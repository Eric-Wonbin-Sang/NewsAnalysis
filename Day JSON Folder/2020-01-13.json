What to do with the leftovers Reheat in a frying pan with some cherry tomatoes and capsicum to make a rough ratatouille. Using my baked egg recipe, spread into a ramekin, top with an egg or two and bake for brekkie or a light dinner. Mash or roughly blend together, mix with a tablespoon of flour and an egg to make quick veggie fritters.",

      "bodyText": "As the UK government prepares to decide whether or not to allow Huawei to be involved in setting up a key portion of the nation\u2019s infrastructure, US officials have issued a stark warning that allowing the Chinese firm a role would put transatlantic intelligence sharing at risk. Why are the Americans so concerned? To put it bluntly, the White House believes the Chinese state will use Huawei to help it spy. Officials in Washington believe the company poses a security risk because the Chinese government will make the firm engineer backdoors in its technology, through which information could be accessed by Beijing. Donald Trump has banned US companies from sharing technology with Huawei and has been putting pressure on other nations to follow his lead. In the UK\u2019s case, Washington says that allowing Huawei to manufacture parts of the 5G network infrastructure will risk exposing state secrets to Chinese spies. What is the British view? While they have accepted there is some risk in working with Huawei, the UK\u2019s security services do not believe it to be unmanageable. Some security concerns have been raised but the intelligences agencies have not linked them to Chinese state influence. The UK government has agreed in principle to allow Huawei to be involved in building \u201cnon-core\u201d parts of the UK\u2019s 5G network. With a final decision expected within weeks, the head of MI5 had recently said he was confident the US-UK intelligence-sharing relationship would not be affected if London gave Huawei the nod. What do Huawei say? Huawei insists it has never been asked to build any backdoor into its technology by the Chinese government and has offered to sign a \u201cno spy agreement\u201d with countries adopting it. Amid concerns that the Chinese government could force Huawei\u2019s hand, the firm\u2019s former chairman Liang Hua said last May there were \u201cno laws requiring the companies to collect intelligence from foreign governments\u201d. Is there more at play here? Huawei certainly think so. During Trump\u2019s presidency, the trade rivalry between the US and China has intensified and the firm believes the White House is simply using it as a weapon in that larger fight. Huawei\u2019s chairman, Eric Xu, has said the US government was in the midst of a \u201cstrategic and long-term\u201d campaign against it.

Series adaptations of several of the books that made the aforementioned classic movies sank without trace, while many others failed to capture his magic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/aug/06/under-the-dome-cbs-hate-watch\" title=\"\">Under the Dome</a> (which spread the tale of a city trapped under an impenetrable shield across three turgid series) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/feb/15/112263-james-franco-stephen-king-adaptation-time-traveller-jfk-assassination\" title=\"\">11.22.63</a> (in which James Franco travelled back in time to try to avert the assassination of John F Kennedy) proved that, even with the best source material, maintaining suspense over several episodes is an undertaking only for the most fearless.</p> <p>The Outsider (Sky Atlantic) is not the adaptation to give the lie to this rule. It \u2026 takes \u2026 an \u2026 age. The first few episodes (the opening couple were broadcast back to back on Monday) resemble a high-class episode of CSI played at half-speed as we follow an investigation into the rape, mutilation and murder of 11-year-old Frankie Peterson, whose body is discovered in the woods of a small town in Oklahoma. Scenes of damning evidence linking Frankie\u2019s little league coach (and popular teacher) Terry Maitland to the killing are interleaved with those of his arrest by detective Ralph Anderson during a baseball match \u2013 in full view of the spectators, so sure is Anderson of Maitland\u2019s guilt. After all, his fingerprints are all over the body and the van used to abduct Frankie, while eyewitnesses place Maitland, bloodied, at the scene.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the authorities, incontrovertible CCTV, eyewitness and forensic evidence emerge that places him miles away at the time. How could he have been in two places at once? Could it be something to do with the hooded, deformed figure that lurks in the background of every investigation site?</p> <p>You know, I think it could.

      "bodyText": "While film renderings of Stephen King\u2019s work frequently result in celluloid classics or near-classics \u2013 Carrie, The Shining, Children of the Corn, Misery, Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption \u2013 TV versions tend to go the other way. Series adaptations of several of the books that made the aforementioned classic movies sank without trace, while many others failed to capture his magic. Under the Dome (which spread the tale of a city trapped under an impenetrable shield across three turgid series) and 11.22.63 (in which James Franco travelled back in time to try to avert the assassination of John F Kennedy) proved that, even with the best source material, maintaining suspense over several episodes is an undertaking only for the most fearless. The Outsider (Sky Atlantic) is not the adaptation to give the lie to this rule. It \u2026 takes \u2026 an \u2026 age. The first few episodes (the opening couple were broadcast back to back on Monday) resemble a high-class episode of CSI played at half-speed as we follow an investigation into the rape, mutilation and murder of 11-year-old Frankie Peterson, whose body is discovered in the woods of a small town in Oklahoma. Scenes of damning evidence linking Frankie\u2019s little league coach (and popular teacher) Terry Maitland to the killing are interleaved with those of his arrest by detective Ralph Anderson during a baseball match \u2013 in full view of the spectators, so sure is Anderson of Maitland\u2019s guilt. After all, his fingerprints are all over the body and the van used to abduct Frankie, while eyewitnesses place Maitland, bloodied, at the scene. Unfortunately for the authorities, incontrovertible CCTV, eyewitness and forensic evidence emerge that places him miles away at the time. How could he have been in two places at once? Could it be something to do with the hooded, deformed figure that lurks in the background of every investigation site? You know, I think it could. As the series wears on, taking itself no less seriously and moving no less ponderously, the supernatural elements are increasingly embraced. Maitland is shot and killed by the murdered boy\u2019s brother, who is in turn shot by Anderson. Maitland\u2019s daughter begins to have nightmares/visions/hallucinations, featuring a \u201cblurry-faced\u201d man, that are full of threats. Another detective is attacked in a barn, where clothes identical to the ones Maitland was wearing during his supposed murderous assault on Frankie are found, this time with a belt buckle covered in his prints \u2013 but from a time before Maitland was born.

      "bodyText": "Friends and opponents alike have expressed their grief after the death of Wilson Gavin, the leader of a rightwing student club at the University of Queensland, who died one day after leading a protest at a drag queen storytime event in a Brisbane library. Gavin, the president of the university\u2019s Liberal National Club, is believed to have taken his own life in the early hours of Monday morning after videos of the protest went viral online at the weekend. In the videos Gavin and a number of other protesters are seen yelling \u201cDrag queens are not for kids\u201d at two performers at the Brisbane Square library. The club\u2019s Facebook page was inundated with comments in opposition to the protesters\u2019 actions, and the group was condemned by other students and federal MPs including the Brisbane Liberal National party MP Trevor Evans and the LNP councillor Vicki Howard. Gavin\u2019s death was confirmed on Monday afternoon. His friend Drew Pavlou, also a UQ senator, said on Twitter Wilson was \u201cat his core a very decent and kind person that cared for others\u201d. \u201cHe had his struggles and made mistakes, and it is a tragedy for us all that he ultimately succumbed to his suffering and pain.\u201d Brisbane\u2019s LNP lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said he was deeply saddened by the news, and the events of the previous two days had been \u201ctruly tragic\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s all do our best to ensure something positive comes from this tragedy.\u201d Gavin was a staunch conservative and was interviewed in 2017 about his opposition to same-sex marriage, despite being gay himself. Rainbow Families Queensland, which organised the library event, said LGBTQ+ people were at high risk of suicide, which is why it promoted programs such as Safe Schools and drag storytime. The University of Queensland said it was providing support for staff and students. \u201cMutual respect and diversity are core values of the university, and we hope that everyone shows consideration for those affected during the difficult days ahead,\u201d a spokeswoman said. The Liberal National Club was disendorsed by the LNP in December, and on Monday night the UQ Liberal National Club Facebook page was deleted. Some politicians, including the state LNP MP Mark Robinson and the federal LNP MP George Christensen, linked Gavin\u2019s death to the reaction on social media. \u201cTwitter is broken,\u201d Christensen said in a tweet before deactivating his Twitter account. \u201cIt\u2019s for ad hominem attacks &amp; pile-ons, not real discourse.

Ministers have been considering a merger of the FCO and DfID for months, but in recent weeks it was reported that the plans advocated by Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief strategist, had been put on hold. Fox, still influential in Conservative policy making, is to urge Johnson not to grant a last-minute reprieve to DfID in an attempt to buy political peace. In a speech to the Institute for Government on Tuesday he will argue \u201cthe Conservative victory has created a political moment which is as important as Mrs Thatcher\u2019s victory in 1979\u201d, and as a result the reshaping of Whitehall must be as radical. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has been pressing the case for a single merged department, but the resistance has come from DfID, which is concerned that the key poverty reduction goals of the aid budget will be blurred if its work is conducted inside a politically directed FCO. Raab confirmed in the Commons that ministers were preparing a root and branch foreign security and development review as part of the post-Brexit landscape. Fox will claim in his speech that the Foreign Office has seen \u201cdecades of degradation of the UK\u2019s overseas capability as the Treasury has taken advantage of Britain\u2019s Eurocentricity to penny pinch\u201d.

He hasn\u2019t bowled a lot with the Kookaburra ball, which requires a completely different skillset from the Duke\u2019s. His main skill is bowling 90mph plus.

Archer has had a slight problem with his elbow; Wood has not played any cricket since the World Cup: Woakes is now fit but what about the X-factor? Much may depend on the evaluation of the pitch but only a fool draws any conclusions three days before the start of the game. On Monday the strip, which is darker than the rest of the square, was well-grassed with the odd bare patch. It did not look a thing of beauty and draws have become a rare event at this ground. Root stared at the surface intently while in conversation with Chris Silverwood and Graham Thorpe.</p> <p>Meanwhile the rest of the squad was on the outfield playing with a football. But panic not. They were not actually playing football. They were attempting some hybrid game that is volleyball played with a football, minus a net. There was a lot of noise and plenty of argument as the senior citizens, many of whom are not especially old, took on the nippers, many of whom are really quite young.</p> <p>Your correspondent naturally monitored proceedings but at the end of it all had no idea who had won. Nor, one suspects, did the spin-bowling coach, Jeetan Patel, who was umpiring the contest.</p> <p>Patel has more important work to do. Not only is there debate about which paceman should play; England must also consider the spinner\u2019s berth, and here Patel\u2019s input will surely be important; so, too, will that of the medics. Jack Leach would have a strong case to be restored to the XI if \u2013 and it\u2019s quite a big if \u2013 he can convince everyone he is fully fit after being laid low by illness, not only before the first Test but at the end of the last one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>",

He hasn\u2019t bowled a lot with the Kookaburra ball, which requires a completely different skillset from the Duke\u2019s. His main skill is bowling 90mph plus. We have enough bowlers in and around the county circuit who can bowl at 82 to 85mph and try to nip it around. You want the likes of Wood and Archer to give you that X-factor.\u201d The caveats abound. Archer has had a slight problem with his elbow; Wood has not played any cricket since the World Cup: Woakes is now fit but what about the X-factor? Much may depend on the evaluation of the pitch but only a fool draws any conclusions three days before the start of the game. On Monday the strip, which is darker than the rest of the square, was well-grassed with the odd bare patch. It did not look a thing of beauty and draws have become a rare event at this ground. Root stared at the surface intently while in conversation with Chris Silverwood and Graham Thorpe. Meanwhile the rest of the squad was on the outfield playing with a football. But panic not. They were not actually playing football. They were attempting some hybrid game that is volleyball played with a football, minus a net. There was a lot of noise and plenty of argument as the senior citizens, many of whom are not especially old, took on the nippers, many of whom are really quite young. Your correspondent naturally monitored proceedings but at the end of it all had no idea who had won. Nor, one suspects, did the spin-bowling coach, Jeetan Patel, who was umpiring the contest. Patel has more important work to do. Not only is there debate about which paceman should play; England must also consider the spinner\u2019s berth, and here Patel\u2019s input will surely be important; so, too, will that of the medics. Jack Leach would have a strong case to be restored to the XI if \u2013 and it\u2019s quite a big if \u2013 he can convince everyone he is fully fit after being laid low by illness, not only before the first Test but at the end of the last one.",

Australian weapons systems manufacturer Electro Optics Systems (EOS) \u2013 which supplies the Saudi military with remote weapon stations \u2013 has told the Guardian their equipment does not cross the border into Yemen. But a report by a United Nations panel of experts, including former Australian MP and international lawyer Melissa Parke, said countries who supplied weapons to the militaries of the UAE or Saudi Arabia could be complicit in war crimes being committed in the Yemen conflict. The Sri Lankan military has been accused of war crimes over several years and complicity in the continued disappearance, abuse and torture of Tamil citizens, democracy activists, journalists and opponents of the government.

European parliamentary authorities announced last Friday that Puigdemont and Com\u00edn had begun their mandate on 2 July, the day the new parliament met for the first time, following a ruling from the European court of justice that boosted the separatist leaders\u2019 cause. However, the parliament said Junqueras was no longer an MEP, because Spain\u2019s supreme court had ruled last week that he was not eligible to serve because of his conviction for sedition and misuse of public funds. Flanked by Com\u00edn and six MEP supporters at a news conference, Puigdemont said: \u201cWe are proud to be here, but we are not happy because we miss Oriol Junqueras. And we will continue fighting until Mr Junqueras returns to his house, because he was a member of [this] parliament for several years before.\u201d Junqueras, chairman of the separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), served as an MEP from 2009 to 2011. Puigdemont, who made a home in the Belgian town of Waterloo after fleeing Spain in 2017, also made clear that he intended to continue his efforts to make the bitterly fought Catalonia crisis a European question. He hopes to join other separatist parties, such as the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru, as a member of the Greens-European Free Alliance group, the fourth largest group in the parliament. But the group has not decided yet whether to admit the new Catalans. In 2017, Puigdemont organised a referendum, criticised for violating the rules of the Catalan parliament and trampling on democratic norms, before making an illegal declaration of independence. He avoided trial on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds by fleeing to Belgium. Last October, nine Catalan separatist leaders were jailed for their part in the failed bid for independence, including Junqueras. The European parliament announced last Friday that Junqueras would no longer be recognised as an MEP, the day after Spain\u2019s supreme court ruled that he was not eligible because of his conviction. \u201cTaking into account the decision of the Junta Electoral Central [Spain\u2019s electoral commission] of 3 January 2020 and pursuant to the decision of the Tribunal Supremo of 9 January 2020, the mandate of Junqueras i Vies terminated with effect on 3 January 2020,\u201d the European parliament president, David Sassoli, said in a statement. Catalan independence supporters vowed to continue to press parliamentary authorities to reinstate his immunity. The separatists have also said they are appealing to Spain\u2019s supreme court, but their prospects of success are unclear. Officials from the European parliament said they were still considering whether Junqueras was entitled to six months\u2019 pay, as he is considered to have been an MEP from 2 July until last week. Its rules mean an MEP cannot be subject to detention or legal proceedings because of views expressed or votes cast as an MEP, but it cannot be claimed if the person has committed an offence.",

During that time Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez and Ronald Koeman, both of whom had expressed their desire to coach the club in the future, turned down the opportunity to take over with immediate effect. Barcelona had contemplated a series of other names, including Thierry Henry and the former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino. Almost a dozen managers had been connected to the club as rumours circulated. The impression was of a club not sure which way to turn.</p> <p>Despite his sacking being an open secret by then, Valverde took charge of the Monday morning training session as normal, as his team returned to work after three days off. Before the session at San Joan Desp\u00ed, he gathering his players together in a circle, although it later emerged that he had not bade farewell at that point. He is expected to return on Tuesday morning to say goodbye.</p> <p>That was just the beginning of a long day, as photographers followed endless cars going in and out \u2013 a stream of men at the wheel and the lingering feeling that no one was. Valverde met with the president Josep Maria Bartomeu after the session. His agent I\u00f1aki Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez negotiated the rescinding of his contract. A board meeting, already planned in advance, followed on Monday evening and a statement was finally released after 11pm local time.</p> <p>That delay was in keeping with the way Barcelona had handled the whole process, which drew widespread criticism. Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, the club\u2019s former midfielder, had described their treatment of Valverde as \u201ca bit ugly\u201d and the situation as \u201cunpleasant\u201d.</p> <p>Barcelona had hoped and expected to announce the signing of Seti\u00e9n and the departure of Valverde earlier. Reporters outside the Camp Nou following the board meeting they had been told that a statement was expected shortly and that a press conference would be held by the president and the sporting director the following morning. That was at 7.20pm.</p> <p>Off the record briefings confirmed that Seti\u00e9n would be taking over. His agent had arrived in the city in the early afternoon. But there was no official announcement until 11.15pm. At that point, while a severance package had been verbally agreed with Valverde, it was still yet to be signed off formally. Seti\u00e9n will sign his contract at lunchtime on Tuesday before being presented to the media and supporters.</p> <p>A club statement read: \u201cBarcelona and Ernesto Valverde have reached an agreement to terminate the contract that united both parties.</p> <p>\u201cThe club publicly expresses its gratitude to Ernesto Valverde for his professionalism, his commitment, his dedication and his always positive treatment towards all that make up the Bar\u00e7a family. We wish him luck and success in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Valverde won two league titles and the Copa del Rey during his two years in charge but there was criticism of the way his side played and second-leg Champions League defeats at Roma and Liverpool, when three-goal first-leg leads were lost in calamitous fashion, weighed heavily. No one fought for him to continue. Indeed, it surprised many when Valverde signed a new contract last February and when he continued beyond the summer but at that point, he enjoyed the backing of the president.</p> <p>There remained doubts, though, and that support definitively changed when Barcelona were defeated 3-2 by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup in Jeddah on Thursday, having been 2-1 up with nine minutes remaining. He had been booed by Saudi Barcelona fans throughout the game.</p> <p>Abidal and the club\u2019s CEO \u00d2scar Grau travelled to Qatar following that defeat and offered the post to Xavi, but he turned it down, sparking an accelerated search for a replacement. Although that was played out in public, Barcelona backed into a corner, Valverde had still not been formally told by early Monday evening. He was far from impressed. By the end of the night, his departure finally official, the overwhelming feeling was of relief.</p> <p>For Seti\u00e9n, there is excitement. Aged 61, this is the job he most covets. A former coach of Las Palmas and Real Betis, Seti\u00e9n led the latter to a stunning 4-3 victory at the Camp Nou in which his team were judged to have \u2018out-Barcelonad\u2019 Barcelona. The former Spain international is committed to a style based on possession and technique, a professed admirer of Sergio Busquets and Lionel Messi, and once said he would have cut off his finger to play for Johan Cruyff.</p>",

Before the session at San Joan Desp\u00ed, he gathering his players together in a circle, although it later emerged that he had not bade farewell at that point. He is expected to return on Tuesday morning to say goodbye. That was just the beginning of a long day, as photographers followed endless cars going in and out \u2013 a stream of men at the wheel and the lingering feeling that no one was. Valverde met with the president Josep Maria Bartomeu after the session. His agent I\u00f1aki Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez negotiated the rescinding of his contract. A board meeting, already planned in advance, followed on Monday evening and a statement was finally released after 11pm local time. That delay was in keeping with the way Barcelona had handled the whole process, which drew widespread criticism. Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, the club\u2019s former midfielder, had described their treatment of Valverde as \u201ca bit ugly\u201d and the situation as \u201cunpleasant\u201d. Barcelona had hoped and expected to announce the signing of Seti\u00e9n and the departure of Valverde earlier. Reporters outside the Camp Nou following the board meeting they had been told that a statement was expected shortly and that a press conference would be held by the president and the sporting director the following morning. That was at 7.20pm. Off the record briefings confirmed that Seti\u00e9n would be taking over. His agent had arrived in the city in the early afternoon. But there was no official announcement until 11.15pm. At that point, while a severance package had been verbally agreed with Valverde, it was still yet to be signed off formally. Seti\u00e9n will sign his contract at lunchtime on Tuesday before being presented to the media and supporters. A club statement read: \u201cBarcelona and Ernesto Valverde have reached an agreement to terminate the contract that united both parties. \u201cThe club publicly expresses its gratitude to Ernesto Valverde for his professionalism, his commitment, his dedication and his always positive treatment towards all that make up the Bar\u00e7a family. We wish him luck and success in the future.\u201d Valverde won two league titles and the Copa del Rey during his two years in charge but there was criticism of the way his side played and second-leg Champions League defeats at Roma and Liverpool, when three-goal first-leg leads were lost in calamitous fashion, weighed heavily. No one fought for him to continue. Indeed, it surprised many when Valverde signed a new contract last February and when he continued beyond the summer but at that point, he enjoyed the backing of the president. There remained doubts, though, and that support definitively changed when Barcelona were defeated 3-2 by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup in Jeddah on Thursday, having been 2-1 up with nine minutes remaining. He had been booed by Saudi Barcelona fans throughout the game. Abidal and the club\u2019s CEO \u00d2scar Grau travelled to Qatar following that defeat and offered the post to Xavi, but he turned it down, sparking an accelerated search for a replacement. Although that was played out in public, Barcelona backed into a corner, Valverde had still not been formally told by early Monday evening. He was far from impressed. By the end of the night, his departure finally official, the overwhelming feeling was of relief. For Seti\u00e9n, there is excitement. Aged 61, this is the job he most covets. A former coach of Las Palmas and Real Betis, Seti\u00e9n led the latter to a stunning 4-3 victory at the Camp Nou in which his team were judged to have \u2018out-Barcelonad\u2019 Barcelona. The former Spain international is committed to a style based on possession and technique, a professed admirer of Sergio Busquets and Lionel Messi, and once said he would have cut off his finger to play for Johan Cruyff.",

But the turbulence of her 2000s was underlined by the off-court events that glued the decade together. After receiving racist abuse from the Indian Wells crowd in 2001, she would boycott the tournament for 14 years. In 2004, errant line calls by umpire Mariana Alves in her US Open quarter-final loss to Jennifer Capriati would catalyse the arrival of Hawk-Eye in tennis and also her rising US Open anxiety.

Williams returned to No 1 in 2013 as the continued improvement of her serve marked it as one of the most dominant shots in the history of the sport, offering her game increased efficiency in her advancing years. Williams\u2019s pursuit of history late in her career has had some unintended side-effects. No period underlined this quite like 2015 when she captured her second Serena Slam before heading into the US Open chasing the grand slam. That was the moment she rose from a star athlete to a cultural icon, as celebrities descended on Flushing Meadows simply to be seen in her presence, but it was also the site of one of her biggest failures as she spectacularly fell to Roberta Vinci in the semi-final. She recovered to produce one more stunning result by winning the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant. She gave birth to Alexis Olympia, that September but it was a complicated childbirth that included a second near-death experience stemming from a pulmonary embolism. Since then she has reached four grand-slam finals: Wimbledon and the US Open in 2018 and 2019. It is an astounding achievement for an ageing champion so soon out of childbirth, but the consequence of her success is that nothing but victory is acceptable. 2020s Williams has won two International events, a tournament category on the WTA calendar, in her career. When she won in Bastad, Sweden, in 2013, her celebration was a simple fist pump. On Sunday, she won her second in Auckland and celebrated by lifting her hands to the sky and shouting in jubilation. It was a reflection of how committed she still is and, after four lost finals, how important is the sensation of finishing a tournament without losing. Williams is still playing at an extremely high level, but mentally it will only get tougher. She lost those four grand-slam finals without winning a set. Age brings a greater understanding of the size of these achievements, which makes it all so much more difficult; she knows that she will retire soon and that her opportunities are finite. The question is whether she can take them.",

      "bodyText": "Using Huawei technology in UK 5G networks would put transatlantic intelligence sharing at risk, senior US officials have told British ministers, warning that allowing the Chinese firm access would be \u201cnothing short of madness\u201d. The extraordinary American ultimatum came as a special delegation led by Donald Trump\u2019s deputy national security advisor, Matt Pottinger, presented an incendiary dossier they said featured new evidence of the security risks of relying on Huawei technology in future phone networks. The intense and public lobbying presents an immediate headache for Boris Johnson, the prime minister, who had been expected to make a final decision about Huawei shortly, having been repeatedly advised by the UK\u2019s security establishment that any security risks can be contained. Ahead of the UK decision the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, said over the weekend that he saw \u201cno reason to think\u201d that using Huawei technology should threaten intelligence sharing with the US, suggesting that Britain was poised to give the Chinese company the go-ahead. But that assertion was flatly contradicted by a senior US official who was part of the delegation, who said: \u201cCongress has made it clear they will want an evaluation of our intelligence sharing.\u201d A second member said that the US president hoped not to fall out with the UK over the issue but added: \u201cDonald Trump is watching closely\u201d. Last spring, the UK had indicated it would allow Huawei to supply non-core technology such as mobile phone masts and antennas in future 5G networks, after a cabinet committed had voted by 5 to 4 in favour. But even that would not be enough to allay Washington\u2019s concerns, the US officials said. Huawei has consistently denied that it has ever been asked by the Chinese government to introduce secret \u201cback doors\u201d into its technology, and has even offered to sign a \u201cno spy agreement\u201d with countries adopting it. But the US insists there is a surveillance risk. The officials, who had flown in specially from the US, would not spell out what the \u201crelatively recent information\u201d that they had shared with their UK counterparts was, but it is understood to be of a technical nature. Although the long-standing intelligence-sharing relationship between the US and the UK would not be immediately compromised, they said that members of Congress would want to review it in future legislation. A final decision will also be seen as a crucial early signal in how far the UK wants to move towards the US orbit as trade talks with both Washington and Brussels loom after Britain formally leaves the EU at the end of January. As well as Pottinger, key officials in the US delegation of six included Chris Ford, an assistant secretary in the US state department, and Robert Blair, the special envoy for international telecoms. The delegation claimed that Chinese spies, working for the People\u2019s Liberation Army, also worked simultaneously for Huawei \u2013 and that the company \u201chad played a role\u201d in supporting the \u201cre-education camps\u201d for the country\u2019s Muslim Uighur minority. British sources initially said that they were only going to meet civil servants, but the US delegation said they had spoken to at least one cabinet minister. Huawei is one of three companies that supply equipment to Vodafone, BT and other mobile phone companies for high-speed 5G networks, alongside Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia from Finland. Its kit is recognised by UK phone companies as being cheaper and more advanced than rivals, and some believe that the Trump administration wants to weaken China\u2019s advanced position in the market for trade reasons. A Huawei spokesperson said it was a private company that has supplied the UK for the past 15 years and that parliamentary committees had concluded there is no technical reason to ban it from supplying 5G equipment. The spokesman added: \u201cAnd now, Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, says he has \u2018no reason to think\u2019 that the UK\u2019s intelligence-sharing relationship with the US would be hit if Britain continued to use Huawei technology.

Amor will have less licence with Jones in charge of skills but he will be expected to add innovation to a side that has long tended to be inward looking in tight matches. \u201cEngland is probably the best team in world rugby to coach,\u201d said Proudfoot, who had a stint with Kobe Steelers in Japan. \u201cHaving coached against them you get to respect their identity, so to get the opportunity to be part of that is a huge honour. I am really grateful to be given this chance and it is a decision I take with great humility and responsibility, knowing there is a huge legacy to live up to.\u201d His time in Scotland, which was interrupted by a series of injuries, means northern hemisphere conditions will not be a culture shock. In the buildup to the World Cup final he paid tribute to Jones, Hatley and Borthwick, noting how England had become more efficient in all aspects at forward and describing their performance against New Zealand as incredible. \u201cI looked at it and thought wow,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder Eddie they have come to understand what they want to do and are a lot more confident. They are the trendsetters.\u201d Jones, who joined England from the Stormers at the end of 2015, believes Proudfoot can take England\u2019s forwards to another level. \u201cHe brings great technical expertise and knowledge having coached in South Africa and Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Six Nations is a fresh start for the team and that is how we have approached our coaching staff. We felt we needed to regenerate the forwards coaching area and Matt has had an outstanding coaching career to date, culminating in being a World Cup-winning coach. \u201cWe have had our eyes on Simon for a while. We used him in the run-up to the World Cup in some training camps. I have been very impressed with his dynamism and his rugby intellect. He will bring a fresh view on how we build our attack. We have done some great things under Scott Wisemantel and we will always be forever grateful for the work he did, but we are excited about Simon coming in and what he is going to bring.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A surprising turn of events on the fourth day of Milan men\u2019s fashion week: Armani has embraced extreme \u201cgorpcore\u201d. The trend of wearing outdoorsy clothes in the city was a dominant theme at the Italian fashion label\u2019s cinematic autumn/winter collection. At the show on Monday, the guests, who included the actors Taron Egerton and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, were welcomed to a stage that resembled the set of a Tom Cruise action film: models walked around giant ice blocks (actually recycled plastic blobs) as a projection of falling snow played above them. \u201cArmani\u2019s fashion embraces the man, enhancing his persona,\u201d said the show notes, and the theatrics expressed themselves in the clothes. The opening look was a utility vest-cum-hoodie, worn unzipped on the shoulders, accessorised with boxing glove-style mittens and Ugg-shaped boots that clung to the models\u2019 feet like medical scrubs. This was followed by a Mad Max-style black jumpsuit, while a smothering full-length puffer coat with matching balaclava resembled the prehistoric beast in Creature from the Black Lagoon. The appearance of flourishes such as steam-punk goggles and snoods added to the sense of disorientation. This focus on performance also involved a reference to perhaps the most famous icon of dystopia: Neo from The Matrix. Featuring futuristic sunglasses and a long leather jacket with a furry collar, the Matrix coat was a key trend in menswear collections this season, cropping up on the Fendi, Martine Rose and John Lawrence Sullivan catwalks. Giorgio Armani is most often pilloried when he strays from the sleek men\u2019s tailoring with which he made his name. And in this Milan show, some of the most extreme iterations of gorpcore felt like a step too far. The best looks came in the middle of the show, when Armani focused on the Nehru suit silhouette, rendered in safari green and velvet, in slate grey worn with a black polo neck and in watermelon pink. This felt like classic Armani \u2013 brilliant clothes with a subtle twist, rather than Giorgio Goes Gorpcore.",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 14 January.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Voters have marked down Scott Morrison for his handling of the bushfire crisis,</strong> and increasingly see him as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/14/essential-poll-more-voters-disapprove-of-scott-morrison-and-see-him-as-arrogant\">arrogant and out of touch</a>, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The survey, undertaken from 7 to 11 January, also shows Anthony Albanese has overtaken Morrison as preferred prime minister for the first time since he became leader of the Labor party following the May election. The survey of 1,081 voters shows a shift in the number of people who disapprove of Morrison\u2019s performance, which has increased from 43% in December to 52%. This has been driven by an increase in those who strongly disapprove \u2013 up from 22% in December to 32%.</p> <p><strong>The heat in the world\u2019s oceans reached a new record level in 2019,</strong> showing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/ocean-temperatures-hit-record-high-as-rate-of-heating-accelerates\">\u201cirrefutable and accelerating\u201d heating of the planet</a>. The world\u2019s oceans are the clearest measure of the climate emergency because they absorb more than 90% of the heat trapped by the greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuel burning, forest destruction and other human activities. The new analysis shows the past five years are the top five warmest years recorded in the ocean and the past 10 years are also the top 10 years on record. The amount of heat being added to the oceans is equivalent to every person on the planet running 100 microwave ovens all day and all night.</p> <p><strong>The Australian government is keeping draft versions of its strategy for helping the Pacific deal with climate change secret,</strong> prompting concerns it may be hiding changes that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/14/government-refuses-to-release-draft-pacific-climate-aid-report-after-nine-months-delay\">weakened the final report</a>. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade\u2019s climate change action strategy was released in in November. The department\u2019s draft report had <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/dfat-s-climate-change-strategy-stuck-on-hold-20190717-p527yq\">languished in the office of the foreign affairs minister</a>, Marise Payne, for nine months. Seeking to understand whether the minister\u2019s office influenced the final version, the Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi lodged a freedom of information request for the draft copy, which the department gave to the minister\u2019s office in February last year. But the government is now refusing to release the draft, arguing it is not in the public interest and would \u201cundermine the value and authority of the final climate change strategy\u201d.</p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p><strong>The business community will push for the extension of recovery grants to those affected by bushfires in Victoria</strong> as well as government support for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/14/australian-businesses-affected-by-bushfires-to-push-for-wider-government-support\">\u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d faced by businesses</a> indirectly affected by the national crisis.</p> <p><strong>Humane Society International staff have described what they say are apocalyptic scenes</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/13/australia-fires-humanitarian-group-describes-apocalyptic-scenes-of-wildlife-devastation-on-kangaroo-island\">on fire-ravaged Kangaroo Island</a> in South Australia, where they have set up a base rescuing injured wildlife.</p> <p><strong>Heavy rains forecast for this week are unlikely to end Australia\u2019s long-running bushfire threat,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/13/australia-fires-heavy-rain-and-cooler-temperatures-unlikely-to-end-bushfire-threat\">despite pockets expected in bushfire-affected areas</a>.</p> <h2>The world</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e949c4f9ab01c0c42060c441d69df00cad4fd105\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e949c4f9ab01c0c42060c441d69df00cad4fd105/0_72_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders speaks during a campaign rally at Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan, on October 27, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 slogan of \u2018Not me.

And what does that adaptation involve? According to Morrison, \u2018Building dams is key to that. Native vegetation management is key to that. Land clearing is key to that.\u2019 In other words doing the very things conservatives have been desirous of for the past century \u2013 building dams, reducing national parks and increasing land clearing.\u201d</p> <h2>Sport</h2> <p><strong>Newcastle Jets\u2019 W-League game against Adelaide United being postponed due to air quality and temperature concerns was a touch serendipitous, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/14/jets-secondment-of-w-league-coach-for-mens-team-should-not-escape-scrutiny\">writes Ella Reilly</a>. \u201cCoach Craig Deans \u2013 who has taken the reins of the club\u2019s A-League team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/07/ernie-merrick-the-a-leagues-great-entertainer-exits-stage-right\">following the dismissal of Ernie Merrick</a> \u2013 would not have been at the helm of the women\u2019s team had the match been given the green light.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Rabbitohs now have arguably the most potent backline in the NRL,</strong> having landed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/14/south-sydney-go-from-strength-to-strength-with-capture-of-latrell-mitchell\">the most dynamic player on the market</a>, writes Nick Tedeschi.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 14 January. Top stories Voters have marked down Scott Morrison for his handling of the bushfire crisis, and increasingly see him as arrogant and out of touch, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The survey, undertaken from 7 to 11 January, also shows Anthony Albanese has overtaken Morrison as preferred prime minister for the first time since he became leader of the Labor party following the May election. The survey of 1,081 voters shows a shift in the number of people who disapprove of Morrison\u2019s performance, which has increased from 43% in December to 52%. This has been driven by an increase in those who strongly disapprove \u2013 up from 22% in December to 32%. The heat in the world\u2019s oceans reached a new record level in 2019, showing \u201cirrefutable and accelerating\u201d heating of the planet. The world\u2019s oceans are the clearest measure of the climate emergency because they absorb more than 90% of the heat trapped by the greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuel burning, forest destruction and other human activities. The new analysis shows the past five years are the top five warmest years recorded in the ocean and the past 10 years are also the top 10 years on record. The amount of heat being added to the oceans is equivalent to every person on the planet running 100 microwave ovens all day and all night. The Australian government is keeping draft versions of its strategy for helping the Pacific deal with climate change secret, prompting concerns it may be hiding changes that weakened the final report. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade\u2019s climate change action strategy was released in in November. The department\u2019s draft report had languished in the office of the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, for nine months. Seeking to understand whether the minister\u2019s office influenced the final version, the Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi lodged a freedom of information request for the draft copy, which the department gave to the minister\u2019s office in February last year. But the government is now refusing to release the draft, arguing it is not in the public interest and would \u201cundermine the value and authority of the final climate change strategy\u201d. Australia The business community will push for the extension of recovery grants to those affected by bushfires in Victoria as well as government support for \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d faced by businesses indirectly affected by the national crisis. Humane Society International staff have described what they say are apocalyptic scenes on fire-ravaged Kangaroo Island in South Australia, where they have set up a base rescuing injured wildlife. Heavy rains forecast for this week are unlikely to end Australia\u2019s long-running bushfire threat, despite pockets expected in bushfire-affected areas. The world Support for Bernie Sanders is surging in Iowa and New Hampshire as his campaign touts new signs of growth in his support, particularly among young people of colour. Things are faring less well for Cory Booker, who has dropped out of the race. Iranian authorities fired live ammunition to disperse protesters in Tehran on Sunday night, wounding several people, according to witness accounts provided to the Guardian and footage circulating on social media. Joker leads the Oscars 2020 pack, with 11 nominations. 1917, The Irishman and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood are up for 10, and Parasite and Little Women have six nominations. Here\u2019s the full list. A group of US environmental activists were listed as \u201cextremists\u201d in Department of Homeland Security documents and some of its members listed alongside white nationalists and mass killers, documents obtained by the Guardian reveal. Recommended reads The ecologist Chris Dickman has estimated more than a billion animals have died in the Australian bushfires \u2013 a figure that excludes fish, frogs, bats and insects. On Monday, the government announced $50m to help rescue and protect wildlife affected by the crisis and environment groups released a list of fauna species for which they hold immediate concerns. But the list is far from exhaustive and there won\u2019t be a clear picture of the extent of the impact on plant and animal life until experts can access fire-ravaged habitats and conduct assessments. Nothing Scott Morrison has said suggests any change in policy that will actually involve emissions reductions, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cInstead he has quickly adopted the new go-to response of climate change deniers \u2013 that of the need to adapt and \u2018improve resilience\u2019. The new argument is that yes climate change is probably to blame, but we can\u2019t do anything about it, and anyway it\u2019s too late now, so let\u2019s \u2018adapt\u2019. And what does that adaptation involve? According to Morrison, \u2018Building dams is key to that. Native vegetation management is key to that. Land clearing is key to that.\u2019 In other words doing the very things conservatives have been desirous of for the past century \u2013 building dams, reducing national parks and increasing land clearing.\u201d Sport Newcastle Jets\u2019 W-League game against Adelaide United being postponed due to air quality and temperature concerns was a touch serendipitous, writes Ella Reilly. \u201cCoach Craig Deans \u2013 who has taken the reins of the club\u2019s A-League team following the dismissal of Ernie Merrick \u2013 would not have been at the helm of the women\u2019s team had the match been given the green light.\u201d The Rabbitohs now have arguably the most potent backline in the NRL, having landed the most dynamic player on the market, writes Nick Tedeschi. Latrell Mitchell will now follow up playing for Trent Robinson by learning at the feet of Wayne Bennett while playing for a club that has long been renowned as a leader in mentoring Indigenous talent. Media roundup Fire retardant dropped across New South Wales could contaminate the water supply and threaten aquatic life, the Sydney Morning Herald reveals. \u201cA coronial inquest into the rape and murder of South Australian outback nurse Gayle Woodford has heard \u2018a catalogue of blunders\u2019 allowed her killer to \u2018slip through the cracks\u2019,\u201d reports the ABC.

Beginning in the 1930s, some, mostly African American neighborhoods \u2013 designated with red lines \u2013 were categorized as too risky for investment, and denied home loans and insurance.

The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work. About 2 million people are currently in receipt of UC. More than 6 million will be on the benefit by the time it is fully rolled out.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How long has it been around?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/19/universal-credit-failings-pac-accuses-dwp\">management failures</a>, expensive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/05/universal-credit-iain-duncan-smith\">IT blunders and design faults</a>&nbsp;mean it is now seven years behind schedule, and rollout will not be complete until 2024. The government admitted that the delay was caused in part by claimants being too scared to sign up to the new benefit.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the biggest problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The original design set out a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2016/jun/09/debt-and-food-banks-the-legacy-of-universal-credits-long-hello\">minimum 42-day wait for a first payment</a>&nbsp;to claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/universal-credit-flaws-pushing-claimants-towards-debt-and-eviction-warning?platform=hootsuite\">rent arrears and eviction</a>s, hunger (food banks in UC areas report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/25/food-banks-report-record-demand-amid-universal-credit-chaos\">notable increases in referrals</a>), use of expensive credit and mental distress.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Ministers have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Are there other problems?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Plenty.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/03/universal-credit-cost-cutting-treasury-benefit-reform-resolution\">Multibillion-pound cuts to work allowances</a>&nbsp;imposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than \u00a31,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. <br></p>\n    <p>Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It's also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. <br></p>\n    <p>And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/15/universal-credit-savaged-by-public-spending-watchdog-nao\">critical study</a> found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ronnie Draper, the general secretary of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers union, which represents thousands of Greggs staff, said it had so far only been contacted by one worried worker about losing out on the bonus but would discuss alternative ways the company could make the payment if it emerged individuals were losing out.</p> \n<p>It is not known how many of Greggs workers are on universal credit, which replaces a number of working-age benefits and tax credits.

      "bodyText": "The government has been urged to rethink its tax and benefit rules for low-paid workers after it emerged that some staff at the bakery chain Greggs could get to keep just a quarter of their \u00a3300 annual bonus as a result of universal credit deductions. Greggs announced last week that its 25,000 workers would receive a windfall of up to \u00a3300 under a \u00a37m reward scheme linked in part to the success of the company\u2019s vegan sausage rolls. However, benefits experts have pointed out that some staff who are on universal credit will keep as little as \u00a375 after tax and national insurance (NI) are paid and bonus earnings clawed back by the government at a rate of 63p in the pound. Benefits consultant Gareth Morgan said the clawing back of the bonuses through universal credit meant that the government might ultimately be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Greggs reward scheme. Morgan calculated that under current tax and benefit rules, a worker earning less than the tax and NI thresholds of \u00a38,632 a year would typically be left with \u00a3111 of the \u00a3300 bonus. One earning more than that but less than the upper threshold of \u00a312,500 a year would get just \u00a397.68 while a worker on more than \u00a312,500 a year would end up with \u00a375.48. Universal credit originally aimed to incentivise claimants to earn more by introducing a work allowance allowing them to keep hold of more of their benefits as their income rose. However, this was cut in 2015, and only partly restored. Claimants\u2019 earnings over and above this allowance are in effect reclaimed at a 63% taper rate. Ronnie Draper, the general secretary of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers union, which represents thousands of Greggs staff, said it had so far only been contacted by one worried worker about losing out on the bonus but would discuss alternative ways the company could make the payment if it emerged individuals were losing out. It is not known how many of Greggs workers are on universal credit, which replaces a number of working-age benefits and tax credits.

The Times said Sedwill had been dragged into the row last week and that he and the prime minister would ultimately have to decide on the allocation of any public money to the couple in the future.</p> <h2>Sir Edward Young</h2> <p>The Queen\u2019s top aide, who has reportedly come under increasing pressure since Harry and Meghan\u2019s announcement.

Alderton returned to work for Prince Charles after a spell as Britain\u2019s ambassador to Morocco. He had previously served as an aide in Charles\u2019 official London residence, Clarence House, and is reported to be popular with the prince\u2019s family.</p> <h2>Simon Case</h2> <p>The Duke of Cambridge\u2019s private secretary is a civil servant who formerly worked on solving the Irish border issue during Brexit discussions. He also served as principal private secretary to David Cameron when he was prime minister, having previously worked as GCHQ\u2019s director of strategy.</p> <h2>Fiona Mcilwham</h2> <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s private secretary is relatively new to the role. She is a top diplomat and became one of the UK\u2019s youngest ambassadors when she was posted to Albania aged 35 in 2009.

The Queen said there were complex issues to address and that more work needed to be done,but she also set a timetable, saying she expects final decisions to be reached in days.</p> <p>The statement announces a \u201cperiod of transition\u201d for the royal couple and their young son Archie as they spend time in Canada and the UK, while they reduce their reliance on public funds.<br></p> <p>The Queen\u2019s statement about the Sandringham talks followed an earlier joint statement issued by Prince William and Prince Harry, which described as false a UK newspaper story claiming the Sussexes felt they were being forced out by \u201cbullying\u201d behaviour within the family.

It will be his first public engagement since news of his intention to step back from royal duties broke.

Here are some of the main topics that you imagine would be part of the discussions today:</p> <p><strong>Titles</strong></p> <p>If the couple seem determined to step back from royal duties, then the royal family may want to step back from honouring them with titles. It is unclear whether the British public would regard removing the titles as petty, or as the right thing to do if the couple are no longer working as part of the royal family. However, the question of titles might not be as pressing as it first appears. Regardless of whether he retains a formal royal title or not, Harry will remain the youngest son of Diana, Princess of Wales. That in itself will guarantee enduring public interest in his life for years to come. <br></p> <p><strong>Living arrangements</strong><br></p> <p>The couple have suggested they will split their time between North America and the UK. However, if Meghan wants to apply for British citizenship she is required to only spend 90 days outside the country. <br></p> <p>There\u2019s also the question of whether they can retain Frogmore Cottage, the Grade II-listed house in Windsor they currently use as a base. It was refurbished recently with \u00a32.4m of taxpayer money. It is owned by the Queen.<br></p> <p><strong>Security</strong><br></p> <p>Living abroad some of the year poses a unique set of security challenges for the royal family to face. The Sussexes would still require 24/7 security protection \u2013 but who is going to pay for it? There are reports today that the Canadian PM, Justin Trudeau, has suggested his country may be prepared to contribute \u2013 although that may not please the Canadian public.<br></p> <p><strong>Funding</strong><br></p> <p>The couple aren\u2019t short of money, either from Meghan\u2019s earnings before she married into the royal family, or from the money that Prince Harry inherited from his mother. But whatever they do to try and bring in an income is liable to be controversial, and open to accusations that they are trading on the royal family\u2019s name. They appear to be willing to give up direct state funding from the sovereign grant which is estimated to make up about 5% of their annual costs. The rest of the money is currently met with revenues from the Duchy of Cornwall granted to them by Harry\u2019s father, Charles.</p> <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p> <p>If the couple split their time between the UK and Canada they may have to split their tax affairs. Both Canadian and UK authorities would stake a claim on revenue earned within their jurisdiction. <br></p> <p><strong>Future royal duties and charity work</strong><br></p> <p>The couple\u2019s statement that they wanted to step back from being \u201csenior royals\u201d didn\u2019t appear to totally rule out doing some official engagements. One of the topics to be explored at the summit today will no doubt be the extent to which it is practical for them to combine official royal duties with an independent lifestyle, and their own soon-to-be-launched charitable foundation.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-13T16:04:10.934Z\">at 4.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1c8b318f08d66fcfaa3205\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-13T15:23:25.556Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A reminder that the main development of the day so far, as we wait for news to emerge from the Sandringham summit, is that the Duke of Sussex and Duke of Cambridge have issued a furious denial over a newspaper report speculating on causes of a rift between them, branding it \u201coffensive and potentially harmful\u201d.</p> <p>You can read my colleague Caroline Davies\u2019s full report on it here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/13/william-and-harry-rubbish-offensive-and-potentially-harmful-story\">William and Harry rubbish 'offensive and potentially harmful' story</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1c84708f0852212f74d2f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-13T15:03:35.124Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Press Association have just put out a report outlining the existing rules by which members of the royal family are allowed to carry out commercial activities. They could form the starting point for any agreement that comes out of today\u2019s summit meeting. They were devised almost 20 years ago, in the wake of a scandal when the Countess of Wessex was accused of cashing in on her royal status in an attempt to win business for her PR firm.</p> <p>Under the rules, royals have to first consult the Lord Chamberlain before taking on a new business activity. They could be seen as an impediment to the kind of independence that Harry and Meghan appear to be seeking. </p> <p>The guidelines also stressed that anyone connected with a business activity \u201cshould be carefully briefed not to try to exploit, either deliberately or inadvertently, the member of the royal family\u2019s position, associations or access\u201d.</p> <p>At the time the rules were introduced there were also calls for a register of royal interests, similar to that operated by MPs, listing the business interests or shareholdings of members of the royal family. This was not introduced, with palace officials warning it could be exploited as an unofficial endorsement.</p> <p>It does throw into sharp relief one of the contradictions at the heart of the Sussexes\u2019 bid for commercial freedom.

With funds from the successful cookbook, they have now been able to share their spirit of community with so many more. The Hubb continues to work with local organisations to build hope, bring comfort and provide not simply a warm meal, but with it, a sense of togetherness. The Duke and Duchess were so happy to reconnect with the women and hear about the projects they continue to develop to help those in their community and beyond.

      "bodyText": "Here are the main points so far today: The Queen has agreed to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s wish to take a step back from public life, though she said she stressed that her preference would have been for the couple to remain as full-time working royals. The monarch, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry met at Sandringham to discuss the plans today. Prince William and Prince Harry have issued a joint statement dismissing a \u201cfalse story\u201d in a UK newspaper about their relationship. The two princes said: \u201cFor brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.\u201d Although they did not name the paper, it is believed to be a reference to an article in the Times which suggested the Sussexes had been driven away from the royal family by bullying behaviour. The home secretary, Priti Patel, contradicted Prince Harry\u2019s claims that negative coverage of his wife has been motivated by an undercurrent of racism. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not in that category at all where I believe there\u2019s racism at all. I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity, where people of any background can get on in life.\u201d The chief executive of the Rugby Football League, Ralph Rimmer, says he is very hopeful that Prince Harry will remain its patron. Harry will conduct the draw for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup at Buckingham Palace on Thursday in his first public engagement since he and Meghan issued their statement last week. My colleague, Caroline Davies, has tonight\u2019s main story: Community workers and charity organisers have defended the Duke and Duchess of Sussex after they were accused of letting the country and their family down by seeking to step back from their senior royal status. After days of criticism of Harry and Meghan, the Queen said on Monday that while she would have preferred them to remain full-time royals she was \u201centirely supportive\u201d of the plan. Her defence came after some members of the military had hit out at Harry in particular over the weekend, accusing him of \u201cdisrespect to the Queen\u201d and his former comrades. One said his fellow marines were \u201cvery upset, if not disgusted\u201d with the decision. On Monday, however, some of those who have worked alongside the Sussexes on grassroots and research initiatives in Nottingham gave them their strong support and said they had been impressed by the extent of their commitment to their work. My colleague Simon Jenkins has written an interesting opinion piece, in which he suggests the monarchy is incapable of the sort of change for which Harry and Meghan hoped. No, the monarchy is not in crisis. No, the princes are not bullies. No, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be destitute, merely stinking rich. No, they will not go unprotected. In a nutshell, the past few days\u2019 events, inconceivable in any other democracy, really do not matter. Pull the other one. The nation is on tenterhooks, or at least its mass media is. The royal press corps is about to be deprived of its beloved stereotype; the tearaway young prince who goes to war, marries a beautiful woman and \u201cshakes the monarchy to its foundations\u201d. But stereotypes always fade. The British monarchy has handled worse than this. Only senior royals were due to attend today\u2019s meeting, but the talks have been shaped and directed behind the scenes by a group of senior aides who have provided briefings on the implications of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s decision to step back from some of the duties and pressures of public life. Sir Mark Sedwill The palace reportedly consulted the cabinet secretary on the constitutional implications. The Times said Sedwill had been dragged into the row last week and that he and the prime minister would ultimately have to decide on the allocation of any public money to the couple in the future. Sir Edward Young The Queen\u2019s top aide, who has reportedly come under increasing pressure since Harry and Meghan\u2019s announcement. According to the Sunday Times, Princess Anne and Prince Edward are among the members of a faction who want to see him ousted, believing him to have failed to stop the situation reaching crisis point. Clive Alderton The principal private secretary to the Prince of Wales and a career diplomat. Alderton returned to work for Prince Charles after a spell as Britain\u2019s ambassador to Morocco. He had previously served as an aide in Charles\u2019 official London residence, Clarence House, and is reported to be popular with the prince\u2019s family. Simon Case The Duke of Cambridge\u2019s private secretary is a civil servant who formerly worked on solving the Irish border issue during Brexit discussions. He also served as principal private secretary to David Cameron when he was prime minister, having previously worked as GCHQ\u2019s director of strategy. Fiona Mcilwham The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s private secretary is relatively new to the role. She is a top diplomat and became one of the UK\u2019s youngest ambassadors when she was posted to Albania aged 35 in 2009. She impressed in the role, with the Albanian journalist Muhamed Veliu telling the Mail on Sunday she \u201cquickly gained huge respect\u201d at a time of mounting political tension over organised crime. After a mountain of speculation since Harry and Meghan declared their intentions last week, today\u2019s statement from the Queen leaves us a little clearer about what the future will hold for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, even if it is necessarily light on detail. The Queen said there were complex issues to address and that more work needed to be done,but she also set a timetable, saying she expects final decisions to be reached in days. The statement announces a \u201cperiod of transition\u201d for the royal couple and their young son Archie as they spend time in Canada and the UK, while they reduce their reliance on public funds. The Queen\u2019s statement about the Sandringham talks followed an earlier joint statement issued by Prince William and Prince Harry, which described as false a UK newspaper story claiming the Sussexes felt they were being forced out by \u201cbullying\u201d behaviour within the family. Given that both brothers have spoken in recent months about the previously close nature of their relationship changing, it will be seen as a sign of unity on a significant day for the future shape of the British monarchy. Buckingham Palace has just released the following statement from the Queen: Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family. My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan\u2019s desire to create a new life as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working Members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family. Harry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives. It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK. These are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days. Reports are coming in from correspondents at Sandringham that the royals have left the estate. Prince Charles, Prince William &amp; Prince Harry are all believed to have left Sandringham House separately, at around 4:30pm. Buckingham Palace has said a statement following today\u2019s meeting will follow shortly. Here are the main points so far today: The Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry are meeting at Sandringham to discuss the future of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they attempt to step away from senior royal duties and forge a more independent life. Prince William and Prince Harry have issued a joint statement dismissing a \u201cfalse story\u201d in a UK newspaper speculating about their relationship. The two princes say: \u201cFor brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.\u201d Although they did not name the paper, it is believed to be a reference to an article in the Times which suggested the Sussexes had been driven away from the royal family by \u201cbullying\u201d behaviour. The home secretary, Priti Patel, contradicted Prince Harry\u2019s claims that negative coverage of his wife has been motivated by an undercurrent of racism. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not in that category at all where I believe there\u2019s racism at all. I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity, where people of any background can get on in life.\u201d The chief executive of the Rugby Football League, Ralph Rimmer, says he is very hopeful that Prince Harry will remain its patron. Harry will be conducting the draw for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup at Buckingham Palace on Thursday in his first public engagement since he and Meghan issued their statement last week. It\u2019s got to be said that the media hanging out at Sandringham today have had very little to report directly on. One moment of excitement did happen about an hour ago though, when a man got on top of a car with a megaphone and began addressing the media and the police present at the Queen\u2019s private estate. ITV News\u2019s royal editor, Chris Ship, posted this clip a little while ago, during which the protester appears to describe the media as a \u201csavage bunch of dogs\u201d. Away from Sandringham, my colleague Aaron Bower from the sport desk has been attending a press event in Huddersfield with Ralph Rimmer, the chief executive of the Rugby Football League. Prince Harry, in his role as patron for the sport of rugby league, will conduct the draw for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. It will be his first public engagement since news of his intention to step back from royal duties broke. Rimmer was asked about Harry\u2019s duties, and expects him to continue. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful [he will continue],\u201d Rimmer said. \u201cFrom what I know, I think his patronages will remain, but that could change. We haven\u2019t had anything negative from the palace or his office regarding our patronage, but there are plenty of wheels turning in the machine at this moment in time. As far as I understand from the news, there will be some clarifications ironed out today, so we\u2019ll see how his patronages work out after that.\u201d On Harry\u2019s involvement with Thursday\u2019s World Cup draw, Rimmer said: \u201cIn light of everything that has happened recently, we\u2019re honoured that he will make the draw. He\u2019s been a superb patron for us. Of course there will be the eyes and ears of the world\u2019s media on that event and I suppose the event will benefit from that.\u201d Some outlets have run pictures of what appears to have been a car carrying Harry into Sandringham at around 1.45pm, before the summit which was believed to be starting at 2pm. Here are some of the main topics that you imagine would be part of the discussions today: Titles If the couple seem determined to step back from royal duties, then the royal family may want to step back from honouring them with titles. It is unclear whether the British public would regard removing the titles as petty, or as the right thing to do if the couple are no longer working as part of the royal family. However, the question of titles might not be as pressing as it first appears. Regardless of whether he retains a formal royal title or not, Harry will remain the youngest son of Diana, Princess of Wales. That in itself will guarantee enduring public interest in his life for years to come. Living arrangements The couple have suggested they will split their time between North America and the UK. However, if Meghan wants to apply for British citizenship she is required to only spend 90 days outside the country. There\u2019s also the question of whether they can retain Frogmore Cottage, the Grade II-listed house in Windsor they currently use as a base. It was refurbished recently with \u00a32.4m of taxpayer money. It is owned by the Queen. Security Living abroad some of the year poses a unique set of security challenges for the royal family to face. The Sussexes would still require 24/7 security protection \u2013 but who is going to pay for it? There are reports today that the Canadian PM, Justin Trudeau, has suggested his country may be prepared to contribute \u2013 although that may not please the Canadian public. Funding The couple aren\u2019t short of money, either from Meghan\u2019s earnings before she married into the royal family, or from the money that Prince Harry inherited from his mother. But whatever they do to try and bring in an income is liable to be controversial, and open to accusations that they are trading on the royal family\u2019s name. They appear to be willing to give up direct state funding from the sovereign grant which is estimated to make up about 5% of their annual costs. The rest of the money is currently met with revenues from the Duchy of Cornwall granted to them by Harry\u2019s father, Charles. Taxation If the couple split their time between the UK and Canada they may have to split their tax affairs. Both Canadian and UK authorities would stake a claim on revenue earned within their jurisdiction. Future royal duties and charity work The couple\u2019s statement that they wanted to step back from being \u201csenior royals\u201d didn\u2019t appear to totally rule out doing some official engagements. One of the topics to be explored at the summit today will no doubt be the extent to which it is practical for them to combine official royal duties with an independent lifestyle, and their own soon-to-be-launched charitable foundation. A reminder that the main development of the day so far, as we wait for news to emerge from the Sandringham summit, is that the Duke of Sussex and Duke of Cambridge have issued a furious denial over a newspaper report speculating on causes of a rift between them, branding it \u201coffensive and potentially harmful\u201d. You can read my colleague Caroline Davies\u2019s full report on it here: The Press Association have just put out a report outlining the existing rules by which members of the royal family are allowed to carry out commercial activities. They could form the starting point for any agreement that comes out of today\u2019s summit meeting. They were devised almost 20 years ago, in the wake of a scandal when the Countess of Wessex was accused of cashing in on her royal status in an attempt to win business for her PR firm. Under the rules, royals have to first consult the Lord Chamberlain before taking on a new business activity. They could be seen as an impediment to the kind of independence that Harry and Meghan appear to be seeking. The guidelines also stressed that anyone connected with a business activity \u201cshould be carefully briefed not to try to exploit, either deliberately or inadvertently, the member of the royal family\u2019s position, associations or access\u201d. At the time the rules were introduced there were also calls for a register of royal interests, similar to that operated by MPs, listing the business interests or shareholdings of members of the royal family. This was not introduced, with palace officials warning it could be exploited as an unofficial endorsement. It does throw into sharp relief one of the contradictions at the heart of the Sussexes\u2019 bid for commercial freedom. Their worth in terms of endorsements and commercial exploitation rest, at least on Prince Harry\u2019s side, almost entirely on being a member of the royal family. It is difficult to see how any work by the proposed \u201cSussex Royal\u201d brand (see 10:50) can be anything other than tied up with their connections to the monarchy. Harry, though, might point to the example of his mother. Diana continued to do charity work and maintain a high media profile even after she had in effect been ostracised from the heart of the royal family. The treatment of the Duchess of Sussex by the media, and what her brand of appealing to the socially progressive younger generation symbolises for Britain\u2019s culture warriors such as Piers Morgan and Eamonn Holmes, is the subject of Owen Jones\u2019s column today: Britain\u2019s culture war can be summed up like this: a currently triumphalist faction that believes that progressive social norms have gone too far and that so-called \u201cidentity politics\u201d, PC culture and the \u201cwoke\u201d need to be driven back. Meghan became a target because she is a mixed-race American with no aristocratic blood, who dared to import vaguely progressive values into the most conservative of British institutions. Even worse, she supposedly seduced a linchpin of the monarchy to these nefarious \u201cwoke\u201d ways. It is being reported in London\u2019s Evening Standard that the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has privately assured the Queen that the commonwealth country would pick up the bill for security for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex if they were to move to Canada as has been mooted. That could prove contentious domestically for Trudeau. Dr Barry Mackenzie, a Canadian royal historian, was asked about exactly this on BBC Radio 5 live this morning, and said: \u201cThat I think is going to be a sticking point for Canadians. And even though this whole scenario seems to have done a lot to make Canadians sympathetic to the situation in which the Queen finds herself, at the same, if this arrangement means that Canadians are going to have to pick up that bill, then I do fear that may be fodder for republicans, who already complain about the fact that the monarchy is expensive.\u201d We heard similar views when we asked our Canadian readers what they thought about the proposed move. The Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry are due to met at Sandringham for an emergency summit to discuss the announcement by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex that they intend to step back from being senior royal figures and become self-financing. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has contradicted Prince Harry\u2019s claims that negative coverage of his wife has been motivated by an undercurrent of racism. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not in that category at all where I believe there\u2019s racism at all. I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity, where people of any background can get on in life. I certainly haven\u2019t seen that through any debates or commentary or things of that nature.\u201d Prince William and Prince Harry have issued a joint statement dismissing a \u201cfalse story\u201d in a UK newspaper today speculating about their relationship. The two princes say: \u201cDespite clear denials, a false story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge. For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.\u201d Although they did not name the paper, it is believed to be a reference to an article in the Times which suggested the Sussexes had been driven away from the royal family by \u201cbullying\u201d behaviour. With the abrupt announcement that they were intending to step back from royal duties, it has been natural to look back at some of the things that Prince Harry has previously said about his role in the royal family through a slightly different lens. As recently as 2017 he spoke to Newsweek magazine about considering leaving the royal family: \u201cI felt I wanted out but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself.\u201d Today\u2019s summit meeting at Sandringham is not just a family gathering though; it is a business meeting. Interviewed around the time of the Queen\u2019s 90th birthday, Harry told the BBC: \u201cI still view her more as the Queen than my grandmother. You have this huge amount of respect for your boss and I always view her as my boss \u2013 but occasionally as a grandmother.\u201d And maybe there\u2019s a hint of what comes next in what he\u2019s said before. Harry once answered a question on what he would do if he were not a prince: \u201cI\u2019d probably live in Africa. I\u2019d like to spend all my time out there \u2026 As a job, it would probably be a safari guide.\u201d It has been believed for some time that Prince Charles is in favour of a slimmed-down version of the monarchy, which might be more likely to continue to carry public support. He may not have envisaged the changes happening so quickly, or being instigated by his youngest son. At the weekend Kate Williams argued in the Observer that Harry and Meghan\u2019s \u201cflexi-royal\u201d plan could help modernise the monarchy, bringing it more in line with the royal families of Europe, in which most members not in direct line have full-time careers. A few months ago, Prince Andrew revealed royal privilege and entitlement at its worst, refusing to apologise in his Newsnight interview for socialising with a sex criminal. And although he was criticised and forced to step down, it was a long time coming and it still seemed as if some in our society were angrier about Meghan wearing dark nail varnish than Andrew\u2019s links with Epstein. Harry and Meghan\u2019s decision to step back has gained huge traction and sympathy across the world. The royal family needs to work with their wishes or risk losing them for ever. Prince Harry and Prince William have dismissed a \u201cfalse story\u201d in a UK newspaper today speculating about their relationship. The joint statement on behalf of the Duke of Sussex and Duke of Cambridge said: \u201cDespite clear denials, a false story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge. For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.\u201d The statement does not specify which report, but they are believed to be referring to a story in the Times which was headlined \u201cPrinces \u2018fell out because William wasn\u2019t friendly towards Meghan\u2019\u201d. The opening paragraph of that story referred to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex regarding themselves as \u201chaving been pushed away from the royal family by the \u2018bullying\u2019 attitude\u201d of the Duke of Cambridge. The Times claimed that a source, said to be close to the couple, had said William was insufficiently welcoming towards Meghan when she first started dating Harry as a result of the competitive nature of William\u2019s relationship with his younger brother. The report quoted the source as saying she had spent two years \u201cconstantly being told your place, constantly bullied as they would see it\u201d. The move comes a day after the Sunday Times reported William saying: \u201cI\u2019ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can\u2019t do that any more; we\u2019re separate entities.\u201d And in a documentary, filmed during the Sussexes\u2019 tour of southern Africa last autumn, Harry said he and William were now \u201con different paths\u201d and had \u201cgood days\u201d and \u201cbad days\u201d in their relationship. With the home secretary, Priti Patel, coming out today to say she had seen no racism in the coverage of Meghan Markle during her journey from becoming Prince Harry\u2019s partner to marrying into the royal family (see 10:14), it might be worth spending two minutes reading Nesrine Malik\u2019s blistering column from the Observer yesterday, where she spoke of \u201cBritain\u2019s racism pantomime\u201d. In many ways, any improvement in race relations has come with a proportional decline in self-awareness, and with it a degradation of the public conversation on race. The increased visibility of black and brown people in those spaces where this conversation takes place \u2013 in politics and the media \u2013 has achieved little apart from sifting them into for and against camps. Whenever a public figure is subjected to racist behaviour, a sort of kangaroo court is set up, one with an impossibly high bar for proving a racist event has occurred \u2013 anything short of an explicit slur or a violent attack can easily be explained away. The outcome of the litigation is certain because the whole point of the exercise is the spectacle, rather than the inquiry. There\u2019s an argument that the royal family haven\u2019t helped themselves in terms of media management in the way that they have made today\u2019s crisis summit a type of public event, but also private event. Having been informed that it is taking place, the media have of course set up camp outside Sandringham, hoping for photos of the members of the family as they arrive. But there\u2019s no scheduled press conference afterwards, and no formal public element to the proceedings. By the end of the day we may still be very much in a \u201cno white smoke yet\u201d situation. The Sun and the Mirror both focus their front pages on what comes next, and what they fear might be a worst-case scenario for the monarchy \u2013 that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex offer a \u201ctell-all\u201d TV interview to put their side of the story. The Sun\u2019s editorial is firm on what it thinks its readers expect: \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the couple must not receive a penny from the state. British taxpayers fund the royal family to strengthen our nation\u2019s soft power and to support vital charities. If Meghan and Harry can\u2019t be bothered with the legwork, then it goes without saying they must give up the whopping perks which come with it.\u201d The Sun also finds time to report that the Duchess of Sussex has only ever spent six hours in Sussex, an almost textbook example of the kind of negative coverage that has continually riled Prince Harry. The potential impact of a dynamite television interview is one that Prince Harry will be well aware of. His mother Princess Diana gave a landmark interview to Martin Bashir about the failure of her marriage to Prince Charles in 1995, when Harry was a child. As you can imagine, coverage of the crisis dominated most front pages in the UK this morning, with the Mirror, Mail, Sun, Telegraph and Times all leading with royal stories. Describing it on their masthead as \u201cD-day for the royals\u201d, the Telegraph\u2019s editorial says: \u201cThere is evidently a general willingness to recognise that Prince Harry and his wife do not want to continue with the role that had been expected of them, although many will deeply resent the suggestions that the Duchess has somehow been forced to flee by intrinsic racism and bigotry. Rarely has a royal marriage been so welcomed, largely because of the popularity of Prince Harry and a national desire to see him happy.\u201d The paper\u2019s deferential sympathies, though, very much lie with the plight of the Queen. Their editorial goes on to say: \u201cIt is also clear that the country does not want to see a \u2018half-in, half-out\u2019 arrangement reached, which would not be fair on the other senior royals. In particular, it would not be fair on the Queen, who has again been confronted with an unnecessarily onerous task, which she approaches with her usual dutiful fortitude, but at a time in her life when she deserves better.\u201d A key aspect for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to establish will be where their future commercial interests lie. They have already made moves to trademark their names. My colleague Ben Quinn reports that back in December they filed an application with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the name of their new foundation \u201cSussex Royal\u201d. The application covered Australia, Canada, the EU and US, and was for a range of items and activities including clothing, stationery and the running of \u201cemotional support groups\u201d. The couple already use \u201cSussex Royal\u201d as their name on Instagram, where they have over 10 million followers. Since making their statement last week on Instagram and their own website, they have posted just one more thing online \u2013 a roundup of photographs of them visiting the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, which was set up in the wake of Grenfell to cook meals for families and neighbours who had been displaced because of the fire. Here\u2019s a rundown from my colleague Caroline Davies of what we can expect from the day - and what both sides of the royal family will be hoping to get out of any agreement. The announcement from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex last week was quite unclear on the details about the role they are hoping to fulfil in the future. However, there may have been some hints in the Sunday papers. Writing in the Sunday Times, the ITV journalist Tom Bradby, who seems close to the couple, outlined what he felt they were looking to get out of any deal. \u201cThey appear philosophical about the prospect of losing their titles and becoming, in the end, entirely self-funded,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf I had to guess,\u201d he added \u201cI\u2019d say Meghan might take on a few big roles as a brand ambassador and do some work in television as an executive producer, perhaps on programmes that promote the causes and charities she has long been interested in. \u201cI imagine Harry will probably concentrate on the voluntary work he has done over the years \u2013 the Invictus Games, Sentebele \u2013 and if he were to step into the commercial space, I suspect it would be an area that already interests him, such as eco-tourism.\u201d One of the other issues that will be up for discussion is the future security arrangements for the couple and their young son Archie. Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live this morning about the possible options, the home secretary, Priti Patel, refused to comment, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to provide any detailed information on the security arrangements for either them or any members of the royal family or for any protected individuals \u2013 that\u2019s thoroughly inappropriate for me to do so.\u201d She went on to contradict Prince Harry\u2019s assessment that some of the negative coverage of his wife had been motivated by racism. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not in that category at all where I believe there\u2019s racism at all. I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity, where people of any background can get on in life.\u201d She added that she didn\u2019t think the media had been in any way racist, saying: \u201cI certainly haven\u2019t seen that through any debates or commentary or things of that nature.\u201d Harry has been critical of coverage of Meghan for some time. In November 2016 he issued a statement condemning what he called a \u201cwave of abuse and harassment\u201d from the British press and public. \u201cSome of this has been very public,\u201d the palace\u2019s statement read at the time. \u201cThe smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.\u201d In September last year, the BBC issued an apology to Prince Harry after it failed to warn the Duke of Sussex in advance before broadcasting and publishing online an image from a neo-Nazi social media group that called him a \u201crace traitor\u201d. Good morning, on a day that could prove to be pivotal for the future shape of the monarchy. While a lot of the wider coverage of the crisis caused by the sudden announcement from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex that they want to step back from senior roles in the royal family treats them like showbiz or celebrity characters, the move has significant constitutional implications for how the royal family is run and paid for, and what is expected from them in the future. Later today the Queen will gather her heir Prince Charles, and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry, for a meeting. Meghan is expected to be joining them via conference call, as they attempt to thrash out the next steps to a workable solution at the Queen\u2019s private Sandringham estate in eastern England. According to reports the issues up for debate will include how much money the couple will still receive from Charles\u2019s estate, their royal titles and what commercial deals they can strike. It\u2019s not entirely clear that much news will emerge from the meeting today \u2013 we may just end up with a \u201ctalks with continue\u201d.",

The organisers of the competition, which takes place in England in 2021, have been given assurances that the Duke of Sussex, in his role as patron of the Rugby Football League, will be at Buckingham Palace as scheduled. The Guardian understands, however, that the World Cup organisers have been told that the BBC, in its role as the host broadcaster of the tournament, will be the only sport media outlet granted access to the palace. Other sports reporters will be hosted at an event in Manchester, where the draw will be streamed live. It was announced on Monday that Dave Woods, the BBC\u2019s rugby league correspondent, and the presenter Seema Jaswal will host the event, but any questions about Harry\u2019s ongoing discussions with the royal family over his role will be off-limits. The royal rota is still expected to cover the event, despite the Sussexes indicating on their website that they wanted to change the way they engage with the media beyond the rota.

      "body": "<p>The merest flicker of concern passed across Black Rod\u2019s face. Nicky Morgan had forgotten so much in recent months, it was entirely possible she might forget to turn up to her own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/06/nicky-morgan-to-keep-retiring-mp-payment-despite-role-in-lords\">introduction to the House of Lords.</a> Indeed, her amnesia appears to be getting worse by the day. Give it a few months and she will have regressed completely. Baroness Morgan of Tabula Rasa.</p> <p>Fortunately, Morgan\u2019s minders: Baroness Verma and Lord Young of Cookham, had taken no chances. They had arrived at her house early in the morning to make sure there was no chance of the culture secretary going walkabout. From there, they had bundled her into the back of a car and taken her off to Westminster to get togged up. Moments after the clerk called her name, Morgan was led forwards to be sworn in at the despatch box.</p> <p>\u201cBaroness Morgan of Cotes,\u201d said the clerk.</p> <p>Morgan merely looked puzzled. Then she always does. It\u2019s about the only thing that\u2019s really genuine about her. Because the rest of us are just as astonished at her career trajectory as she must be. Fair to say, she\u2019s been on quite the journey.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d the clerk whispered anxiously. \u201cHard to believe I know.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed it is. Back in 2018, Morgan had been one of the leading voices for remain on the Tory benches and in September of that year had insisted she would refuse to serve in any Boris Johnson government. Then her memory had begun to fade and she had been seduced by the possibility of badgers in night-vision goggles patrolling the Northern Ireland border as part of the entirely absurd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/29/the-malthouse-compromise-everything-you-need-to-know-brexit-vote\">Malthouse Compromise</a>. The Alternative Arrangements had merely proved to be a gateway drug to an Alternative Lifestyle and soon \u201cOur Nicky\u201d was voting for any old Brexit.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long before the obliteration of memory \u2013 and with it any trace of principle she might once have had \u2013 came to the attention of a new prime minister who fully understood the virtues of having no morality whatsoever. Morgan was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/16/nicky-morgan-kept-on-as-culture-secretary-amid-tory-reshuffle\">invited back into the cabinet as the culture secretary</a>. A position she happily accepted, because by then she had no memory of having said she would turn it down.</p> <p>Things went rapidly downhill after that. A headlong dive into the abyss. Before the general election, she had announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/31/nicky-morgan-tory-boris-johnsonn-erg-brexit\">would stand down as an MP </a>because she felt she could no longer serve her constituents with dedication and wanted to spend more time with her family. So she had been astonished to find herself campaigning so actively on behalf of the Conservatives during the election and genuinely baffled to be asked if she had been offered a job and a peerage in return.</p> <p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she had exclaimed. Because she had genuinely forgotten that she had been offered both. Such an easy mistake to make. So imagine her surprise when Boris Johnson had kept his promise \u2013 admittedly a first to a woman \u2013 and given her everything she had always wanted. Along with an \u00a38,400 retiring payment to former MPs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/06/nicky-morgan-to-keep-retiring-mp-payment-despite-role-in-lords\">she said she would not return</a>. Start as you mean to go on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ecb79b2cf5478869d2d1db9de00d42384d6ad45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ecb79b2cf5478869d2d1db9de00d42384d6ad45/0_0_1659_995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zac Goldsmith, centre: showing the punters of Richmond Park the error of their ways by being appointed by PM as their very own unelected overlord.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zac Goldsmith, centre: showing the punters of Richmond Park the error of their ways by being appointed by PM as their very own unelected overlord.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: House of Lords/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bizarrely, Morgan\u2019s introduction proved to be a spiritual high point in the proceedings. Because next in line for inauguration was Frank Zac Goldsmith. Though Mad Frankie would rather you forgot the Frank bit. Frank must just be the alter ego who led a racist campaign as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/07/zac-goldsmith-racist-campaign-london\">Tories\u2019 candidate for London mayor against Sadiq Khan.</a></p> <p>Back in 2014, Goldsmith had styled himself as a champion of democracy by insisting constituents should have the right to recall for MPs they didn\u2019t like. Only it\u2019s turned out that the recall Zac had in mind was his right to do whatever the fuck he wanted and recall himself.</p> <p>The voters of his Richmond Park constituency had overwhelmingly decided they had had more than enough of Goldsmith at last month\u2019s general election. So Zac had immediately complained to Boris that it just wasn\u2019t fair. Respecting the democratic mandate of the people was never meant to be taken this far.</p> <p>And Boris had rather agreed with Goldsmith. Zac was his kind of wealthy dilettante and it was obvious the voters had made a hideous mistake by not re-electing him. So the punters of Richmond Park had to be shown the error of their ways by having Goldsmith appointed as their very own unelected overlord. A man who could be trusted to always make the wrong call. Not least by accepting the honour. If Zac had even a hint of self-respect, he would have turned it down. Just so he could look himself in the mirror</p> <p>And to rub voters\u2019 noses in it, Goldsmith would also be kept on as the environment minister. Given the chance, Boris would also have made Dominic Cummings a peer had he not already been long since married into the aristocracy. There was always still time, he supposed.</p> <p>There were a few half-hearted murmurs of \u201cHear, Hear\u201d as Morgan and Goldsmith were introduced, but most peers remained silent. Even they have standards. There\u2019s unelected and then there\u2019s unelectable. Long live democracy! Long Live the people\u2019s government!</p>",

      "bodyText": "The merest flicker of concern passed across Black Rod\u2019s face. Nicky Morgan had forgotten so much in recent months, it was entirely possible she might forget to turn up to her own introduction to the House of Lords. Indeed, her amnesia appears to be getting worse by the day. Give it a few months and she will have regressed completely. Baroness Morgan of Tabula Rasa. Fortunately, Morgan\u2019s minders: Baroness Verma and Lord Young of Cookham, had taken no chances. They had arrived at her house early in the morning to make sure there was no chance of the culture secretary going walkabout. From there, they had bundled her into the back of a car and taken her off to Westminster to get togged up. Moments after the clerk called her name, Morgan was led forwards to be sworn in at the despatch box. \u201cBaroness Morgan of Cotes,\u201d said the clerk. Morgan merely looked puzzled. Then she always does. It\u2019s about the only thing that\u2019s really genuine about her. Because the rest of us are just as astonished at her career trajectory as she must be. Fair to say, she\u2019s been on quite the journey. \u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d the clerk whispered anxiously. \u201cHard to believe I know.\u201d Indeed it is. Back in 2018, Morgan had been one of the leading voices for remain on the Tory benches and in September of that year had insisted she would refuse to serve in any Boris Johnson government. Then her memory had begun to fade and she had been seduced by the possibility of badgers in night-vision goggles patrolling the Northern Ireland border as part of the entirely absurd Malthouse Compromise. The Alternative Arrangements had merely proved to be a gateway drug to an Alternative Lifestyle and soon \u201cOur Nicky\u201d was voting for any old Brexit. It wasn\u2019t long before the obliteration of memory \u2013 and with it any trace of principle she might once have had \u2013 came to the attention of a new prime minister who fully understood the virtues of having no morality whatsoever. Morgan was invited back into the cabinet as the culture secretary. A position she happily accepted, because by then she had no memory of having said she would turn it down. Things went rapidly downhill after that. A headlong dive into the abyss. Before the general election, she had announced that would stand down as an MP because she felt she could no longer serve her constituents with dedication and wanted to spend more time with her family. So she had been astonished to find herself campaigning so actively on behalf of the Conservatives during the election and genuinely baffled to be asked if she had been offered a job and a peerage in return. \u201cOh no,\u201d she had exclaimed. Because she had genuinely forgotten that she had been offered both. Such an easy mistake to make. So imagine her surprise when Boris Johnson had kept his promise \u2013 admittedly a first to a woman \u2013 and given her everything she had always wanted. Along with an \u00a38,400 retiring payment to former MPs that she said she would not return. Start as you mean to go on. Bizarrely, Morgan\u2019s introduction proved to be a spiritual high point in the proceedings. Because next in line for inauguration was Frank Zac Goldsmith. Though Mad Frankie would rather you forgot the Frank bit. Frank must just be the alter ego who led a racist campaign as the Tories\u2019 candidate for London mayor against Sadiq Khan. Back in 2014, Goldsmith had styled himself as a champion of democracy by insisting constituents should have the right to recall for MPs they didn\u2019t like. Only it\u2019s turned out that the recall Zac had in mind was his right to do whatever the fuck he wanted and recall himself. The voters of his Richmond Park constituency had overwhelmingly decided they had had more than enough of Goldsmith at last month\u2019s general election. So Zac had immediately complained to Boris that it just wasn\u2019t fair. Respecting the democratic mandate of the people was never meant to be taken this far. And Boris had rather agreed with Goldsmith. Zac was his kind of wealthy dilettante and it was obvious the voters had made a hideous mistake by not re-electing him. So the punters of Richmond Park had to be shown the error of their ways by having Goldsmith appointed as their very own unelected overlord. A man who could be trusted to always make the wrong call. Not least by accepting the honour. If Zac had even a hint of self-respect, he would have turned it down. Just so he could look himself in the mirror And to rub voters\u2019 noses in it, Goldsmith would also be kept on as the environment minister. Given the chance, Boris would also have made Dominic Cummings a peer had he not already been long since married into the aristocracy. There was always still time, he supposed. There were a few half-hearted murmurs of \u201cHear, Hear\u201d as Morgan and Goldsmith were introduced, but most peers remained silent. Even they have standards. There\u2019s unelected and then there\u2019s unelectable. Long live democracy! Long Live the people\u2019s government!",

But he has declined to confirm the sums involved until a deal is done.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/856998/2020-01-08_a_new_decade__a_new_approach.pdf\">New Decade, New Approach</a> deal promises \u201cpositive changes in areas that impact greatly on people\u2019s lives such as the economy, overcrowded hospitals, struggling schools, housing stress, welfare concerns and mental health\u201d.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what is in the Stormont executive\u2019s in-tray:</p> <h2><strong>NHS</strong></h2> <p>Staff pressures and waiting lists are the most immediate priority. Northern Ireland has the worst waiting lists of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/18/northern-ireland-nurses-strike-over-pay-and-patient-safety\">anywhere in the UK</a>, but the nurses\u2019 strike will be the number one focus for the new health minister, Robin Swann.

The plan emerged from a government-backed panel in 2016 and has never been taken forward because of the collapse of the assembly. It already has cross-party agreement.</p> <h2><strong>Education</strong></h2> <p>A long-running teachers\u2019 pay dispute will be another priority, but the deal also calls for a fundamental review of the way education is run. In July last year Simon Hoare, the chair of the Northern Ireland affairs select committee, said a lack of investment was having a devastating impact on schools. The region has had the highest school spending cuts per pupil in the UK over the past decade. Special needs education is under strain. The same committee also heard that Northern Irish schools were relying on charities to deliver essential services for children with mental health problems.</p> <h2><strong>Justice</strong></h2> <p>The deal promises to increase police numbers to 7,500 and commits to speed up the criminal justice system and address the findings of recent reports published by the Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland.</p> <h2><strong>Housing and welfare payments</strong></h2> <p>Investment and upkeep of social housing and the removal of the threat of the bedroom tax are priorities. The deal\u2019s plan of action promises to stop the reclassification of housing associations as public sector bodies and \u201cenhance investment\u201d in social housing.</p> <p>It also promises to tackle the maintenance backlog in the 86,000 homes owned by the region\u2019s housing authority. The deal also includes the extension of Stormont-funded mitigation payments for 34,000 social households that could be <a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/34000-in-northern-ireland-may-face-benefits-cut-due-to-bedroom-tax-38524636.html\">adversely affected</a> by the bedroom tax from April.</p> <h2><strong>Brexit</strong></h2> <p>While the new deal heralds new long-term budgeting for the region, the pressing interest will be job creation and protecting businesses from any impact from Brexit.</p> <p>First up is the staffing of the all-important Brexit working advisory group and the specialised committee, which will oversee the detail and implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/13/brexit-irish-border-uk-northern-ireland\">Institute for Government report</a> on Monday warned that it would be almost impossible to get a special customs systems in place before the end of the proposed transition period on 31 December. The power-sharing deal promises that \u201crepresentatives from the executive will be invited to be part of the UK delegation\u201d on these committees.</p> <p>The Brexit deal gives Northern Ireland a unique opportunity to attract UK firms that want to retain access to the single market, but with no Stormont, there has been no cross-community cohesive leadership on the issue in the last three years.</p> <h2><strong>The economy</strong></h2> <p>Boris Johnson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/12/pm-to-visit-northern-ireland-as-assembly-reopens-for-business\">predicted \u201can incredible time\u201d</a> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> now that the region has a functioning power-sharing government again.</p> <p>A goal of the executive, or cabinet, will be \u201cto develop a regionally balanced economy with opportunities for all\u201d and the delivery of essential infrastructure projects, including a key bottleneck offering motorway access at the York Street Interchange in Belfast and City Deals for the Belfast Region and Derry/Londonderry.</p> <p>The Irish government has also made financial pledges within the agreement to honour commitments to part-fund some north/south projects, such as the A5 dual carriageway and a redevelopment of the Ulster canal system.</p>",

The same committee also heard that Northern Irish schools were relying on charities to deliver essential services for children with mental health problems. Justice The deal promises to increase police numbers to 7,500 and commits to speed up the criminal justice system and address the findings of recent reports published by the Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland. Housing and welfare payments Investment and upkeep of social housing and the removal of the threat of the bedroom tax are priorities. The deal\u2019s plan of action promises to stop the reclassification of housing associations as public sector bodies and \u201cenhance investment\u201d in social housing. It also promises to tackle the maintenance backlog in the 86,000 homes owned by the region\u2019s housing authority. The deal also includes the extension of Stormont-funded mitigation payments for 34,000 social households that could be adversely affected by the bedroom tax from April. Brexit While the new deal heralds new long-term budgeting for the region, the pressing interest will be job creation and protecting businesses from any impact from Brexit. First up is the staffing of the all-important Brexit working advisory group and the specialised committee, which will oversee the detail and implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol. An Institute for Government report on Monday warned that it would be almost impossible to get a special customs systems in place before the end of the proposed transition period on 31 December. The power-sharing deal promises that \u201crepresentatives from the executive will be invited to be part of the UK delegation\u201d on these committees. The Brexit deal gives Northern Ireland a unique opportunity to attract UK firms that want to retain access to the single market, but with no Stormont, there has been no cross-community cohesive leadership on the issue in the last three years. The economy Boris Johnson has predicted \u201can incredible time\u201d for Northern Ireland now that the region has a functioning power-sharing government again. A goal of the executive, or cabinet, will be \u201cto develop a regionally balanced economy with opportunities for all\u201d and the delivery of essential infrastructure projects, including a key bottleneck offering motorway access at the York Street Interchange in Belfast and City Deals for the Belfast Region and Derry/Londonderry. The Irish government has also made financial pledges within the agreement to honour commitments to part-fund some north/south projects, such as the A5 dual carriageway and a redevelopment of the Ulster canal system.",

The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, used the promise of financial support to coax Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP towards a deal. Devolution collapsed in January 2017 amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/16/northern-ireland-power-sharing-government-expected-to-collapse-sinn-fein-cash-for-ash\">acrimony between the two parties</a>.</p> <p>In a joint statement, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader and first minister, and Michelle O\u2019Neill, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader and deputy first minister, said they had had constructive meetings with Johnson and Varadkar, but stressed that funding \u201cmust follow quickly\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need significant and sustained investment, not just this year but over a number of years,\u201d said Foster. \u201cThis is crucial in ensuring transformation in areas such as health and also our road and water infrastructures.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Neill said she had pressed Johnson and Varadkar over funding. \u201cWe have done our bit. I look forward to the fulfilment of the commitments made by the two governments to let us get to work.\u201d</p> <p>Foster and O\u2019Neill were due to push the issue in a meeting with Smith on Monday night.</p> <p>A botched green energy scheme nicknamed \u201ccash for ash\u201d that wasted hundreds of millions of pounds under Foster\u2019s watch in the previous administration may have dented her ability to squeeze money from Whitehall.</p> <p>Asked about the scandal, Johnson replied: \u201cIt is vital that public spending in Northern Ireland is properly invigilated and there is no repetition of that kind of thing.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson struck a cautious tone on the investigation of alleged crimes by military veterans during the Troubles, a contentious issue in Northern Ireland and the Conservative party.</p> <p>The new power-sharing deal struck the right balance between supporting military veterans and giving victims of violence the truth, he said.</p> <p>Stalled mechanisms backed by Northern Ireland\u2019s parties in a 2014 agreement are due to be implemented as part of last week\u2019s accord. This could set up a potential conflict with the Tory party\u2019s recent election pledge that there would be no unfair prosecutions of armed forces personnel where there was no new evidence.</p> <p>\u201cI think that the parties here who have revived Stormont have done a very good job of finding a balance between giving people who are in search of the truth the confidence that they need but also giving people who served our country in the armed services the confidence and certainty that they need,\u201d said Johnson.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has pledged the government\u2019s support for Northern Ireland\u2019s revived power-sharing executive, but sidestepped questions about funding to shore up the historic deal. The prime minister said he felt \u201cthe hand of the future beckoning us all forward\u201d during a visit to Stormont on Monday to support the restoration of devolution in the region after a three-year breakdown. However, Johnson deflected questions about a promised financial package for public services and infrastructure, saying devolution was about leadership, not money. \u201cWhat\u2019s so great about today is, as I say, that Northern Ireland politicians have put aside differences, stepped up to the plate and shown leadership,\u201d he told a press conference after meeting party leaders. The prime minister repeated his claim that under the Brexit deal there would be no checks on goods going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and only minimal checks on goods going the other way. This claim has been undermined by Northern Ireland\u2019s obligation to implement EU customs codes at its ports. Flanked by the Irish PM, Leo Varadkar, Johnson said cooperation between Dublin, Belfast and London would deepen. \u201cThe friendship that always existed, the opportunity now is to develop even more east-west cooperation and links and that is what we are going to do,\u201d he said. Varadkar agreed: \u201cThe Good Friday agreement is working again. North-south cooperation is going to resume. We are going to beef up and deepen cooperation.\u201d However the giddy mood at Stormont, which was revived on Saturday after three years of mothballing, gave way to frustration at the lack of detail about funding. \u201cWe are listening very carefully and we will give the support we can,\u201d said Johnson, perhaps mindful that funding for Northern Ireland could have knock-on implications for Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland\u2019s political parties signed up to power-sharing last week partly on the basis of significant Treasury transfers, with Sinn F\u00e9in mooting \u00a31.5bn and the Democratic Unionist party floating \u00a32bn. Some public services, notably healthcare, are in crisis. The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, used the promise of financial support to coax Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP towards a deal. Devolution collapsed in January 2017 amid acrimony between the two parties. In a joint statement, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader and first minister, and Michelle O\u2019Neill, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader and deputy first minister, said they had had constructive meetings with Johnson and Varadkar, but stressed that funding \u201cmust follow quickly\u201d. \u201cWe need significant and sustained investment, not just this year but over a number of years,\u201d said Foster. \u201cThis is crucial in ensuring transformation in areas such as health and also our road and water infrastructures.\u201d O\u2019Neill said she had pressed Johnson and Varadkar over funding. \u201cWe have done our bit. I look forward to the fulfilment of the commitments made by the two governments to let us get to work.\u201d Foster and O\u2019Neill were due to push the issue in a meeting with Smith on Monday night. A botched green energy scheme nicknamed \u201ccash for ash\u201d that wasted hundreds of millions of pounds under Foster\u2019s watch in the previous administration may have dented her ability to squeeze money from Whitehall. Asked about the scandal, Johnson replied: \u201cIt is vital that public spending in Northern Ireland is properly invigilated and there is no repetition of that kind of thing.\u201d Johnson struck a cautious tone on the investigation of alleged crimes by military veterans during the Troubles, a contentious issue in Northern Ireland and the Conservative party. The new power-sharing deal struck the right balance between supporting military veterans and giving victims of violence the truth, he said. Stalled mechanisms backed by Northern Ireland\u2019s parties in a 2014 agreement are due to be implemented as part of last week\u2019s accord. This could set up a potential conflict with the Tory party\u2019s recent election pledge that there would be no unfair prosecutions of armed forces personnel where there was no new evidence. \u201cI think that the parties here who have revived Stormont have done a very good job of finding a balance between giving people who are in search of the truth the confidence that they need but also giving people who served our country in the armed services the confidence and certainty that they need,\u201d said Johnson.",

      "body": "<p>The announcement last October was stuffed with the manufactured excitement one expects from any venture touched by Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin brand. The \u201clong-awaited\u201d rebranding of Flybe as Virgin Connect would mark the start of the airline\u2019s \u201cjourney into the future as part of the extended Virgin family\u201d under a \u201ctremendously re-energised team\u201d.</p> <p>Now comes a detour on that journey, a trip to two government business departments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/13/flybe-in-rescue-talks-to-stave-off-collapse\">to ask for emergency financing</a>. The airline, the departments for business and transport and Flybe\u2019s shareholders, including Virgin Atlantic, would not comment on <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/regional-airline-flybe-in-frantic-bid-to-stave-off-collapse-11907407\">the reports</a> but, since all parties would have a strong incentive to quash any untrue tale, one must assume high-stakes bargaining is at a critical point.</p> <p>Flybe can\u2019t afford the negotiations to be leisurely. Credit card providers, who can find themselves on the hook for cancelled flights, tend to panic in these situations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/15/flybe-virgin-atlantic-stobart-takeover\">Last February\u2019s \u00a32.2m purchase of Flybe</a> by the Connect consortium had to be accelerated in its final stages because lenders were withholding money from the airline to protect themselves from the risk of default. So clarity is needed, and quickly.</p> <p>The main obstacle to a rescue, one must assume, is deep reluctance to risk public money by lending to a private company where the owners bought the business less than a year ago and, as the quotes above indicate, revved the engines confidently last autumn. Indeed, the Connect consortium, having bought Flybe at a knockdown headline price, said they were willing to invest \u00a3100m. They spoke excitedly of the potential of Flybe to feed Virgin\u2019s long-haul network out of Heathrow and Manchester. What\u2019s changed?</p> <p>Increased trading losses? Higher fuel costs after sterling\u2019s decline last summer? Brexit uncertainty? None of those risks were unimaginable 12 months ago, so it would be hard for Virgin and its consortium partners \u2013 Stobart Air and the US investment firm Cyrus Capital \u2013 to plead that they\u2019ve been struck by exceptional events. Flybe has suffered many crises in many forms in its 40 years of flying.</p> <p>A better card to play in front of ministers would be to point to Flybe\u2019s role as the main operator of UK domestic flights, and thus its contribution to regional connectivity. The government is preaching a gospel of \u201clevelling up\u201d between regions, so presumably would be reluctant to see Flybe fail. In that sense, the airline is a more \u201cdeserving\u201d case than Thomas Cook, where the hole in the package holiday market can be filled by rivals. Besides, Flybe\u2019s numbers will be substantially smaller than Thomas Cook\u2019s.</p> <p>Yet the bare-minimum requirement for any public support should be this: Virgin and its partners should have to dig deep themselves. So no more talk about an intention to invest in improving Flybe. Only upfront, at-risk capital will do.</p> <p>Even with that qualification, it\u2019s impossible from outside to tell if there\u2019s a sensible deal to be done that protects the public purse. But the underlying principle ought be clear: Virgin and its partners cannot expect a free ride.</p> <h2>Fines in their billions are fine for big tech</h2> <p>As Alphabet, as Google calls itself these days, shapes up to become the fourth of the US big tech firms to reach a stock market capitalisation of $1tn, it\u2019s worth recalling old legal battles.</p> <p>One, which was naively regarded as breathtaking at the time, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/27/google-braces-for-record-breaking-1bn-fine-from-eu\">the \u20ac2.42bn fine from the EU</a> in 2017. Google abused its dominance of the search engine market in building its online shopping service and \u201cdenied other companies the chance to compete on merits and to innovate,\u201d the competition policy commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said.</p> <p>Include various other fines and the EU has fined Google about \u20ac8bn for anti-competitive practices over the years. It\u2019s a stunning sum in and of itself but, versus $1tn in corporate worth, it can almost be lost in the wash.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to believe regulators would be able easily to add a zero to their penalties to deter monopolist behaviour by digital giants. But a billion here, and a billion there, now looks puny.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The announcement last October was stuffed with the manufactured excitement one expects from any venture touched by Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin brand. The \u201clong-awaited\u201d rebranding of Flybe as Virgin Connect would mark the start of the airline\u2019s \u201cjourney into the future as part of the extended Virgin family\u201d under a \u201ctremendously re-energised team\u201d. Now comes a detour on that journey, a trip to two government business departments to ask for emergency financing. The airline, the departments for business and transport and Flybe\u2019s shareholders, including Virgin Atlantic, would not comment on the reports but, since all parties would have a strong incentive to quash any untrue tale, one must assume high-stakes bargaining is at a critical point. Flybe can\u2019t afford the negotiations to be leisurely. Credit card providers, who can find themselves on the hook for cancelled flights, tend to panic in these situations. Last February\u2019s \u00a32.2m purchase of Flybe by the Connect consortium had to be accelerated in its final stages because lenders were withholding money from the airline to protect themselves from the risk of default. So clarity is needed, and quickly. The main obstacle to a rescue, one must assume, is deep reluctance to risk public money by lending to a private company where the owners bought the business less than a year ago and, as the quotes above indicate, revved the engines confidently last autumn. Indeed, the Connect consortium, having bought Flybe at a knockdown headline price, said they were willing to invest \u00a3100m. They spoke excitedly of the potential of Flybe to feed Virgin\u2019s long-haul network out of Heathrow and Manchester. What\u2019s changed? Increased trading losses? Higher fuel costs after sterling\u2019s decline last summer? Brexit uncertainty? None of those risks were unimaginable 12 months ago, so it would be hard for Virgin and its consortium partners \u2013 Stobart Air and the US investment firm Cyrus Capital \u2013 to plead that they\u2019ve been struck by exceptional events. Flybe has suffered many crises in many forms in its 40 years of flying. A better card to play in front of ministers would be to point to Flybe\u2019s role as the main operator of UK domestic flights, and thus its contribution to regional connectivity. The government is preaching a gospel of \u201clevelling up\u201d between regions, so presumably would be reluctant to see Flybe fail. In that sense, the airline is a more \u201cdeserving\u201d case than Thomas Cook, where the hole in the package holiday market can be filled by rivals. Besides, Flybe\u2019s numbers will be substantially smaller than Thomas Cook\u2019s. Yet the bare-minimum requirement for any public support should be this: Virgin and its partners should have to dig deep themselves. So no more talk about an intention to invest in improving Flybe. Only upfront, at-risk capital will do. Even with that qualification, it\u2019s impossible from outside to tell if there\u2019s a sensible deal to be done that protects the public purse. But the underlying principle ought be clear: Virgin and its partners cannot expect a free ride. Fines in their billions are fine for big tech As Alphabet, as Google calls itself these days, shapes up to become the fourth of the US big tech firms to reach a stock market capitalisation of $1tn, it\u2019s worth recalling old legal battles. One, which was naively regarded as breathtaking at the time, was the \u20ac2.42bn fine from the EU in 2017. Google abused its dominance of the search engine market in building its online shopping service and \u201cdenied other companies the chance to compete on merits and to innovate,\u201d the competition policy commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said. Include various other fines and the EU has fined Google about \u20ac8bn for anti-competitive practices over the years. It\u2019s a stunning sum in and of itself but, versus $1tn in corporate worth, it can almost be lost in the wash. It\u2019s hard to believe regulators would be able easily to add a zero to their penalties to deter monopolist behaviour by digital giants. But a billion here, and a billion there, now looks puny.",

Gelare Jabbari apologised in an Instagram post, writing: \u201cIt was very hard for me to believe that our people have been killed. Forgive me that I got to know this late. And forgive me for the 13 years I told you lies.\u201d Zahra Khatami quit her role at IRIB, saying: \u201cThank you for accepting me as anchor until today. I will never get back to TV. Forgive me.\u201d Her fellow anchor Saba Rad said: \u201cThank you for your support in all years of my career. I announce that after 21 years working in radio and tv, I cannot continue my work in the media. I cannot.\u201d The journalists\u2019 statements are part of a crisis of confidence following the initial attempts by state officials to deny that Ukrainian jetliner 752 had been shot down by mistake by members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) air defence force. The crisis is leading even some of the news agencies most closely associated with the regime to start reporting on the street protests, or a least to start addressing the allegations about a potential state cover-up. The Tehran-based Association of Iranian Journalists said in a statement that the country was witnessing \u201ca funeral for public trust\u201d that was damaging the already shaky reputation of Iran\u2019s official media. Speaking candidly on BBC Radio Today, Ghanbar Naderi, a commentator on Iran\u2019s state-run Press TV, admitted: \u201cThere is little trust in the government and people want more freedom. The lies they said about the shooting down of the aeroplane [have] lost public trust.

It has made many mistakes that are unacceptable. If the IRGC shot down a civilian airplane, I have no choice but to condemn it.\u201d The Association of Iranian Journalists said: \u201cThe publication of false information has had a severe impact on public confidence and public opinion, and more than ever shook the media\u2019s shaky position. The situation has become so complex. We lie loudest when we lie to ourselves; and Islamic Republic of Iran state television employees acknowledge that their credibility has been lost.

This incident showed that people cannot trust official data and journalists should try to fill this gap as much as possible.\u201d Many Iranian newspapers appear to be angry because they felt their readerships were turning to international media to find out the truth about the crash. For instance, the reformist newspaper Etemad has persistently demanded since the weekend to know for how long the IRGC knew that it had shot down the plane and whether senior figures in the government were really not informed until Friday. Commentary in the reformist press and on Twitter had been hugely critical of what writers described as \u201cstructural lies\u201d by state institutions, as well as lack of coordination between the country\u2019s civilian aviation authority and IRGC. Etemad has called on officials not just to apologise, but to resign. The head of the Iranian civilian aviation authority, Ali Abedzadeh, has been most subject to criticism. Abedzadeh had told reporters: \u201cThe story that the plane was shot down by a rocket cannot be true under any circumstances \u2026 It is impossible from the scientific point of view.\u201d The authority subsequently apologised for \u201cinconsistency in the information provided\u201d, adding: \u201cWe have not been under any pressure or advice to conceal the reality and have no intention of concealing the reality \u2026 We have released the information we believed \u2026 and we are sorry for the mistake.\u201d Reporters Without Borders ranks Iran as 170th in the world press freedom index out of 180 countries.

Reformist newspapers are often shut. Social influencers on Twitter often find their thoughts banned by either targeted or generalised internet shutdowns. That said, papers do manage to carry debates about government errors including the timing of November\u2019s petrol price hike, rampant corruption, the Guardian Council disqualification of parliamentary candidates and the spiralling cost of housing. But the scale of the cover-up by the state, and the current outpouring of shamed regret by senior IRGC commanders, has given some media leeway to attack the catalogue of errors that led to the deaths of some many Iranians. Overseas ambassadors have also felt obliged to apologise over inaccurate information they gave in the wake of the incident. Additional reporting by Michael Safi",

Party dinosaurs \u2013 most trade unions, John Prescott, Jack Straw and others \u2013 forced Blair to drop it. PR was a fight too far with his party, so he threw away his chance to truly reshape politics and break the century of Tory hegemony. But now enlightenment has broken out among most of the candidates. Keir Starmer \u201cbelieves there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/03/keir-starmer-left-win-labour-leadership-members\" title=\"\">a case for electoral reform</a>, because of the millions of votes wasted every election in safe seats\u201d. He adds the proviso, \u201creform must ensure it protects the constituency link\u201d, and says he is up for discussion. Reviving the Jenkins plan fits his bill.</p> <p>Jess Phillips, who in the past <a href=\"https://www.makevotesmatter.org.uk/news/2020/1/7/labour-leadership-hopefuls-on-electoral-reform-what-we-know-so-far\" title=\"\">backed</a> Caroline Lucas\u2019s PR bill, takes the same line. She \u201cwould like electoral reform so seats reflect the votes cast\u201d while keeping MPs \u201crooted in communities\u201d. She adds this wise thought: electoral reform alone is \u201cnot a route for Labour out of its current political crisis\u201d. Quite right: Labour would have crashed badly this time under any system.</p> <p>Lisa Nandy is a longtime advocate of progressive alliances but is only \u201copen-minded\u201d on PR. Most backers of alliances see them as a temporary fix coming together to bring in PR.</p> <p>Rebecca Long-Bailey is, as ever, opaque. All her campaign says is that she is \u201cin favour of reviewing our electoral system as part of a wider package of constitutional reform that will be fleshed out in the course of the campaign\u201d. Disappointingly, Emily Thornberry, good in many ways, is the arch-anti-reformer. She was against the alternative vote in the 2011 referendum and strongly backs the current system. \u201c<a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2010/09/the-case-for-first-past-the-post/\" title=\"\">We are all equal with first past the post,</a>\u201d she claims. Which is perverse as it is plainly not so.</p> <p>Thanks to Lewis, electoral reform is now mainstream Labour, and is there to stay if Starmer, Phillips or Nandy wins. This matters not just for fairer elections, or even opening Westminster to new political forces. It matters right now, in opposition, as a flashing beacon that a newly open state of mind is welcoming others, freed from cabals and closed factions, with a more electable aura.</p> <p>Besides, the <a href=\"https://www.makevotesmatter.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Make Votes Matter</a> campaign reports that in the wake of the last election, three-quarters of Labour members <a href=\"https://www.makevotesmatter.org.uk/newsroom-2/2019/12/16/poll-three-quarters-of-labour-members-want-proportional-representation\" title=\"\">back PR</a>. Hardly surprising, after the left-of-centre and remainers won more votes than the Tories and the Brexiters last month. Labour\u2019s vote collapsed; the Tory vote didn\u2019t soar. The Green vote <a href=\"https://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/2019/12/13/green-party-piles-on-more-votes-than-any-other-party-in-climate-election/\" title=\"\">rose by 65%</a>, so close to a million people voted to get just one MP. It took an average of <a href=\"https://leftfootforward.org/2020/01/westminsters-political-system-pits-progressives-against-each-other-labours-next-leader-must-back-an-electoral-overhaul/\" title=\"\">51,000 people to elect a Labour MP</a>, only 38,000 for each Tory. When asked if they think seats won should match the votes cast, the public <a href=\"https://www.makevotesmatter.org.uk/public-on-reform\" title=\"\">backs PR</a> by 56%, claims Make Votes Matter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/clive-lewis-to-beat-tories-labour-has-to-work-with-other-progressives\">Clive Lewis: to beat Tories, Labour has to work with other progressives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All the tactical voting effort was \u201cfundamentally a failure\u201d, says the psephologist Peter Kellner. It won no seats, though it made some close-run. Always a weak attempt to circumvent a bad system, it failed, he says, because too many Liberal Democrat voters found Jeremy Corbyn \u201canathema\u201d, while Labour voters were deterred from vote-swapping by Jo Swinson\u2019s venomous attacks on their party.</p> <p>After the shocking lies told in both the alternative vote and the Brexit referendum campaigns, who wouldn\u2019t be wary of ever holding another public vote? Kellner suggests that Labour, if in power, could bring in the reform for one election, promising a referendum to confirm it once people had tried it.</p> <p>How remote that prospect seems. Even if Brexit and Boris Johnson do badly, Kellner thinks it unlikely that Labour can win outright next time. But if both Labour and Liberal Democrats had creditable leaders, he thinks that Labour might win 60 extra seats, the Liberal Democrats another 20 and, together with others, break the Tory majority. That needs the next Labour leader to follow those Clive Lewis themes on cooperation, pluralism, and progressive alliances.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Jess Phillips, who in the past backed Caroline Lucas\u2019s PR bill, takes the same line. She \u201cwould like electoral reform so seats reflect the votes cast\u201d while keeping MPs \u201crooted in communities\u201d. She adds this wise thought: electoral reform alone is \u201cnot a route for Labour out of its current political crisis\u201d. Quite right: Labour would have crashed badly this time under any system. Lisa Nandy is a longtime advocate of progressive alliances but is only \u201copen-minded\u201d on PR. Most backers of alliances see them as a temporary fix coming together to bring in PR. Rebecca Long-Bailey is, as ever, opaque. All her campaign says is that she is \u201cin favour of reviewing our electoral system as part of a wider package of constitutional reform that will be fleshed out in the course of the campaign\u201d. Disappointingly, Emily Thornberry, good in many ways, is the arch-anti-reformer. She was against the alternative vote in the 2011 referendum and strongly backs the current system. \u201cWe are all equal with first past the post,\u201d she claims. Which is perverse as it is plainly not so. Thanks to Lewis, electoral reform is now mainstream Labour, and is there to stay if Starmer, Phillips or Nandy wins. This matters not just for fairer elections, or even opening Westminster to new political forces. It matters right now, in opposition, as a flashing beacon that a newly open state of mind is welcoming others, freed from cabals and closed factions, with a more electable aura. Besides, the Make Votes Matter campaign reports that in the wake of the last election, three-quarters of Labour members back PR. Hardly surprising, after the left-of-centre and remainers won more votes than the Tories and the Brexiters last month. Labour\u2019s vote collapsed; the Tory vote didn\u2019t soar. The Green vote rose by 65%, so close to a million people voted to get just one MP. It took an average of 51,000 people to elect a Labour MP, only 38,000 for each Tory. When asked if they think seats won should match the votes cast, the public backs PR by 56%, claims Make Votes Matter. All the tactical voting effort was \u201cfundamentally a failure\u201d, says the psephologist Peter Kellner. It won no seats, though it made some close-run. Always a weak attempt to circumvent a bad system, it failed, he says, because too many Liberal Democrat voters found Jeremy Corbyn \u201canathema\u201d, while Labour voters were deterred from vote-swapping by Jo Swinson\u2019s venomous attacks on their party. After the shocking lies told in both the alternative vote and the Brexit referendum campaigns, who wouldn\u2019t be wary of ever holding another public vote? Kellner suggests that Labour, if in power, could bring in the reform for one election, promising a referendum to confirm it once people had tried it. How remote that prospect seems. Even if Brexit and Boris Johnson do badly, Kellner thinks it unlikely that Labour can win outright next time. But if both Labour and Liberal Democrats had creditable leaders, he thinks that Labour might win 60 extra seats, the Liberal Democrats another 20 and, together with others, break the Tory majority. That needs the next Labour leader to follow those Clive Lewis themes on cooperation, pluralism, and progressive alliances. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

Though I and most of my friends who have had abortions know this, I guess that\u2019s just anecdata. You can\u2019t trust women when they tell you that the main feeling was relief and that they didn\u2019t really want a load of counselling about adoption or to wait another few weeks. Still, a study conducted over five years across 21 states in the US has found that this is true. Of all the emotions that women were asked about \u2013 including sadness, guilt, regret, anger and happiness \u2013 it was relief that was the main one expressed.

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin has pulled off a significant diplomatic coup by arranging a mini-summit in Moscow between the two sides in Libya\u2019s long-running civil war. Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the leader of the Libyan National Army forces in the east, and Fayez al-Sarraj, the leader of the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, held eight hours of indirect talks rather than meeting face-to-face but the presence of the two sides in the Russian capital is a confirmation of Russia\u2019s increasingly important role in Libya. Divided European countries have failed to bring about an end to an increasingly bloody nine-month assault on Tripoli by Haftar. The Tripoli government led by al-Sarraj signed a truce deal, consolidating an agreement the two men separately made for a ceasefire over the weekend, but Haftar asked for further time to consult on the proposal. The ceasefire, demanded jointly by Moscow and Turkey last week, came into force on Sunday, but was sporadically broken. Sarraj had previously demanded that Haftar\u2019s troops withdraw to their positions before the start of their April offensive. A ceasefire is seen as a necessary precursor to wider talks. Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, will also be present at the Moscow meeting. If the two Libyan antagonists met face to face it would not be for the first time, but it would be the first direct meeting since Haftar launched his attack on Tripoli, which has been denounced by Sarraj as a war crime. The two men have previously met face to face in Abu Dhabi and in Paris to sign various peace agreements that have then fallen apart. Only last week Sarraj refused to go ahead with a planned meeting in Rome with the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, after he learned that Conte was also meeting Haftar. Sarraj finally went ahead with the Rome meeting on Saturday, but without Haftar. Russia has increased its leverage in Libya by allowing a small number of Russian mercenaries tied to the private Wagner Group to operate near Tripoli on behalf of Haftar. Putin insists if any Russian troops are operating they do not have his sanction. The diplomatic jockeying between Europe, Turkey and Russia over Libya is significant since the country credited with finally bringing peace to Libya is likely to benefit in terms of diplomatic prestige and even future contracts. Although Libya and Syria are very different cases, there are some parallels with the way an uneasy alliance of Turkey, Russia and Iran grabbed hold of the political negotiations in Syria, wresting the initiative from the US, Europe and the UN. It is not yet clear if Putin is trying to push Europe out of the peacemaking process, or is willing to work in conjunction with European nations. Putin met the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, at the weekend in Russia. Berlin has been due to hold a peace conference with the main interested parties and the array of external actors.

Conte has come under ferocious domestic criticism for mishandling the crisis, and for being seen as irrelevant. He is due to meet Erdo\u011fan on Monday. Separately the new European commission has been seeking to take a more active role. The EU council president, Charles Michel, on Sunday went to Cairo to talk to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, one of the strongest backers of Haftar. The new commission, anxious that the US is pulling back in the Middle East, is desperate not to leave a western void filled by Turkey and Russia. Turkey appears to have bought itself some leverage in the future of Libya talks by announcing it is prepared to send troops there to help up prop up Sarraj\u2019s Government of National Accord (GNA). Military figures in the GNA claim as many as 500 Russian mercenaries have been operating in southern Tripoli, and there were signs that they were being pulled back from the frontlines at the weekend. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to Putin on Monday to tell him he supported a ceasefire that was \u201ccredible, durable and verifiable\u201d.",

Born in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, the son of Victor Smee, a greengrocer, and Leila (nee Harrod), a nurse, he was one of the big beneficiaries of a post-1945 welfare state that he greatly valued. A peripatetic childhood led him to the Royal Grammar school in Guildford and an economics degree at the London School of Economics. There, in the early 1960s, an American tutor encouraged him to take an MBA at a time when the UK had not developed such courses; Clive chose to do so at the University of Indiana. He worked for the British Council in Nigeria (1966-68) during the civil war there, before returning to the UK and starting with the civil service as an economics adviser at the Overseas Development Ministry. A travelling fellowship to the US and Canada was followed in the early 80s by a spell first as an adviser on the Central Policy Review Staff at No 10 Downing Street \u2013 the first proper central government policy unit, which gave him his first encounters with Margaret Thatcher \u2013 and then as a senior adviser at the Treasury. Those early experiences at the centre of government helped Smee to understand how to build the bridges that are needed if the findings of research and analysis are to become policy action. After he became chief economic adviser at the DHSS in 1984, successive prime ministers \u2013 Thatcher, John Major and Blair \u2013 much valued him in that role over the next 18 years, as did most health secretaries across the political divide. Virginia Bottomley (now Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone), the Conservative health secretary during the 90s, said he was \u201cas good as they come: a man of total integrity and ability, and I always wanted him there even when some of the policy officials were a bit obstructive to him being at so many meetings\u201d. Alan Milburn, who was in charge of health for Labour between 1999 and 2003, said Smee provided much of the evidence for the huge commitments in the NHS Plan of 2000 and \u201cwas very much part of the reset of health policy post-1997\u201d.

If we\u2019re to have good government here, it has to be one which delivers in terms of people\u2019s rights and one which delivers progressive politics but also has to be one which can actually deliver good public services and if we don\u2019t have the finances then the government can\u2019t function properly.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson has falsely claimed that there will be no checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland under his plans for Northern Ireland to remain in the single market after Brexit.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/13/labour-leadership-nomination-deadline-means-thornberry-and-lewis-risk-elimination-from-contest-at-230pm-live-news?page=with:block-5e1c6c068f087e8308e6d673#block-5e1c6c068f087e8308e6d673\">2.06pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Peers have started debating the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill.</strong> In her speech <strong>Lady Hayter,</strong> the Labour leader in the Lords, criticised the pace at which it was being \u201crammed\u201d through parliament.

Instead, invoking Barbara Castle, Nandy urged Labour members to be \u201cbrave\u201d and to choose her. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Barbara Castle once said, \u201cin politics, guts is all\u201d. It\u2019s in that spirit I want to talk about the leadership that is needed at this moment. The empathy, stamina and moral courage that has driven big, deep lasting change in this country over 100 years.</p> <p>These have been a bruising few years and a shattering defeat. But now is not the time to steady the ship or play it safe. If we do not change course we will die and we will deserve to. This is the moment when we up our game and recover our ambition.</p> <p>So I am asking you to make the brave, not the easy choice, in this leadership contest.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nandy was speaking in Dagenham, which is associated with Castle because it was the site of the Ford machinists strike that led to Castle passing the Equal Pay act in 1970. Nandy would be a \u201cbrave\u201d choice for Labour leader because she is relatively young (40) and relatively inexperienced (her shadow cabinet career lasted just a few months). In this passage, and elsewhere in the speech, she does not name Keir Starmer, but the line about needing to change course, not \u201csteady the ship\u201d, is a direct rejection of what Starmer said in a Guardian interview just after the election when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/keir-starmer-labour-leadership-pitch-radical-government\">he said it was \u201cimportant not to oversteer\u201d.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f542a11f1cfb058b212aa27e08d800f62c22a2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f542a11f1cfb058b212aa27e08d800f62c22a2c/0_69_2872_1723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Castle - cited by Lisa Nandy today as a role model.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara Castle - cited by Lisa Nandy today as a role model.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Barham/Daily Mail /REX</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1c9a498f0852212f74d3f1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-13T16:43:09.214Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the House of Lords peers have started debating the second reading of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. The debate is due to run until about 10pm, and there is a list of speakers <a href=\"https://www.lordswhips.org.uk/todays-lists\">here,</a> but no vote is expected because peers normally let bills through at second reading without a divison.</p> <p>In the debate <strong>Gavin Barwell</strong>, who was Theresa May\u2019s chief of staff when she was prime minister, has just delivered his maiden speech as a peer. He said that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was \u201cin large part\u201d Theresa May\u2019s deal. But he also suggested that Johnson was making a mistake in ruling out an extension to the post-Brexit transition. He told peers:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I understand why the government does not want to extend the negotiating period. But there simply isn\u2019t time to negotiate the entire future relationship, have it ratified by national parliaments, and for business to prepare to implement it in 11 months ... The main risk is not no deal, it is a very basic, initial deal. And it is in our interests for everything to be decided in one go because the moment that that is no longer the case, we risk getting into a repeat of the divorce negotiations, where the EU ensured its three priorities were dealt with first. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b1e111153e708daf666d279679a3c6e7c0cf1be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b1e111153e708daf666d279679a3c6e7c0cf1be/21_0_607_364/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gavin Barwell.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gavin Barwell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: House of Lords</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1c96968f088d80a182a220\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-13T16:15:01.531Z\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From Sky\u2019s <strong>Tom Rayner</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RaynerSkyNews/status/1216740646125547520\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">199 nominations cast in labour leadership first round out of a possible 212 (202 MPs/10 MEPs).

Before that her staff were all dealing with constituency work, she says.</p> <p>She says the way you end up in magazines is \u201cbeing a bit interesting\u201d.

This isn\u2019t about triangulating on our policies - it is about saying you have got a political system that is stacked against you.</p> <p>Why do you keep playing by the rules with both your hands tied behind your back?

It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So far, Mr Lewis has done more than the other candidates to advance an analysis of Labour\u2019s problems that goes beyond weaknesses of the manifesto, the leadership and Brexit to address the UK\u2019s political system as a whole. On Sunday he <a href=\"https://www.cliveforleader.com/manifesto/\">launched a manifesto</a> that included proposals for the democratisation of the BBC and a new body to represent women and girls, as well as plans for devolution, the abolition of the House of Lords and introduction of a proportional voting system (the latter is also supported by Ms Phillips, with the other candidates <a href=\"https://www.makevotesmatter.org.uk/news/2020/1/7/labour-leadership-hopefuls-on-electoral-reform-what-we-know-so-far\">so far undecided</a>).</p> <p>A diverse field of candidates and ideas is important, which is why we hope that both Mr Lewis and Ms Thornberry will make it to the next round. In the past, hostility to electoral reform has come from the right and left of the party. Even now, it is unlikely to be the first priority of an opposition facing so many challenges. Nor is it the only policy area in which intellectual work, as well as the community organising that several leadership contenders have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/03/lisa-nandy-enters-labour-leadership-race-with-call-for-change\">described as a priority</a>, is needed. But the problems with first past the post, including the way it perpetuates a Labour-Tory duopoly, shuts out smaller parties and rewards nationalist ones (because votes piled up in one area are easier to convert into seats than those that are thinly spread) can no longer be ignored.</p> </blockquote> <p>Obviously Guardian leaders are always right although, sadly, history shows that a Guardian endorsement does not always guarantee electoral success.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, visit Belfast for talks with the first minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill.

The EU\u2019s trade commissioner has suggested there could be a last-minute trade-off with Brussels offering the City of London access to European markets in return for European fleets retaining their fishing rights in British waters. Boris Johnson has refused to confirm reports that the UK government will contribute up to \u00a32bn to improve public services in Northern Ireland now that power-sharing has been restored. On a visit to Stormont, he said the UK government would support the new executive financially, but he refused to put a figure on it. (See 2.06pm.) Conor Murphy, the finance minister, said Johnson needed to be more specific. Murphy said: They need to ante up basically, we had the political agreement which got the parties into the executive again, the document that was produced was the two governments\u2019 document, promises of significant investment in services here was their promises, significant investment in infrastructure was their promise, so we have now costed most of that, I have put the figures directly to Boris Johnson this morning, I am going to put them to Julian Smith later on this afternoon and we\u2019ll be in touch with the Treasury as well, I hope before the week is out to talk to the minister for finance in Dublin as well. My primary focus in the next days ahead is to secure the finances that are necessary. If we\u2019re to have good government here, it has to be one which delivers in terms of people\u2019s rights and one which delivers progressive politics but also has to be one which can actually deliver good public services and if we don\u2019t have the finances then the government can\u2019t function properly. Johnson has falsely claimed that there will be no checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland under his plans for Northern Ireland to remain in the single market after Brexit. (See 2.06pm.) Peers have started debating the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. In her speech Lady Hayter, the Labour leader in the Lords, criticised the pace at which it was being \u201crammed\u201d through parliament. She said: This is both stupid because it will mean corrections having to be made later but also arrogant with scant regard to our normal democratic method of law-making. Washington is \u201cpoised\u201d to sign a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK, MPs have been told. Speaking in the Queen\u2019s speech debate Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said: We\u2019re making good progress in paving the way for our first round of future free trade agreements with the rest of the world and when I was out in the US, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told me in Washington that the US is poised at the doorstep pen in hand ready to sign a deal. And a free trade deal with the US would boost businesses, it would create jobs, it would reduce the cost of living and expand consumer choice on both sides of the Atlantic. So there is a huge opportunity for a win-win deal. Lisa Nandy has claimed voters in the general election found the prospect of a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn \u201cfrightening\u201d, and said the party under her leadership would remain radical but try to persuade people it would be careful with their money. Jess Phillips, the Labour leadership candidate, has strongly criticised Scottish nationalism. Speaking ahead of a visit to Scotland tomorrow she said: The idea that the answer to the UK leaving a union with our most important trading partner is for Scotland to leave a union with her most important trading partner only makes sense if you\u2019re a nationalist. Nicola Sturgeon wants to talk to me about threats to Scotland - the SNP\u2019s abject failings on education and health show that it is her administration that remains a threat to opportunity and equality for working people in Scotland. Keir Starmer, the Labour leadership frontrunner, has branded a decision by police to include Extinction Rebellion on a list of extreme ideologies as \u201ccompletely wrong and counterproductive\u201d. The dispute over the arrest of Britain\u2019s ambassador to Tehran has escalated as the Foreign Office summoned the Iranian ambassador in order to protest about the episode. Boris Johnson has hired David Cameron\u2019s former personal photographer as a special adviser, it is understood. As the Press Association reports, Andrew Parsons was taken off the public payroll when a political storm erupted after it was disclosed he was being paid by the taxpayer in 2010. He will re-enter Downing Street in a role that will see him focus on modernising Number 10\u2019s digital and video output, PA understands. Special advisers are temporary civil servants and their salaries are paid by the taxpayer. Parsons toured the country with the PM during the general election campaign, officially taking photographs for the Conservative Party but he also sold his images to media outlets. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. From Business Insider\u2019s Adam Payne This transition period stuff is catching. The Queen has just released a read-out of her talks at Sandringham about Harry and Meghan and it turns out that their breakaway is also going to involve a transition period. Doubtless there will be calls for it to get extended too. As my colleague Peter Walker reports in his story, Lisa Nandy\u2019s speech this afternoon did not contain much in the way of policy. Instead, invoking Barbara Castle, Nandy urged Labour members to be \u201cbrave\u201d and to choose her. She said: Barbara Castle once said, \u201cin politics, guts is all\u201d. It\u2019s in that spirit I want to talk about the leadership that is needed at this moment. The empathy, stamina and moral courage that has driven big, deep lasting change in this country over 100 years. These have been a bruising few years and a shattering defeat. But now is not the time to steady the ship or play it safe. If we do not change course we will die and we will deserve to. This is the moment when we up our game and recover our ambition. So I am asking you to make the brave, not the easy choice, in this leadership contest. Nandy was speaking in Dagenham, which is associated with Castle because it was the site of the Ford machinists strike that led to Castle passing the Equal Pay act in 1970. Nandy would be a \u201cbrave\u201d choice for Labour leader because she is relatively young (40) and relatively inexperienced (her shadow cabinet career lasted just a few months). In this passage, and elsewhere in the speech, she does not name Keir Starmer, but the line about needing to change course, not \u201csteady the ship\u201d, is a direct rejection of what Starmer said in a Guardian interview just after the election when he said it was \u201cimportant not to oversteer\u201d. In the House of Lords peers have started debating the second reading of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. The debate is due to run until about 10pm, and there is a list of speakers here, but no vote is expected because peers normally let bills through at second reading without a divison. In the debate Gavin Barwell, who was Theresa May\u2019s chief of staff when she was prime minister, has just delivered his maiden speech as a peer. He said that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was \u201cin large part\u201d Theresa May\u2019s deal. But he also suggested that Johnson was making a mistake in ruling out an extension to the post-Brexit transition. He told peers: I understand why the government does not want to extend the negotiating period. But there simply isn\u2019t time to negotiate the entire future relationship, have it ratified by national parliaments, and for business to prepare to implement it in 11 months ... The main risk is not no deal, it is a very basic, initial deal. And it is in our interests for everything to be decided in one go because the moment that that is no longer the case, we risk getting into a repeat of the divorce negotiations, where the EU ensured its three priorities were dealt with first. From Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner From Euronews\u2019 Darren McCaffrey From the Scotsman I\u2019ve corrected a couple of posts earlier because they wrongly said that Labour candidates needed nominations from 10% of CLPs to pass the CLP nomination threshold, when in fact the figure is 5%. (See 2.54pm.) I\u2019m sorry about that. Lisa Nandy has asked Labour members to \u201cmake the brave, not the easy choice\u201d and select her to replace Jeremy Corbyn, using a speech to set out her vision of how to restore the party\u2019s fortunes in communities across the UK, my colleague Peter Walker reports. In response to a comment BTL, I have amended the earlier post about Boris Johnson\u2019s Stormont press conference because it is more accurate to say that his comments about the NI/GB trading rules that will be in place after Brexit were not just misleading but untrue. (See 2.06pm.) Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, has a good Twitter thread explaining why. It starts here. And here are some of his conclusions. And here are the final figures for nominations for deputy leader. In two cases they also vary slightly from the figures quoted earlier. (See 2.54pm.) Angela Rayner (88) Ian Murray (34) Dawn Butler (29) Rosena Allin-Khan (23) Richard Burgon (22) The Labour party website has now updated its tally of nominations for leadership candidates from MPs. Here are the latest figures, which in three cases vary slightly from the ones quoted earlier. (See 2.54pm.) Sir Keir Starmer (89) Rebecca Long-Bailey (33) Lisa Nandy (31) Jess Phillips (23) Emily Thornberry (23) The deadline has now passed for MPs and MEPs to nominate candidates for the Labour leadership and deputy leadership. Here are the five leadership candidates still in the contest. Sir Keir Starmer (86 nominations) Rebecca Long-Bailey (33) Lisa Nandy (30) Jess Phillips (23) Emily Thornberry (22) The figures for nominations are taken from the official Labour website tally, except for Thornberry\u2019s number, because her final nomination (see 2.25pm) is not on the website yet. And here are the five deputy leadership candidates still in the contest. Angela Rayner (85) Ian Murray (34) Dawn Butler (28) Rosenal Allin-Khan (23) Richard Burgon (22) To get on the final ballot for members, candidate have to clear another hurdle. They must either get nominations from 5% of constituency Labour parties (ie, 33 of them), or get nominations from at least three affiliate organisations, of which at least two must be unions), collectively comprising at least 5% of the affiliate vote. There are 12 unions and 19 socialist societies affiliated to Labour, but in practice it would be hard to clear the affiliate hurdle without the support of one of the big unions. This official Labour briefing paper (pdf) sets out how CLPs are meant to run the meetings deciding who they will nominate. Members vote by AV (the alternative vote). The CLP/affiliate nomination process opens this Wednesday and runs for a month, closing on Friday 14 February. It is likely several of the candidates will fail to get the nominations they need. UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected this posted to say that the threshold is 5% of CLPs, not 10% as it wrongly said earlier. From Dawn Butler, who passed the threshold to remain in the contest for the Labour deputy leadership earlier More from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh on the nomination that carried Emily Thornberry through to the next stage of the Labour leadership contest. @Afzal4Gorton is Afzal Khan, the MP for Manchester Gorton. According to HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh, Emily Thornberry has got the final nomination she needs to make it through to the next stage of the Labour leadership contest. According to the latest Labour party tally, Emily Thornberry is now only one nomination away from reaching the 22 target she needs to remain in the leadership contest. The figures also confirm that Richard Burgon, Rosen Allin-Khan and Dawn Butler have all hit the 22 target - meaning there are five candidates for deputy leader. The other two being Angela Rayner and Ian Murray. To make it onto the final ballot, candidates for the leadership or the deputy leadership also need to clear another hurdle by getting either nominations from 5% of CLPs - 33 of them - or nominations from 5% of the affiliate vote or trade unions. Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, has posted this on Twitter about his meeting with Boris Johnson. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference earlier. The prime minister claimed there would be no checks on goods going from NI to GB and only minimal checks on goods going the other way under his plan for a post-Brexit alternative to the backstop. He said: Be in no doubt. We are the government of the United Kingdom. I cannot see any circumstances whatever in which they will be any need for checks on goods going from Northern Ireland to GB. The only circumstances in which you could imagine the need for checks coming from GB to NI, as I\u2019ve explained before, is if those goods were going on into Ireland and we had not secured, which I hope and I\u2019m confident we will, a zero tariff, zero quota agreement with our friends and partners in the EU. And, furthermore, I would remind you that the arrangements that we have put in place under the Northern Ireland protocol automatically evaporate after four years unless the assembly of Northern, the government of Northern Ireland, decides that they want to protract them. So there are plenty of protections for Northern Irish business, farmers and others. This is untrue. As John Campbell, BBC Northern Ireland\u2019s business and economics editor points out, Johnson is wrong to say that a zero tariff free trade deal would obviate the need for checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland under his plan, which would effectively put a customs barrier down the Irish Sea. And, as Newsnight\u2019s Ben Chu reports, what Johnson was saying about there being no checks on items going from NI to GB depends on a narrow definition of checks. Given that exit summary declarations will have to be filled in, it is assumed that someone will \u201ccheck\u201d that this is happening. Johnson defended the UK government\u2019s decision to press ahead with legislation for a body to investigate killings that occurred during the Troubles. This plan was set out in the 2014 Stormont House agreement, and the deal agreed last week says the UK government will \u201cwithin 100 days, publish and introduce legislation in the UK parliament\u201d. Some Tories are concerned about the prospect of veterans being investigated, but when asked about this, Johnson said: I think that the parties here who have revived Stormont have done a very good job at finding a balance between giving people who are in search of the truth the confidence that they need, but also in giving people who have served our country in the armed services the confidence and certainty that they need. And we will certainly be going forward as a UK government with our manifesto commitment to ensure that there are no further unfair prosecutions for people who have served their country when there is no new evidence to be brought forward. I think that is the right balance to be struck. Johnson said the UK government would support the new power-sharing executive financially, but he refused to confirm that this would amount to a package worth \u00a32bn. Asked about this, he said: We are, in the UK government, making huge commitments which will be passed through, obviously, the Barnett consequentials, to Northern Ireland in healthcare. I have heard the arguments made to me this morning. We are listening very carefully and we will certainly do everything we can to support. He mocked Tony Blair\u2019s soundbite from the Good Friday agreement, saying he saw the \u201chand of the future\u201d beckoning. He said: Never mind the hand of history on my shoulder. I see the hand of the future beckoning us all forward, and I hope that with good will and compromise and hard work on all sides it will be a very bright future indeed. Clive Lewis has withdrawn from the Labour leadership contest. He says he pulled so that MPs who had nominated him could nominate someone else in the 40 minutes before nominations close. Given that he only has five nominations, however, even if all of them were to back Emily Thornberry before 2.30pm, on their own they would not get her over the line. In a statement Lewis said: For me, this election wasn\u2019t about just the leadership of the Labour party but about our survival as an engaging and relevant political movement that could win a path to power. At this stage, it\u2019s clear that I won\u2019t get on the ballot. So, I\u2019m standing aside in the spirit of pluralism, diversity and generosity that I\u2019ve promoted throughout this campaign, so that those who have supported me can recast their nominations. Whilst I\u2019m disappointed not to have progressed further, I\u2019m proud to have led the debate on key issues such as progressive alliances, electoral reform, democracy in our country, democracy within the Labour party, racism and diversity, and the climate crisis. These issues aren\u2019t going away and given the scale of our last defeat, need to tackled head on with sharp ideas and credible strategy so we can win the next election for the millions of people who deserve a Labour government. The Financial Times\u2019 Jim Pickard says Richard Burgon has now got the 22 nominations needed to move on to the next stage of the contest to be Labour\u2019s deputy leader. Rosena Allin-Khan has also secured the 22 nominations she needs to get to the next stage of the contest for the Labour deputy leadership, the Independent\u2019s Lizzy Buchan reports. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom Boris Johnson is due to hold another press conference in Belfast early this afternoon, alongside Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach or Irish PM. From Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn Asked about the plan for the UK government to legislate to address issues relating to the legacy of the Troubles, Johnson says the parties who have revived Stormont have done a good job of finding a balance between allowing people to find the truth, and giving people confidence that there won\u2019t be unfair prosecutions of veterans. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. I will post a summary soon. Asked if was in Belfast for a photo opportunity, Johnson says that is a bit harsh. He says he is here to show how strongly he will support leaders in Northern Ireland. Asked about the RHI scandal (the \u201ccash for ash\u201d scandal), Johnson says it is vital that public spending in Northern Ireland is properly invigilated. He says he leads a government for the UK. He can see no circumstances whatever in which there will be a need for checks going from NI to GB. And there would only be checks on goods going from GB to NI if they were destined for Ireland, and if the government had failed to negotiate a zero-tariff trade deals. And the assembly would be free after four years to vote to end those arrangements, he says. Johnson says Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, has a \u201cbright future\u201d. He thanks everyone who has contributed to the restoration of Stormont. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: How much will Westminster contribute? And should politicians here do their bit by raising rates? Johnson says he has heard the points made by politicians. Westminster will be supportive. But it is about politicians being accountable. Johnson says there has been a conversation about funding. Will the UK government be supportive? Of course it will, he says. But he says this is not just about money. It is about leadership too, he says. He says circumstances are \u201cvery, very promising\u201d for Northern Ireland. It attracts the most inward investment, and the most tech investment, he says. He says he heard \u201cwonderful\u201d infrastructure proposals discussed this morning. (See 12.42am.) But education and tech are important too, he says. Never mind the \u201chand of history\u201d, Johnson says. He says he sees the \u201chand of the future\u201d beckoning. Boris Johnson is speaking now at Stormont. He says this is a good day for the people of Northern Ireland and that he has had good conversations with the first minister and deputy first minister. He pays tribute to the politicians for being willing to compromise. And he thanks \u201cSOSNI\u201d - the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith. Barry Gardiner nominated Dawn Butler for the Labour deputy leadership to help to ensure that she can go on to the next stage of the contest, he says - even though he will be voting for Angela Rayner. According to the BBC, reports that Butler has hit the 22 threshold have been confirmed. (See 12.35pm.) That means Rayner, Butler and Ian Murray are all through. From Nichola Mallon, the SDLP minister for infrastructure in the power-sharing executive Boris Johnson is due to speak to the media at Stormont shortly. This is from ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen, who is referring to the appalling weather in Belfast today. Dawn Butler has now got the 22 nominations she needs to get through to the next round of the contest for the Labour deputy leadership, a source in one of the other camps is claiming. This has not been confirmed by the Butler camp yet. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and favourite in the Labour leadership contest, has released the text of the letter he has sent to Labour HQ asking it to hold hustings in all regions of Britain. This is from the politics academic Stuart Wilks-Heeg on the locations chosen for the Labour leadership hustings. (See 10.48am.) ITV\u2019s Paul Brand has the latest numbers for Labour nominations. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband is backing Keir Starmer for leader, and Angela Rayner for deputy. Boris Johnson is due to meet Leo Varadkar, his Irish opposite number, in Belfast today. They will be speaking about the resumption of power-sharing in Northern Ireland, based on the New Decade, New Approach agenda published at the end of next week (you can read the 62-page text of it here), but there will be no escaping the shadow of Brexit. Johnson is peddling the line that he will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d this month because the UK will leave the EU at the end of January. But of course Brexit will be far from over, because the UK and the EU will then have to negotiate a new trade relationship. A report on this from the Institute for Government argues that \u201cBrexit will not be \u2018done\u2019 in 2020\u201d because \u201cit will continue to dominate government for years to come\u201d. And, according to a report in the Irish Independent, Varadkar himself has been telling his party that are are only at half-time in the process. It says: Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is poised to call an early election this week in a bid to capitalise on the success of Brexit negotiations ... The taoiseach emphasised the importance of Brexit to the campaign when he addressed a private Fine Gael meeting on Friday, saying it\u2019s only \u201chalf-time\u201d in the process. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re about 1-0 up\u201d and it\u2019s \u201cdefinitely not the time to switch the team\u201d. PA Media has snapped this from this morning\u2019s Downing Street lobby briefing. Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK has been summoned by the Foreign Office in response to the \u201cunacceptable\u201d arrest of the British ambassador in Tehran, Downing Street said. From the BBC\u2019s Darran Marshall Boris Johnson has arrived at Stormont for talks with Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, and Michelle O\u2019Neill, the deputy first minister. Phillips says she wants universal, free childcare. (There are more details in our overnight story, and an an article Phillips has written for today\u2019s Daily Mirror.) James O\u2019Brien pick her up on the word universal. He says Phillips is saying that because she does not want to call herself a socialist. Phillips says that\u2019s wrong. She says she has always called herself a socialist. Q: If you don\u2019t win, who would you like to see as leader? Phillips says she thinks Labour should have a woman as a leader. She says she would like to see Lisa Nandy as leader if it could not be her. And that\u2019s it. Phillips says she has received death threats and been scared by those. But she says she tries to respond to threats by using them to fuel her determination. She says nothing in her career was as bad as hearing about the death of Jo Cox. After that her children said they did not want her to carry on, she says. A caller asks how Phillips managed to attract so much media attention before the general election, including coverage in the Sunday Times. James O\u2019Brien says there is an accusation that she is the Murdoch candidate. Phillips says she only took on staff to deal with her media last week. Before that her staff were all dealing with constituency work, she says. She says the way you end up in magazines is \u201cbeing a bit interesting\u201d. She used to turn down nine out of 10 interview bids, she says. And she says she also wrote a book. It included a whole chapter criticising Rupert Murdoch. Yet she still ended up being featured by the Sunday Times, she says. Q: To what extent should politicians be engaging with the media? Phillips says the Sun is the best-read newspaper. She says, if you are not going to engage with it, you need another way of reaching people. She says she worked with the Sun, before her election as an MP and afterwards, on behalf of Women\u2019s Aid to highlight domestic violence issues. She says this campaign helped to change the way. But she says she would not want to be so cosy with the Sun as to be unable to criticise Murdoch. Q: Corbyn probably thought you should not give interviews to the Murdoch press? Phillips says that is probably correct. But she says you have to deal with the world as it is. Q: Will you keep on Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s director of communications and strategy, if you become leader? Phillips says Milne would probably not want to stay if she were leader. Q: But if he does? Phillips says she thinks she \u201cwould struggle\u201d with that concept. But she says he is a Labour party employee. You have to obey employment law, she says. But she says you can always make sure employees are subject to appraisals. Q: Who do you want as your deputy leader? Phillips says Ian Murray has \u201cone of the most credible cases\u201d to be deputy leader. But she says she would not rule anyone out for the job. She says Murray has twice been the only Labour MP to get elected in Scotland. That is a tribute to his skills as a campaigner, she says. Q: Were you tempted to follow Luciana Berger and leave the Labour party? Phillips replies: On many occasions I felt quite tempted. She says the Berger episode shook her. But she says watching the Panorama documentary on Labour\u2019s handling of antisemitism disturbed her the most. It showed brave members of the Labour party staff being hounded over this issue, she says. Q: So why did you not leave? Phillips says it was more important to stay, and to try to change things. She says any comparison of Israel to the Holocaust is unacceptable. Jess Phillips, one of the four Labour leadership candidates who has got enough nominations from MPs and MEPs to move on to the next stage, has just started a phone-in on LBC. James O\u2019Brien is presenting. He asks if there was ever a moment in politics when she thought: \u201cBlimey, this is bonkers.\u201d Phillips says she was surprised recently when a woman cried because she was so surprised to meet Phillips in the flesh. But she says she was really surprised by the attention she received for a speech in the Commons saying she did not realise how posh some people really were before she became an MP. (That was the \u2018I thought posh was eating olives\u2019 speech.) Phillips is now taking questions from callers. Q: How have you demonstrated leadership in dealing with antisemitism? Phillips says at every stage she has worked with other MPs, including Jewish MPs, to issue demands to the national executive committee as to how it should be dealing with this. She has done this in public and in private, she says. She has been pushing for rule changes for years, she says. According to a report in the Times (paywall), Boris Johnson may commit to a funding package worth up to \u00a32bn to held the new power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland to address the problems facing public services in the region. But Edwin Poots, a DUP agriculture minister in the executive, said this morning the money could come with \u201cstrings attached\u201d, potentially by way of a commitment from the executive to raise extra revenue through the introduction of water charges or a hike in rates bills. Poots told Radio Ulster\u2019s Nolan Show: I was with Julian Smith [the Northern Ireland secretary during the talks leading up to the resumption of power-sharing] and he didn\u2019t want to be tied down to a particular figure but we were working off identified needs and they were seeking to ascertain what it was actually going to take to meet those identified needs. He said he didn\u2019t want to make any promise on a figure and I said all you have to say is \u2018billions\u2019 and, of course, that would be at least two billion. I would hope those are the ball parks we are in, that we are actually looking at billions of pounds over the course of the next number of years. They may well come with some strings attached to it. So, for example, and I don\u2019t know this, but I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if they do press us to raise rates at a higher level and we do something in terms of water rates and all of that - those may be pressures that are applied by the Treasury and we will have to wait and see if that is the case. But Michelle O\u2019Neill, the Sinn F\u00e9in deputy first minister, has ruled out water charges. According to Lisa Nandy\u2019s team, the Barnsley Central MP Dan Jarvis will be nominating her today. At one stage Jarvis was considering standing as a candidate himself. Yesterday the Labour party announced the dates and venues for the seven official party hustings. Here is the list: Saturday 18 January - Liverpool Saturday 25 January - Durham Saturday 1 February - Bristol Sunday 2 February - Cardiff Sunday 9 February - Birmingham Saturday 15 February - Glasgow Sunday 16 February - London Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the contest, has said that he will ask Labour to reconsider because the south east, the east of England and Yorkshire have been left out. And Lisa Nandy says the party should be holding hustings in seats it lost. The Labour MP Catherine West, who is backing Emily Thornberry for the party leadership, told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics that she thought Thornberry would be the best candidate at bringing \u201cguerilla warfare\u201d to the government in the House of Commons. West also dismissed suggestions that Thornberry, a London lawyer, would fail to appeal to Labour supporters in the north. Asked about this, West replied: I think she will [relate to these voters] because in the end what we need to do is to win the government back, and somebody who is effective, and who can pummel the government, and who can point out their weaknesses \u2013 let\u2019s not forget, when she was shadow foreign secretary that was when [Boris] Johnson appeared at his weakest ... and that\u2019s actually an element of what you need to do in opposition. Britain\u2019s economy contracted in November, amid uncertainty over the general election, my colleague Graeme Wearden reports. He says: UK GDP shrank by 0.3% during the month, a sharper contraction than economists expected, with manufacturers and services companies both struggling. The service sector shrank by 0.3% during the month, according to the Office for National Statistics, while manufacturing output fell by an alarming 1.7%. But... the economy actually grew by 0.1% in the September-November quarter, which is better than expected. Graeme has all the details on his business live blog. In an interview with Radio 5 Live this morning Priti Patel, the home secretary, said she did not think that the Duchess of Sussex had been subject to racist press coverage in the UK. Asked if she thought Meghan had received racist coverage, Patel said: I\u2019m not in that category at all where I believe there\u2019s racism at all. I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity, where people of any background can get on in life. Asked if the media had been in any way racist, Patel replied: I don\u2019t think so, no ... I certainly haven\u2019t seen that through any debates or commentary or things of that nature. As my colleague Peter Walker reports, Patel also defended anti-terror police for putting the Extinction Rebellion environmental protest group on a list of extremist ideologies. Arlene Foster, who resumed her role as first minister of Northern Ireland when the assembly started sitting again at the weekend, told the Today programme this morning that she would be telling Boris Johnson that Stormont needs more money for public services when they meet later this morning. Asked who much Northern Ireland needed, she explained: It\u2019s a composite figure. There\u2019s a need to make sure that we have the resources, resources not just for one year but over a number of years so that we don\u2019t face a cliff edge in another year. But as well as that, we need to have capital investment. We have a huge hole in our infrastructure, particularly in our water infrastructure which we need to fix. It\u2019s a package that will have to be capital and resource, and I think the prime minister is very much aware of what we need. Asked whether the figure being asked for was up to \u00a32bn, the DUP leader said she was \u201cnot going to put a figure on it because I think it is important that we get the right figure\u201d. Foster also said that she would be asking Johnson to explain how Northern Ireland would continue to enjoy \u201cunfettered access\u201d to the GB market after Brexit under the plan negotiated by Johnson to keep Northern Ireland in the single market. She said: The prime minister has been saying very clearly that he will ensure that there is unfettered access. I want to hear from him today how he\u2019s going to do that and how the regulations that are coming forward are going to make sure that there aren\u2019t any barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, because the rest of the United Kingdom, Great Britain, is our biggest market, both in terms of what we send to them but also what they send to us. Good morning. Today we hit the first deadline in the Labour leadership contest and at 2.30pm two leadership candidates, Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis, and three deputy leadership candidates, Richard Burgon, Rosena Allin-Khan and Dawn Butler, will find out whether or they have been able to reach the 22 nomination threshold, or whether they will have to drop out from the contest. In the leadership contest, according to the official Labour party tally, Thornberry is on 10 and Lewis is on four. But Thornberry has not nominated herself yet, and so 11 is a more accurate figure. The four leadership candidates who have already got the nominations they need, and who are on to the next stage of the process, are: Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips. And in the deputy leadership contest, according to the official tally, Burgon is on 18, Allin-Khan is on 17 and Butler is on 15. Two candidates are already through: Angela Rayner and Ian Murray. On the Today programme this morning Clive Lewis said he had faith that his colleagues would help him out. He said: I\u2019ve got faith in my colleagues. I think they have heard what I have put forward this week. I think they have heard the radical nature of what I\u2019m saying. I understand it is difficult because I am talking about things which are hard for people to hear. This isn\u2019t about triangulating on our policies - it is about saying you have got a political system that is stacked against you. Why do you keep playing by the rules with both your hands tied behind your back? Change the rules. Lewis was referring to his support for proportional representation (PR). This morning Lewis gets a boost from the Guardian, which has published a leader saying that we hope both Lewis and Thornberry get through to the next round and that Lewis has done more than any other candidate to advance an analysis of Labour\u2019s problems addressing defects with the UK\u2019s political system as a whole. It says: So far, Mr Lewis has done more than the other candidates to advance an analysis of Labour\u2019s problems that goes beyond weaknesses of the manifesto, the leadership and Brexit to address the UK\u2019s political system as a whole. On Sunday he launched a manifesto that included proposals for the democratisation of the BBC and a new body to represent women and girls, as well as plans for devolution, the abolition of the House of Lords and introduction of a proportional voting system (the latter is also supported by Ms Phillips, with the other candidates so far undecided). A diverse field of candidates and ideas is important, which is why we hope that both Mr Lewis and Ms Thornberry will make it to the next round. In the past, hostility to electoral reform has come from the right and left of the party. Even now, it is unlikely to be the first priority of an opposition facing so many challenges. Nor is it the only policy area in which intellectual work, as well as the community organising that several leadership contenders have described as a priority, is needed. But the problems with first past the post, including the way it perpetuates a Labour-Tory duopoly, shuts out smaller parties and rewards nationalist ones (because votes piled up in one area are easier to convert into seats than those that are thinly spread) can no longer be ignored. Obviously Guardian leaders are always right although, sadly, history shows that a Guardian endorsement does not always guarantee electoral success. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 11am: Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, visit Belfast for talks with the first minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill. Johnson is expected to speak to the media at around 12.30pm. 2.30pm: Nominations close for MPs and MEPs backing candidates in the Labour leadership and deputy leadership elections. The leadership candidates Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis and the deputy leadership candidates Richard Burgon, Rosena Allin-Khan and Dawn Butler have until then to reach the threshold of 22 nominations, or face being eliminated from the contest. 2.30pm: The Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy gives a speech in Dagenham. 2.30pm: Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, and Zac Goldsmith, the environment minister, are introduced as new peers in the House of Lords. After 3pm: Peers debate the second reading of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Each year, unfathomable amounts of energy are added to the oceans. Scientists measure heat in joules; the amount of heat in the oceans is so large that we report it in zettajoules. What is a zettajoule? It is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules. The amount of heat we are putting into the oceans is equivalent to about five Hiroshima atom bombs of energy every second. I am part of the team of researchers that published a paper on ocean warming that shows the total heat of Earth is increasing with global heating, as scientists have predicted for decades. Each year, we take Earth\u2019s temperature to try to determine what is happening to our climate. Each year the news is worse than the year before. There is hope, which I will discuss later. But first, let\u2019s talk about the new study. As humans emit heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, it creates an energy imbalance. There is more heat coming in than going out. That means the Earth is out of balance, and temperatures are rising. The vast majority of the excess energy \u2013 more than 90% \u2013 ends up in the oceans.

Though campus protests are not unusual in Iran, they come during a period of extraordinary tumult in the Islamic Republic, with an economy suffocated by US sanctions, the largest protests in the regime\u2019s history crushed by violent force in November, and popular revulsion that the country\u2019s armed forces shot down a jet loaded with Iranian citizens \u2013 then denied doing so.</p> \n<p>A government spokesman on Monday denied there had been any cover-up: \u201cSome officials were even accused of lying and a cover-up but, in all honesty, that was not the case,\u201d said Ali Rabiei, adding that all details provided by officials before Saturday\u2019s revelation had been based on the information they had.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll of those who expressed opinions on those days, at the peak of America\u2019s psychological war ... did so based on existing information at the time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Analysts said the renewed anti-government protests were still concentrated among the restive middle classes and students and not an existential threat to the government. But the backlash had wiped out any momentum the government had hoped to gain from the outpouring of grief and rage that followed the killing of Gen Qassem Suleimani by a US drone strike on 3 January, and Iran\u2019s missile strikes on American forces in Iraq five days later.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was thought they would have gotten a break, but they have \u2026 ruined it for themselves,\u201d said Dina Esfandiary, an Iran specialist at the Century Foundation thinktank.</p> \n<p>A witness told the Guardian that groups, many led by women, gathered in Tehran\u2019s central Azadi Square on Sunday evening wearing masks and scarves to hide their identities, confronting riot police and officers in plain clothes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3b940a7d-7dfe-47bb-bd2b-6e2553838290\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KmFma4XeWkU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOne of [the officers] with a white beard was filming regular people and smiling flagrantly while we were shouting in their faces,\u201d Ronak, 35, said. \u201cThirty minutes later, the shooting of teargas started and the crowd was shouting in between cries and coughs: \u2018For so many years of crimes, down with this <em>wilayat</em> [Iran\u2019s theocratic system of government].\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>She said the crowd rushed away from the teargas but continued chanting, and security forces started to fire \u201ccompact and hard black bullets\u201d, a form of non-lethal ammunition. \u201c[They fired] constantly, without stop,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople were on the ground.

      "bodyText": "Iranian authorities fired live ammunition to disperse protesters in Tehran on Sunday night, wounding several people, according to witness accounts provided to the Guardian and footage circulating on social media. Hundreds of protesters had defied a heavy security presence in the Iranian capital to hold vigils and demonstrations after the government belatedly admitted its own forces had shot down a Ukraine International Airlines passenger jet last Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board. There were fresh protests on Monday in at least two universities in the country. Though campus protests are not unusual in Iran, they come during a period of extraordinary tumult in the Islamic Republic, with an economy suffocated by US sanctions, the largest protests in the regime\u2019s history crushed by violent force in November, and popular revulsion that the country\u2019s armed forces shot down a jet loaded with Iranian citizens \u2013 then denied doing so. A government spokesman on Monday denied there had been any cover-up: \u201cSome officials were even accused of lying and a cover-up but, in all honesty, that was not the case,\u201d said Ali Rabiei, adding that all details provided by officials before Saturday\u2019s revelation had been based on the information they had. \u201cAll of those who expressed opinions on those days, at the peak of America\u2019s psychological war ... did so based on existing information at the time.\u201d Analysts said the renewed anti-government protests were still concentrated among the restive middle classes and students and not an existential threat to the government. But the backlash had wiped out any momentum the government had hoped to gain from the outpouring of grief and rage that followed the killing of Gen Qassem Suleimani by a US drone strike on 3 January, and Iran\u2019s missile strikes on American forces in Iraq five days later. \u201cIt was thought they would have gotten a break, but they have \u2026 ruined it for themselves,\u201d said Dina Esfandiary, an Iran specialist at the Century Foundation thinktank. A witness told the Guardian that groups, many led by women, gathered in Tehran\u2019s central Azadi Square on Sunday evening wearing masks and scarves to hide their identities, confronting riot police and officers in plain clothes. \u201cOne of [the officers] with a white beard was filming regular people and smiling flagrantly while we were shouting in their faces,\u201d Ronak, 35, said. \u201cThirty minutes later, the shooting of teargas started and the crowd was shouting in between cries and coughs: \u2018For so many years of crimes, down with this wilayat [Iran\u2019s theocratic system of government].\u2019\u201d She said the crowd rushed away from the teargas but continued chanting, and security forces started to fire \u201ccompact and hard black bullets\u201d, a form of non-lethal ammunition. \u201c[They fired] constantly, without stop,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were on the ground. One of the teargas canisters was fired near us. My friend was shot by paintball bullets in his head. For a few seconds I thought he had lost his eye, but the bullet hit his eyebrows. Blood was dripping from his eyebrows. His face was wet and he was constantly coughing.\u201d The crowd dispersed after security forces began \u201cshooting bullets that were aimed at heads\u201d, she said. \u201cThe crackdown was too intense, so our comrades dispersed,\u201d she said. The witness\u2019s account could not be independently confirmed, but accorded with another witness\u2019s report that security forces initially fired teargas to disperse the crowds and then started firing bullets. \u201cIt was a very bad situation,\u201d the woman, who asked not to be identified, said in a message provided to the Iranian activist Masih Alinejad. \u201cThey were firing teargas repeatedly. We couldn\u2019t see anywhere and we were screaming. We were getting blinded. Forces were firing teargas back to back. A young girl beside me was shot in the leg. It was terrible, terrible.\u201d She provided a video from near Azadi Square showing bloodstains along the pavement, one of several similar videos being circulated by Iranian activists on Sunday evening and Monday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s the blood of our people,\u201d a woman said in one clip. Another video purportedly from near Azadi Square shows several people appearing to be wounded on the ground including a woman lying on a bloodied pavement. \u201cThey shot her with a bullet,\u201d a man says. Tehran\u2019s police chief said in a statement on Monday that no shots were fired during Sunday\u2019s events and that officers were under orders to show restraint. \u201cAt protests, police absolutely did not shoot because the capital\u2019s police officers have been given orders to show restraint,\u201d Hossein Rahimi said.

      "bodyText": "Finally, the FTSE 100 has closed 29 points higher at 7,617, up 0.4% today. That\u2019s thanks to the weaker pound, which cushioned stocks from fears about weak UK growth. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: The FTSE jumped higher on the open boosted by trade deal optimism and the pound tumbling..... Recession fears and rate cut expectations dragged the pound sharply lower in early trade. The monthly GDP reading for November printed significantly worse than expected at -0.3% with the manufacturing sector acting as the biggest burden on the economy amid continued Brexit uncertainty and slow global demand. House builders had a good day, she adds. House builders outperformed thanks to a helping hand from broker upgrades, with Taylor Wimpey jumping over 2.5%. Following from the Conservative victory in the elections the outlook for the sector and house prices in general has improved. This seems slightly at odds with the pound falling on recession fears. Tomorrow\u2019s trading update from Taylor Wimpey and building material supplier Grafton could give further insight into the health of the sector. Whilst retailer dominated last week, house builders will take centre stage this week. Time for a recap. Britain\u2019s economy stumbled in November, with GDP shrinking by 0.3% during the month. Service sector firms and manufacturers both failed to grow, as political uncertainty over December\u2019s general election and ongoing Brexit tensions hit the economy. The economy barely expanded during the last three months, rising by 0.1%, thanks to a pick-up in growth in September and October. But on an annual basis, growth hit its weakest level since 2012. The news hit the pound, which fell to its lowest level since the City returned to work after the Christmas break. Sterling has lost almost a cent today to $1.297. Investors believe there\u2019s a strong possibility that the Bank of England will cut interest rate at its next meeting, in a fortnight\u2019s time. Several policymakers have hinted that they\u2019d consider a cut, if the economy doesn\u2019t strengthen. There are some signs of a Boris Bounce in the UK, with estate agents Savills reporting a pick-up in demand after last month\u2019s election. UK regional airline Flybe is fighting for government support, after running up steeper losses than expected. Flybe insists that it is operating normally, but aviation experts believe it could struggle to get extra financing. European stock markets have started the new week poorly. The Stoxx 600 index has lost 0.3%, with losses in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid. But Wall Street has seen some early gains, on hopes that the US and China will sign a Phase One trade deal this week. Tesla has hit a record high. Over on Wall Street, shares in electric self-driving car maker Tesla have hit a record high. Tesla traded over $500 for the first time ever, up 4%, as the New York stock market opens for another week. Investors are piling in after investment bank Oppenheimer hiked its price target on Tesla, saying: We believe the company\u2019s risk tolerance, ability to implement learnings from past errors, and larger ambition than peers are beginning to pose an existential threat to transportation companies that are unable or unwilling to innovate at a faster pace. This means Tesla\u2019s share price is up 50% in the last year, as fears over its financial stability have eased. Other tech stocks are also higher, lifting the Nasdaq by 0.4% in early trading. The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.1%. Today\u2019s weak UK growth figures, and recent dovish comments from Bank of England officials, mean a January interest rate cut is now virtually an even-money chance. That\u2019s according to CME Group, the derivatives and options marketplace. Its BoEWatch Tool tracks the probability of a rate move at upcoming Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee meetings, based on futures prices. It shows a 49% chance that the BoE cuts rates on 30 January, and a 51% chance that they leave them at 0.75%. This suggests that future UK economic data could move the markets -- particularly the \u2018flash\u2019 PMI surveys due on Friday 24th January. They will show whether activity rose or fell at service sector companies and factories this month. Environmentalists in Exeter don\u2019t share concerns over Flybe\u2019s future. Instead, the local Green Party point out that airlines are a major contributor to the climate emergency, and that flying between regional airports is unsustainable both financially, and for environmental reasons. A very fair point. But without serious investment in other transport networks, flying will still appeal. For example, today\u2019s flight from Exeter to Belfast was scheduled to take 80 minutes. Driving would take over 10 hours, while train takes around 15 hours. Speculation continues to swirl over Flybe\u2019s future, with the airline still looking for government support to prop up its finances. Flybe continues to operate services as usual -- with flights still taking off on time despite the risk of blustery conditions in parts of the UK today. But there is still concern that the regional airline may not get the support it needs. Aviation consultant John Strickland fears that Westminster politicians may not bail out the Exeter-based firm. He told the Press Association: \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult sector. Regional flying is the poor relation in aviation terms. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not been helped by the options for surface transport, from driving through to trains. \u201cOn top of that you have the Air Passenger Duty burden on tickets which is an issue for competitiveness. \u201cIt\u2019s a very large airline in terms of regional activity, having 80-plus aircraft. \u201cIt\u2019s always seemed to me that was unusual, relative to the consortium who\u2019s bought it.\u201d \u201cIt was always going to be a challenge to be able to turn this around. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to succeed, to me it\u2019s always seemed it would have to be done in a way that the airline would shrink to some extent. \u201cI cannot see the Government doing much of anything except give warm words because they didn\u2019t help out Monarch or Thomas Cook. \u201cI just can\u2019t see a political will to get involved, so it\u2019s going to depend on somebody putting money in.\u201d In other news, Britain posted a record trade surplus in November -- although the underlying picture isn\u2019t quite as impressive. The ONS reports that the UK racked up a monthly surplus of \u00a34.0 billion, mainly driven by a \u00a33.0 billion increase in exports of unspecified goods. Unspecified goods includes \u2018non-monetary gold\u2019 (where swings in London\u2019s bullion market can distort the trade figures). But strip out unspecified goods, and November 2019 still saw a monthly trade surplus of \u00a30.7 billion. That\u2019s largely due to a \u00a31.6bn drop in machinery imports, and a \u00a31.3bn drop in transport equipment, during the month. This may partly be due to companies stockpiling goods in October in case of a disorderly Brexit. The ONS also reports that Britain racked up a larger trade deficit with the EU, underlying the importance of a post-Brexit trade deal. It says: The UK\u2019s trade in goods deficit widened \u00a30.7 billion to \u00a329.9 billion in the three months to November 2019, as imports grew faster than exports, while the trade in services surplus widened \u00a31.7 billion to \u00a328.8 billion. The trade in goods deficit with EU countries widened \u00a31.8 billion to \u00a323.9 billion in the three months to November 2019, while with non-EU countries it narrowed \u00a30.6 billion to \u00a33.8 billion. Today\u2019s weak growth report piles pressure on the Bank of England to consider cutting interest rate soon, says my colleague Richard Partington: The British economy shrank in November following a fall in consumer spending and a downturn in manufacturing before the election, raising pressure on the Bank of England for an interest rate cut. In a reflection of the political uncertainty hanging over families and businesses before last month\u2019s vote, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product (GDP) had fallen by 0.3% in November from the previous month. Most major sectors of the economy except construction recorded a drop in output, including the country\u2019s usually dominant services industry \u2013 which includes retail, hotels and finance. The latest snapshot comes as momentum towards an interest rate cut builds after three members of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee signalled that weakness in the economy could warrant lower borrowing costs within months to support jobs and growth. The pound came under selling pressure on Monday, dropping by around 0.7% against the US dollar, to $1.2980, and the euro, to \u20ac1.1675, amid rising expectations that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) could cut rates as soon as its next meeting on 30 January. There are some signs that the UK economy may be picking up speed. Savills, the estate agents, told the City this morning that business has picked up since the December general election. Saville now expects profits to hit the upper end of its guidance, thanks to a pick-up in property transactions. But it also warned shareholders that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU could weigh on the economy in 2020: \u201cLooking to the year ahead, increased political stability in the UK should maintain improved sentiment in real estate markets... Nevertheless, some caution may remain until the full impact of Brexit is better understood.\u201d Today\u2019s growth report contains several charts showing how the UK economy fared in November, and over the last quarter. This one shows how the economy barely grew in September-November, with annual growth sliding to its weakest since 2012. This table highlights how services and manufacturing both contracted in November alone: These charts show how services sector growth weakened steadily in recent months..... ...while industrial production has contracted for months. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid, is promising measures to spur the economy in his budget, in two months time. He also appears to blame Brexit deadlock for the growth slowdown, saying: \u201cUncertainty has held our economy back for too long. We are getting Brexit done so we can move on and chart a new course for our economy. In my Budget on 11 March we will lay the foundations for a decade of renewal that will unleash Britain\u2019s potential by levelling up across our great country.\u201d TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has called on the government to take steps to boost growth: \u201cThese figures are bleak news for the economy and working people with vital industries like manufacturing in the doldrums. \u201cThe government has run out of excuses. It must come up with a plan to boost growth and living standards across the country. \u201cWarm words are not going to cut it.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the UK economy is stuck \u201cin the doldrums\u201d, having only grown by 0.1% in the last quarter. November saw a decline in estimated output in most major sectors except construction, although this was offset by small upward revisions in previous estimates of GDP growth in September and October. The weakening of the dominant UK services sector in the autumn is notable and business surveys suggest that output in this sector remained flat in December. All of this data, however, relates to a period of heightened economic and political uncertainty last autumn due to Brexit and the general election. It is too early to say for sure if economic momentum will pick up in the new year now the political situation is clearer, but our latest survey of the financial services sector with the CBI does suggest some boost to optimism since the election.\u201d John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, says Britain\u2019s weak growth is due to the UK government\u2019s failure to invest in public services. \u201cOur production sector and manufacturing growth are suffering as a result of ongoing Tory mismanagement and incompetence. \u201cLabour will continue to hold the Government to account for its disastrous economic record, and fight for the investment that is needed to restore public services and tackle the climate emergency.\u201d The pound has sunk to its lowest level since 27 December, and has fallen for eight of the first nine trading days this year. The City now reckons there\u2019s an even chance of UK interest rates being cut in a fortnight\u2019s time. Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank, says: With a growing chorus on the MPC apparently open to the prospect of a rate cut, if the data points in that direction, today\u2019s release might well tip the balance of one or two members ahead of the meeting on 30 January, where the market probability assigned to a 25 bps cut has risen to 50% versus 5% at the start of last week.\u201d There\u2019s a serious danger that the UK economy will have shrunk in the final quarter of 2019, given November\u2019s grim performance. That would put Britain half-way into recession again. Howard Archer of IT Item Club says: There now looks to be a very real chance that the economy contracted marginally over the fourth quarter of 2019; at best it may have stagnated. Barring further revisions to the back data, GDP will have needed to grow 0.3% month-on-month in December just for GDP to have been flat quarter-on-quarter over the fourth quarter In fact, the economy looks to have had a difficult December overall. However, it\u2019s also possible that activity and business confidence will be boosted this year, following December\u2019s decisive election result. Matthew Cady, investment strategist at Brooks Macdonald, says there\u2019s a significant chance that the Bank of England cut interest rates at its next meeting on 30 January. UK GDP for November has come in at negative -0.3%. This is quite a bit weaker than had been expected. Consensus had been looking for zero growth month on month. Against this, both September and October were revised up by 0.2% and 0.1% points respectively. The weaker GDP print today puts beyond doubt that the next Bank of England meeting at the end of January is going to be a \u2018live\u2019 meeting. Last week, governor Mark Carney suggested the Bank could move \u2018promptly\u2019 if the UK economy was weakening. Yesterday, policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe said he\u2019d vote for a cut if the economy doesn\u2019t bounce back following December\u2019s election. Vlieghe\u2019s comments were already pushing the pound down this morning, before the GDP figures landed. Garry Young, Director of Macroeconomic Modelling and Forecasting at the NIESR thinktank, says UK growth has \u201cpetered out\u201d. GDP was virtually flat in the three months to November and the latest surveys point to further stagnation in December. While there is some evidence of an improvement in business optimism following the general election, it is doubtful that this will do much to change the short-term economic outlook of further lacklustre growth.\u201d Car production and pharmaceuticals helped to drag UK manufacturing down in the last quarter, flags up economist Rupert Seggins. The BBC\u2019s Dharshini David points out that UK industry is pulling growth back Over the last three months, the UK service sector grew by just 0.1% while construction expanded by 1.1%. But Britain\u2019s production sector, including manufacturing, shrank by 0.6% over the last quarter -- with Brexit uncertainty hitting orders and forcing some carmakers to schedule temporary shutdowns in case of a disorderly exit from the EU. The Office for National Statistics\u2019 head of GDP, Rob Kent-Smith, says UK growth has hit its lowest level in seven years, on an annual basis. \u201cOverall, the economy grew slightly in the latest three months, with growth in construction pulled back by weakening services and another lacklustre performance from manufacturing. \u201cThe UK economy grew slightly more strongly in September and October than was previously estimated, with later data painting a healthier picture. \u201cLong term, the economy continues to slow, with growth in the economy compared with the same time last year at its lowest since the spring of 2012. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that the UK economy has slowed for two months running. As you can see, it shrank in April-June, then bounced back with 0.4% growth in July-September, avoiding a recession. But growth slowed to 0.2% in August-October, and then just 0.1% in September-November (as we\u2019ve just learned). The pound has fallen sharply this morning, falling below $1.30 for the first time in 2020. Sterling fell as low as $1.2968, down nearly a cent today, as November\u2019s weak GDP figures spook the City. Traders reckon there\u2019s a rising chance that UK interest rates are cut soon, perhaps at the Bank of England\u2019s meeting at the end of January. Brexit uncertainty, and the threat of crashing out of the EU without a deal in October, hurt the economy in November. The ONS says: Production fell by 1.2% in the month of November 2019, following growth of 0.4% in October. Within production, manufacturing fell by 1.7%. This was largely driven by large falls in the manufacture of transport equipment, food, and chemicals. These industries were also the main drags on growth in April 2019, just after the UK\u2019s original planned date to exit the European Union, as this chart shows: NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s economy contracted in November, amid uncertainty over the general election. UK GDP shrank by 0.3% during the month, a sharply contraction than economists expected, with manufacturers and services companies both struggling. The service sector shrank by 0.3% during the month, according to the Office for National Statistics, while manufacturing output fell by an alarming 1.7%. But... the economy actually grew by 0.1% in the September-November quarter, which is better than expected. More to follow.... Professor Loizos Heracleous of Warwick Business School fears that Flybe may struggle to obtain new funding. He points out that the airline industry has seen plenty of failures recently (including Monarch, Flybmi and Thomas Cook). \u201cAttracting new finance will be no easy task. The aviation industry is an unattractive industry in terms of performance and returns on investment at the best of times. \u201cIt is saddled with high cost assets, namely planes, and key costs that fluctuate uncontrollably, mainly fuel, which accounts for around a third of total airline costs. On top of that they face high regulation, often aggressive unions, low barriers to entry that increase competition, and high bargaining power of buyers. Heracleous adds that rising fuel costs and political uncertainty are eating into profits, meaning more bankruptcies are inevitable: For example, in 2017 we saw 79 new airlines enter the market, while 25 went bankrupt. The failure rate was even higher in Europe, where 29 airlines were started and 14 went bankrupt. In the medium to long term the European aviation industry may move towards higher levels of consolidation where the weakest players get weeded out or taken over. Rob Burgess, editor of frequent flyer website www.headforpoints.com, says Flybe appeared to making progress -- but has struggled through the quiet winter trading period. The new strategy seemed sensible, moving away from leisure routes and focusing on \u2018visiting friends and family\u2019 and business travel. The least cost-efficient aircraft have been removed from the fleet and new routes have been announced. On the bulk of its routes Flybe has no airline competition and there is, somewhere in there, a small but very decent airline waiting to get out A quick glance at Flybe\u2019s route map shows how the airline plays an important role in Britain\u2019s economy, especially for companies and households outside major cities. For example, a passenger in Exeter can fly direct to Edinburgh or Glasgow in Scotland, across the Irish Sea to Dublin or Belfast, or over the Channel to Jersey, Geneva and Amsterdam. Flybe also provides direct flights from John O\u2019Groats - the far north of Scotland - to Edinburgh and Aberdeen, and thus indirect flights to major cities in England. Boris Johnson has pledged to do more to help Britain\u2019s regions, so he might note how Flybe provides important air links for Teeside (where the Conservatives have bolstered their support). Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw says the government should help Flybe obtain the financial help it needs to keep running. He points out that the airline plays a crucial role, operating flights from airports across the country. It also employs 400 people at its headquarters at Exeter Airport. Bradshaw says (via Devon Live): \u201cThe priority must be to secure Flybe\u2019s long term future by restoring profitability. The airline provides valuable connectivity throughout the U.K., vital for the regions, including our own, as well as good, skilled jobs and training locally. Brexit and the way the Government\u2019s aviation taxes hit a regional airline like Flybe have been a double whammy for the company and I would expect the Government to work closely with its management to secure the future of such a strategically important business.\u201d Balpa, the union for UK pilots, is demanding answers about Flybe\u2019s future. Brian Strutton, Balpa\u2019s general secretary, says: \u201cI am appalled that once again the future of a major UK airline and hundreds of jobs is being discussed in secret with no input from employees or their representatives. \u201cAccording to reports, the airline could have collapsed over the weekend which would have been devastating news. \u201cThis is an appalling state of affairs and we demand that the owners of Flybe - Virgin, Stobart and Cyrus - and the Government departments involved stop hiding and talk to us about Flybe. \u201cWe have a right to be consulted and the staff have a right to know what is going on.\u201d Flybe\u2019s financial crisis is surprising, given the company had seemingly been rescued a year ago. The Virgin Atlantic-led consortium which took control of Flybe a year ago pledged to inject \u00a3100m into the struggling airline -- a \u00a320m working capital loan and \u00a380m to invest. But this money doesn\u2019t appear to have been enough, given the scale of Flybe\u2019s problems (fuel costs, competition from other services, weak consumer confidence, economic uncertainty....) As Simon Calder writes in the Independent today: It appears that the scale of Flybe\u2019s problems were even bigger than the consortium anticipated. The losses have been exacerbated by the miserable winter that the airline is experiencing. Demand remains soft, and some competing rail links are improving \u2013 in southwest England, for example, new rail timetables introduced on GWR a month ago dramatically improved services from Devon to London, damaging the appeal of the Flybe link from Exeter to the capital. Some aviation insiders suggest that credit-card acquirers have increased demands for upfront cash, which is often a problem among ailing airlines. There are also claims that the Virgin-led consortium is alarmed at the amount of additional cash that it is having to pump in \u2013 throwing good money after bad was one description. Good news: Flybe appears to be operating as normal today. Its live arrivals and departures screen shows that some flights have taken off from across Europe today, with other services scheduled for later. The UK government won\u2019t reveal details of its talks with Flybe. A Department for Transport spokesperson says only that: \u201cWe do not comment on speculation or the financial affairs of private companies.\u201d Flybe insists that it is still operating as normal, but isn\u2019t denying that it\u2019s seeking financial help from the government. A spokeswoman says: Flybe continues to focus on providing great service and connectivity for our customers, to ensure that they can continue to travel as planned. We don\u2019t comment on rumour or speculation.\u201d They\u2019ve tweeted this message too: Good morning, and welcome for our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The future of Europe\u2019s largest regional airline is in focus this morning, with 2,000 jobs on the line. UK-based Flybe is urgently seeking government help to find emergency funding to keep the company going, according to Sky News. The Exeter firm is reportedly locked in survival talks with officials at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Department for Transport (DfT), seeking extra financing to cover its rising losses. The crisis comes just a year after Flybe was rescued by a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic, and months after travel giant Thomas Cook went under. Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman says that EY, the accountancy firm, has been put on standby in case Flybe falls into administration He says: The government is understood to have been briefed on the crisis at Flybe in the last few days, with more than 2,000 jobs at risk if the company collapses. One source close to Flybe said on Sunday night that the Department for Transport and Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy had been working to determine whether the government could provide or facilitate any emergency financing to the company. Flybe operates from 27 airports across the UK, from John O\u2019Groats in Scotland to Southampton on the English south coast, plus Manchester, Edinburgh, Liverpool and London Heathrow. It also flies to and from France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland. It came close to collapse a year ago, before Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital Partners swooped in to buy Flybe\u2019s operating assets. More to follow.... Also coming up today New GDP data will show how Britain\u2019s economy fared in November, in the run-up to the general election. Economists predict the economy flatlined during the month, and shrank slightly in the September-November quarter. European stock markets are expected to open flattish, as investors watch events in Iran and await the US-China trade deal signing ceremony on Wednesday. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK GDP for November 2019. Expected to show no growth in the month, and a -0.1% contraction in the last quarter.",

      "body": "<p>If cinema had the impact on the world that film critics insisted they did in 2019, Joker would have brought about an incel revolution, and Little Women would have ended misogyny.</p> <p>It was not a great year for film, with even our greatest film-makers putting out middling efforts. Yet if you listen to the critics and official opinion-havers online, you could have been convinced that it was a very important year for film. Issue movies took on an outsized influence, and movies that just tried to be movies \u2013 entertaining, thought-provoking or pleasurable \u2013 were denounced or celebrated as being dangerous or culturally momentous. The stakes this year for every film seemed impossibly high.</p> <p>This was the year <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-film-joker-opening/security-stepped-up-as-joker-opens-in-u-s-movie-theaters-idUSKBN1WI2I4\">police departments issued warnings</a> about the possibility of mass shootings at opening-night screenings of Joker, after all. It was a hysteria that built online after film critics saw the movie at festivals and started to complain it somehow \u201cglamorized\u201d or sympathized with violent incels. (I always thought one of the best things cinema was capable of doing was of sympathizing with the marginalized and misunderstood, but I guess that viewpoint is out of fashion now.)</p> <p>This was also the year media outlets like the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/27/opinion/little-women-movie.html\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/12/little-women-awards-season-men\">Vanity Fair</a> insisted Little Women was mandatory viewing to prove you\u2019re not a misogynist. <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/tracy-letts-little-women-essay\">Even GQ</a> ran a piece implying how important it was men \u201csupport women\u201d by watching this film about some white ladies having a hard time during the civil war. Men\u2019s supposed lack of interest in Little Women became the dominant narrative of the movie, implying it reveals the (alleged) lack of interest men have, in the words of the New York Times, in \u201csee[ing] women as human beings\u201d.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t possibly be that Little Women is just a bad movie \u2013 although it is. Little Women is one of those books that has been over-adapted, with five previous film adaptations, plus a miniseries, plus a theatrical production, plus an anime version, and on and on.</p> <p>The book itself is sentimental and sloppy, although interesting in the way it portrays hardship and deprivation. Its mediocrity makes mysterious its continued cultural dominance. Somehow the version adapted and directed by Greta Gerwig ramps up the sentimentality and strips the story of anything of interest. In her version, poverty looks glamorous, advocacy means just having the right opinions, and there are no consequences for anyone\u2019s actions.

I was bored for most of it, and angry for having had high hopes for this film by all of the ravishing critical praise, but yeah I guess it was pretty good, all things considered.

      "bodyText": "If cinema had the impact on the world that film critics insisted they did in 2019, Joker would have brought about an incel revolution, and Little Women would have ended misogyny. It was not a great year for film, with even our greatest film-makers putting out middling efforts. Yet if you listen to the critics and official opinion-havers online, you could have been convinced that it was a very important year for film. Issue movies took on an outsized influence, and movies that just tried to be movies \u2013 entertaining, thought-provoking or pleasurable \u2013 were denounced or celebrated as being dangerous or culturally momentous. The stakes this year for every film seemed impossibly high. This was the year police departments issued warnings about the possibility of mass shootings at opening-night screenings of Joker, after all. It was a hysteria that built online after film critics saw the movie at festivals and started to complain it somehow \u201cglamorized\u201d or sympathized with violent incels. (I always thought one of the best things cinema was capable of doing was of sympathizing with the marginalized and misunderstood, but I guess that viewpoint is out of fashion now.) This was also the year media outlets like the New York Times and Vanity Fair insisted Little Women was mandatory viewing to prove you\u2019re not a misogynist. Even GQ ran a piece implying how important it was men \u201csupport women\u201d by watching this film about some white ladies having a hard time during the civil war. Men\u2019s supposed lack of interest in Little Women became the dominant narrative of the movie, implying it reveals the (alleged) lack of interest men have, in the words of the New York Times, in \u201csee[ing] women as human beings\u201d. It couldn\u2019t possibly be that Little Women is just a bad movie \u2013 although it is. Little Women is one of those books that has been over-adapted, with five previous film adaptations, plus a miniseries, plus a theatrical production, plus an anime version, and on and on. The book itself is sentimental and sloppy, although interesting in the way it portrays hardship and deprivation. Its mediocrity makes mysterious its continued cultural dominance. Somehow the version adapted and directed by Greta Gerwig ramps up the sentimentality and strips the story of anything of interest. In her version, poverty looks glamorous, advocacy means just having the right opinions, and there are no consequences for anyone\u2019s actions. At one point, I slid so far down in my chair to avoid looking at the screen and the incredibly painful things that were happening \u2013 painful to me, not to the characters \u2013 that I was nearly sitting on the floor. But if you insist that a movie is important, you don\u2019t really have to deal with whether or not it\u2019s good. You can shame people into seeing it as a political statement, rather than as an entertainment or cultural selection.

Let\u2019s say that O is 0 (zero). In this case, fifteen Cs must be CH. The only digits that fit are C = 1 and H = 5. The number MU, therefore, is 15 x P, which means that U must be an 0 (zero) or a 5. But both of those numbers are already taken by the letter O and H.

To start, C cannot be 1, since then 15 x C + 7 = 22, which means there is a carry of 2 to the hundred\u2019s column, which would mean that the C in MUCHO would be 7.

C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 3.</p> <p>If C = 4, then 15 x C + 7 = 67, which means there is a carry of 6 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 1.

C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 6.</p> <p>If C = 7, then 15 x C + 7 = 112, which means there is a carry of 1 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 6. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 7.</p> <p>If C = 8, then 15 x C + 7 = 127, which means there is a carry of 2 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 7.

In other words 15P + 8 = MU. P must be between 1 and 6, since MU is less than 100. We have as candidates 1, 3, 4, 6. We can eliminate 1, since this makes MU 23, and 2 is taken.

At Exeter airport, where Flybe is based, customers expressed concern on Monday that a collapse would leave holes in flight schedules. The airline carries more than 8 million passengers a year and is a key operator at regional airports around the UK, with a network covering 56 airports across Britain and Europe. Gary Whitham, who uses Flybe to commute to Exeter for work from his home in the Netherlands, said: \u201cI am on a project in Exeter until April and have been since October. I have heard nothing at all about Flybe\u2019s problems. If they do go, then I would have to fly to Bristol, which is much more inconvenient for me.\u201d On the arrivals board, nine of the 10 flights displayed were operated by Flybe, from destinations including Belfast, Newcastle, Amsterdam and Dublin. Flybe flies to 14 destinations from Exeter. A man waiting to pick up his daughter-in-law and grandchildren from the airport said: \u201cMy son travels every week to Luxembourg from Cornwall for work.

      "bodyText": "The heat in the world\u2019s oceans reached a new record level in 2019, showing \u201cirrefutable and accelerating\u201d heating of the planet. The world\u2019s oceans are the clearest measure of the climate emergency because they absorb more than 90% of the heat trapped by the greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuel burning, forest destruction and other human activities. The new analysis shows the past five years are the top five warmest years recorded in the ocean and the past 10 years are also the top 10 years on record. The amount of heat being added to the oceans is equivalent to every person on the planet running 100 microwave ovens all day and all night. Hotter oceans lead to more severe storms and disrupt the water cycle, meaning more floods, droughts and wildfires, as well as an inexorable rise in sea level. Higher temperatures are also harming life in the seas, with the number of marine heatwaves increasing sharply. The most common measure of global heating is the average surface air temperature, as this is where people live. But natural climate phenomena such as El Ni\u00f1o events mean this can be quite variable from year to year. \u201cThe oceans are really what tells you how fast the Earth is warming,\u201d said Prof John Abraham at the University of St Thomas, in Minnesota, US, and one of the team behind the new analysis. \u201cUsing the oceans, we see a continued, uninterrupted and accelerating warming rate of planet Earth. This is dire news.\u201d \u201cWe found that 2019 was not only the warmest year on record, it displayed the largest single-year increase of the entire decade, a sobering reminder that human-caused heating of our planet continues unabated,\u201d said Prof Michael Mann, at Penn State University, US, and another team member. The analysis, published in the journal Advances In Atmospheric Sciences, uses ocean data from every available source. Most data is from the 3,800 free-drifting Argo floats dispersed across the oceans, but also from torpedo-like bathythermographs dropped from ships in the past. The results show heat increasing at an accelerating rate as greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere. The rate from 1987 to 2019 is four and a half times faster than that from 1955 to 1986. The vast majority of oceans regions are showing an increase in thermal energy. This energy drives bigger storms and more extreme weather, said Abraham: \u201cWhen the world and the oceans heat up, it changes the way rain falls and evaporates. There\u2019s a general rule of thumb that drier areas are going to become drier and wetter areas are going to become wetter, and rainfall will happen in bigger downbursts.\u201d Hotter oceans also expand and melt ice, causing sea levels to rise. The past 10 years also show the highest sea level measured in records dating back to 1900. Scientists expect about one metre of sea level rise by the end of the century, enough to displace 150 million people worldwide. Dan Smale, at the Marine Biological Association in the UK, and not part of the analysis team, said the methods used are state of the art and the data is the best available. \u201cFor me, the take-home message is that the heat content of the upper layers of the global ocean, particularly to 300 metre depth, is rapidly increasing, and will continue to increase as the oceans suck up more heat from the atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cThe upper layers of the ocean are vital for marine biodiversity, as they support some of the most productive and rich ecosystems on Earth, and warming of this magnitude will dramatically impact on marine life,\u201d Smale said. The new analysis assesses the heat in the top 2,000m of the ocean, as that is where most of the data is collected. It is also where the vast majority of the heat accumulates and where most marine life lives. The analysis method was developed by researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and uses statistical methods to interpolate heat levels in the few places where there was no data, such as under the Arctic ice cap. An independent analysis of the same data by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration shows that same increasing heat trend. Reliable ocean heat measurements stretch back to the middle of the 20th century. But Abraham said: \u201cEven before that, we know the oceans were not hotter.\u201d \u201cThe data we have is irrefutable, but we still have hope because humans can still take action,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t taken meaningful action yet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The final member of the Oval Four, a group of black men wrongly convicted of theft and assaulting the police in 1972 on the evidence of a corrupt officer, is set to have his name cleared. Constantine \u201cOmar\u201d Boucher has been traced and will now have his case referred to the court of appeal, bringing to an end one of the longest-running cases of miscarriage of justice in British legal history. Boucher, who was convicted along with Winston Trew, Sterling Christie and George Griffiths of mugging offences on the London Underground, contacted the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) after hearing that his three fellow defendants had all had their convictions quashed last month. Previous attempts to trace him had been unsuccessful. He has been living in the United States. \u201cThis is great news,\u201d said Trew, 69, who has campaigned for many years for the convictions to be overturned. \u201cFinally, it has come to an end. It is a new beginning for all four of us.\u201d He said discussions were now taking place with a view to possible compensation for the false arrests and wrongful imprisonment. The four were arrested at Oval tube station in south London by undercover officers led by DS Derek Ridgewell, who had previously served in the South Rhodesian \u2013 now Zimbabwean \u2013 police force. He was involved in a number of high-profile and controversial cases in the early 1970s, leading to calls for the home secretary to open an inquiry. The men claimed that evidence against them was fabricated and they had been subjected to violence and threats but, after a five-week trial at the Old Bailey, all four were convicted in November 1972 of attempted theft and assaulting police. Christie was also found guilty of theft of a handbag. All four were sentenced to two years in prison, reduced to eight months on appeal. In 1978, Ridgewell himself was jailed for stealing mailbags and confessed to the governor of Ford prison: \u201cI just went bent.\u201d Trew, Christie, both 69, and Griffiths, 67, had their convictions overturned by the court of appeal in December after a referral by the CCRC earlier in 2019. The lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, expressed the court\u2019s \u201cregret\u201d at the injustice and the length of time it had taken to remedy it. The CCRC did not refer Boucher\u2019s conviction to the court of appeal because it had been unable to locate him. The watchdog said it had now done so on the basis that there was \u201ca real possibility that the court of appeal will quash his conviction\u201d. Burnett said last month there was \u201can accumulating body of evidence that points to the fundamental unreliability of evidence given by DS Ridgewell \u2026 and others of this specialist group\u201d. The judge said it was clear the convictions were unsafe. \u201cWe would wish only to note our regret that it has taken so long for this injustice to be remedied,\u201d he said. Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice after that hearing, Trew urged anyone else who might have been wrongfully convicted as a result of Ridgewell\u2019s misconduct to challenge their convictions. \u201cThey should come forward and contact the CCRC,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are innocent, don\u2019t give up.\u201d Trew and Griffiths\u2019s solicitor, Jenny Wiltshire of Hickman &amp; Rose, welcomed the decision but said it was deeply concerning that it had taken so long. Ridgewell was involved in several controversial cases, culminating in the 1973 acquittals of the Tottenham Court Road Two, two young Jesuits studying at Oxford University. He was then moved into a department investigating mailbag theft, where he joined up with two criminals with whom he split the profits from stolen mailbags before he was caught and jailed, eventually dying of a heart attack in prison in 1982 at the age of 37. In January 2018, Stephen Simmons\u2019s 1976 conviction for stealing mailbags was quashed after he discovered Ridgewell had been jailed for a similar offence two years after his own conviction.",

This comes on the heels of a year in which Alabama\u2019s governor, Kay Ivey, signed into law the Human Life Protection Act, stating that doctors who perform abortions can be sentenced to life in prison. On 15 May, the day the law was signed, Jasmine Wahi, co-founder and director of Newark-based arts not-for-profit <a href=\"http://www.projectforemptyspace.org/\">Project for Empty Space</a>, texted artist, activist and fellow SVA MFA instructor <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/marilyn-minter/\">Marilyn Minter</a>. \u201cWe have to do something,\u201d she wrote.

The essayist Lynne Tillman provided a launch statement and the project features marquee names such as Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman, Hank Willis Thomas and Catherine Opie, along with the emerging artists Shirin Neshat, Wangechi Mutu, Chloe Wise and dozens of others. The project is a continuation of a show which debuted at Project for Empty Space in 2019 featuring Dominique Duroseau, Yvette Molina, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thankgodforabortion/\">Viva Ruiz</a>, and Christen Clifford, all of whom have pieces in the current exhibition. <br><br>The title may shock, but Abortion is Normal is meant to <a href=\"http://www.projectforemptyspace.org/calendar/2019/9/10/abortion-is-normal-exhibition-opening\">create \u201can inclusive and empathetic entry point\u201d into the conversation</a>, dismantling the stigma surrounding abortion, and working as an urgent call to action. The exhibition includes participants of all races and genders; some of whom have had abortions, and others who are soon-to-be or current parents. \u201cIt was important for us to have an intersectional exhibition, that ranged not only in gender demographics,\u201d said Wahi, \u201cbut, because we have people of all gender identities between the two spaces, addressing a variety of reproductive rights issues.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"282dd70af9eb73cf4a4e1b09a2e753d0df2fbcd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/282dd70af9eb73cf4a4e1b09a2e753d0df2fbcd2/0_117_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marilyn Minter and Laurie Simmons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marilyn Minter and Laurie Simmons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jocko Graves / BFA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The project is refreshingly grassroots. Most attendees at the opening last Thursday learned about Abortion is Normal directly through participating artists or via social media. In the DIY spirit, zine-style foldouts were distributed rather than catalogs, and several luminaries contributed new works specifically created for the show, including Marilyn Minter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/marilyn-minter-cuntrol\">CUNTROL</a>, Jane Kaplowitz\u2019s homage to Ruth Bader Ginsburg and <a href=\"http://www.jonkessler.com\">Jon Kessler</a>\u2019s short video incorporating archival footage from abortion clinic bombings of the 1970s.</p> <p>Proceeds from the show will be split between Planned Parenthood and Downtown for Democracy, a Pac launched in 2003 in response to the US invasion of Iraq. The latter is volunteer run and supports cultural and political shows, as well as other forms of activism including educational efforts and advertising in swing states, voter registration, and youth outreach.</p> <p>Last year, the group launched the <a href=\"https://downtown4democracy.org/past-events/2018/10/31/protest-factory\">Protest Factory</a>, a show and series of events at Jeffrey Deitch in New York meant to kickstart local activism which saw Cecily Brown and Kembra Pfahler leading sign-making classes, readings by Eileen Myles and Luc Sante, and a \u201cT-shirt debut\u201d featuring Richard Hell, Barbara Kruger, and Richard Prince, in collaboration with Supreme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06940a5a0d827f6a065fd9179d7645613e29b18c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06940a5a0d827f6a065fd9179d7645613e29b18c/0_0_5451_3271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marilyn Minter, Cuntrol, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marilyn Minter, Cuntrol, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are those chipping away at reproductive rights and they never stop,\u201d says Gina Nanni of Downtown for Democracy. \u201cThere is a generation that came up before Roe v Wade that will never forget, but a younger generation that takes certain rights for granted. We want all to be educated, that you can never let go of issues that are important, that being involved in the political process is the only way that we can maintain a society and law that reflects the will of the people.\u201d</p> <p>The show, which came together in a matter of weeks rather than months or years, reflects this immediacy. Wahi and Jampol continued to vet submissions up until launch. \u201cPeople were really enthusiastic about making this happen, especially at the beginning of an election year,\u201d explains Wahi. \u201cSo, we pulled all hands on deck, with volunteer help picking up work, and with consignment and loans. It was a huge team effort, but it\u2019s something that I hope will change people\u2019s minds about choice.\u201d That several blue chip artists, whose work fetches in the tens of thousands on auction, were willing to donate is truly unique. \u201cLiving in these times, \u2018no\u2019 is not an option,\u201d said the artist Rob Pruitt, who donated a full-scale work. \u201cSo many have worked so hard, and for so long, to safeguard these rights that the thought of this work being undone would be a tragedy. I said yes without thinking twice.\u201d</p> <p>Driving outreach was the team of Minter and Simmons, both longtime activists who frequently collaborate on causes and events. \u201cThere\u2019s very little time when we\u2019re not working on something together, and rarely does a project that\u2019s political come across my visions or hers that we don\u2019t share,\u201d said Simmons, who contributed a 1976 piece from her collection. Both Minter and Simmons remember life before Roe v Wade, which fueled their hands-on approach to the show. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect our children and our younger female friends.\u201d Simmons pointed out that the show is not a contribution to one candidate or campaign \u2013 it\u2019s issue driven, and in support of autonomy and empowerment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88a8a485847ae2ed3ebfb08c967fccab2ed8afaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88a8a485847ae2ed3ebfb08c967fccab2ed8afaf/0_249_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Installation image works by Elektra KB\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Installation image works by Elektra KB.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jocko Graves / BFA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it certainly is powerful.

There is a particularly strong thread to past downtown New York provocateurs such as Keith Haring, Gordon Matta Clark and Jean-Michel Basquiat, who used their generous creative spirit to shape and change prevalent attitudes.</p> <p>If you\u2019re unable to attend the second installment of the exhibition, Keith Corso, chief development officer of PPNY, offers a few words on participation. \u201cVote!\u201d he urges. \u201cGet your friends out to vote. Make sure everyone votes. It\u2019s going to be a very important year for all of us to stand up.

      "bodyText": "A week into 2020, and the US political discourse on reproductive rights is already at a crossroads. On 6 January, 39 Republican senators signed an amicus brief urging the supreme court to reconsider Roe v Wade, the 1973 supreme court case that secured the legal right to an abortion. This comes on the heels of a year in which Alabama\u2019s governor, Kay Ivey, signed into law the Human Life Protection Act, stating that doctors who perform abortions can be sentenced to life in prison. On 15 May, the day the law was signed, Jasmine Wahi, co-founder and director of Newark-based arts not-for-profit Project for Empty Space, texted artist, activist and fellow SVA MFA instructor Marilyn Minter. \u201cWe have to do something,\u201d she wrote. Within minutes, Minter responded that she was game. Born from this exchange is the ambitious, multi-disciplinary Abortion is Normal: An Emergency Art Show, a two-part exhibition co-curated by Wahi and Project for Empty Space co-founder Rebecca Pauline Jampol, in collaboration with Minter, Gina Nanni of Downtown for Democracy, the artist Laurie Simmons and the art historian Sandy Tait. The essayist Lynne Tillman provided a launch statement and the project features marquee names such as Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman, Hank Willis Thomas and Catherine Opie, along with the emerging artists Shirin Neshat, Wangechi Mutu, Chloe Wise and dozens of others. The project is a continuation of a show which debuted at Project for Empty Space in 2019 featuring Dominique Duroseau, Yvette Molina, Viva Ruiz, and Christen Clifford, all of whom have pieces in the current exhibition. The title may shock, but Abortion is Normal is meant to create \u201can inclusive and empathetic entry point\u201d into the conversation, dismantling the stigma surrounding abortion, and working as an urgent call to action. The exhibition includes participants of all races and genders; some of whom have had abortions, and others who are soon-to-be or current parents. \u201cIt was important for us to have an intersectional exhibition, that ranged not only in gender demographics,\u201d said Wahi, \u201cbut, because we have people of all gender identities between the two spaces, addressing a variety of reproductive rights issues.\u201d The project is refreshingly grassroots. Most attendees at the opening last Thursday learned about Abortion is Normal directly through participating artists or via social media. In the DIY spirit, zine-style foldouts were distributed rather than catalogs, and several luminaries contributed new works specifically created for the show, including Marilyn Minter\u2019s CUNTROL, Jane Kaplowitz\u2019s homage to Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Jon Kessler\u2019s short video incorporating archival footage from abortion clinic bombings of the 1970s. Proceeds from the show will be split between Planned Parenthood and Downtown for Democracy, a Pac launched in 2003 in response to the US invasion of Iraq. The latter is volunteer run and supports cultural and political shows, as well as other forms of activism including educational efforts and advertising in swing states, voter registration, and youth outreach. Last year, the group launched the Protest Factory, a show and series of events at Jeffrey Deitch in New York meant to kickstart local activism which saw Cecily Brown and Kembra Pfahler leading sign-making classes, readings by Eileen Myles and Luc Sante, and a \u201cT-shirt debut\u201d featuring Richard Hell, Barbara Kruger, and Richard Prince, in collaboration with Supreme. \u201cThere are those chipping away at reproductive rights and they never stop,\u201d says Gina Nanni of Downtown for Democracy. \u201cThere is a generation that came up before Roe v Wade that will never forget, but a younger generation that takes certain rights for granted. We want all to be educated, that you can never let go of issues that are important, that being involved in the political process is the only way that we can maintain a society and law that reflects the will of the people.\u201d The show, which came together in a matter of weeks rather than months or years, reflects this immediacy. Wahi and Jampol continued to vet submissions up until launch. \u201cPeople were really enthusiastic about making this happen, especially at the beginning of an election year,\u201d explains Wahi. \u201cSo, we pulled all hands on deck, with volunteer help picking up work, and with consignment and loans. It was a huge team effort, but it\u2019s something that I hope will change people\u2019s minds about choice.\u201d That several blue chip artists, whose work fetches in the tens of thousands on auction, were willing to donate is truly unique. \u201cLiving in these times, \u2018no\u2019 is not an option,\u201d said the artist Rob Pruitt, who donated a full-scale work. \u201cSo many have worked so hard, and for so long, to safeguard these rights that the thought of this work being undone would be a tragedy. I said yes without thinking twice.\u201d Driving outreach was the team of Minter and Simmons, both longtime activists who frequently collaborate on causes and events. \u201cThere\u2019s very little time when we\u2019re not working on something together, and rarely does a project that\u2019s political come across my visions or hers that we don\u2019t share,\u201d said Simmons, who contributed a 1976 piece from her collection. Both Minter and Simmons remember life before Roe v Wade, which fueled their hands-on approach to the show. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect our children and our younger female friends.\u201d Simmons pointed out that the show is not a contribution to one candidate or campaign \u2013 it\u2019s issue driven, and in support of autonomy and empowerment. And it certainly is powerful. In Christen Clifford\u2019s I Want Your Blood, the artist and her collaborators literally bleed for the cause, creating a menagerie of vials and bottles containing blood meant to act as a totem for the sacredness of the human body. \u201cI found the process very satisfying,\u201d said participant and writer Jillian McManemin, whose donated blood sits in an antique Avon bottle. \u201cLike I was in on a naughty ancient ritual.\u201d The exhibition comes as part of a wave of art and social projects meant to normalize abortion, including Shout Your Abortion and Abortion Out Loud, and fits into the larger history of using art to power social change. There is a particularly strong thread to past downtown New York provocateurs such as Keith Haring, Gordon Matta Clark and Jean-Michel Basquiat, who used their generous creative spirit to shape and change prevalent attitudes. If you\u2019re unable to attend the second installment of the exhibition, Keith Corso, chief development officer of PPNY, offers a few words on participation. \u201cVote!\u201d he urges. \u201cGet your friends out to vote. Make sure everyone votes. It\u2019s going to be a very important year for all of us to stand up. Reproductive health rights are hanging in the balance!\u201d Abortion is Normal: Part One will be showing at Eva Presenhuber, New York until 18 January and Part Two will be showing at Arsenal Contemporary, New York from 21 January until 1 February",

Glossy black-cockatoo (Kangaroo Island sub-species)</strong></h2> <p>Kangaroo Island is home to a unique sub-species of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/07/kangaroo-island-bushfires-grave-fears-for-unique-wildlife-after-estimated-25000-koalas-killed\">Glossy black-cockatoo</a> and there are grave fears extensive areas of critical habitat have burned in fires that have devastated two-thirds of the island. In particular, there are concerns for the birds\u2019 nesting habitat. Two decades of conservation work by the Kangaroo Island community had brought numbers from as low as 150 in the 1990s to as high as 400 before the fires. Preliminary analysis suggests 50%-60% of their habitat has burned.</p> <h2><strong>2. Kangaroo Island dunnart</strong></h2> <p>Even before the fires, there were concerns for the future of the Kangaroo Island dunnart, a small marsupial found nowhere else in Australia. The species is listed as endangered under national environment law and there are fears the fires may have wiped out the animals. Ecologists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/07/kangaroo-island-bushfires-grave-fears-for-unique-wildlife-after-estimated-25000-koalas-killed\">spoken</a> about how cameras they set up to monitor the species in its habitat melted in the flames.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaad773ab3c9d7d94b9b06314668f0366949f767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaad773ab3c9d7d94b9b06314668f0366949f767/0_165_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kangaroo Island dunnart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The endangered Kangaroo Island dunnart, photographed with a sensor camera during a private land survey, west end of Kangaroo Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KI Land for Wildlife</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3. Koala</strong></h2> <p>The fires in northern New South Wales in October and November tore through key koala habitat in areas including Port Macquarie. Fires in East Gippsland in Victoria have also burnt through bushland where the species is found. Additionally, the species was introduced to Kangaroo Island in the 1920s and the island is home to Australia\u2019s only populations of the species that are chlamydia-free. Thousands of animals are estimated to have died in the disaster, however there are populations in other parts of the country that are not fire-affected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4397a43e15fd92aa49a779026368cba7da7b4a4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4397a43e15fd92aa49a779026368cba7da7b4a4a/0_1391_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Humane Society International\u2019s disaster relief team visit the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park which is caring for koalas and other stricken wildlife\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humane Society International\u2019s disaster relief team visit the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park which is caring for koalas and other stricken wildlife.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Quartermain/Humane Society International</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4. Hastings River mouse</strong></h2> <p>The Hastings River mouse is a small rodent that was already endangered under national environment laws before fire tore through its habitat in northern NSW. It is one of the species that experts will be looking to assess on the ground as not much is known about how it responds to fire. There are populations outside of fire-affected northern NSW, but the impact on its habitat in that region is believed to be large.</p> <h2><strong>5. Regent honeyeater</strong></h2> <p>Experts fear fires throughout NSW have destroyed habitat in several key parts of the state occupied by the critically endangered regent honeyeater. Before the fires, less than 400 birds remained in the wild. Birdlife Australia says preliminary analysis suggests habitat in Lake Cathie, Dunbogan and from Forster to Old Bar has been affected by fires. One of the species\u2019 main breeding strongholds is in the Capertee Valley, north of Lithgow, where bushland has burned as a result of the Gospers Mountain fire. The nearby Wolgan Valley is also a site used by the birds. Finally, nesting habitat in Burragorang is feared destroyed by the Green Wattle Creek fire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b2cb16e8c47ca3e3c6da644b0e384b1b94667d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b2cb16e8c47ca3e3c6da644b0e384b1b94667d8/0_130_3844_2307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A regent honeyeater\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The regent honeyeater was already one of Australia\u2019s numerous critically endangered animals before recent bushfires spread through several of its remaining habitats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Cook/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>6.

Large tracts of habitat for the Blue Mountains water skink have been destroyed.</p> <h2><strong>7. Brush-tailed rock-wallaby</strong></h2> <p>The brush-tailed rock-wallaby is listed as a vulnerable species nationally, and endangered in NSW. When fires destroy native vegetation they reduce the available habitat and food for species, even if they survive the blaze. The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service has been conducting air drops of carrots and sweet potatoes for brush-tailed rock-wallabies in areas including the Capertee and Wolgan valleys, Yengo national park, Kangaroo Valley, Jenolan, Oxley Wild Rivers and Curracubundi national parks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fad909af184e7ed82907deb7f58d113936faeb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fad909af184e7ed82907deb7f58d113936faeb6/0_17_1116_670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A brush-tailed rock wallaby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A brush-tailed rock wallaby, in the snow at the threatened native animal reserve Aussie Ark at Barrington Tops, NSW in August 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lachlan Gilding/Aussie Ark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8. Southern corroboree frog</strong></h2> <p>The fire at Dunns Road in NSW, now part of a mega-blaze, is making a slow march through alpine country in the Kosciuszko national park. The northern part of the alps is a stronghold for the southern corroboree frog, which is critically endangered. Experts also hold fears for the northern corroboree frog if fire moves into the Namadgi national park. The area is not far from Ginini Flats where the northern corroboree frog is found.</p> <h2><strong>9. Quokka</strong></h2> <p>Bushfires in the Stirling Range in Western Australia have destroyed key mainland habitat for the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-07/bushfires-cause-stirling-ranges-biodiversity-to-be-devastated/11844516\">quokka</a>.

Western ground parrot</strong></h2> <p>The critically endangered western ground parrot is one of Australia\u2019s species most threatened with extinction. Less than 150 individuals remain in the wild and a key threat to the remaining population in Cape Arid national park is fire. A bushfire before Christmas stopped just short of the bird\u2019s habitat, but experts fear it\u2019s only a matter of time before a fire goes through the area.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/07/australia-wildfires-animals-shelters-knitting\">Kangaroo pouches, koala mittens: knitters unite to aid animals in Australia fires</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>11. Northern eastern bristlebird</strong></h2> <p>The northern eastern bristlebird lives in a small and shrinking part of north-eastern NSW and south-eastern Queensland. It is estimated there were fewer than 50 left in the wild before this fire season, and its habitat has been reduced by more than 50% since the 1980s. It is critically endangered.

The ecologist Chris Dickman has estimated more than a billion animals have died around the country \u2013 a figure that excludes fish, frogs, bats and insects. On Monday, the government announced $50m to help rescue and protect wildlife affected by the crisis and environment groups released a list of fauna species for which they hold immediate concerns. But the list is far from exhaustive and there won\u2019t be a clear picture of the extent of the impact on plant and animal life until experts can access fire-ravaged habitats and conduct assessments. \u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d James Trezise, a policy analyst at the Australian Conservation Foundation, says. \u201cThe number of species and ecosystems that have been severely impacted across their ranges is almost certain to be much higher, especially when factoring in less well-known species of reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates.\u201d These are some of the species experts hold concerns for: 1.

      "body": "<p>It was with a touch of serendipity that Newcastle Jets\u2019 W-League game against Adelaide United, scheduled as part of a double header last Friday, was postponed due to air quality and temperature concerns; coach Craig Deans \u2013 who has taken the reins of the club\u2019s A-League team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/07/ernie-merrick-the-a-leagues-great-entertainer-exits-stage-right\">following the dismissal of Ernie Merrick</a> \u2013 would not have been at the helm of the women\u2019s team had the match been given the green light. </p> <p>Theoretically he could be back in charge of his side for the rescheduled match on 1 February which, by the form books at least, the Jets should expect to get something out of. But the fact the W-League team have not played since Deans was made interim coach of the men\u2019s team has meant the decision\u2019s true impact has been somewhat obscured and the optics of it have largely escaped scrutiny.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/09/consistency-of-matildas-squad-at-odds-with-inconsistency-of-messaging\">Consistency of Matildas squad at odds with inconsistency of messaging | Samantha Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI like working,\u201d Deans said with a chuckle when asked about the effective doubling of his workload. It\u2019s an almost extreme final conclusion of the \u201cone club\u201d philosophy \u2013 one club, one head coach, two first teams. But what happens if the Jets fail to appoint an A-League coach in the projected timeframe? How long is it reasonable to leave the W-League team with its head coach working double time?</p> <p>Explaining the situation last week, Jets CEO Lawrie McKinna noted Deans would ultimately \u201cstay with the women\u201d, and the complementary schedules of the two teams \u2013 the A-League side training during the day, W-League at night, as well as the teams\u2019 next two fixtures being double headers \u2013 made the temporary situation tenable while the hunt for Merrick\u2019s full-time replacement takes place.</p> <p>As Merrick didn\u2019t have an assistant coach, who would typically have stepped up, the club needed to look within to fill the role in the short-term. Deans, having been on the A-League bench multiple times this season, and having filled the role of interim A-League coach previously, is an obvious choice from the point of view of the men\u2019s side of the club. It\u2019s not so clear from the other point of view.</p> <p>The postponement of the W-League game on Friday might make the temporary solution <em>appear</em> more serendipitous. Deans was not expected to be on the W-League bench, with his long-time assistant coach Ash Wilson likely to have taken charge \u2013 theoretically meaning he might miss just that one game. Should Wilson take the mantle this weekend, the number of female head coaches in the W-League will double, albeit temporarily (the other being Canberra United\u2019s Heather Garriock). Appear is the key word here though; these results are by accident, not design.</p> <p>The Jets\u2019 call comes at a time where wider questions about how clubs and club-owning entities view the relationship between the male and female components of their operations. Just a couple of days after the Merrick-Deans decision was announced, Melbourne City owners City Football Group appointed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/09/nick-cushing-manchester-city-departure-strange-timing\">Manchester City\u2019s WSL head coach Nick Cushing to a role with the conglomerate\u2019s MLS side New York City</a>, a move puzzling in its timing and its implications for the remainder of City\u2019s WSL season. Also in England, Arsenal have updated their website to refer to its men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, rather than \u201cfirst team\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d.</p> <p>Newcastle over the last few years, it should be acknowledged, have worked to integrate the club\u2019s male and female sides after regaining control of the W-League team from NNSW Football in 2017. Shortly afterwards, the Jets became the first W-League club to pay a transfer fee when they re-signed Emily van Egmond from Wolfsburg.

      "bodyText": "It was with a touch of serendipity that Newcastle Jets\u2019 W-League game against Adelaide United, scheduled as part of a double header last Friday, was postponed due to air quality and temperature concerns; coach Craig Deans \u2013 who has taken the reins of the club\u2019s A-League team following the dismissal of Ernie Merrick \u2013 would not have been at the helm of the women\u2019s team had the match been given the green light. Theoretically he could be back in charge of his side for the rescheduled match on 1 February which, by the form books at least, the Jets should expect to get something out of. But the fact the W-League team have not played since Deans was made interim coach of the men\u2019s team has meant the decision\u2019s true impact has been somewhat obscured and the optics of it have largely escaped scrutiny. \u201cI like working,\u201d Deans said with a chuckle when asked about the effective doubling of his workload. It\u2019s an almost extreme final conclusion of the \u201cone club\u201d philosophy \u2013 one club, one head coach, two first teams. But what happens if the Jets fail to appoint an A-League coach in the projected timeframe? How long is it reasonable to leave the W-League team with its head coach working double time? Explaining the situation last week, Jets CEO Lawrie McKinna noted Deans would ultimately \u201cstay with the women\u201d, and the complementary schedules of the two teams \u2013 the A-League side training during the day, W-League at night, as well as the teams\u2019 next two fixtures being double headers \u2013 made the temporary situation tenable while the hunt for Merrick\u2019s full-time replacement takes place. As Merrick didn\u2019t have an assistant coach, who would typically have stepped up, the club needed to look within to fill the role in the short-term. Deans, having been on the A-League bench multiple times this season, and having filled the role of interim A-League coach previously, is an obvious choice from the point of view of the men\u2019s side of the club. It\u2019s not so clear from the other point of view. The postponement of the W-League game on Friday might make the temporary solution appear more serendipitous. Deans was not expected to be on the W-League bench, with his long-time assistant coach Ash Wilson likely to have taken charge \u2013 theoretically meaning he might miss just that one game. Should Wilson take the mantle this weekend, the number of female head coaches in the W-League will double, albeit temporarily (the other being Canberra United\u2019s Heather Garriock). Appear is the key word here though; these results are by accident, not design. The Jets\u2019 call comes at a time where wider questions about how clubs and club-owning entities view the relationship between the male and female components of their operations. Just a couple of days after the Merrick-Deans decision was announced, Melbourne City owners City Football Group appointed Manchester City\u2019s WSL head coach Nick Cushing to a role with the conglomerate\u2019s MLS side New York City, a move puzzling in its timing and its implications for the remainder of City\u2019s WSL season. Also in England, Arsenal have updated their website to refer to its men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, rather than \u201cfirst team\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d. Newcastle over the last few years, it should be acknowledged, have worked to integrate the club\u2019s male and female sides after regaining control of the W-League team from NNSW Football in 2017. Shortly afterwards, the Jets became the first W-League club to pay a transfer fee when they re-signed Emily van Egmond from Wolfsburg. The last couple of PFA season reviews have found that, of all W-League players, those in Jets shirts were the most satisfied with their club\u2019s efforts to integrate the W-League programme. But in spite of this context it is difficult to ignore some of the hypothetical questions the situation invites. Would it be acceptable if the Jets\u2019 W-League team were in their own playoffs race? Would reassigning their coach to the A-League, even just on a temporary basis, happen in those circumstances? What if the situation was reversed? If a W-League team\u2019s playoff hopes were under threat and their coach dismissed, would the club look to its A-League set-up to fill that particular void? The current situation should prompt other clubs to consider more thoroughly their future decision making, particularly as the league\u2019s \u201cone club\u201d philosophy continues to bed in. Not because of situational serendipity; not because of hypotheticals; but because as the game grows and similar situations arise, these questions will continue to resonate.",

The survey, undertaken from 7-11 January, also shows Anthony Albanese has overtaken Morrison as preferred prime minister for the first time since he became leader of the Labor party following the May election. As the government fends off criticism of its response to the fires, the survey of 1,081 voters shows a shift in the number of people who disapprove of Morrison\u2019s performance, which has increased from 43% in December to 52%. This has been driven by an increase in those who strongly disapprove \u2013 up from 22% in December to 32%. However, the gauge of voter sentiment shows that those who are increasingly unhappy with Morrison are Labor and undecided voters, with the prime minister\u2019s approval rating among Coalition supporters changing only from 82% in December to 79%. The number of Labor voters who now \u201cstrongly disapprove\u201d of Morrison\u2019s performance has increased from 36% in December to 52%, indicating an increased polarisation of political views compared to last year. Overall, only around a third (32%) of people approve of Morrison\u2019s handling of the current bushfires crisis, while 36% strongly disapprove of his performance. This compares unfavourably with how voters rate the performance of state premiers, with 55% of voters in New South Wales endorsing Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s response, and 58% of Victorians believing Daniel Andrews has performed well. Just 11% of Labor voters and 23% of those voting for another party approve of Morrison\u2019s performance. On Sunday, Morrison rejected suggestions that the federal government was unprepared for the risk of bushfires, saying \u201cthe recommendations that were put to us were acted upon\u201d. However, according to the survey, 78% of people agreed that the federal government was \u201cunderprepared for the risk of bushfires this season\u201d. A similar number (79%) believe the prime minister should have met with experts before the fire season \u201cto plan a coordinated response to the risk\u201d, in response to revelations that a group of former fire chiefs had been trying unsuccessfully to secure a meeting with Morrison since April. The prime minister has also argued that Australia has always had bushfires like those experienced in the current season, but around half of voters (52%) disagreed with the statement. As support for Morrison has softened, so too has his standing as preferred prime minister, with 39% now saying Albanese would be better in the role, compared to 36% for Morrison. This is a 6 percentage point drop for Morrison since November, which has coincided with an 11 percentage point increase for Albanese. A quarter of voters are still undecided, slightly fewer than when the question was last asked in November when 29% did not know. While the majority of the Coalition base (64%) approve of Morrison\u2019s response to the bushfire crisis that has so far claimed 28 lives and more than 2,000 homes, a growing number of voters are associating him with negative attributes. Since October last year, the view that Morrison is \u201cgood in a crisis\u201d has fallen from 51% to 32% \u2013 a massive 19% drop, while the prime minister is also less likely to be seen as visionary (down from 42% to 30%), and as hard-working (down from 63% to 53%). Coalition voters were equally damning in their assessment of Morrison\u2019s performance, with those believing he is \u201cgood in a crisis\u201d dropping from 79% to 61%. Fewer people see him as a \u201ccapable leader\u201d, down 9 points to 45%, while more people now see him as narrow minded (now 54%, from 47% in October), arrogant (now 51%, from 44%) and out of touch with ordinary Australians (now 62%, from 56%). A majority of voters still regard Morrison as \u201cintelligent\u201d, a trait that remains one of the top three attributes associated with the prime minister. For Albanese, approval of his performance has remained steady, moving from 39% to 43% between December and January. Among Labor voters, 64% either approve or strongly approve of Albanese\u2019s performance, with just 13% of the Labor base registering disapproval. Voters are also becoming more familiar with Albanese, with those who don\u2019t know about the opposition leader\u2019s performance now at 27%, the lowest since he became leader and down from 33% in December.",

      "bodyText": "The impact of climate change over the past five months across Australia has caused climate change deniers within the media and governments to quickly update their tactics to a new, sinister position. Gone are the plans to just keep lying for the next decade that activists such as Greta Thunberg are predicting that the world is going to end in 2030, or to continue to flub and fudge the science \u2013 no real warming since 1998, 2005, 2010, 2016! Solar activity! Volcanoes! Greenland! Now of course the feculent minds of columnists and government MPs will continue to spout these lies \u2013 when has reality ever been an impediment to their effluent-driven utterances? But the months of fires across southern Queensland, northern New South Wales, the horrors of Gippsland, the NSW south coast and Kangaroo Island over Christmas and new year, the smoke haze across Sydney and Canberra and now Melbourne, has shifted forwards their timetable of obfuscation. Five months ago they could still get away with wheeling out the \u201cnow is not the time\u201d line, or to confidently state that you cannot link this bushfire to climate change. But now such lines are greeted with universal scorn. Last year was the hottest and driest calendar year in Australia\u2019s recorded history. That created the conditions for the fires, and they do not exist without climate change. At this point any climate change denier with access to a social media account will tell you that rainfall has actually increased over the past century in Australia. That is true, and also utterly irrelevant and designed to mislead. Climate change impacts have only really taken off since the late 1960s and early 70s, and not surprisingly, given the size and differing climates of Australia, the impact on rainfall has varied. Over the past 50 years the trend rate of rainfall in northern Australia has barely changed \u2013 if anything, it has risen a bit (great if you like rain and you live in Broome) but in south-eastern Australia the trend is clearly falling: So now that they are unable to say \u201cnow is not the time\u201d, they have adapted. Rather than suggest no connection with climate change, they have shifted to arguing there is no connection between any particular climate change policy and bushfires. Scott Morrison argued last week on ABC\u2019s 7.30: \u201cYou cannot link any individual single emissions reduction policy of a country \u2013 whether it\u2019s Australia or anyone else \u2013 to any specific fire event. I mean, that\u2019s just absurd.\u201d Yes, it is absurd, because no one is actually arguing that. But the prime minister is very good at defeating arguments no one is making. He is also very good at giving false hope. Right now columnists and journalists are writing articles expressing belief that maybe Morrison is about to shift the government\u2019s climate change policy. Perhaps he will, but I have seen Charlie Brown try to kick this football before and I remain unpersuaded because I have listened to what the prime minister himself has said just this past week. Three times David Speers asked him on Sunday if the government would increase its emissions targets. Morrison responded with: \u201cWell, the cabinet and the government will continue to evolve our policies.\u201d Then he added: \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is I\u2019m not going to put someone\u2019s job at risk, a region\u2019s, town\u2019s future at risk.\u201d And finally: \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is we want to reduce emissions and do the best job we possibly can and get better and better and better at it.\u201d What he is saying is \u201cno\u201d. Nothing he has said suggests any change in policy that will actually involve emissions reductions. Instead he has quickly adopted the new go-to response of climate change deniers \u2013 that of the need to adapt and \u201cimprove resilience\u201d. What does that mean? It means the next step in climate change denial \u2013 a step I joked grimly last month was not far away. Alas, it is no longer a joke. The new argument is that, yes climate change is probably to blame, but we can\u2019t do anything about it, and anyway it\u2019s too late now, so let\u2019s \u201cadapt\u201d. And what does that adaptation involve? According to Morrison: \u201cBuilding dams is key to that. Native vegetation management is key to that. Land clearing is key to that.\u201d In other words doing the very things conservatives have been desirous of for the past century \u2013 building dams, reducing national parks and increasing land clearing. They will hand out grants to organisations and areas most electorally beneficial and all the while trumpet that they are dealing with the issue in a practical way, unlike the opposition which, they argue, will be trying to kill jobs. Conservatives hate dealing with the actual source of problems \u2013 they much prefer handing out the graft; which is appropriate when you realise climate change denialism is the biggest con in political and media history. And of course emissions will rise while they suggest they are actually being reduced. The line from Morrison is that we will \u201cmeet and beat\u201d our Paris emissions reductions targets. The current figures from his own government show that rather than reduce emissions in 2030 by 26% below 2005 levels, we are on track to cut them by just 16%. But the real problem \u2013 one that needs much more attention than interviewers now give it \u2013 is the 26% target itself has no basis in science as being anywhere near enough to keep temperatures below 1.5C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in 2018 that to keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5C, C02 emissions needed to \u201cdecline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050\u201d. Forty-five per cent, not 26%. And that is a 45% reduction of actual emissions, not including farcical \u201cland use\u201d figures. When we exclude land use, our 26% target really becomes closer to 15%. Morrison boasting that Australia will meet and beat its target is like someone boasting that they are beating their target of 10 minutes of exercise a day, and hoping everyone ignores that doctors recommended 30 minutes. A 45% cut of real emissions is well below what the government is targeting and miles below our current projections: The reality is, even while including land use, we are still well short of where we need to be: And so we enter the next stage of climate change politics \u2013 a subtle and sinister shift \u2013 the talk will be about practical measures of adaptation rather than of reducing emissions: gone will be direct action, in its place will be \u201cdirect adaptation\u201d. It is a stage that, if successful, will signal the end for our planet. Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

Those doctors, by the way, seem to have been strangely silent, post-legal case. No doubt so as to empower women better. Still, Goop is worth more than a quarter of a billion dollars, largely because of Gwyneth talking about her vagina, so no wonder she has a smile on her face (or maybe that\u2019s just the vaginal egg). So, light that candle, breathe deep and accept the facts: this is Gwyneth\u2019s vagina. And the rest of us just live in it. Need style counsel?

Plaintiffs could show liability and a judge or jury would likely rule in their favor, but it might be difficult for plaintiffs to find Iranian assets from which plaintiffs can be compensated. </p> \n   <p>There also may be international laws and treaties and perhaps tariffs that govern, but I think that the Iranian Government could be held responsible, because its officials clearly made the mistake.

Several people have been wounded, according to witness accounts provided to the Guardian. They said security forces initially fired teargas to disperse the crowds and then started firing bullets. You can read the full story here. The dispute over the arrest of Britain\u2019s ambassador to Tehran this weekend has escalated as the Foreign Office summoned the Iranian ambassador to protest about the incident. Rob Macaire was held briefly on Saturday as anti-government demonstrations broke out in Tehran. The ambassador was accused of taking part in the protests, a claim he denies. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: This was an unacceptable breach of the Vienna convention and it needs to be investigated. We are seeking full assurances from the Iranian government that this will never happen again. The FCO has summoned the Iranian ambassador today to convey our strong objections. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister has told Reuters that representatives of five nations whose citizens died when an airliner was shot down by Iran last week will meet in London on Thursday to discuss possible legal action. One of Iran\u2019s most popular female actors has criticised the government in Tehran in a post on Instagram, telling her almost 6 million followers that \u201cwe are not citizens\u201d but \u201ccaptives\u201d. Taraneh Alidoosti \u2013 who has appeared in an Oscar-nominated film and acclaimed TV dramas \u2013 wrote: \u201cI fought this dream for a long time and didn\u2019t want to accept it. We are not citizens. We never were. We are captives.\u201d In a series of viral tweets, the head of a Canadian packaged meat company has lashed out at Donald Trump, suggesting the US president bears culpability for Iranian missiles that brought down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 last week. Most of the 167 passengers on board were bound for Canada. \u201cU.S. government leaders unconstrained by checks/balances, concocted an ill-conceived plan to divert focus from political woes. The world knows Iran is a dangerous state, but the world found a path to contain it; not perfect but by most accounts it was the right direction,\u201d wrote Michael McCain, the chief executive of Maple Leaf Foods, calling Trump a \u201cnarcissist\u201dwho has destabilised the Middle East. \u201cThe collateral damage of this irresponsible, dangerous, ill-conceived behaviour? 63 Canadians needlessly lost their lives in the crossfire, including the family of one of my [Maple Leaf Food] colleagues (his wife + 11 year old son)! We are mourning and I am livid.\u201d The thread has been \u2018liked\u2019 more than 45,000 times, suggesting the post is striking a nerve with Canadians. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has so far resisted weighing in on the role US actions may have played in the tragedy. \u201cI think it is too soon to be drawing conclusions or assigning blame or responsibility in whatever proportions,\u201d he said last week. McCain\u2019s post \u2014 the boldest criticism so far from the Canadian business community \u2014 follows a series of emotional vigils across the country over the weekend. Speaking to thousands of mourners in Edmonton, Trudeau said the country would not rest until there was justice and accountability for victims and their families. Carl Tobias, professor of law at the University of Richmond, in the US state of Virginia, has commented on whether the families of victims of the Iran plane crash might be able to sue the Iranian government. \u201cMuch remains unclear, so caution is the byword. However, if, as has been reported and admitted, the Iranian missile struck the plane \u2018unintentionally\u2019 or mistakenly, which I consider to mean negligently, exposure to civil liability for the lives lost would be relatively clear,\u201d he wrote in an email to the Guardian\u2019s international correspondent Michael Safi. \u201cThis would mean that the survivors might be able to recover for their losses in US, Canadian, and I assume Ukrainian civil courts.\u201d There are technical procedural issues about filing suit, but the US and Canadian courts would be amenable to survivor suits. Plaintiffs could show liability and a judge or jury would likely rule in their favor, but it might be difficult for plaintiffs to find Iranian assets from which plaintiffs can be compensated. There also may be international laws and treaties and perhaps tariffs that govern, but I think that the Iranian Government could be held responsible, because its officials clearly made the mistake. There may also be possible liability imposed on the airline for flying in this airspace given the recent tensions, but that seems less clear now. It looks like the internet could be being throttled at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, where there are protests. You can read some background to internet shutdowns in Iran here: This video posted by the BBC purports to show protesters outside Sharif University of Technology in Tehran chanting \u201ckill the mullahs\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister has told Reuters that representatives of five nations whose citizens died when an airliner was shot down by Iran last week will meet in London on Thursday to discuss possible legal action. Speaking at the sidelines of an official visit to Singapore on Monday, Vadym Prystaiko said the countries would also discuss compensation and the investigation into the incident. Footage circulated by Iranian activists on Monday morning shows a new gathering at Tehran\u2019s Sharif University and another at the Sharif University in Isfahan, the first signs that the public demonstrations that erupted on Saturday may continue for a third day. \u201cBasiji go away!\u201d people in Isfahan are heard shouting, in reference to pro-regime militiamen. \u201cClerics must go!\u201d I\u2019ve also just heard a voice message from an activist in Tehran who says regime supporters are trying to take over public spaces: It is fucked around Valiasr Square [in Tehran]. They brought huge loudspeakers and are playing noha [lamentation songs]. And there are around 20 to 30 Revolutionary Guards in their uniforms. One of Iran\u2019s most popular female actors has bluntly criticised the government in Tehran in a post on Instagram, telling her almost 6 million followers that \u201cwe are not citizens\u201d but \u201ccaptives\u201d. Taraneh Alidoosti \u2013 who has appeared in an Oscar-nominated film and acclaimed TV dramas \u2013 wrote: \u201cI fought this dream for a long time and didn\u2019t want to accept it. We are not citizens. We never were. We are captives.\u201d Alidoosti said that she had replaced her profile picture with the colour black in mourning for demonstrators shot dead by security forces last November. The colour had nothing to do with official \u201cmourning\u201d following the assassination on 3 January of Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani, by a US drone, she said. The Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding has the full story \u2013 Iranian authorities appear to have fired live ammunition to disperse crowds in Tehran protesting over the Iranian military\u2019s shooting down of a commercial airliner with 176 people onboard. Several people have been wounded, according to witness accounts provided to the Guardian. They said security forces initially fired teargas to disperse the crowds and then started firing bullets. You can read the full story here. Iran\u2019s government spokesman has dismissed tweets by Donald Trump, telling the country\u2019s authorities in Farsi and English not to kill protesters and praising the \u201cgreat Iranian people\u201d. Ali Rabiei said the US president was shedding \u201ccrocodile tears\u201d when voicing concern for Iranians. The UK government will tell Iran\u2019s ambassador in London it has \u201cstrong objections\u201d to the arrest of the UK\u2019s top diplomat in Tehran. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: In relation to the arrest of the UK\u2019s ambassador over the weekend, I would say this was an unacceptable breach of the Vienna convention and it needs to be investigated. We are seeking full assurances from the Iranian government that this will never happen again. The FCO has summoned the Iranian ambassador today to convey our strong objections. Downing Street has also indicated that the families of the victims of the downed Ukraine International Airlines flight could seek compensation from the Iranian government. Downing Street has indicated that the families of the victims of the downed Ukraine International Airlines flight could seek compensation from the Iranian government. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman told journalists in Westminster: As a first step we need a comprehensive, transparent and independent investigation to know exactly what happened. Of course, the families of the four British victims deserve justice and closure and we will continue to do everything we can to support them in getting that, including options for compensation. The Foreign Office has summoned Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, to protest at the brief detention of Rob Macaire, the British ambassador in Tehran, Downing Street has said. Macaire was held briefly on Saturday as anti-government demonstrations broke out in Tehran over the shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner by Iranian forces. The ambassador was accused of taking part in the protests, a claim he denies. A No 10 spokesman said: This was an unacceptable breach of the Vienna convention, and it needs to be investigated. We are seeking full assurances from the Iranian government that this will never happen again. The FCO has summoned the Iranian ambassador today to convey our strong objections. The meeting is expected to take place this afternoon. Domonic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, will update MPs on Iran when he speaks to the Commons in the Queen\u2019s speech debate later on Monday. From the Telegraph\u2019s Middle East correspondent: Michael H Fuchs, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and a former deputy assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, has written in the Guardian that we cannot allow Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy to be normalised. After three years of dangerously and unnecessarily escalating tensions with Iran, Donald Trump rang in the new year by creating a crisis that almost started a war with Iran \u2013 and still very well could. As we enter the fourth year of Trump\u2019s presidency, it is more necessary than ever to remind ourselves daily: this is not normal. The list of despicable domestic actions by Trump that must not be normalized is long \u2013 from the policy separating migrant children from their parents and detaining them in cages to the president\u2019s call for his critics to be investigated or jailed. Here\u2019s a useful visual guide to what we know about the crashing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752: From the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor: Reuters is reporting that Iran\u2019s government spokesman has dismissed tweets by Trump telling the country\u2019s authorities in Farsi and English not to kill protesters. The US president praised the \u201cgreat Iranian people\u201d. Ali Rabiei said Trump was shedding \u201ccrocodile tears\u201d when voicing concern for Iranians. Rabiei said Britain\u2019s ambassador to Iran had acted in a way that was \u201ccompletely unprofessional and unacceptable\u201d, after he was briefly detained near a protest. The envoy said he was arrested after attending a vigil and had left when it turned political. Iranian authorities appear to have fired live ammunition to disperse protesters in Tehran, wounding several people, according to witness accounts provided to the Guardian and footage circulating on social media. Our international correspondent, Michael Safi, has reported that security forces initially fired teargas to disperse the crowds and then started firing bullets. \u201cIt was a very bad situation,\u201d the woman, who asked not to be identified, said in a message provided to the Iranian activist Masih Alinejad. Tehran\u2019s police chief said in a statement on Monday that no shots were fired during Sunday\u2019s events and that officers were under orders to show restraint. Read the full story here: France and Russia have a shared desire to safeguard Iran\u2019s nuclear deal, French President Emmanuel Macron has said. According to Reuters, Macron said in a statement he had a phone call on Sunday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said he remained committed to the deal. Leaders of Britain, France and Germany on Sunday called on Iran to return to full compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and refrain from further violence. The crashing of the Ukrainian Airlines jet outside Tehran has drawn inevitable comparisons with MH17, brought down over the east of Ukraine by a Russian missile five years ago. The Guardian\u2019s central and eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker reports on how \u2013 yet again \u2013 Ukraine has been dragged into a conflict not of its own making. \u201cUkraine seems to have a dark cloud over it,\u201d said Alina Polyakova of the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s fighting a war against Russia, and has become part of the political war in the US. This tragedy again puts Ukraine in the middle of conflicts that have nothing to do with it.\u201d While the plane\u2019s shooting down had a terrible cost in human life, Ukraine\u2019s unwanted starring role in the US impeachment disaster has come with costs to military aid, political alliances and reputation. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe,\u201d said Pavlo Klimkin, who was the country\u2019s foreign minister until last August. \u201cUkraine now has the reputation of a place that can cause all kinds of trouble. It\u2019s the opposite of everything we were working for.\u201d You can read our latest story on the events in Iran from Guardian international correspondent, Michael Safi, here. The resurgent anti-government protests threaten to tip Iran\u2019s regime into crisis just as it was riding a wave of nationalist sentiment after the killing of top general Qassem Suleimani by a US drone strike on 3 January. Iran\u2019s response \u2013 a carefully calibrated but heavily publicised ballistic missile attack on US forces in Iraq last Wednesday \u2013 was supposed to bring catharsis and demonstrate the regime\u2019s power. Instead, by leading to the shooting down of a passenger jet loaded with Iranian citizens, it has humiliated the military and exposed some of its top leaders as having lied to the country for days until the admission on Saturday morning that an Iranian missile was responsible for the crash. Two state TV hosts resigned in protest over false reporting over the incident and Iranian media outlets joined the outcry, running front-page headlines that read, \u201cAshamed\u201d and \u201cUnbelievable\u201d. The governments of France, Germany and the UK \u2013 the \u201cE3\u201d \u2013 issued a statement yesterday saying that they were still committed to the Iran nuclear deal, despite the collapse in Iran/US relations. They said: Today, our message is clear: we remain committed to the JCPoA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] and to preserving it; we urge Iran to reverse all measures inconsistent with the agreement and return to full compliance; we call on Iran to refrain from further violent action or proliferation; and we remain ready to engage with Iran on this agenda in order to preserve the stability of the region. But President Donald Trump tweeted late last night UK time that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if Iran wanted to negotiate with the US. He was responding to comments by the national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, who said sanctions were ramping up pressure on Tehran and that the country was \u201cgoing to have no other choice but to come to the table\u201d. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the protests in Iran and the fallout from the downing of a passenger jet outside Tehran last week. Authorities in Iran are struggling to contain public anger after they admitted on Saturday that the country\u2019s military was responsible for shooting down a commercial airliner with 176 people onboard. Police used teargas to break up a second day of protests in Tehran on Sunday, with demonstrations spreading to other cities. Speaking at a vigil yesterday, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, his voice sometimes breaking, said he would \u201cpursue justice and accountability\u201d for those killed in the disaster. At least 57 Canadians died in the crash, most of them of Iranian descent, in one of the biggest single losses of life the country has suffered in 40 years. \u201cYou may feel unbearably lonely, but you are not alone. Your entire country stands with you, tonight, tomorrow, and in all the years to come,\u201d he told a crowd of 1,700 in Edmonton, Alberta, home to 13 of the victims. Meanwhile, both Boris Johnson and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have condemned the brief arrest and detention on Saturday of the British ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire. Macaire said he had attended an event that advertised itself as being a vigil for those who died in the crash, but Tehran said it had summoned the ambassador to justify his \u201cillegal and inappropriate presence\u201d at the protest.

      "bodyText": "Cory Booker has become the latest candidate of colour to drop out of the Democratic presidential race, citing a lack of funds. \u201cIt\u2019s with a full heart that I share this news \u2013 I\u2019ve made the decision to suspend my campaign for president,\u201d the senator from New Jersey wrote in an email to supporters, adding that he had always said he would withdraw \u201cif there was no longer a path to victory\u201d. Booker\u2019s departure, following those of Kamala Harris and Juli\u00e1n Castro, is a stark measure of dwindling diversity in the Democratic field, which began with a record number of women and people of colour. Tuesday\u2019s debate in Iowa will feature only white candidates. They include the billionaire Tom Steyer who, along with fellow businessman Michael Bloomberg, has poured millions of dollars in TV advertising and grassroots efforts. Harris, a senator from California, withdrew in December, saying she could not afford to go on. Booker complained then there were \u201cmore billionaires than black people\u201d in the field. Now only one African American candidate remains: Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, who entered late and is seen as having virtually no chance. As an African American offering an upbeat message of hope, Booker \u2013 who launched the effort on 1 February 2019, the first day of Black History Month \u2013 drew comparisons with the former president Barack Obama, but his campaign never caught fire. He touted numerous endorsements from officials in Iowa and had some memorable debate exchanges with Joe Biden, including over the former vice-president\u2019s opposition to legalising recreational marijuana. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Booker joked. But he never broke into the top tier in any opinion poll and failed to make the December debate stage. In the last three months of 2019, he raised only $6.6m \u2013 about $28m less than the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. A 50-year-old bachelor, Booker was also an unconventional candidate who skipped hotels to sleep in supporters\u2019 homes and talked about his love of Star Trek. He was joined on the trail by his girlfriend, the actor and activist Rosario Dawson. Criticisms of Booker concerned his record as mayor of Newark, New Jersey, and his closeness to big business. In the 2014 midterm elections, he was the biggest recipient of Wall Street donations, even ahead of the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell. On the campaign trail, his optimistic message proved out of kilter with the times. On Monday, like other candidates before him, Booker was quickly mocked by Donald Trump via Twitter. \u201cReally Big Breaking News (Kidding): Booker, who was in zero polling territory, just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cNow I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him! In his message to supporters, Booker acknowledged that the upcoming impeachment trial in the Senate was a factor in the timing of his decision. \u201cOur campaign has reached the point where we need more money to scale up and continue building a campaign that can win \u2013 money we don\u2019t have, and money that is harder to raise because I won\u2019t be on the next debate stage and because the urgent business of impeachment will rightly be keeping me in Washington. \u201cSo I\u2019ve chosen to suspend my campaign now, take care of my wonderful staff and give you time to consider the other strong choices in the field.\u201d It was clear on Monday that Booker had earned the respect of his fellow candidates. The Minnesota senator Amy Klobucha, who will debate this week, wrote: \u201cI will miss my friend Cory Booker so much on the campaign trail. We were friends before this started and are even better friends now. The one thing about Cory \u2013 he never stops standing up for what is right \u2026 so, the best is yet to come!\u201d The entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted: \u201cCory Booker \u2013 my friend, my brother. Running alongside you has been one of the joyous parts of this race. You inspire me and millions of other Americans to be better and do better. I will miss seeing you and Rosario on the trail, but not for long. The fight continues.\u201d Steyer said: \u201cSenator Booker\u2019s commitment and love for the country is clear. He\u2019s right that uniting as a people is how we tackle our biggest challenges. I know he\u2019s going to continue to lead in this fight.\u201d Stacey Abrams, who in Georgia in 2018 narrowly failed in her bid to become America\u2019s first black female governor, wrote on Twitter: \u201cMy friend Sen Cory Booker has been \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 a light that knows our nation is capable of so much more. \u201cThank you for your relentless optimism, grounded not in na\u00efvet\u00e9 but a deep understanding of what we can do when we tell the truth [and] unleash the capacity of all.\u201d Activists praised Booker for the issues he raised on the national stage, from criminal justice reform to proposing a national gun-licensing programme to spotlighting LGBTQ+ rights. The Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation tweeted: \u201cThank you Cory Booker for standing up for LGBTQ people on the campaign trail and beyond. Your leadership on LGBTQ issues has been incredible.\u201d Booker is now expected to run for re-election to the Senate in November. In his message, he said: \u201cI will be doing everything in my power to elect the eventual Democratic nominee for president, whomever that may be, and to elect great Democrats to the Senate and up and down the ballot. \u201c2020 is the most important election of our lifetimes \u2013 we have to beat Donald Trump \u2026 but beating Trump is the floor, not the ceiling.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Between the raging Australian wildfires and the precipice of the third world war, 2020 didn\u2019t exactly get off to a great start. And it probably isn\u2019t going to get much better either, since the year will also mark the end of a number of your favourite television shows. Here\u2019s a roundup of the key series preparing to come to an end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/09/sitcoms-broadway-musicals\">Sitcoms that should and shouldn't be turned into Broadway musicals</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The Good Place</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82b816a3e20004f4d31ab1926f003c44e154a341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82b816a3e20004f4d31ab1926f003c44e154a341/0_99_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>True, The Good Place isn\u2019t the show that it once was. What began as a truly delightful, optimistic exploration of ethics has gown saggy and directionless, in part thanks to that unnecessarily long stretch where we were subjected to The Worst Australian Accents Ever Heard By Human Ears. Nevertheless, with just four episodes left, it\u2019s still sad to say goodbye to Team Cockroach. If we get to the end of the year without anyone greenlighting a Joey-style spin-off for Janet, I will personally be very upset indeed.</p> <h2>Homeland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6938c92a1349d32045253e9213bb0012617c45c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6938c92a1349d32045253e9213bb0012617c45c/0_34_2850_1710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homeland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ll be honest here. I, like you, didn\u2019t realise that Homeland was still on. Once the Brody storyline came to its own absurdly silly conclusion, Homeland devolved into something much more flat and uninteresting. Did you know that this will be the eighth season of Homeland? Can you remember a single thing about the seventh, sixth or fifth seasons? Me neither. But hopefully it can rally this year and end big. Carrie Mathison has been though a comically huge amount this last decade. If this last run can tie up her story with enough grace, this could be worth watching.</p> <h2>Schitt\u2019s Creek</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3867a8de0be30fd16e3fb891501dd6f1059484b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3867a8de0be30fd16e3fb891501dd6f1059484b8/0_85_7028_4216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schitt's Creek\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Now this one is sad. The first episode of Schitt\u2019s Creek only appeared in 2015, but in that time it has shaken off its rusty sitcom premise to become something truly special. It\u2019s a warm, wonderful, inclusive show that has a tendency to make every viewer feel like the first person to ever discover it. There will be so much to miss when Schitt\u2019s Creek leaves us \u2013 not least Catherine O\u2019Hara\u2019s breathtakingly weird performance as Moira \u2013 and there are sure to be tears along the way.</p> <h2>BoJack Horseman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"263790c65a891511d4457a36e13ed9fb64951bf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/263790c65a891511d4457a36e13ed9fb64951bf7/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Like Schitt\u2019s Creek, BoJack is another series that managed to slip its potentially horrible premise \u2013 a horse is a Hollywood has-been \u2013 and become something nuanced and beautiful. BoJack has been sad as much as it has been funny, with every repercussion to every horrible decision tending to play out in full before us. This final season has been split in two. The first half ended on an incredibly ominous note, as BoJack\u2019s quest for redemption butted hard against the damage that his behaviour has caused. Honestly, these last episodes could go either way. We might see a happy Hollywood ending, or something unbelievably dark could be in store.</p> <h2>GLOW</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"219f52fa82eff1343f4b46b79a36f3d5f9e591b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/219f52fa82eff1343f4b46b79a36f3d5f9e591b4/0_87_1656_994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"GLOW\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It only seems like yesterday that we were being introduced to the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, and yet now it\u2019s coming to an end. One of the best \u2013 if not the best \u2013 Netflix Original series, GLOW had so much going for it. It hit the peaks of 1980s nostalgia with more accuracy and panache than its stablemate Stranger Things. It was able to surf genres, skipping from comedy to drama to flat-out parody, with an ease that remains untouchable. In Betty Gilpin it uncovered one of the best actors of the modern age. There\u2019s no word about how the show plans to wrap up, but nevertheless this will be a hard one to leave.</p> <h2>Modern Family</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10c1e92a050efd331608e5670fea8153c81c4934\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10c1e92a050efd331608e5670fea8153c81c4934/0_191_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Family\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Now that even the youngest cast members are well into their mid-40s, it is finally time to say goodbye to the Pritchetts and the Dunphys. Modern Family has become a bit of a dinosaur of late. The child actors are now adults. The adult actors are now sleepwalking. The product placement episodes are glaring enough to be nauseating. And yet on its way out, perhaps the show can recapture some of the frenetic warmth that made us love it all those years ago. Here\u2019s hoping.</p> <h2>Fresh Off the Boat</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2207001a3314f7537f1be5476739d6a1245bb834\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2207001a3314f7537f1be5476739d6a1245bb834/0_174_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Everyone knew this was coming. As soon as Constance Wu used her social media presence to complain about its recommission last year, Fresh Off the Boat\u2019s days were numbered. The bad news is that it\u2019s a real shame; Fresh Off the Boat wasn\u2019t just an important sitcom in terms of authentic diversity, but it was also capable of being very funny. The good news is that we still get a whole season of watching Wu do her best to hide the fact that she really doesn\u2019t want to be there.</p>",

The technology could boost the number of livers available for transplantation and offer new approaches to treating diseases such as liver cancer. In 2018-19 1,010 liver transplants were carried out. At the end of March 2019 there were 432 people waiting for the procedure. While about 60% of those in need receive a liver within six months, others face waits of two or more years. Some die before a liver can be transplanted. Livers are typically only stored for about nine to 12 hours on ice before transplant. In 2018 researchers in the UK published a report on system that allows livers to be kept at body temperature for 24 hours, a move that the lead author said at the time \u201cimproved both the transplant success rate as well as the number of livers available for transplant\u201d. Now experts have pushed such an approach even further, revealing a system that allows human livers to be stored for a week just below body temperature. \u201cThis is a different type of machine that we [had] to develop to reach seven days,\u201d said Prof Pierre-Alain Clavien, co-author of the research from University Hospital Zurich. The week-long storage, the researchers say, would not only increase the distance over which organs can be transported, but offers another crucial advantage: it gives damaged livers more time to repair themselves, boosting the number of livers that could be used for transplant, while allowing doctors to reject those that are unsuitable. \u201cWe know from operations on patients and others that the liver needs a week to fully regenerate,\u201d said Clavien. Writing in the journal Nature Biotechnology, Clavien and colleagues report how they engineered a machine that keeps the liver alive and well by performing similar roles as the human body, including pumping blood through the organ and introducing nutrients and hormones such as insulin. Clavien said the system also removed waste products from the blood, allowing it to be cycled through the organ, and regulated levels of oxygen and blood pressure while the organ itself was moved rhythmically to mimic breathing. The team initially developed the system using pig livers and carried out three liver transplants on the animals using livers that had been stored for a week. A few hours after transplantation, the team found no difference in the function or tissues of the livers compared with livers stored for just a few hours. The approach was then tweaked and tested on 10 human livers that had been stored traditionally but turned down for transplantation due to their poor quality. The team found that all 10 livers lost weight during the course of the week and four deteriorated. However, six livers showed improvements and at the end of seven days were deemed suitable for transplantation. The study has limitations, including that some aspects of liver function can only be assessed many months after transplantation. However, Clavien said the system would be used for livers initially stored on ice but deemed too poor quality for immediate transplantation, and that in future it may also be used to boost the quality of marginal livers. Transplants in humans using the approach were in the offing, he said. The system could also offer new approaches to tackling a range of diseases, the researchers say.

An imminent, apparently inevitable Big Name departure. Much public handwringing over \u201cfuture roles\u201d. Much like Monday\u2019s summit at Sandringham, Barcelona\u2019s Camp Nou has also been the focus of much media scrutiny, after the venerable Spanish club\u2019s board members met for discussions that look certain to end with head coach Ernesto Valverde being ordered to \u201cstep back\u201d from his role as manager of the club.</p> \n<p>For some time now, the writing has been on the wall for the Spaniard, what with Barcelona being <em>\u2026 </em>[Fiver checks notes]<em> \u2026</em> eh, top of La Liga and still in contention for Big Cup and the Copa del Rey. Unhappy with this apparently appalling state of affairs, Valverde\u2019s employers have already offered his job to Xavi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/12/barcelona-managerial-limbo-xavi-hernandez-luis-suarez\">who knocked them back</a>, but the very public nature of their overtures to their diminutive former midfield metronome mean the jig is surely up for Valverde, who will sit tight and wait for a pay-off. \u201cValverde is still in a position where he could win all the trophies this season,\u201d said Spain manager Luis Enrique, while Andr\u00e9s Iniesta chimed in to point out that \u201cthe way the club have gone about things is a little ugly\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/12/barcelona-managerial-limbo-xavi-hernandez-luis-suarez\">Barcelona in managerial limbo after Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez turns down role</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Following Xavi\u2019s decision to stay on as manager of the more ambitious Qatari club Al Sadd, Mauricio Pochettino <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/13/football-transfer-rumours-mauricio-pochettino-to-take-over-at-barcelona\">is rumoured</a> to be next highest on Bar\u00e7a\u2019s List of Most Wanted. A former player and manager with their city rivals Espanyol, the Argentinian has repeatedly said he could never contemplate managing at Barcelona and famously once said he\u2019d rather work on his farm in Argentina \u201cthan to go and work in certain places\u201d. Here\u2019s hoping he\u2019s used the time since his dismissal from Spurs to practice performing U-turns on his tractor.</p> \n<p>In other Valverde news, Ernesto\u2019s Real Madrid namesake-but-not-relation, Federico, has also been making headlines, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/12/real-madrid-beat-atletico-madrid-on-penalties-to-lift-spanish-supercopa\">for an act of $hithousery</a> which earned him plaudits from both camps after the Spanish Super Cup final, which was contested in \u2026 [Fiver checks notes] \u2026 Saudi Arabia. With the game scoreless, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s \u00c1lvaro Morata found himself through on goal, only for Valverde to scythe him down from behind just outside the penalty area that led to the referee brandishing a red card and ordering the 21-year-old to \u201cstep back\u201d himself from any further involvement.</p> \n<p>Despite being reduced to 10 men, Real Madrid went on to win on penalties, with Valverde getting the man-of-the-match award and praise from Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Diego Simeone. \u201cIt was the most important piece of play,\u201d he cooed admirably. \u201cI told Valverde that he did what he had to do at that moment. I think the prize for the best player makes perfect sense because Valverde won the game in this action.\u201d His was a sentiment with which Morata, one can\u2019t help but feel, might have respectfully disagreed.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cThe FA has reminded Sheffield United\u2019s Oli McBurnie of his responsibilities following [his] attendance at the Championship fixture between Cardiff and Swansea\u201d \u2013 after appearing in a right get-up at Sunday\u2019s goalless south Wales derby, former Swan Oli McBurnie gets a dressing-down by FA suits over images on assorted social media disgraces amid claims he made an obscene gesture to Cardiff fans.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4724d9d3f1e74a50b4da9816305ab41044c360f7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4724d9d3f1e74a50b4da9816305ab41044c360f7/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big Oli McBurnie rocking some serious Stone Island right there.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big Oli McBurnie rocking some serious Stone Island right there.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>RECOMMENDED LISTENING</h2> \n<p>Football Weekly will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly\">in this general direction</a>.</p> \n<h2>RECOMMENDED VIEWING</h2> \n<p>Michael Doyle. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/jan/13/notts-countys-michael-doyle-scores-stoppage-time-winner-from-halfway-video\">Still got it</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc5153c9-28c6-4214-8678-b2ded1ac1427\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/keGGnEyiNzE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>FIVER LETTERS</strong></h2> \n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffkennaleague/status/1216713032740626440\">This</a> is a Fiver Facebook marketplace purchasing error just waiting to happen\u201d \u2013 Stix.</p> \n<p>\u201cRe: Mat Ryan and his heartwarming bushfire animal rescue charity donation of A$28,000 after every Premier League save over the weekend (Friday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs).

      "bodyText": "ERNESTO GOES TO THE DOOR MARKED HAS UNO Top-level crisis talks between senior figures at a national institution. An imminent, apparently inevitable Big Name departure. Much public handwringing over \u201cfuture roles\u201d. Much like Monday\u2019s summit at Sandringham, Barcelona\u2019s Camp Nou has also been the focus of much media scrutiny, after the venerable Spanish club\u2019s board members met for discussions that look certain to end with head coach Ernesto Valverde being ordered to \u201cstep back\u201d from his role as manager of the club. For some time now, the writing has been on the wall for the Spaniard, what with Barcelona being \u2026 [Fiver checks notes] \u2026 eh, top of La Liga and still in contention for Big Cup and the Copa del Rey. Unhappy with this apparently appalling state of affairs, Valverde\u2019s employers have already offered his job to Xavi, who knocked them back, but the very public nature of their overtures to their diminutive former midfield metronome mean the jig is surely up for Valverde, who will sit tight and wait for a pay-off. \u201cValverde is still in a position where he could win all the trophies this season,\u201d said Spain manager Luis Enrique, while Andr\u00e9s Iniesta chimed in to point out that \u201cthe way the club have gone about things is a little ugly\u201d. Following Xavi\u2019s decision to stay on as manager of the more ambitious Qatari club Al Sadd, Mauricio Pochettino is rumoured to be next highest on Bar\u00e7a\u2019s List of Most Wanted. A former player and manager with their city rivals Espanyol, the Argentinian has repeatedly said he could never contemplate managing at Barcelona and famously once said he\u2019d rather work on his farm in Argentina \u201cthan to go and work in certain places\u201d. Here\u2019s hoping he\u2019s used the time since his dismissal from Spurs to practice performing U-turns on his tractor. In other Valverde news, Ernesto\u2019s Real Madrid namesake-but-not-relation, Federico, has also been making headlines, for an act of $hithousery which earned him plaudits from both camps after the Spanish Super Cup final, which was contested in \u2026 [Fiver checks notes] \u2026 Saudi Arabia. With the game scoreless, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s \u00c1lvaro Morata found himself through on goal, only for Valverde to scythe him down from behind just outside the penalty area that led to the referee brandishing a red card and ordering the 21-year-old to \u201cstep back\u201d himself from any further involvement. Despite being reduced to 10 men, Real Madrid went on to win on penalties, with Valverde getting the man-of-the-match award and praise from Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Diego Simeone. \u201cIt was the most important piece of play,\u201d he cooed admirably. \u201cI told Valverde that he did what he had to do at that moment. I think the prize for the best player makes perfect sense because Valverde won the game in this action.\u201d His was a sentiment with which Morata, one can\u2019t help but feel, might have respectfully disagreed. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThe FA has reminded Sheffield United\u2019s Oli McBurnie of his responsibilities following [his] attendance at the Championship fixture between Cardiff and Swansea\u201d \u2013 after appearing in a right get-up at Sunday\u2019s goalless south Wales derby, former Swan Oli McBurnie gets a dressing-down by FA suits over images on assorted social media disgraces amid claims he made an obscene gesture to Cardiff fans. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly will be in this general direction. RECOMMENDED VIEWING Michael Doyle. Still got it.

      "bodyText": "Less than a week since Bafta\u2019s strikingly white and male awards shortlist met with widespread criticism \u2013 including from the organisation\u2019s own chief executive \u2013 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has released a set of nominations whose small concessions to diversity seem striking by contrast. Cynthia Erivo is nominated for best actress for her role in a biopic of abolitionist Harriet Tubman, and Parasite \u2013 Bong Joon-ho\u2019s acclaimed South Korean black comedy \u2013 is up for six awards, including best director and best picture. Little Women, Greta Gerwig\u2019s so-far-overlooked take on the Louisa May Alcott classic, also scored six nominations, including best picture and best adapted screenplay \u2013 but Gerwig was locked out of the all-male best director shortlist. Such moves are likely to be just about sufficient to insulate the Academy from the worst of the anger that greeted Bafta\u2019s equivalent announcement last Tuesday, where its members snubbed all non-white acting nominees, as well as homegrown talent such as Rapman and Joanna Hogg, and credited Joker \u2013 Todd Phillips\u2019s Batman origins story \u2013 with the most nods. However, many commentators expressed distaste at many of Monday\u2019s omissions \u2013 in particular the lack of recognition in the best actress category for Lupita Nyong\u2019o, star of Jordan Peele\u2019s horror movie, Us and for Awkwafina, the lead in The Farewell. The complete exclusion of Lulu Wang\u2019s much-admired female-centric Chinese-American drama does little to boost the Academy\u2019s inclusivity credentials. \u201cIn the past, the pushback against #OscarsSoWhite was, \u2018There just weren\u2019t enough performances to nominate,\u2019\u201d said April Reign, the activist who created the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag in 2015. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not the case this year. There was a wealth of talent \u2014 and not just of black performers but of various marginalised communities \u2014 that was overlooked. And it\u2019s really unfortunate.\u201d Joker is also the nominee to beat at the Oscars this year, where it likewise goes into the race with 11 nominations, including best picture, best director and best actor for Joaquin Phoenix. It is only the second comic-book movie to land a best picture nomination, following Black Panther in 2018. Nine years before, Christopher Nolan\u2019s Gotham-set The Dark Knight was snubbed for best picture \u2013 a move that many felt damagingly highlighted the divergent tastes of Oscar voters and paying audiences. Some saw Joker\u2019s position on the top of the pile as further evidence of an endemic misogyny in the film industry, however. Said Melissa Silverstein, the founder of Women and Hollywood: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to look further that the movies nominated for the most Oscars this year to realize how white boy centric Hollywood is. A war movie, a mob movie and movie about an incel. Why we continue to glorify these stories over and over again is the crux of the problem.\u201d Coming in with 10 nominations are Sam Mendes\u2019s first world war thriller 1917, Quentin Tarantino\u2019s love letter to 60s LA, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and Martin Scorsese\u2019s wintry mob epic, The Irishman. Netflix, the studio responsible for that film, came away with 24 nominations from Monday\u2019s announcement: leading the pack for the first time, but still fewer than anticipated, because of the complete lack of nods for Dolemite Is My Name and slightly underwhelming totals for Marriage Story and The Two Popes. Disney picked up 23 nominations, while Sony \u2013 whose slate last year included Once Upon a Time in Hollywood \u2013 took 20. Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach\u2019s divorce drama, ended up with six nominations, including for stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. Johansson\u2019s role in Jojo Rabbit means she will also be in the running in the best supporting actress race this year \u2013 although Laura Dern\u2019s turn as her cynical lawyer in Marriage Story makes her the favourite. Little Women\u2019s Florence Pugh, Richard Jewell\u2019s Kathy Bates and Margot Robbie (for Bombshell, costing Once Upon a Time in Hollywood a key nod) round out the category \u2013 leaving Jennifer Lopez unrecognised for her pole-dancing turn in Hustlers. Meanwhile, The Irishman\u2019s Joe Pesci and Al Pacino, plus Tom Hanks, Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, whose part in Tarantino\u2019s film has earned him some career-best notices, compete for supporting actor. Phoenix is the man to beat for leading actor, having taken the lion\u2019s share of awards so far for his transformative performance in Joker. He is up against Driver, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonathan Pryce (for The Two Popes) and Pain and Glory\u2019s Antonio Banderas. Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler failed to capitalise on prodigious buzz for Dolemite Is My Name and Uncut Gems, respectively \u2013 and Robert De Niro\u2019s leading role in The Irishman again failed to win over first-round voters. Taron Egerton\u2019s Golden Globe win on Sunday for his Elton John in Rocketman did not in the end convert to an Oscar nomination. Another apparent lock-in leads the best actress nominations: Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, whose turn as Judy Garland in last year\u2019s biopic has won over critics and voters in other awards bodies alike. Competing against her, Johansson and Erivo are Little Women\u2019s Saoirse Ronan and Bombshell\u2019s Charlize Theron. Last year\u2019s Oscars won much praise for handing out four trophies \u2013 including best director \u2013 to Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s Spanish-language, black-and-white story of a domestic servant, Roma; praise tempered by the eventual victory of reductive interracial road movie Green Book for best picture. This year, second-round voters have the chance to repeat the trick by honouring a foreign-language film in categories other than best international film: Parasite \u2013 which tells of an impoverished family infiltrating the lives of a wealthy household \u2013 is also up for best film, best director, best original screenplay, best editing and best production design. The Baftas announcement last week led to such a backlash that the awards body promised a major review of its voting procedures. Speaking to the Guardian, Steve McQueen \u2013 a Bafta and Oscar winner for 12 Years a Slave \u2013 said the organisation risked cultural redundancy without urgent change. Both the Baftas and Oscars have undertaken membership shakeups over the past five years in a bid to better reflect the diversity of both films and the wider world. In 2017, a Bafta survey found that its members were 43% female, 18% minority ethnic and had a median age of 44; further intakes would likely have raised those figures further. Last year\u2019s ceremony was the first since a new set of eligibility rules, designed to increase inclusion, were introduced for two key awards.

On 3 January, the US goaded Iran by assassinating its most senior military commander, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/making-of-a-martyr-how-qassem-suleimani-was-hunted-down\" title=\"\">Qassem Suleimani</a>. Iran vowed retribution for what it saw as a declaration of war. US president Donald Trump then upped the ante, suggesting that any Iranian response might provoke a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d US strike.</p> \n<p>There was little doubt that Iran would follow through on its threat regardless, in one form or another. Neighbouring Iraq was by far the most likely theatre of conflict, owing to the heavy US presence in the country. The assault came in the early hours of 8 January, when Iran fired a volley of ballistic missiles at two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/suleimani-assassination-two-us-airbases-in-iraq-hit-by-missiles-in-retaliation\" title=\"\">Iraqi airbases</a> hosting US and coalition troops. Its attack seemed calibrated to minimise casualties \u2013 thereby averting a broader conflict \u2013 but no one knew how Washington would react.</p> \n<p>Airlines operating in the region were fully aware that their flight paths crossed a potential conflict zone. Yet they received no guidance from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the wing of the United Nations whose job it is to promote safety and compliance by global carriers. Risk assessments were, instead, made by individual companies and countries \u2013 just as they had been before the MH17 disaster. Some Middle Eastern carriers had suspended flights to Baghdad prior to the missile barrage. Some Asian and European ones diverted flights around Iranian airspace. Shortly after the assault, the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/07/faa-ban-iran-iraq-us-airlines\" title=\"\">banned its airlines from the region</a>. But many others kept to schedule.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f1c86aeb-f0cc-48ee-9a94-8ed0320616e3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ovA0ydHrHfQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was in this confused climate that Ukraine International Airlines took the fateful decision to operate flight 752 from Tehran on the morning of 8 January \u2013 as paramilitary forces on the outskirts of the capital pointed their anti-aircraft missiles skyward, waiting nervously for an American strike. With the benefit of hindsight, \u201cwhy take the risk?\u201d seems an obvious question to ask. But at the time, the airline\u2019s operations department, like any other, would have likely balanced this with a contrasting question: why cancel the flight?</p> \n<p>After all, doing so would have been a purely emotional intervention. None of the entities that are well-placed to conduct risk assessments had publicly urged Ukraine International to stay on the ground. Not the Ukrainian government. Not the Iranian government. Not the US government. Not the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the continent\u2019s aviation regulator. Not the International Air Transport Association, the industry\u2019s main trade group. Not even the ICAO.</p> \n<p>Let me be clear here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/12/observer-view-on-flight-ps752-and-political-fallout-iran-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Iran has committed the gravest of acts</a>. It must be held to account. But no one should feign surprise that soldiers make mistakes in highly charged situations that have the potential to break into war. Blame for flight 752 does not lie solely with those who downed the plane; it also lies with those who put it in harm\u2019s way.</p> \n<p>Six years ago, when MH17 was shot down by another paramilitary group, the <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/statement-mh17-2014-07-21/\" title=\"\">global airline industry vowed</a> to collaborate more closely with governments and intelligence agencies to keep passengers well away from conflict zones.</p> \n<p>The onus fell primarily on western countries, whose institutions have the intelligence capabilities and democratic accountability to drive reforms. Their task was not an easy one. Sovereignty was a major stumbling block: airlines are beholden only to the states in which they are registered. No global body, including the UN, has the legal authority to close overseas air corridors. Commercial factors also muddied the waters: countries such as Iraq and Ukraine earn huge sums of money issuing overflight permits to airlines. Their governments will push back against suggestions that their skies are unsafe, just as foreign airlines will balk at the prospect of costly and time-consuming diversions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/09/iran-plane-crash-visual-guide\">A visual guide to the Iran plane crash</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, the way forward was obvious. What could not be legally mandated could at least be encouraged. There was talk of more <a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/routes-clark-calls-for-intelligence-sharing-after-mh17/114551.article\" title=\"\">intelligence-sharing</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/983db026-1977-11e4-8730-00144feabdc0\" title=\"\">setting up a new body</a> to collect intelligence about threats, issue global advisories, and chastise those who ignored them. The UN\u2019s ICAO set up a centralised repository for countries to share information, but remained a passive observer. The repository <a href=\"https://flightsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/eng_rapport_flying_over_conflict_zones.pdf\" title=\"\">was closed</a> in 2017 due to low engagement. The EU\u2019s EASA set up an <a href=\"https://www.easa.europa.eu/easa-and-you/air-operations/czibs\" title=\"\">information bulletin</a> in 2016. Its latest entry for Iraq, issued in October 2019 and valid until March 2020, acknowledged a threat to civil aviation but stopped short of telling carriers to avoid the airspace. There is no Iranian entry.</p> \n<p>The reality is that as flight MH17 fell off the news cycle, so did the impetus to effect change. That cannot happen again. In 2014,<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/opinion/conflict-zones-and-airspace-after-flight-mh17.html\" title=\"\"> I wrote that</a> \u201cfurther shoot-downs are virtually assured unless decisive action is taken by the industry\u201d. I repeat that warning, emphatically, today.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Martin Rivers is an aviation journalist and Middle East politics blogger</p>",

Shortly after the assault, the US banned its airlines from the region. But many others kept to schedule. It was in this confused climate that Ukraine International Airlines took the fateful decision to operate flight 752 from Tehran on the morning of 8 January \u2013 as paramilitary forces on the outskirts of the capital pointed their anti-aircraft missiles skyward, waiting nervously for an American strike. With the benefit of hindsight, \u201cwhy take the risk?\u201d seems an obvious question to ask. But at the time, the airline\u2019s operations department, like any other, would have likely balanced this with a contrasting question: why cancel the flight? After all, doing so would have been a purely emotional intervention. None of the entities that are well-placed to conduct risk assessments had publicly urged Ukraine International to stay on the ground. Not the Ukrainian government. Not the Iranian government. Not the US government. Not the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the continent\u2019s aviation regulator. Not the International Air Transport Association, the industry\u2019s main trade group. Not even the ICAO. Let me be clear here: Iran has committed the gravest of acts. It must be held to account. But no one should feign surprise that soldiers make mistakes in highly charged situations that have the potential to break into war. Blame for flight 752 does not lie solely with those who downed the plane; it also lies with those who put it in harm\u2019s way. Six years ago, when MH17 was shot down by another paramilitary group, the global airline industry vowed to collaborate more closely with governments and intelligence agencies to keep passengers well away from conflict zones. The onus fell primarily on western countries, whose institutions have the intelligence capabilities and democratic accountability to drive reforms. Their task was not an easy one. Sovereignty was a major stumbling block: airlines are beholden only to the states in which they are registered. No global body, including the UN, has the legal authority to close overseas air corridors. Commercial factors also muddied the waters: countries such as Iraq and Ukraine earn huge sums of money issuing overflight permits to airlines. Their governments will push back against suggestions that their skies are unsafe, just as foreign airlines will balk at the prospect of costly and time-consuming diversions. Still, the way forward was obvious. What could not be legally mandated could at least be encouraged. There was talk of more intelligence-sharing and even setting up a new body to collect intelligence about threats, issue global advisories, and chastise those who ignored them. The UN\u2019s ICAO set up a centralised repository for countries to share information, but remained a passive observer. The repository was closed in 2017 due to low engagement. The EU\u2019s EASA set up an information bulletin in 2016. Its latest entry for Iraq, issued in October 2019 and valid until March 2020, acknowledged a threat to civil aviation but stopped short of telling carriers to avoid the airspace. There is no Iranian entry. The reality is that as flight MH17 fell off the news cycle, so did the impetus to effect change. That cannot happen again. In 2014, I wrote that \u201cfurther shoot-downs are virtually assured unless decisive action is taken by the industry\u201d. I repeat that warning, emphatically, today. \u2022 Martin Rivers is an aviation journalist and Middle East politics blogger",

      "bodyText": "As if we needed more reasons to love Helen Mirren. In the latest example of a favoured genre of story \u2013 Hollywood stars turning up in random UK places (see also: Nicolas Cage spending New Year\u2019s Eve in a Somerset pub), Mirren has been delighting fans with her Instagram posts detailing her jaunts around Bradford. Mirren, along with Jim Broadbent, is in Bradford filming her upcoming film The Duke, the true story of an art heist. And it seems the actor has really taken to the West Yorkshire city and all it has to offer. Mirren started her documentation with a night-time snap of one of the city\u2019s mills with the caption: \u201cThe one and only Bradford with its own magic.\u201d The next day, she upped her game. \u201cLast night at The Panto Snow White in the magnificent Alhambra Theater in Bradford I yelled \u2018he\u2019s behind you\u2019 and wearing my lit up blue tiara and laughed my socks off at 2 legends Billy Pearce and Paul Chuckle. It was an honour to meet them afterwards. Thank you, you guys are truely [sic] awesome.\u201d Clearly having the time of her life, Mirren next snapped her dinner, giving a shoutout to a local restaurant. \u201cNothing like indian/pakistani dinner in Bradford doesn\u2019t get any better, Thank you Mumtaz.\u201d But perhaps Mirren\u2019s most joyous post of all was a wonderful picture of four friends dressed up in leg warmers and shell suits, complete with crimped hair and retro shades. \u201cSome gals having a great eighties night out in Bradford,\u201d Mirren wrote. Imagine being approached by Helen Mirren wanting to photograph you in your fancy dress finery. Mirren\u2019s Yorkshire posts have proved extremely popular, with tens of thousands of likes. In particular, there is something very sweet about her namechecking Bradford in each post, lest we think she is back in Los Angeles at the Golden Globes, where she was just a week ago. Incidentally, here\u2019s her last (pre-Bradford) post from New York: As witnessed by the fact other recent posts include a cheese sarnie as her \u201cfavourite supper\u201d, and the following post in which she eats chips from a cone, handbag discarded next to her, the Oscar-winner has always been refreshingly down to earth. Basically, what I\u2019m saying is: Bradford, give her the Freedom of the City. Or even better: make her mayor.",

Not least because there is a character called Ros, audiences will inevitably wonder how much she made up. \u201cI am divorced,\u201d she says, \u201calthough the play isn\u2019t the story of my marriage. However, I have experienced, in other relationships, mental and physical abuse. There was a guy a few years ago who had me up by my throat against a wall, smashed a mirror over my dog. I had to rush into the street, like in a horror movie.\u201d</p> <p>Survivors of domestic violence are increasingly encouraged to seek redress, however long after the events, by contacting the police or confronting the perpetrator. Has she thought of doing that? \u201cNo. No, I haven\u2019t. All I can say is that I think I\u2019ve spent so much of my life stuck in the past that I just don\u2019t want to revisit those things any more. I found it hard to forgive myself for letting it happen over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>She found that writing The Delights of Dogs and the Problems of People, which features a dangerous relationship, \u201creleased a lot of that shame\u201d. Thanks to a therapist and (after five years single) a fiance, she feels that \u201cthe cycle, I hope, is over\u201d. Lullabies for the Lost, about a mental health therapy group, also reflects her experience: \u201cYeah.

How much had he known? \u201cOnly a little because people lead their own lives. So it was deeply upsetting to read because you\u2019re very protective of your children.\u201d</p> <p>The actor\u2019s air of massive indomitability, exaggerated for professional effect, might lead some to suspect that he would be unlikely to pick up vulnerability in others, but he stresses that he has a side that is sensitive, even feminist: \u201cMy heroes \u2013 my <em>heroines \u2013 </em>are women. All my life, 90% of men have bored the arse off me. And it is women who have taught me everything.\u201d</p> <p>His support for the subject matter of his daughter\u2019s plays also reflects a longer family history. His father, a coal-hewer in South Yorkshire, was crushed and gassed in an accident, leaving the family reliant on minimal sick pay. \u201cMy mother had a complete nervous breakdown,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was 12.

So in what way is Blessed executively producing Ros? \u201cHe\u2019s doing it right now, frankly \u2013 publicising the shows. Dad came to an early reading of the plays and \u2013 because of everything we\u2019ve discussed, the family history of mental illness \u2013 was very receptive to it.

I love it that I\u2019ve got a 55-inch chest.\u201d</p> <p>Ros looks thoughtful. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that, despite having written the plays and been through therapy, I put on some weight last year because someone close to me was very ill, and I haven\u2019t got rid of it yet. And so I start to think, as a size 16, maybe I shouldn\u2019t be on stage, people probably shouldn\u2019t have to look at me. And that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Women in showbiz are notoriously pressured to lose weight, so has a producer or director ever waved a diet sheet or personal trainer at Blessed? \u201cNo! No never!\u201d he says. Ros adds: \u201cIsn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d</p> <p>She has to leave for a dress rehearsal. I stay to ask him about Cats. In the 1981 stage premiere of the musical, Blessed played Bustopher Jones and Old Deuteronomy, roles taken by James Corden and Judi Dench in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/cats\">new film version</a> that has been critically clawed to box-office death. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen it yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember when my agent rang up and said, \u2018They want to see you for a stage show called Cats.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Cats?

Blessed remembers the production team in tears of despair over funding, going with the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber to beg money from banks \u2013 who refused because the idea seemed so absurd. \u201cBut, when I went to the North Pole, I came across an igloo and there was an Inuit inside, playing Memory from Cats on a banjo.

There is a resemblance but, with this actor, the very idea of a miniature seems wrong. The mountainous original is sitting at his desk, wearing a striking winter morning costume of red fleece, pyjama bottoms and wellington boots. He must be the hairiest 83-year-old man in existence, his huge head crowned by a thick grey thatch, his neck Tudor-ruffed by what seem metres of white beard. \u201cKenneth Branagh sits every week where you\u2019re sitting!\u201d he booms.

I love it that I\u2019ve got a 55-inch chest.\u201d Ros looks thoughtful. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that, despite having written the plays and been through therapy, I put on some weight last year because someone close to me was very ill, and I haven\u2019t got rid of it yet. And so I start to think, as a size 16, maybe I shouldn\u2019t be on stage, people probably shouldn\u2019t have to look at me. And that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Women in showbiz are notoriously pressured to lose weight, so has a producer or director ever waved a diet sheet or personal trainer at Blessed? \u201cNo! No never!\u201d he says. Ros adds: \u201cIsn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d She has to leave for a dress rehearsal. I stay to ask him about Cats. In the 1981 stage premiere of the musical, Blessed played Bustopher Jones and Old Deuteronomy, roles taken by James Corden and Judi Dench in the new film version that has been critically clawed to box-office death. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen it yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember when my agent rang up and said, \u2018They want to see you for a stage show called Cats.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Cats? Fucking gorillas maybe! Bears!\u2019\u201d Whereas the movie was an expected success that became a disaster, the theatre version had the opposite journey. Blessed remembers the production team in tears of despair over funding, going with the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber to beg money from banks \u2013 who refused because the idea seemed so absurd. \u201cBut, when I went to the North Pole, I came across an igloo and there was an Inuit inside, playing Memory from Cats on a banjo. Now that is success!\u201d He insists that he feels \u201cno jealousy or resentment about not being in the film. I will see it, but I worry. In the theatre, you can do anything \u2013 human beings as cats. But it\u2019s harder on film. But I wish them well with it. I envy no other bugger. I celebrate talent.\u201d He is writing a travel book at the moment and hopes to play Prospero on stage, the insertion of a \u201cvery advanced pacemaker\u201d having solved a cardiac arrhythmia problem that forced him to abandon his production of King Lear five years ago. He has always said his biggest ambition is to go into space, but surely he won\u2019t now ever do it? \u201cOf course I will! But it\u2019s hush hush.\u201d The last two words are whispered \u2013 or at least reduce-boomed. \u2022 Lullabies for the Lost and The Delights of Dogs and the Problems of People are at the Old Red Lion theatre, London, until 1 February.",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s current energy policies have led to a sharp decline in the number of new onshore windfarms, raising fears that the UK may fall short of the renewable energy it needs to generate to meet its climate targets. Industry data shows the rollout of new onshore windfarms fell dramatically after the government scrapped subsidy schemes four years ago. According to official data from the Renewable UK trade association, 23 new onshore windfarms began generating clean electricity for the UK last year, but all but one of them had secured support from subsidy schemes before they were closed. Last year\u2019s total was a fraction of the 2014 peak when more than 400 new onshore wind projects began generating clean power for the first time. The 2019 figures are also well below the average set over the last decade of 208 new projects a year. Renewable UK warned that the UK risked falling short of its aim of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 as the pipeline of projects that clinched support before the schemes were closed begins to run dry. Rebecca Williams, a director at Renewable UK, said the figures showed that the government\u2019s current approach was falling short on the clean electricity needed to meet the UK\u2019s legally binding climate targets. \u201cThis is a flashing red warning light on our net zero dashboard and we urgently need a new strategy from government,\u201d she said. The findings are likely to increase pressure on the government to reverse the block on government support for new onshore windfarms, put in place by the former Tory prime minister David Cameron in 2016. The current energy policy blocks onshore wind developers from competing for support contracts, and has caused the rollout of new onshore wind capacity to fall to 629 megawatts (MW) last year, or a quarter of the onshore wind growth recorded two years ago. The government\u2019s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has suggested that the UK\u2019s onshore wind capacity should increase by almost threefold in the next 15 years to meet climate goals at low cost. This would require the UK to grow its onshore wind capacity from 13,000 MW now to 35,000 MW by 2035, or an average of more that 1,400MW a year. The sole addition to the UK\u2019s fleet of onshore wind farms under the government\u2019s current energy policy last year \u2013 the Withernwick II project, in the East Riding of Yorkshire \u2013 has a capacity of 8MW, with just four turbines. \u201cOnshore wind is one of the cheapest low carbon technologies in the UK, quick to build, and it\u2019s hugely popular as the government\u2019s own opinion polls show 78% of people support it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAs ministers get down to work at the start of a new decade, we need to see new policies which support the full range of clean power sources to transform our energy system.\u201d ScottishPower, a major developer of renewable energy, has started planning for a major expansion of onshore windfarm projects across Scotland in anticipation of a government U-turn on support for wind power projects. Lindsay McQuade, the chief executive of ScottishPower Renewables, told the Guardian late last year that \u201cif the commitment of net zero is to be a reality, I expect to see support from government to match it\u201d.",

Dorothy Whipple\u2019s first novel from 1927, Young Anne, \u201c can probably be termed \u2018solidly middlebrow,\u2019\u201d says interwar: The story of a girl growing up and coming into womanhood in a northern English mill town has all the right ingredients: family, friends, first love, frustrated love.

As one of Dickens\u2019 less well-received efforts I was braced for it perhaps not hitting the heights, however it\u2019s been such an enjoyable read. Like all of his books I\u2019ve read to date it has a neatly packaged, intertwining story that reveals itself in a pleasing manner, but the real star of the show here is the many wonderful true Dickensian characters present-from your showpiece villains Pecksniff and Jonas, through to Mrs Gamp, Mark Tapley and Tom Pinch, all of them just jump off the page and into life in true Dickens style. What could be better? Interesting links about books and reading Alasdair Gray on The Art Of Fiction in the Paris Review. Blockbuster books have been bombing at the box office. Kate seems to have been selected for her role of princess because she was irreproachable: as painfully thin as anyone could wish, without quirks, without oddities, without the risk of the emergence of character.\u201d Hilary Mantel on royal bodies in 2013. Cooking with Elizabeth Jane Howard. \u201cWhat your choice of dialogue tags says about you,\u201d blubbered Christopher Hoffmann.

Later, he and Loach remade In Two Minds as a feature film, Family Life (1971).</p> <p>In between, they made the film Kes (1969), which became a British classic, based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/20/barry-hines-obituary-a-kestrel-for-a-knave-author\" title=\"\">Barry Hines</a>\u2019s novel A Kestrel for a Knave.

Garnett was one of those who gave Loach an awareness of socialism that would inform all his future work, and to Hines he gave encouragement.</p> <p>Another writer he encouraged was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jun/25/guardianobituaries2\" title=\"\">Jim Allen</a>, who wrote Days of Hope (1975), a four-part epic for the BBC tracing the betrayal of the working class by the trade union and Labour party leaderships in the years leading up to the general strike of 1926.</p> <p>Then, in 1979, worn down by years of battling to get TV and film productions made \u2013 and a dissatisfaction with the country\u2019s move to the right politically \u2013 Garnett left Britain for the US.</p> <p>His decade there was relatively fruitless, but he returned home to create World Productions and launch a new wave of innovative, challenging dramas such as Between the Lines (1992-94) and This Life (1996-97), alongside the more mainstream Ballykissangel (1996-2001). For the first time, while bringing on a new generation of writers and directors, he was producing series designed to have long runs, with repeat commissions.</p> <p>Garnett was born Anthony Lewis in the Birmingham district of Erdington. Following the death of his parents, he was brought up by his Auntie \u201cPom\u201d (Emily) and Uncle Harold, while his younger brother, Peter, went to other relatives. \u201cI automatically closed down, feeling nothing,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cI never cried.\u201d He retained his father\u2019s surname but switched to his uncle\u2019s, Garnett, in his late teens.</p> <p>As a child, he was an inveterate reader and attended Birmingham\u2019s central grammar school, where he acted in school plays. While performing with amateur groups, he fell in love with Topsy Jane Legge.</p> <p>Garnett then joined rep companies before studying psychology at University College London, where he acted with its drama society. Spotted by a BBC producer, he was given small roles in An Age of Kings (1960), an anthology of Shakespeare\u2019s history plays. More screen appearances followed, including parts in Mercer\u2019s television plays A Climate of Fear (1962) and The Birth of a Private Man (1963), and in the film The Boys (1962), as a teenager on trial for murder.</p> <p>He joined the Wednesday Play as an assistant story editor and, on promotion to story editor, worked on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dennis-potter\" title=\"\">Dennis Potter</a>\u2019s Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton and Stand Up, Nigel Barton (both 1965).</p> <p>In addition, Garnett produced two other plays by Allen, The Lump (1967) and The Spongers (1978), as well as Hard Labour (1973), the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mikeleigh\" title=\"\">Mike Leigh</a>\u2019s first TV drama, and Law &amp; Order (1978), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/dec/30/books.guardianreview5\" title=\"\">GF Newman</a>\u2019s controversial take on the legal system, directed by Les Blair, another of Garnett\u2019s proteges, who also included the writers <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-leon-griffiths-1536531.html\" title=\"\">Leon Griffiths</a> and Charles Wood, and directors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/11/jack-gold\" title=\"\">Jack Gold</a>, Roy Battersby and Roland Joff\u00e9.</p> <p>Garnett left the BBC for a couple of years, and with <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1402133/index.html\" title=\"\">Kenith Trodd</a> set up Kestrel Productions, making dramas for the newly launched ITV company LWT. These included his own collaboration with Loach, After a Lifetime (1971).</p> <p>During the 1960s and 70s, Garnett often hosted evening meetings on Fridays with Trodd and like-minded leftwingers \u2013 at a time when MI5 was secretly vetting those employed by the BBC. There was an attempt to block Garnett\u2019s return to the corporation that was overruled because of his professional ability. Later, he himself had to threaten to resign in order to be allowed to employ Joff\u00e9.</p> <p>Garnett then wrote and direct- ed two films: Prostitute (1980), focusing on the working lives of sex workers, in Britain, and Handgun (1983), about a female victim of rape seeking revenge, in Texas.</p> <p>His time as a film producer at Warner Bros in Hollywood bizarrely yielded only the Sesame Street spin-off Follow That Bird (1985) before he made the musical Earth Girls Are Easy (1988) and the atom bomb drama Fat Man and Little Boy (1989), starring Paul Newman.</p> <p>Setting up World Productions in 1990 enabled him to work outside the BBC, which he criticised as having become a massive bureaucracy that stifled creativity. His company\u2019s other programmes for it included Cardiac Arrest (1994-96), The Cops (1998-2001), Attachments (2000-02) and Rough Diamond (2006).</p> <p>On his return to London in 1990, Garnett set about exorcising the demons of his past and underwent five years of psychoanalysis. He said it moved his grief on to mourning and accepting the deaths of his parents and the \u201cexistential death\u201d of Topsy Jane. Their 1963 marriage ended in divorce; she died in 2014.</p> <p>He is survived by his partner, Victoria Childs, and his sons Will, with Topsy Jane, and Michael, from his second marriage, to Alex (nee Ouroussoff), which also ended in divorce.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Tony Garnett (Anthony Edward Lewis), producer, writer and director, born 3 April 1936; died 12 January 2020</p>",

Garnett knew the Wednesday Play\u2019s producer, James MacTaggart, would be unhappy with it, so set the production in motion while his boss was on holiday. \u201cIt was a case of, \u2018If the cat\u2019s away, the mice will play,\u2019\u201d Garnett explained to me in 2002. \u201cWhen Jim arrived back from his holiday, he hit the roof. I had a huge, apoplectic, stand-up row in his office that went on for days.\u201d Nevertheless, MacTaggart allowed filming to continue because Garnett felt so strongly about it. \u201cIt was very important to me, for personal reasons,\u201d added Garnett. Fourteen years later, in his memoir, The Day the Music Died, he revealed that his mother, Ida (nee Poulton), died of septicaemia after having a backstreet abortion when he was five. His father, Tom Lewis, a garage mechanic who switched to selling insurance, took his own life 19 days later. When Up the Junction was screened, it caused uproar in the rightwing press and was attacked by the Clean Up TV campaigner Mary Whitehouse, although Garnett seemed to relish this as \u201can added frisson\u201d. He then became a producer and with Loach \u2013 who regarded him as being good at the \u201ccorridor politics\u201d \u2013 made an even bigger impact with what became the most famous TV play of the 20th century, Cathy Come Home (1966). Jeremy Sandford\u2019s script about homelessness was brought to Garnett\u2019s attention by Dunn, the writer\u2019s then wife. It was an attack on council house waiting lists and the policy of separating husbands from their homeless wives and children. Loach reworked the script with Sandford while Garnett was \u201ceconomical with the truth\u201d in discussions with BBC management. The public and political outrage that followed the screening of Cathy Come Home, featuring Carol White and Ray Brooks as the couple whose family was torn apart, speeded up the formation of Shelter. It was another experience of his own heartache that led Garnett to commission In Two Minds, David Mercer\u2019s 1967 Wednesday Play about schizophrenia. Repudiating the traditional view that it was a disease with an organic basis, the play incorporated the ideas of a new wave of psychiatrists, led by RD Laing, who believed it could be caused by internal family relationships. Mercer had experienced depression himself, and Garnett had been witness to the sudden decline in mental health of his wife, Topsy Jane, who starred with Tom Courtenay in the 1962 film The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner and had seemed set for a glittering screen career. Cast as Courtenay\u2019s girlfriend in Billy Liar (1963), she fell ill several weeks into filming, was replaced by Julie Christie, diagnosed as schizophrenic and given electroshock therapy. \u201cShe had been sent back someone else \u2026 the opposite of the woman I knew,\u201d wrote Garnett. Later, he and Loach remade In Two Minds as a feature film, Family Life (1971). In between, they made the film Kes (1969), which became a British classic, based on Barry Hines\u2019s novel A Kestrel for a Knave. The story, adapted by Garnett, Loach and Hines, features a 15-year-old Yorkshire boy, Billy Casper (played by David Bradley), who \u2013 failed by the education system \u2013 finds satisfaction in training a wild bird while facing a certain future down the local pit. Garnett was one of those who gave Loach an awareness of socialism that would inform all his future work, and to Hines he gave encouragement. Another writer he encouraged was Jim Allen, who wrote Days of Hope (1975), a four-part epic for the BBC tracing the betrayal of the working class by the trade union and Labour party leaderships in the years leading up to the general strike of 1926. Then, in 1979, worn down by years of battling to get TV and film productions made \u2013 and a dissatisfaction with the country\u2019s move to the right politically \u2013 Garnett left Britain for the US. His decade there was relatively fruitless, but he returned home to create World Productions and launch a new wave of innovative, challenging dramas such as Between the Lines (1992-94) and This Life (1996-97), alongside the more mainstream Ballykissangel (1996-2001). For the first time, while bringing on a new generation of writers and directors, he was producing series designed to have long runs, with repeat commissions. Garnett was born Anthony Lewis in the Birmingham district of Erdington. Following the death of his parents, he was brought up by his Auntie \u201cPom\u201d (Emily) and Uncle Harold, while his younger brother, Peter, went to other relatives. \u201cI automatically closed down, feeling nothing,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cI never cried.\u201d He retained his father\u2019s surname but switched to his uncle\u2019s, Garnett, in his late teens. As a child, he was an inveterate reader and attended Birmingham\u2019s central grammar school, where he acted in school plays. While performing with amateur groups, he fell in love with Topsy Jane Legge. Garnett then joined rep companies before studying psychology at University College London, where he acted with its drama society. Spotted by a BBC producer, he was given small roles in An Age of Kings (1960), an anthology of Shakespeare\u2019s history plays. More screen appearances followed, including parts in Mercer\u2019s television plays A Climate of Fear (1962) and The Birth of a Private Man (1963), and in the film The Boys (1962), as a teenager on trial for murder. He joined the Wednesday Play as an assistant story editor and, on promotion to story editor, worked on Dennis Potter\u2019s Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton and Stand Up, Nigel Barton (both 1965). In addition, Garnett produced two other plays by Allen, The Lump (1967) and The Spongers (1978), as well as Hard Labour (1973), the director Mike Leigh\u2019s first TV drama, and Law &amp; Order (1978), GF Newman\u2019s controversial take on the legal system, directed by Les Blair, another of Garnett\u2019s proteges, who also included the writers Leon Griffiths and Charles Wood, and directors Jack Gold, Roy Battersby and Roland Joff\u00e9. Garnett left the BBC for a couple of years, and with Kenith Trodd set up Kestrel Productions, making dramas for the newly launched ITV company LWT. These included his own collaboration with Loach, After a Lifetime (1971). During the 1960s and 70s, Garnett often hosted evening meetings on Fridays with Trodd and like-minded leftwingers \u2013 at a time when MI5 was secretly vetting those employed by the BBC. There was an attempt to block Garnett\u2019s return to the corporation that was overruled because of his professional ability. Later, he himself had to threaten to resign in order to be allowed to employ Joff\u00e9. Garnett then wrote and direct- ed two films: Prostitute (1980), focusing on the working lives of sex workers, in Britain, and Handgun (1983), about a female victim of rape seeking revenge, in Texas. His time as a film producer at Warner Bros in Hollywood bizarrely yielded only the Sesame Street spin-off Follow That Bird (1985) before he made the musical Earth Girls Are Easy (1988) and the atom bomb drama Fat Man and Little Boy (1989), starring Paul Newman. Setting up World Productions in 1990 enabled him to work outside the BBC, which he criticised as having become a massive bureaucracy that stifled creativity. His company\u2019s other programmes for it included Cardiac Arrest (1994-96), The Cops (1998-2001), Attachments (2000-02) and Rough Diamond (2006). On his return to London in 1990, Garnett set about exorcising the demons of his past and underwent five years of psychoanalysis. He said it moved his grief on to mourning and accepting the deaths of his parents and the \u201cexistential death\u201d of Topsy Jane. Their 1963 marriage ended in divorce; she died in 2014. He is survived by his partner, Victoria Childs, and his sons Will, with Topsy Jane, and Michael, from his second marriage, to Alex (nee Ouroussoff), which also ended in divorce. \u2022 Tony Garnett (Anthony Edward Lewis), producer, writer and director, born 3 April 1936; died 12 January 2020",

If he supports the move, it would be limited to the Amazon region and would only apply to men already serving as deacons.</p> <p>A document approved by bishops in the Amazon noted that people of Catholic faith in the region have \u201cenormous difficulties\u201d in receiving communion and seeing a priest. It proposed to \u201cordain priests suitable and esteemed men of the community\u201d, who had already had \u201cfruitful\u201d experiences as deacons.</p> <p>The proposal is seen by many as setting a precedent that could bring an end to the restriction on married Catholic priests worldwide.</p> <p>The implications of Benedict\u2019s intervention are serious, given that conservative and traditionalist Catholics nostalgic for Benedict\u2019s orthodoxy are already deeply opposed to Francis. Some even consider Benedict\u2019s resignation illegitimate.</p> <p>\u201cFrancis has been very clear on several occasions that he considers celibacy very important, he doesn\u2019t want to get rid of it completely and he\u2019s only considering this request because it\u2019s coming from bishops on the ground citing the needs of Catholics,\u201d said McElwee.</p> <p>McElwee also pointed to a move Benedict made during his papacy to create norms that allowed Anglican priests who switched to Catholicism to join the church while remaining married.</p> <p>Massimo Faggioli, a historian and theologian who writes for the Catholic newspaper La Croix, criticised Benedict\u2019s move on Twitter: \u201cThis is not about clerical celibacy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s about the freedom of one pope Francis AND of the synodal process.\u201d</p> <p>The intervention comes as Netflix airs the Two Popes, a drama about the relationship between Benedict and Francis. Benedict was the first pontiff to resign in 600 years and still lives within the walls of the Vatican. The pair are said to have a cordial relationship, but Francis\u2019s efforts at reform have made him unpopular among conservative Catholics.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/11/ex-pope-benedict-xvi-blames-sexual-abuse-on-swinging-sixties\">controversial essay published</a> last year, Benedict blamed the Catholic church\u2019s paedophile priest scandals on the sexual revolution of the 1960s and \u201chomosexual cliques\u201d among priests. His comments were in sharp conflict with Francis\u2019s efforts to steer the church out of a crisis that has blighted it for decades.</p>",

Pope Francis agreed in October to consider a request from bishops in the Amazon to allow married men to become ordained in order to overcome a shortage of clerics in remote areas of the region. \u201cI cannot keep silent,\u201d Benedict, 92, wrote in the book, From the Depths of our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church.

Benedict, who promised to \u201cremain hidden\u201d after his resignation, has come forward on various issues over the past seven years, but this is the first time he has intervened on a matter that the more liberal Pope Francis is actively considering. \u201cIt\u2019s a first for Benedict but also for the church,\u201d said Joshua McElwee, the Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. \u201cThere\u2019s a real worry that the figure of the former pope, who has a big following among those from more conservative circles, could prevent Francis from making a decision that he felt was right for the church.\u201d At the end of the Vatican synod on the Amazon, Francis said he would publish his decision on the ordination of married men later this year. If he supports the move, it would be limited to the Amazon region and would only apply to men already serving as deacons. A document approved by bishops in the Amazon noted that people of Catholic faith in the region have \u201cenormous difficulties\u201d in receiving communion and seeing a priest. It proposed to \u201cordain priests suitable and esteemed men of the community\u201d, who had already had \u201cfruitful\u201d experiences as deacons. The proposal is seen by many as setting a precedent that could bring an end to the restriction on married Catholic priests worldwide. The implications of Benedict\u2019s intervention are serious, given that conservative and traditionalist Catholics nostalgic for Benedict\u2019s orthodoxy are already deeply opposed to Francis. Some even consider Benedict\u2019s resignation illegitimate. \u201cFrancis has been very clear on several occasions that he considers celibacy very important, he doesn\u2019t want to get rid of it completely and he\u2019s only considering this request because it\u2019s coming from bishops on the ground citing the needs of Catholics,\u201d said McElwee. McElwee also pointed to a move Benedict made during his papacy to create norms that allowed Anglican priests who switched to Catholicism to join the church while remaining married. Massimo Faggioli, a historian and theologian who writes for the Catholic newspaper La Croix, criticised Benedict\u2019s move on Twitter: \u201cThis is not about clerical celibacy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s about the freedom of one pope Francis AND of the synodal process.\u201d The intervention comes as Netflix airs the Two Popes, a drama about the relationship between Benedict and Francis. Benedict was the first pontiff to resign in 600 years and still lives within the walls of the Vatican. The pair are said to have a cordial relationship, but Francis\u2019s efforts at reform have made him unpopular among conservative Catholics. In a controversial essay published last year, Benedict blamed the Catholic church\u2019s paedophile priest scandals on the sexual revolution of the 1960s and \u201chomosexual cliques\u201d among priests. His comments were in sharp conflict with Francis\u2019s efforts to steer the church out of a crisis that has blighted it for decades.",

Look no further than an obsessive, vindictive tabloid campaign against Meghan. Ah, but her detractors sneer, what sort of victim is she: supremely wealthy, wanting for nothing, surrounded by luxury. This does not distinguish her from any other royal, of course \u2013 including the likes of Prince Andrew, an associate of a paedophile who, a rash of front-page headlines aside, has not been subjected to a tabloid campaign against him. Britain\u2019s culture war can be summed up like this: a currently triumphalist faction that believes that progressive social norms have gone too far and that so-called \u201cidentity politics\u201d, PC culture and the \u201cwoke\u201d need to be driven back. Meghan became a target because she is a mixed-race American with no aristocratic blood, who dared to import vaguely progressive values into the most conservative of British institutions. Even worse, she supposedly seduced a linchpin of the monarchy to these nefarious \u201cwoke\u201d ways: Prince Harry is indeed now a long way from wearing Nazi uniforms. \u201cI preferred naked billiards party-boy Harry to this newly \u2018woke\u2019 planet-saving preacher,\u201d as Piers Morgan had it. Meghan was \u201cawful, woke, weak, manipulative, spoilt and irritating\u201d, said Eamonn Holmes; she is assailed as the \u201cglobal queen of woke\u201d. And here is why the rightwing press savages her. They regard themselves as the guardians of traditional morality, as though they were the heirs of the medieval church. That\u2019s why they spent much of the 80s and 90s vilifying gay and bisexual men and women, and now incite moral panic about trans people; that\u2019s why they whip up bile against migrants, refugees, Muslims, or indeed any other minority deemed a threat to \u201cBritishness\u201d as they interpret it. We live in a time of \u201cwhitelash\u201d, when \u2013 across the western world \u2013 the winning of rights and freedoms by women and minorities has provoked a furious reaction. From Trumpism to the now hegemonic Tory right, from the Vox party in Spain to the Hungarian authoritarian regime, reactionary movements portray such struggles as mortal threats to men, white people, heterosexuals and anyone else deemed the norm. Meghan\u2019s chief crime is not to share the wealth and opulence that defines royal life, but to be deemed a fifth columnist: a woman of colour who epitomises the encroachment of the progressive values that are articles of faith for so many younger Britons. She has accordingly suffered her punishment beating. But a word of warning. Yes, the Tory right now has a majority, is drunk on power: minorities and their defenders are expected to get back in their box. But a younger generation that passionately believes in such values is going nowhere and, in the end, will win. Deep down, the culture warriors know that, and it is that insecurity that drives their viciousness. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

Tiger frequently pinpointed his children \u2013 he also has a daughter, Sam \u2013 as the key motivators on his latest and successful comeback from serious injury. \u201cI think the kids are starting to understand how much this game means to me and some of the things I\u2019ve done in the game,\u201d he has explained. \u201cPrior to comeback, they only knew that golf caused me a lot of pain.\u201d Amid said comeback, Sam and Charlie mingled in crowds at tournaments without any apparent problem or elements of intrusion at all. That a video of Charlie\u2019s swing earned traction actually owes plenty to the privacy he and his sister have been granted. Whether a change in that approach was needless or harmful is probably for the Woods family to decide. When Tiger begins this year\u2019s competitive schedule next week in California, he will be asked not only how highly he rates his son\u2019s ability \u2013 expect a nondescript reply to that one \u2013 but whether he objects to Charlie being thrust into the spotlight. There may well be an understanding that, when he competes, attention is natural. If respectful in nature that needn\u2019t be problematic, but it remains intriguing that children of other legends \u2013 Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson \u2013 haven\u2019t become champion golfers, or threatened to be. Woods, McIlroy and others were recognisable faces by television audiences long before they became major champions. This was on the obvious basis of parental consent, which distinguishes their situations from events of the weekend. Nonetheless, if any of Lionel Messi\u2019s sons display a youthful aptitude for dribbling and shooting it seems obvious this would enter a broader domain. Woods Jr as a golfing success would be a story for the ages. Knowing of that possibility does no real harm, so long as the follow-up isn\u2019t incessant.",

Negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and the UK after 31 January, the scheduled date for Brexit, are expected to start in early March once both sides have settled positions on the main issues. EU diplomats were presented with the main principles of the free trade agreement on Monday in which \u201caccess to waters and quota share for fisheries\u201d would be made \u201cwithin the context of the economic partnership\u201d. Speaking in Luxembourg on Monday, Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, reiterated that the British government would also need to sign up to a series of commitments on state aid, environmental and labour standards to allow tariff- and quota-free trade.

      "body": "<p>Surprise has turned into panic. With Bernie Sanders leading in early battleground states and competitive with former vice-president Joe Biden nationally, the Democratic establishment is sounding the alarm. <br><br>\u201cShould Sanders actually pull off the feat of capturing the nomination, Donald Trump would have been given a gift that almost assures his re-election,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/yes-bernie-sanders-could-be-the-nomineeand-it-would-be-an-epic-nightmare-for-democrats\">says the Daily Beast</a>. Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign manager, Jim Messina, has a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/11/bernie-sanders-trump-jim-messina-097578\">similar message</a>: \u201cIf I were a campaign manager for Donald Trump and I look at the field, I would very much want to run against Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p> <p>The economy is doing well, and if Republicans get to run a \u201cbusiness\u201d candidate in Trump against a socialist ideologue in Sanders, Messina figures, they\u2019ll win. Obama himself has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2019/11/26/barack-obama-2020-democrats-candidates-biden-073025\">promised to intervene</a>, if necessary, to stop Sanders.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a part of the Democratic party\u2019s power structures, the same structures that failed to thwart Republican takeover of local and state governments and Trump\u2019s election, then perhaps you have reason for concern. Sanders is running a different campaign \u2013 in rhetoric, ideology and base \u2013 than other primary candidates. And he\u2019s clearly a threat to the Democratic party status quo \u2013 its large donors and its nomenklatura would be on the outs in a Sanders administration.<br><br>But if you\u2019re an ordinary Democratic voter, or just someone worried about the possibility of a second Trump term, there\u2019s no need for panic. Sanders is a candidate with both a long record of electoral success and real progressive accomplishments in both executive and legislative office. He may still be something of an outsider in Washington, owing to his style and political background, but he\u2019s far less of a radical than either his most ardent supporters or implacable foes care to admit.</p> <p>Sanders represents a new political mainstream in the United States, more egalitarian in outlook than liberalism but less likely to turn off the non-partisan, irregular voters who will need to be won over in November.</p> <p><strong>*</strong></p> <p>The case against Sanders\u2019s electability centers on two things: his age and his ideology. At 78, he is the oldest candidate in the field. But despite his October heart attack, Sanders appears to be in good health \u2013 energetic at rallies and quick-witted during debates. It helps, no doubt, that his major competitor in the primary, Biden, just turned 77 and Donald Trump will be 74 this year.</p> <p>Unable to play up age, for fear of disqualifying Biden as well, most of the attention has turned to Sanders\u2019s embrace of democratic socialism. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, captured the conventional wisdom last April when <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/04/23/cuomo-goes-after-bernie-americans-dont-want-to-elect-a-socialist/\">he said</a>, \u201cLet\u2019s not be so New York and so coastal right? I think it\u2019s very hard to get elected president as a socialist in this country, when you look at the states we have to win.\u201d</p> <p>This overstates how important \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d is as an ideological label to most Americans. To the extent that it\u2019s defined by its mainstream protagonists, such as Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, democratic socialism can be summed up in commonsense terms of fairness and shared responsibility, and associated with Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal (though this too is a relatively obscure point of reference).</p> <p>What Sanders\u2019s detractors don\u2019t understand is that even though it\u2019s to the left of contemporary liberalism, his redistributive politics has more appeal with self-described moderate voters than typical Democrat ones.</p> <p>As Jared Abbott and Dustin Guastella <a href=\"https://catalyst-journal.com/vol3/no2/a-socialist-party-in-our-time\">point out</a>, millions of Americans are working class, don\u2019t identify with either party, and barely turn out to vote, despite holding more egalitarian views on key issues than your average Democratic primary voters.</p> <p>These potential voters, like most of the country as a whole, support demands such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/medicare-for-all-taxes-saez-zucman\">Medicare for All</a>, federal job programs, trade unions, free higher education and student debt cancellation. Bridging the gap between the one in four Americans who identify as \u201cliberal\u201d and the two-thirds of Americans who <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/477746-poll-majority-support-tax-hike-for-richest-americans\">support tax hikes</a> on the rich is crucial to building a majoritarian leftwing politics.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019s strength lies in his popularity, both among and outside the Democratic base, and his ability to tie together progressive economic and social demands into a narrative that valorizes working people, vilifies a political and corporate elite, and sidesteps partisan \u201cculture war\u201d in favor of populist class war.</p> <p>He\u2019s an outsider, but one who picks his battles wisely and knows how to frame a debate. Take, for instance, his stance on gun control. Sanders has a \u201cD\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association, and he\u2019s worn that as a badge of honor, railing against the organization and its role in national politics. He\u2019s done this despite representing a state with high rates of gun ownership.<br><br>Sanders needs the votes of Vermont hunters. But luckily, they see him as a foe of lobbyists and a friend of theirs, and not an anti-second amendment zealot. They keep electing him, despite his support for gun control. This, in a nutshell, is how we win in a polarized country. We don\u2019t fight a liberal culture war, but rather we change the terms of the conflict so that we can win the broadest base possible and marginalize the powerful interests that dominate politics and the economy.</p> <p>Of course, we can only go so far with anecdotes. A relatively unknown figure, playing catch-up in closed Democratic primaries, Sanders fell short in 2016 and wasn\u2019t able to prove his electability against Trump then. However, his overall electoral record is a strong one. As Matthew Yglesias <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/24/18510756/bernie-sanders-2020-democrats-neoliberals-chill\">acknowledges</a>, Sanders\u2019s statewide results compare favorably to those of Democratic presidential nominees in Vermont:</p> <p>In 1992, Sanders got 58% to Bill Clinton\u2019s 46</p> <p>In 1996, Sanders got 55% to Clinton\u2019s 53%</p> <p>In 2000, Sanders got 69% to Al Gore\u2019s 51%</p> <p>In 2004, Sanders got 67% to John Kerry\u2019s 59%</p> <p>In 2012, Sanders got 71% to Obama\u2019s 67%.</p> <p>Sanders is personally popular, he\u2019s campaigning on a popular set of issues, and he\u2019s figured out a popular way to tie those issues together. Sanders has managed to take a sprawling program and make it seem cohesive, and not like a laundry list of progressive concerns. And his record speaks for itself, he\u2019s a seasoned campaigner who knows how to win elections.<br></p> <p>*</p> <p>The strongest case against Sanders has nothing to do with his electability or his democratic socialist identification, but rather with the disconnect between his political demands and a gridlocked political environment.</p> <p>Of course, this concern has nothing to do with his chances against Trump. A lot of good would be accomplished simply by removing the president and his party from the Oval Office. Not only would rightwing judicial and agency appointments be replaced by progressive ones, but Sanders would be able to pursue action on a host of issues \u2013 from climate change to criminal justice \u2013 <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/02/wielding-the-imperial-presidency\">through executive orders</a>. He\u2019d also be able to chart a new course for American foreign policy, keeping us out of unpopular wars and whittling down our sprawling imperial presence.</p> <p>But legislative failure and administrative incompetence in Washington would hurt Democratic re-election chances in 2024 and candidates at every level. It\u2019s here that Sanders\u2019s record as a public servant is instructive.</p> <p>When Sanders first came to prominence in Vermont, the state was relatively conservative. Burlington, in particular, was dominated by a few major families and a bipartisan political machine. Failed policies and constrained city finances led Sanders\u2019s predecessor as mayor, Gordon Paquette, to push austerity, cutting public services and the salaries of municipal employees.</p> <p>After his surprise mayoral election, Sanders found himself stymied by his city council and powerful business interests. He moved forward by rallying activists, forging new coalitions and slowly expanding his base by improving the delivery of public services and communicating honestly with his constituencies.</p> <p>Yglesias, of Vox, has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/7/21002895/bernie-sanders-2020-electability\">described</a> Sanders\u2019s time in both Burlington and Washington as periods of savvy organizing, pragmatism and success. But it\u2019s worth emphasizing that Sanders did not engage in compromise for the sake of compromise. He pursued alliances to serve his base and his actions managed not just to deliver material gains, but to help reshape politics in Vermont.</p> <p>In Washington, Sanders\u2019s coalition-building meant teaming up with liberal representatives (and occasionally cutting deals with conservatives) and voting for imperfect legislation, but at the same time using his platform to evangelize for his longer-term vision. Sanders wouldn\u2019t have maintained his reputation as a principled outsider if his effectiveness wasn\u2019t married to this ideological stubbornness.</p> <p>In 2009, when Obama met one of his leftwing supporters, the Nation publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel, he reminded her that \u201cthe perfect is the enemy of the good\u201d. With a commanding electoral mandate, the president must have felt confident that he had a formula for success. But under his watch, the Democrats lost 13 governorships and a whopping 816 state legislative seats.</p> <p>The same figures who steered the party under Obama also assured us that Hillary Clinton was closer to the \u201cmedian voter\u201d and thus more electable than either Sanders or Trump.</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s time we stopped pretending that Messina and Obama know how best to win elections in the United States.</p> <p>Sanders is an anti-establishment figure, and one with a decades-long history on the left, but his policy commitments are not outside the new American mainstream. If he can galvanize the same \u201cmoderate\u201d irregular voters who have been drawn to him in the past, he won\u2019t just beat Trump, he\u2019ll set the stage for a long-term political realignment \u2013 the political revolution he calls for.</p> <p>Sanders is a rebel, but he\u2019s one who people know and trust. In other words, he\u2019s the perfect candidate for 2020.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bhaskar Sunkara is the founding editor of <a href=\"http://jacobinmag.com/about/\">Jacobin magazine</a> and a Guardian US columnist.

Not only would rightwing judicial and agency appointments be replaced by progressive ones, but Sanders would be able to pursue action on a host of issues \u2013 from climate change to criminal justice \u2013 through executive orders. He\u2019d also be able to chart a new course for American foreign policy, keeping us out of unpopular wars and whittling down our sprawling imperial presence. But legislative failure and administrative incompetence in Washington would hurt Democratic re-election chances in 2024 and candidates at every level. It\u2019s here that Sanders\u2019s record as a public servant is instructive. When Sanders first came to prominence in Vermont, the state was relatively conservative. Burlington, in particular, was dominated by a few major families and a bipartisan political machine. Failed policies and constrained city finances led Sanders\u2019s predecessor as mayor, Gordon Paquette, to push austerity, cutting public services and the salaries of municipal employees. After his surprise mayoral election, Sanders found himself stymied by his city council and powerful business interests. He moved forward by rallying activists, forging new coalitions and slowly expanding his base by improving the delivery of public services and communicating honestly with his constituencies. Yglesias, of Vox, has described Sanders\u2019s time in both Burlington and Washington as periods of savvy organizing, pragmatism and success. But it\u2019s worth emphasizing that Sanders did not engage in compromise for the sake of compromise. He pursued alliances to serve his base and his actions managed not just to deliver material gains, but to help reshape politics in Vermont. In Washington, Sanders\u2019s coalition-building meant teaming up with liberal representatives (and occasionally cutting deals with conservatives) and voting for imperfect legislation, but at the same time using his platform to evangelize for his longer-term vision. Sanders wouldn\u2019t have maintained his reputation as a principled outsider if his effectiveness wasn\u2019t married to this ideological stubbornness. In 2009, when Obama met one of his leftwing supporters, the Nation publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel, he reminded her that \u201cthe perfect is the enemy of the good\u201d. With a commanding electoral mandate, the president must have felt confident that he had a formula for success. But under his watch, the Democrats lost 13 governorships and a whopping 816 state legislative seats. The same figures who steered the party under Obama also assured us that Hillary Clinton was closer to the \u201cmedian voter\u201d and thus more electable than either Sanders or Trump. Maybe it\u2019s time we stopped pretending that Messina and Obama know how best to win elections in the United States. Sanders is an anti-establishment figure, and one with a decades-long history on the left, but his policy commitments are not outside the new American mainstream. If he can galvanize the same \u201cmoderate\u201d irregular voters who have been drawn to him in the past, he won\u2019t just beat Trump, he\u2019ll set the stage for a long-term political realignment \u2013 the political revolution he calls for. Sanders is a rebel, but he\u2019s one who people know and trust. In other words, he\u2019s the perfect candidate for 2020.

The village of Blackhall Colliery in County Durham became the focus of global intrigue when detectives revealed that bundles of cash amounting to at least \u00a326,000 had been scattered anonymously through the village, often on pavements, since 2014. Everyone in the normally sleepy coastal community seemingly had a theory about who might be behind the apparent acts of kindness. Was it a lottery winner? A drug dealer seeking to get rid of their ill-gotten gains? Or was it someone elderly and possibly vulnerable? On Monday, the mystery was solved. Detectives revealed that two people had come forward to say they were responsible for leaving the meticulously prepared bundles of \u00a320 notes, each time amounting to about \u00a32,000, around Blackhall Colliery over the past six years. Durham police said the pair\u2019s identity would remain a tightly guarded secret, because they had no desire to receive public praise for their generosity. Both benefactors had recently received \u201cunexpected windfalls\u201d and wanted to give something back, the force said. They came forward to police around Christmas time after seeing the worldwide publicity generated by the police appeal in November. One told officers she had felt an emotional connection to the village after being helped by one of its residents and wanted to repay the kindness. The pair\u2019s names are being so closely guarded that even the detective who led the investigation, DC John Forster, said he did not know \u2013 or want to know \u2013 who they were. Forster said the pair revealed their identities to a senior officer at Durham police headquarters and proved that they were the true benefactors by answering a series of questions about the cash that only they would have known. \u201cSomething must have happened over time that brought them back to Blackhall and to give them such an emotional feeling towards the people there,\u201d said Forster, adding only that they were not local, married or related. They may even have left the cash separately before later joining forces. It was a mystery that had stumped detectives for years.

Detectives have confirmed the money had been deliberately left in locations where it might be found by people in need, including pensioners and people who had fallen on hard times. The anonymous duo said they would often wait to make sure the cash was picked up but had never sought any thanks for their donations. It is not known whether they will continue to leave bundles in future, but any that are found and handed in to police will continue to be returned to the finder. Forster said: \u201cI\u2019m really pleased we have an answer to this mystery and am glad we can now definitively rule out the money being linked to any crime or a vulnerable person.\u201d Forster said he did not know whether the pair had left more money than the \u00a326,000 that the honest residents of Blackhall handed in to the police. \u201cI\u2019m still happy to think if it was not all, then most of it,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>Maurizio Sarri had to update his wardrobe after taking over as manager of Juventus. A man who has always felt most comfortable in a tracksuit showed up for his first day of work in Turin sporting a shirt and tie. He soon confessed that his contract obliged him to wear such a uniform when representing the club away from the football pitch. For matches, a compromise was reached. Sarri\u2019s sideline attire at Juventus has typically featured suit trousers and a zip-neck sweater.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/12/barcelona-managerial-limbo-xavi-hernandez-luis-suarez\">Barcelona in managerial limbo after Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez turns down role</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Do the clothes make the man? At the end of Juventus\u2019 win over Roma on Sunday, one journalist asked Sarri whether this first half-season at the club had changed him. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cMy wife tells me I\u2019m the same dickhead I was before.\u201d</p> \n<p>Certainly, he finds himself in a familiar spot professionally. Sarri has guided his team to first in Serie A at the season\u2019s midway stage, just as he did with Napoli in 2015-16 and 2017-18. His opinion on the significance of being crowned as Italy\u2019s \u2018<em>campione d\u2019Inverno</em>\u2019 (winter champion) remains the same as ever: \u201cIt\u2019s a title that does not exist.\u201d</p> \n<p>Since Serie A expanded back to 20 teams in 2004, however, the winter champion has only twice failed to push on and finish in first. The exceptions both belonged to Sarri\u2019s Napoli teams. There was no shame in being outlasted by a Juventus side with far greater financial resources. This time around, he will have no such excuses.</p> \n<p>Sarri has shown evolution beyond his attire over the past seven months. Previously perceived as a rigid tactician with a tendency to over-rely on certain players, he has shown himself willing to experiment more widely with Juventus\u2019s deep squad.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31d70c3f9841bf5c5f42ae478faade7c611c991c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31d70c3f9841bf5c5f42ae478faade7c611c991c/0_54_2423_1454/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maurizio Sarri issues instructions to Paulo Dybala during the win over Roma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maurizio Sarri issues instructions to Paulo Dybala during the win over Roma.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RemotePhotoPress/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It took less than a month, from the start of the season, for Sarri to abandon his favourite 4-3-3, recognising such a system would not allow him to get the most from Paulo Dybala. The Argentinian was better suited to playing centrally, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo in a front two. And when the Portuguese started to struggle with form and fitness, Sarri found ways to get Gonzalo Higua\u00edn on the pitch instead \u2013 even if that meant provoking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/cristiano-ronaldo-angered-substitution-juventus-milan\">a stadium-exiting strop</a> from Serie A\u2019s most expensive player.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Where Sarri started the same eight footballers in more than 30 of Chelsea\u2019s Premier League games last season, only three of his Juventus squad \u2013 Ronaldo, Miralem Pjanic and Leonardo Bonucci \u2013 have made more than 15 starts. He has used 24 players already between Serie A and the Champions League.</p> \n<p>The Roma match marked the first time he had named an unchanged side, though it is hard to say whether he got his selection right. Juventus won chiefly because their opponents imploded, conceding twice in the opening 10 minutes. Aleksandar Kolarov\u2019s loose marking allowed Merih Demiral space to score a back-post volley, before a calamitous series of decisions gifted the visitors a penalty. Pau Lopez should never have passed the ball to Jordan Veretout, facing his own goal with Dybala in close attendance, but the Frenchman also dithered after receiving the ball and responded with an instinctive tug on his opponent\u2019s shirt after being dispossessed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1216448040950804480\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udca5 An explosive start for Juve!<br><br>\u26ab\u26aa Demiral finishes impressively from a free kick, and the Bianconeri take their first step back toward the top of Serie A <a href=\"https://t.co/bkJcEfp90O\">pic.twitter.com/bkJcEfp90O</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1216448040950804480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 12, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Roma were the better team thereafter \u2013 at half-time they were 2-0 down but had outshot their opponents 10-3 \u2013 yet the loss of Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/12/roma-juventus-psg-monaco-hellas-verona-genoa\">to a torn cruciate ligament</a> in the 36th minute was a devastating blow. The 20-year-old has been indispensable for Roma this season: offering acceleration and directness in transition. The injury was sustained on a characteristically brilliant dribble that had supporters roaring before he was brought down outside the Juventus box.</p> \n<p>As he departed on a stretcher, visibly shaking with tears, Ronaldo leaned in and stroked his hair. Zaniolo would later post the image on his Instagram account, promising to come back stronger. It seems unlikely that he will play again before the end of this season, though, his availability for Euro 2020 is also in doubt. There are similar worries for Demiral, who suffered an identical injury jumping under a high ball.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B7PGVQqiYlD/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Juve\u2019s victory moved them two points clear of Inter, who had drawn at home to Atalanta.</p> \n<p>In truth, the <em>Nerazzurri</em> were fortunate to take a point. They made a perfect start, Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez combining before the latter drilled a shot past Pierluigi Gollini. But the goalscorer should have been sent off for a cynical foul before half-time, using his hand to trip Rafael Toloi as the Atalanta player tried to follow up after seeing a header saved at close range.</p> \n<p>The failure of VAR to intervene remains inexplicable. Yet Atalanta refused to let anger knock them off course. Gian Piero Gasperini withdrew the ineffective Duvan Zapata \u2013 making his first start since injuring his thigh in October \u2013 and sent on Ruslan Malinovskyi, who dropped into deeper positions and helped to unblock a clogged midfield.</p> \n<p>Atalanta equalised through Robin Gosens and had their chance to take all the points when Alessandro Bastoni barged into Malinovskyi inside the box in the 88th minute. This time the penalty was awarded. Luis Muriel, who had scored 10 out of 10 Serie A spot-kicks in his career, stepped up to take it. Inter\u2019s goalkeeper, however, excels in situations like these. Samir Handanovic plunged to his right and pushed the ball away. In doing so, he moved alongside Gianluca Pagliuca as the two goalkeepers who have saved the most penalties \u2013 24 apiece \u2013 in Serie A history.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b65abec6b65ccda2433023707e1e4dceaba1eae\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b65abec6b65ccda2433023707e1e4dceaba1eae/0_100_4200_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samir Handanovic gets down to deny Luis Muriel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samir Handanovic gets down to deny Luis Muriel.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For Handanovic, this felt overdue. \u201cI hadn\u2019t saved one in two years,\u201d he observed, before his manager recycled familiar laments about the shallowness of Inter\u2019s squad. They were missing two important pieces through suspension here \u2013 Milan Skriniar and Nicol\u00f2 Barella \u2013 but tired legs are also a convenient excuse for a team that has faded late in several big games.</p> \n<p>In any case, the title race remains wide open. Conte shares Sarri\u2019s opinion on the meaninglessness of winter titles. Still, the Inter manager will hope his rival can continue the habit he has had so far, of failing to upgrade them to the real thing.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7e9f2ded-0994-4f18-8def-417cde77b729\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Internazionale 1-1 Atalanta, Lazio 1-0 Napoli, Cagliari 0-2 Milan, Roma 1-2 Juventus, Verona 2-1 Genoa, Torino 1-0 Bologna, Sampdoria 5-1 Brescia, Fiorentina 1-0 Spal, Udinese 3-0 Sassuolo</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Zlatan Ibrahimovic reopened his account with Milan, scoring the second goal in a 2-0 win over the suddenly lifeless Cagliari. According to the league\u2019s stat-keepers, he also recorded the second-fastest sprint of any player in a red-and-black shirt. Which, admirable though it is, does feel a bit damning on his teammates who are not approaching a 40th birthday. Boy, do Milan need the help of anyone who can stick the ball in the net, though. They have scored two fewer as a squad than Ciro Immobile on his own. There was another huge one from the Italian to sink Napoli and extend Lazio\u2019s winning run to 10 games.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Not the high point of the season: Verona\u2019s game against Genoa had to be delayed for 15 minutes because the lines of the pitch were wonky.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffbc44981940a32dde24116a1fc29740028f2d1b\"> \n <img

      "bodyText": "Maurizio Sarri had to update his wardrobe after taking over as manager of Juventus. A man who has always felt most comfortable in a tracksuit showed up for his first day of work in Turin sporting a shirt and tie. He soon confessed that his contract obliged him to wear such a uniform when representing the club away from the football pitch. For matches, a compromise was reached. Sarri\u2019s sideline attire at Juventus has typically featured suit trousers and a zip-neck sweater. Do the clothes make the man? At the end of Juventus\u2019 win over Roma on Sunday, one journalist asked Sarri whether this first half-season at the club had changed him. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cMy wife tells me I\u2019m the same dickhead I was before.\u201d Certainly, he finds himself in a familiar spot professionally. Sarri has guided his team to first in Serie A at the season\u2019s midway stage, just as he did with Napoli in 2015-16 and 2017-18. His opinion on the significance of being crowned as Italy\u2019s \u2018campione d\u2019Inverno\u2019 (winter champion) remains the same as ever: \u201cIt\u2019s a title that does not exist.\u201d Since Serie A expanded back to 20 teams in 2004, however, the winter champion has only twice failed to push on and finish in first. The exceptions both belonged to Sarri\u2019s Napoli teams. There was no shame in being outlasted by a Juventus side with far greater financial resources. This time around, he will have no such excuses. Sarri has shown evolution beyond his attire over the past seven months. Previously perceived as a rigid tactician with a tendency to over-rely on certain players, he has shown himself willing to experiment more widely with Juventus\u2019s deep squad. It took less than a month, from the start of the season, for Sarri to abandon his favourite 4-3-3, recognising such a system would not allow him to get the most from Paulo Dybala. The Argentinian was better suited to playing centrally, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo in a front two. And when the Portuguese started to struggle with form and fitness, Sarri found ways to get Gonzalo Higua\u00edn on the pitch instead \u2013 even if that meant provoking a stadium-exiting strop from Serie A\u2019s most expensive player. Where Sarri started the same eight footballers in more than 30 of Chelsea\u2019s Premier League games last season, only three of his Juventus squad \u2013 Ronaldo, Miralem Pjanic and Leonardo Bonucci \u2013 have made more than 15 starts. He has used 24 players already between Serie A and the Champions League. The Roma match marked the first time he had named an unchanged side, though it is hard to say whether he got his selection right. Juventus won chiefly because their opponents imploded, conceding twice in the opening 10 minutes. Aleksandar Kolarov\u2019s loose marking allowed Merih Demiral space to score a back-post volley, before a calamitous series of decisions gifted the visitors a penalty. Pau Lopez should never have passed the ball to Jordan Veretout, facing his own goal with Dybala in close attendance, but the Frenchman also dithered after receiving the ball and responded with an instinctive tug on his opponent\u2019s shirt after being dispossessed. Roma were the better team thereafter \u2013 at half-time they were 2-0 down but had outshot their opponents 10-3 \u2013 yet the loss of Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo to a torn cruciate ligament in the 36th minute was a devastating blow. The 20-year-old has been indispensable for Roma this season: offering acceleration and directness in transition. The injury was sustained on a characteristically brilliant dribble that had supporters roaring before he was brought down outside the Juventus box. As he departed on a stretcher, visibly shaking with tears, Ronaldo leaned in and stroked his hair. Zaniolo would later post the image on his Instagram account, promising to come back stronger. It seems unlikely that he will play again before the end of this season, though, his availability for Euro 2020 is also in doubt. There are similar worries for Demiral, who suffered an identical injury jumping under a high ball. Roma remained dogged without Zaniolo but, despite dominating possession and pulling one goal back from the penalty spot, could not carve out the chance they needed to equalise. Juve\u2019s victory moved them two points clear of Inter, who had drawn at home to Atalanta. In truth, the Nerazzurri were fortunate to take a point. They made a perfect start, Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez combining before the latter drilled a shot past Pierluigi Gollini. But the goalscorer should have been sent off for a cynical foul before half-time, using his hand to trip Rafael Toloi as the Atalanta player tried to follow up after seeing a header saved at close range. The failure of VAR to intervene remains inexplicable. Yet Atalanta refused to let anger knock them off course. Gian Piero Gasperini withdrew the ineffective Duvan Zapata \u2013 making his first start since injuring his thigh in October \u2013 and sent on Ruslan Malinovskyi, who dropped into deeper positions and helped to unblock a clogged midfield. Atalanta equalised through Robin Gosens and had their chance to take all the points when Alessandro Bastoni barged into Malinovskyi inside the box in the 88th minute. This time the penalty was awarded. Luis Muriel, who had scored 10 out of 10 Serie A spot-kicks in his career, stepped up to take it. Inter\u2019s goalkeeper, however, excels in situations like these. Samir Handanovic plunged to his right and pushed the ball away. In doing so, he moved alongside Gianluca Pagliuca as the two goalkeepers who have saved the most penalties \u2013 24 apiece \u2013 in Serie A history. For Handanovic, this felt overdue. \u201cI hadn\u2019t saved one in two years,\u201d he observed, before his manager recycled familiar laments about the shallowness of Inter\u2019s squad. They were missing two important pieces through suspension here \u2013 Milan Skriniar and Nicol\u00f2 Barella \u2013 but tired legs are also a convenient excuse for a team that has faded late in several big games. In any case, the title race remains wide open. Conte shares Sarri\u2019s opinion on the meaninglessness of winter titles. Still, the Inter manager will hope his rival can continue the habit he has had so far, of failing to upgrade them to the real thing. Talking points \u2022 Zlatan Ibrahimovic reopened his account with Milan, scoring the second goal in a 2-0 win over the suddenly lifeless Cagliari. According to the league\u2019s stat-keepers, he also recorded the second-fastest sprint of any player in a red-and-black shirt. Which, admirable though it is, does feel a bit damning on his teammates who are not approaching a 40th birthday. Boy, do Milan need the help of anyone who can stick the ball in the net, though. They have scored two fewer as a squad than Ciro Immobile on his own. There was another huge one from the Italian to sink Napoli and extend Lazio\u2019s winning run to 10 games. \u2022 Not the high point of the season: Verona\u2019s game against Genoa had to be delayed for 15 minutes because the lines of the pitch were wonky.",

Donald Trump let the news slip during a controversial interview with the Fox News host Laura Ingraham which was broadcast on Friday. \u201cI was interviewed by a very, very good writer, reporter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI can say Bob Woodward. He said he\u2019s doing something and this time I said, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll sit down.\u2019\u201d Woodward conducted hundreds of interviews for Fear: Trump in the White House, which became a bestselling story of extreme White House dysfunction in the first year of the Trump administration. Famously, he opened the book with Gary Cohn, then Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, removing a paper from the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, lest the president do something extreme. But he didn\u2019t talk to Trump, despite repeated requests. Fear came out in September 2018, eight months after Michael Wolff\u2019s explosive Fire and Fury set off a Trump book publishing boom that has never truly died down. Trump greeted Woodward\u2019s book with derision, calling it \u201ca piece of fiction\u201d and a \u201ccon of the public\u201d and its author a \u201cliar\u201d with \u201cphoney sources\u201d. But the president is nothing if not changeable and on Sunday, one of Woodward\u2019s chief competitors, Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, tweeted that Trump has \u201cmet with Woodward at least twice for his second book; Woodward, a legend, is now \u2018very good\u2019.\u201d When Fear came out, Sarah Sanders, then White House press secretary, claimed its sources were mostly \u201cformer disgruntled employees\u201d. On Sunday, the Post\u2019s Josh Dawsey duly reported that \u201cTrump has also told skeptical senior aides to cooperate with Woodward this time.\u201d Nearly 50 years have passed since Woodward and Carl Bernstein took down a president, a story they chronicled in the books All the President\u2019s Men and The Final Days. Woodward, now 76, took the fuss around Fear in his stride. Speaking to the Guardian, he remembered Ron Ziegler, Richard Nixon\u2019s press secretary, saying he and Bernstein were \u201ccharacter assassins\u201d. \u201cTrump and these people have said lots of things,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard character assassin.

Let the political system respond.\u201d Two years on, the political system has responded to Trump: he has been impeached by the Democratic-controlled House and awaits trial in the Republican Senate. Furthermore, by ordering the assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, Trump has precipitated the kind of international crisis that haunted the pages of Fear. When Fear was released, Trump suggested he might write a book of his own. No such tome has appeared although last week the president made news by saying he wanted to buy one of the many books about him: Donald J Trump: An Environmental Hero by Edward Russo. Now he has spoken to Trump, Woodward will doubtless double-source all the president\u2019s claims. \u201cTrump had one overriding problem,\u201d Woodward wrote in Fear, \u201c[which John Dowd the president\u2019s personal lawyer] knew but could not bring himself to say: \u2018You\u2019re a fucking liar.\u2019\u201d",

Bernard Preynat, 74, who has been defrocked, is believed to have sexually abused scores of boys over a 30-year period, many of them while they attended catechism classes or Boy Scout camps he ran. Even after he admitted he was \u201csick\u201d and had a problem with children, he was allowed to remain a priest in his diocese in Lyon. He appeared in court on Monday, almost 40 years after he is thought to have begun abusing the boys in his charge. The hearing was immediately postponed for 24 hours because of a strike by lawyers protesting outside the court against the government\u2019s pension reforms. Preynat, who is facing 10 charges of \u201csexual aggression\u201d against boys aged seven to 15 between 1971 and 1991, has admitted the abuse. Asked by the judge for his view on the postponement, the disgraced priest told the court: \u201cI would like this trial to happen as quickly as possible. It is five years since the legal case began and when I met some of the victims during the investigation, I heard their suffering for which I am guilty,\u201d he said. Nine victims were expected to give evidence in the case out of more than 90 who are believed to have come forward. Many of the claims have been deemed legally out of date. Preynat\u2019s abuse of young boys was known, documented and covered up by his superiors in the diocese, who were accused of putting the church\u2019s reputation before the victims\u2019 suffering. In an apologetic letters to parents, Preynat admitted he was \u201csick\u201d and \u201chad a problem with children\u201d, but was allowed to keep working with young people and run scout camps. Last March, his superior, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, was convicted of failing to report the abuse and failing to protect the children. He was given a suspended six-month sentence but has appealed against his conviction. The abuse is the subject of a film by the French director Fran\u00e7ois Ozon, called By the Grace of God, which echoed the words Barbarin said when asked why he had not acted to remove Preynat from contact with children. \u201cBy the grace of God most of these cases are now out of date,\u201d he replied, referring to the statute of limitations. Ozon, who met some of Preynat\u2019s victims, told the Observer in October: \u201cPreynat was honest and that was part of the drama. He never denied it.

Acknowledging that my question had been answered would have been the sensible thing to do, but petty rage isn\u2019t sensible.

Leave the potatoes to cook gently, shaking the pan a couple of times, for 15 minutes, in which time they will steam, braise and almost cook through.</p> <p>Uncover, add the rosemary and raise the heat. As the potatoes are almost cooked, this stage is all about crisping, so fry for 10 minutes, stirring often to brown all sides.</p> <p>Push the potatoes aside to create four small hollows, break the eggs into the hollows and fry until done. Serve immediately.</p>",

It is also familiar. Food is comfort for me when it is dependable; when I know what is coming: the apple, the egg, doughnuts for breakfast on a Saturday, and fried potatoes and eggs on a Monday. Today\u2019s dish isn\u2019t really a recipe; rather, it is a way with a kilo of potatoes and four eggs, and one of my favourite things to eat with anyone, but especially just the three of us at this time of year. I must end by noting that I have debated quite seriously with my partner Vincenzo for 11 years about cooking the potatoes, before admitting his way \u2013 uncovered, covered and then uncovered \u2013 is best, giving our comfort crisp edges. Fried potatoes and eggs Prep 10 min Cook 30 min Serves 2 Olive oil 1.2kg potatoes, peeled and cut into roughly 1cm cubes (you don\u2019t need to be too precise) Salt Leaves from 1 rosemary stalk 4 large eggs Pour some olive oil into a frying pan \u2013 seven tablespoons as a guide \u2013 then tip in the potatoes along with a good pinch of salt, and put over a medium flame. Cook for about three minutes, tossing the cubes around until they are coated with oil, then reduce the flame to low and cover with a lid. Leave the potatoes to cook gently, shaking the pan a couple of times, for 15 minutes, in which time they will steam, braise and almost cook through. Uncover, add the rosemary and raise the heat. As the potatoes are almost cooked, this stage is all about crisping, so fry for 10 minutes, stirring often to brown all sides. Push the potatoes aside to create four small hollows, break the eggs into the hollows and fry until done. Serve immediately.",

      "bodyText": "Almost a third of the world\u2019s oceans and land should be protected by the end of the decade to stop and reverse biodiversity decline that risks the survival of humanity, according to a draft Paris-style UN agreement on nature. To combat what scientists have described as the sixth mass extinction event in Earth\u2019s history, the proposal sets a 2030 deadline for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems and wildlife that perform crucial services for humans. The text, drafted by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, is expected to be adopted by governments in October at a crucial UN summit in the Chinese city of Kunming. It comes after countries largely failed to meet targets for the previous decade agreed in Aichi, Japan, in 2010. As well as calling for a commitment to protect at least 30% of the planet, the 20-point draft plan, which has been likened to the 2015 Paris agreement on the climate crisis, aims to introduce controls on invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. The draft text has been welcomed by environmental campaigners, who have called on governments to treat the targets outlined in the accord as the minimum acceptable level for which to aim. The director of Campaign for Nature, Brian O\u2019Donnell, said: \u201cToday\u2019s draft shows that countries are listening and that they recognise the increasingly important role that protecting land and water must play in confronting climate change, preventing wildlife extinctions, and supporting people and local communities. This is a very encouraging first step. \u201cMuch work remains to be done in the coming months to ensure that the rights of indigenous people are advanced, and bold conservation and finance targets are included in the final agreement.\u201d By 2030, the trade in wild species must be legal and sustainable, according to the draft document, which also aims to promote the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples and local communities in decision-making about biodiversity. The planned agreement forms part of a long-term international framework that aims to ensure biodiversity is sustainably valued and conserved by 2050. Enric Sala, explorer-in-residence at National Geographic, and co-author of the Global Deal for Nature, said: \u201cIf adopted, this target could achieve what our children have been calling on governments to do \u2013 listen to the science. If we are to stay below 1.5C (2.7F), prevent the extinction of 1 million species and the collapse of our life support system, we need to protect our intact wilderness, and ensure at least 30% of our land and oceans are protected by 2030. \u201cBut this is the floor, not the ceiling. Now every government on Earth must get behind this bold mission and drive through a global agreement for nature this year.\u201d In May, the world\u2019s leading scientists warned that nature is being destroyed at a rate up to hundreds of times higher than the average for the previous 10 million years, due to human activity. The destruction of the planet\u2019s coral reefs, rainforests and other vital ecosystems have placed human society in jeopardy, with the report\u2019s authors warning of \u201cominous\u201d consequences such as freshwater shortages and climate instability unless radical action is taken. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2020.

Handed out by the Los Angeles-based Broadcast Film Critics Association, the Critics Choice awards made Once Upon a Time in Hollywood its leading film, with three other nods, including Brad Pitt for best supporting actor and Tarantino for best screenplay. In an unusual turn of events, the best director prize was a tie between Parasite\u2019s Bong Joon-ho and 1917\u2019s Sam Mendes after voters could not split them. Joaquin Phoenix took home best actor for his portrayal of a tortured loner in Joker, while Ren\u00e9e Zellweger won best actress for playing Judy Garland in biopic Judy. Laura Dern won best supporting actress for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Marriage Story. The Irishman\u2019s stars, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, took to the stage together to accept the best acting ensemble gong. Eddie Murphy, who received a lifetime achievement award, was celebrating again when his Dolemite Is My Name won best comedy film. In the TV categories, Phoebe Waller-Bridge won best actress in a comedy series for Fleabag and had the audience in the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica laughing after admitting her surprise at receiving so much critical adulation for writing a character \u201cwho literally looks into the camera and says, \u2018Fuck me up the arse.\u2019\u201d She added: \u201cThank you for getting behind that.\u201d Waller-Bridge, who has also won Emmys and Golden Globes for Fleabag\u2019s second season, described working on the show as \u201cthe best experience I\u2019ll probably ever have\u201d. She also thanked Jennifer Lopez for influencing the Priest\u2019s character as his favourite song is her 2002 hit, Jenny from the Block. Waller-Bridge\u2019s co-star Andrew Scott \u2013 who plays the Priest \u2013 won best supporting actor in a comedy series. Best drama was won by Succession, while best supporting actor in a limited series or movie made for television went to Chernobyl\u2019s Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd. Netflix\u2019s When They See Us was named best limited series ahead of HBO and Sky\u2019s Chernobyl. Show creator Ava DuVernay thanked the streaming giant for letting \u201ca black woman do her thing\u201d.

More than a thousand of you voted on topics, and almost as many submitted story ideas.</p> <p>The five topics that received the most support were, in descending order:</p> <ul> <li><p>Disinformation and the 2020 election</p></li> <li><p>America\u2019s sick healthcare system</p></li> <li><p>Climate refugees and forced displacement in the US</p></li> <li><p>The high price of American food production: pollution, pesticides, etc</p></li> <li><p>America\u2019s neglected schools and classrooms</p></li> </ul> <p>We\u2019ve already started tackling all five winning topics in the new year, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/07/americans-healthcare-medical-costs\">Americans dying young</a> because they lack healthcare to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/07/honeybees-deaths-almonds-hives-aoe\">strain that our insatiable appetite for almonds is placing on America\u2019s bee population</a>. And in the coming months, we\u2019ll be developing bigger series and investigations based on some of the hundreds of story ideas readers submitted. Here are some of the topics that came up most frequently.</p> <h2><strong>The future of capitalism</strong></h2> <p>Dozens of you want to see more reporting on wealth inequality, executive pay, out-of-control housing costs, and the economic pressures confronting ageing Americans.</p> <p>Many of you also linked American capitalism to the planet\u2019s growing climate crisis. Garry Thomas, for example, asks that the Guardian \u201cexplore the economic barriers to adjusting our capitalistic society to deal with climate change\u201d. Another reader wants to hear from \u201cscientists, ethicists, theologians and ordinary people what their ideas would be for how to shift our values to an ethical economic system that will be less destructive to our environment\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/31/the-guardian-us-editor-john-mulholland-support\">From the editor of Guardian US: why we need your support in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The climate crisis</strong></h2> <p>The plurality of story ideas we received had do with the climate crisis. Readers want coverage on clean water shortages, the climate\u2019s impact of American food production, how the Trump administration\u2019s rollback on environmental protections is contributing to the crisis, whether recycling makes a meaningful difference, species extinction, overpopulation and more.</p> <p>\u201cEverything must be framed through the lens of climate change as every societal ill will be exacerbated by it,\u201d writes Marshall McComb. Anne Fenimore agrees: \u201cClimate change is the most important issue of our time. All the stories suggested are worthy of coverage, but they are meaningless if we do not address climate change.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Sign up to the Green Light email to get the planet\u2019s most important stories</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"sign up for green light email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4147\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Green Light\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest headlines\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>2020 elections and voting rights</strong></h2> <p>Guardian readers are particularly concerned about the health of America\u2019s elections going into 2020. Readers expressed anxiety about voter suppression, the electoral college and money in politics, among other electoral ills. \u201cKeep us informed about the real effects of political gerrymandering and how it has taken the voice from voters in many states, and defeats the popular vote by increasingly wider margins,\u201d Mike requests. Another reader asks that the Guardian \u201cstate the number of people purged from the voter rolls since the supreme court gutted the Voting Rights Act\u201d. (We\u2019re tracking the purges closely in our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-fight-to-vote\">Fight to vote project</a> and will keep doing so through the election.)</p> <h2><strong>America\u2019s broken healthcare</strong></h2> <p>In a country where up to 25% of the population delays medical care because of costs, it\u2019s no surprise that readers want more coverage of America\u2019s broken, convoluted healthcare system. A number of readers want more coverage of the pharmaceutical industry. Bart wants us to dig into the \u201ccollusion between government, doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical industries\u201d. Another reader asks: \u201cIf the motive of the medical industry was wellness instead of profit, and if the goal of the insurance industry was care instead of profit, then could we realize universal healthcare for all?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Hope and solutions</strong></h2> <p>We also heard repeated requests to break up the relentless pace of bad news with inspiring, solutions-oriented reporting on activists and innovators bringing change to their communities. Here, too, the overlap with climate change kept coming up. A reader named Nicholas asks for \u201cstories about people and organizations that are effectively organizing and working against systemic injustice, inequality, and climate change \u2026 Reading about people who are creating solutions and being their own change is also critical for instilling hope and offering models of how we can work against humanity\u2019s worst impulses.\u201d Another reader wants stories about \u201cpeople doing amazing and proactive changes to better our world. I want to meet the people who made paper straws, bamboo diapers, eco-friendly products etc.\u201d</p> <p>We couldn\u2019t agree more with the need for more news that inspires hope and optimism. That\u2019s the thinking behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-upside\">the Upside</a>, a project that focuses on the people, ideas and initiatives trying to solve some of the world\u2019s biggest problems.

Literally \u2013 several readers acknowledged the necessity of reporting on the American president but want fewer visual reminders. \u201cSkip the picture, please,\u201d writes one reader.</p> <p>To everyone who voted, shared an idea and supported the Guardian in the last year: thank you.

      "bodyText": "In November, we launched an ambitious year-end campaign to to raise $1.5m from our US readers to support our journalism in 2020. We\u2019re excited to report that thanks to more than 30,000 Guardian readers from all 50 states, we\u2019ve already raised more than $1.3m. Your support will give us the resources to cover what\u2019s already proving be a pivotal year for America \u2013 with everything from the presidential election to climate policy to the supreme court at stake. We also asked Guardian US readers to vote on what they want our newsroom to focus on in 2020. More than a thousand of you voted on topics, and almost as many submitted story ideas. The five topics that received the most support were, in descending order: Disinformation and the 2020 election America\u2019s sick healthcare system Climate refugees and forced displacement in the US The high price of American food production: pollution, pesticides, etc America\u2019s neglected schools and classrooms We\u2019ve already started tackling all five winning topics in the new year, from the Americans dying young because they lack healthcare to the strain that our insatiable appetite for almonds is placing on America\u2019s bee population. And in the coming months, we\u2019ll be developing bigger series and investigations based on some of the hundreds of story ideas readers submitted. Here are some of the topics that came up most frequently. The future of capitalism Dozens of you want to see more reporting on wealth inequality, executive pay, out-of-control housing costs, and the economic pressures confronting ageing Americans. Many of you also linked American capitalism to the planet\u2019s growing climate crisis. Garry Thomas, for example, asks that the Guardian \u201cexplore the economic barriers to adjusting our capitalistic society to deal with climate change\u201d. Another reader wants to hear from \u201cscientists, ethicists, theologians and ordinary people what their ideas would be for how to shift our values to an ethical economic system that will be less destructive to our environment\u201d. The climate crisis The plurality of story ideas we received had do with the climate crisis. Readers want coverage on clean water shortages, the climate\u2019s impact of American food production, how the Trump administration\u2019s rollback on environmental protections is contributing to the crisis, whether recycling makes a meaningful difference, species extinction, overpopulation and more. \u201cEverything must be framed through the lens of climate change as every societal ill will be exacerbated by it,\u201d writes Marshall McComb. Anne Fenimore agrees: \u201cClimate change is the most important issue of our time. All the stories suggested are worthy of coverage, but they are meaningless if we do not address climate change.\u201d Sign up to the Green Light email to get the planet\u2019s most important stories 2020 elections and voting rights Guardian readers are particularly concerned about the health of America\u2019s elections going into 2020. Readers expressed anxiety about voter suppression, the electoral college and money in politics, among other electoral ills. \u201cKeep us informed about the real effects of political gerrymandering and how it has taken the voice from voters in many states, and defeats the popular vote by increasingly wider margins,\u201d Mike requests. Another reader asks that the Guardian \u201cstate the number of people purged from the voter rolls since the supreme court gutted the Voting Rights Act\u201d. (We\u2019re tracking the purges closely in our Fight to vote project and will keep doing so through the election.) America\u2019s broken healthcare In a country where up to 25% of the population delays medical care because of costs, it\u2019s no surprise that readers want more coverage of America\u2019s broken, convoluted healthcare system. A number of readers want more coverage of the pharmaceutical industry. Bart wants us to dig into the \u201ccollusion between government, doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical industries\u201d. Another reader asks: \u201cIf the motive of the medical industry was wellness instead of profit, and if the goal of the insurance industry was care instead of profit, then could we realize universal healthcare for all?\u201d Hope and solutions We also heard repeated requests to break up the relentless pace of bad news with inspiring, solutions-oriented reporting on activists and innovators bringing change to their communities. Here, too, the overlap with climate change kept coming up. A reader named Nicholas asks for \u201cstories about people and organizations that are effectively organizing and working against systemic injustice, inequality, and climate change \u2026 Reading about people who are creating solutions and being their own change is also critical for instilling hope and offering models of how we can work against humanity\u2019s worst impulses.\u201d Another reader wants stories about \u201cpeople doing amazing and proactive changes to better our world. I want to meet the people who made paper straws, bamboo diapers, eco-friendly products etc.\u201d We couldn\u2019t agree more with the need for more news that inspires hope and optimism. That\u2019s the thinking behind the Upside, a project that focuses on the people, ideas and initiatives trying to solve some of the world\u2019s biggest problems. For a weekly antidote to the gloom so prominently featured in daily headlines, you can sign up for the Upside\u2019s weekly newsletter here \u2013 and we\u2019re committed to finding more hopeful stories in the US as well. Less Trump? On what\u2019s perhaps a related note, a lot of you would like to see less of Trump. Literally \u2013 several readers acknowledged the necessity of reporting on the American president but want fewer visual reminders. \u201cSkip the picture, please,\u201d writes one reader. To everyone who voted, shared an idea and supported the Guardian in the last year: thank you. Your input and support make our work possible. It\u2019s not too late to support the Guardian\u2019s journalism in 2020 and beyond; you can do so here",

But the California governor, Gavin Newsom, rejected PG&amp;E\u2019s plan to leave bankruptcy, calling it \u201cwoefully short\u201d of reorganizing the company \u201cto provide safe, reliable, and affordable service to its customers\u201d. In 2018, the state legislature passed a bill aimed at heading off that bankruptcy but providing new funding sources for fire-burdened utilities and requiring new wildfire safety plans \u2013 which ultimately included de-energization. In 2019, at Newsom\u2019s urging, the legislature passed new legislation that created a wildfire liabilities fund, and placed a June deadline for PG&amp;E to leave bankruptcy. Critics argued that both bills were essentially bailouts for investor-owned utilities. \u201cI voted no on both of them \u2013 I thought that they shifted financial responsibility on to Californians and neglected to raise public safety to the paramount priority,\u201d said assembly member Marc Levine. \u201cDe-energization was a massive failure.\u201d While California\u2019s fires have been orders of magnitude more destructive than the blackouts, they touch just a fraction of the millions who had their lights turned off in 2019 \u2013 making de-energization a hotter problem for politicians and PG&amp;E to solve.They have just a few months before the next fire season begins. Three new pieces of legislation introduced in the state legislature\u2019s first week back in 2020 aimed at addressing a troubled PG&amp;E, regardless of the bankruptcy\u2019s resolution. A new proposal from Levine would install a public administrator from the state regulatory commission for a period of six months to oversee all the functions of a floundering investor-owned utility. \u201cWe need to stop treating PG&amp;E like a business to keep solvent and more like a convicted felon that needs to be held accountable,\u201d said Levine. Assembly member Kansen Chu authored two bills directly aimed at de-energization which would authorize state regulators to determine if utilities should compensate customers after each power shutoff, and require utilities to support customers who rely on power for medical needs. \u201cThere\u2019s so much ageing infrastructure, but that\u2019s not going to be fixed very soon,\u201d Chu said. \u201cIn the meantime I want them to be more responsible and more careful with their shutoffs because the first shut off was a disaster.\u201d But leaving the power on in the meantime, said Chu, \u201cis probably more devastating\u201d.",

Discovering that few companies were willing to either dismantle buildings carefully enough for materials to be reused, or reuse second hand materials without warranties, they set up their own in-house demolition and construction arm, carrying out performance tests on reclaimed building components and taking on the liability.<br><br>There are similar initiatives underway across Europe, from Belgian group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2019/sep/29/meet-the-inventors-who-want-to-upgrade-your-life\">Rotor\u2019s careful deconstruction of postwar office blocks</a> , to Lacaton &amp; Vassal\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/12/grand-parc-bordeaux-lacaton-vassal-mies-van-der-rohe-award\">exemplary retrofit work in France</a>. But the kind of wholesale revolution that the industry needs can\u2019t just rely on a few progressive architects willing to take on the entire process themselves.

The green credentials have proved popular: the homes were rented out more quickly than any other housing scheme in the city. Another of Lendager\u2019s projects reaches closer to 70% CO2 reduction. Upcycle Studios, a terrace of live-work units, uses recycled concrete, reclaimed oak floors, aluminium from recycled cans, and new thermal windows made by combining two reclaimed double glazed panels. Concrete usually either ends up in landfill, or is crushed for use in roads, but this project shows that waste aggregate (1,700 tonnes of it) can make high quality new concrete, reducing the consumption of virgin materials by almost half. Like Rau, the Lendager Group has been campaigning for the construction industry to move towards a more circular model, but finding few receptive contractors, they decided to get on with it themselves. Discovering that few companies were willing to either dismantle buildings carefully enough for materials to be reused, or reuse second hand materials without warranties, they set up their own in-house demolition and construction arm, carrying out performance tests on reclaimed building components and taking on the liability. There are similar initiatives underway across Europe, from Belgian group Rotor\u2019s careful deconstruction of postwar office blocks , to Lacaton &amp; Vassal\u2019s exemplary retrofit work in France. But the kind of wholesale revolution that the industry needs can\u2019t just rely on a few progressive architects willing to take on the entire process themselves. Nor can it depend on the moral conscience of a few enlightened clients. For a more circular conception of construction to take off, there must be an economic incentive. \u201cThe moral argument simply doesn\u2019t work,\u201d says Rau. \u201cWe have to organise our thinking along the financial axis.\u201d He calculates that, on average, the residual value of a building\u2019s materials equates to around 18% of the original construction cost \u2013 a huge bonus to the bottom line, considering clients are usually saddled with the cost of disposing of demolition waste, rather than reaping any reward from it. \u201cWe have to show that materials are a valuable asset, rather than an expense to be lumbered with.\u201d One recent study found that the 2.6m tonnes of building material \u201creleased\u201d each year through renovation and demolition in Amsterdam alone has a value of \u20ac688m . It is a financial opportunity that has caught the eye of Dutch bank giant ABN Amro, which presides over a \u20ac10.6bn commercial real estate portfolio. At the opening of its Circl pavilion in Amsterdam, a showcase building to demonstrate circular construction principles, one senior executive summed it up: \u201cWe are no longer just a financial bank, but a materials bank.\u201d In a world of increasing scarcity, the windows, beams and slabs of their property empire will be valuable assets in themselves. While much of mainland Europe is well on the way to reimagining buildings as \u201curban mines\u201d of potential, the UK is slowly beginning to catch up. Architect Duncan Baker-Brown, who published the Re-Use Atlas in 2017, says the subject has gone from being a niche pursuit to something being discussed at high level in the last year. \u201cSince Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion, the industry is starting to wake up,\u201d he says. \u201cNational legislation is still way behind, but a lot of local authorities are getting on with it anyway.\u201d He has been working with Brighton and Hove council to instil circular principles into the way local procurement works, and will be running an architectural summer school looking at how waste streams can be harvested from one of the council\u2019s demolition sites and reused. In a welcome sign of progress, the new London Plan will require planning applications to include a Circular Economy Statement, demonstrating how the building components can be disassembled and reused. Signalling a wider shift in the profession, the Architect\u2019s Journal has joined the movement and launched a RetroFirst campaign, urging architects to prioritise refurbishment over demolition and new build. Along with suggesting changes to building regulations to encourage reuse, one of its primary demands is reforming a strange quirk of VAT which sees refurbishment and renovation projects taxed at 20%, while carbon-guzzling new-builds are exempt. Architecture prizes are also indicating the change in mindset, in a welcome shift away from celebrating the signature baubles of the past. The World Building of the Year award was recently given to a retrofit project, which saw a former train shed in the Dutch city of Tilburg turned into a new public library . For two years in a row, the hallowed Mies van der Rohe Award has gone to radical renovations of maligned postwar housing estates: the Kleiburg in Amsterdam and the Grand Parc in Bordeaux have both been transformed by clever, light-touch interventions. The architects of the latter project, Lacaton &amp; Vassal, have a rallying cry that all our cities would do well to adopt from now on: \u201cNever demolish, never remove or replace, always add, transform, and reuse!\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion and catch up on our best stories",

Indeed, McConnell went one step further, threatening to accuse Obama of trying to influence the outcome for Clinton should the administration issue a statement of condemnation. In this way, he recklessly torpedoed a bipartisan effort to protect the integrity of a presidential election. McConnell\u2019s acts of hyper-partisanship are less noisy than the president\u2019s, but no less effective in poisoning American politics and degrading our constitutional democracy. Now, on the eve of what should be sober reckoning with presidential malfeasance, he seeks to use the very poisoned conditions that he has helped create to justify even more toxic acts. Having gutted the impeachment trial before it has even begun, McConnell has dared the electorate to make him and his party pay a price at the polls. Whether they will is the great question to be answered in 2020. Lawrence Douglas is the James J Grosfeld professor of law, jurisprudence and social thought, at Amherst College, Massachusetts.

      "bodyText": "On a warm summer day in 2018, Lissa Yellow-bird Chase packed her vehicle with sunscreen, iPads, spiritual items and water. She drove to the bank of Lake Sakakawea on the edge of Fort Berthold Reservation, in western North Dakota. She parked her vehicle, bearing the license plate \u201cSEARCH\u201d, and prepared for a long day ahead. As she\u2019d done several days that summer, she began to scour her territory for clues. With fishing sonar equipment and a dilapidated old boat, she had nothing to go by but her instincts. It was here, in the deep blue lake, that she and volunteers from her group the Sahnish Scouts of North Dakota, found the body of Olivia Lonebear. The 32-year-old and mother of five had last been seen in New Town, a small oil-boom city on the edge of Fort Berthold Reservation, nine months prior. A hidden epidemic Top left: Mary Eder Cleland in Wolf Point at the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. Mary\u2019s adopted daughter, Dawn Eder, went missing five years ago. Top right: Prairiedawn Thunderchild (right), 16, with her sister Tahnee Thunderchild (center), 14, and their mother. The sisters were almost abducted a year ago by a vehicle of oil workers in Wolf Point. Bottom left: Stacie Smith is the elected chief judge for the Fort Peck tribes. Fort Peck was one of the five pilot tribes across the whole nation to enact the Violence Against Women Act. Bottom right: Heather Belgrace, 23, with her dog, Vador. Heather\u2019s best friend and cousin were murdered. \u2018I hope one day we can get them justice,\u2019 she said. Countless women have been victims of similar, less high-profile cases, but Lonebear\u2019s death exposed the reality in which Native American women and girls live \u2013 what the former North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp called a \u201chidden epidemic\u201d. The facts are dire. Native American women and girls are sexually assaulted and targeted at rates far greater than other American women, and they are 10 times more likely to be murdered. In 2015, the Canadian government announced a national inquiry into the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG). In June, the commissioners found the state responsible for \u201ca race-based genocide\u201d. The treatment of Indigenous women is no less alarming across the border: while Canada collects some data, the US federal government does not track how many people like Lonebear go missing or turn up murdered. Twenty-three-year-old Heather Belgrade, Lonebear\u2019s cousin who lives across the border in north-eastern Montana, has also been grieving the death of her best friend Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, who was brutally murdered in 2017. The case helped to bring about Savanna\u2019s Act, which enacted a set of reforms in how law enforcement agencies deal with cases of missing and murdered Native Americans.

Jermain Charlo went missing on 15 June 2018 in Missoula at age 23. The dangers of the oil industry While the realities facing Native American women and girls are gaining more attention, what is less understood are the effects of extractive industries, mainly oil, on Native American women and communities. Residents across Fort Peck Reservation are sensitized to the impacts of the oil industry. The reservation is situated not far from large oil boom towns like Williston and Watford City in North Dakota and is in the direct vicinity of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion. Many of the community members I spoke to discussed the influx of crime, sexual violence and drugs when the Bakken oil boom began in 2006. They\u2019re bracing for what\u2019s to come. Prairiedawn Thunderchild and her older sister Tahnee Thunderchild learned of those dangers early one evening when they were walking home to their apartment in Wolf Point, a small town of a few thousand people, on Fort Peck Reservation in Montana. A fracking location in Williston, North Dakota, part of the Bakken oil shale that has seen a large influx of temporary oil workers. The Bakken area encompasses North Dakota, Montana, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. That evening, the girls saw a car with North Dakota license plates approaching. The car began to follow them, and the men, whom they didn\u2019t recognize from their community, told the sisters to get into the vehicle. The girls knew that a car full of non-native men with North Dakota plates probably meant they were oil employees. They had heard stories of trafficking, kidnapping and sexual assault. They ran and called the tribal police. \u201c[They] probably wanted gross things from us,\u201d Tahnee told me. \u201cMan camps,\u201d as they have come to be known, house thousands of temporary oil workers with disposable income, who are dealing with the stressors of dangerous working conditions. The proposed Keystone XL pipeline would bring in more \u201cman camps\u201d affecting Native American women and communities. \u201cOil industry camps may be impacting domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in the direct and surrounding communities in which they reside,\u201d the Department Of Justice found.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United are ready to firm up their interest in Bruno Fernandes, with the Sporting Lisbon midfielder keen on a move priced at around \u20ac70m (\u00a360m). Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has identified the 25-year-old as an option to strengthen a position depleted by the departures of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini plus the long-term injury to Scott McTominay. While United have refused to comment on their expected approach for the Portugal international it is understood Sporting are braced for Fernandes to be sold to United. Sporting are exploring alternatives to replace a player who has 13 goals in 22 appearances this season and 19 caps for his country. At the weekend Jorge Silas, Sporting\u2019s manager, was asked if Fernandes will be available for Friday\u2019s derby with Benfica. He said: \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee any of these things because I don\u2019t know. Bruno is a huge player and all players like him have a lot of [interest from the] market. I don\u2019t like to think about it, but I\u2019ll be thinking of alternatives in case Bruno leaves. I hope it doesn\u2019t happen, but we have to start thinking that.\u201d",

This was their 15th win in 15 competitive fixtures this season \u2013 10 of them in the Pro 14 \u2013 and they have a squad whose depth is steadily increasing. In Max Deegan they have another fine prospect at No 8 where Caelan Doris has already forced himself into the Six Nations reckoning and they will be a daunting prospect for any opponent heading to Dublin in the quarter-finals. All that is now required to rubber-stamp a quarter-final in Dublin is a solid result in Treviso, although the Italian side are becoming increasingly hard to beat at home.

It seems a team must simply do their time in this competition before they start to get the hang of it. Exeter represent as poignant an illustration of this truth as any. This is their seventh attempt and the first time they have qualified for the quarter-finals in a manner that might be described as \u201cunder control\u201d. They did qualify as group winners in 2016 with a mere three victories, tied on 16 with two others in one of the most outlandish pools ever known.

Ulster ought to win at home to Bath, so are ready to step in should Quins rouse themselves, but a best-runners-up spot is their likeliest reward.</p> <h2><strong>Pool 4: Racing 92 and Saracens have it all to play for</strong></h2> <p>Racing 92\u2019s bonus-point victory over Munster delivered the pool title and left the Irish province all but eliminated. Racing trailed for long periods but the strength of their bench gave them the means to pull away with three tries in the final 10 minutes. Racing may require something from their final match at Saracens on a day when the holders need to win to have a chance of going through as one of the best runners-up, vying with Gloucester and Northampton, who also have 14 points but both finish their campaigns in France. Glasgow are also in the mix on 12 points but Munster\u2019s failure to leave Paris with a bonus point means they need Saracens to secure no more than one on Sunday, take five off the Ospreys and have other results go their way. If Sarries go through, they could find themselves in Exeter in the last eight.</p> <p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/11/ospreys-saracens-european-champions-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Ospreys 15-22 Saracens</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Pool 5: Cipriani injury hurts Gloucester when it matters</strong></h2> <p>If Gloucester fail to progress in Europe this season they will not have to look far for the reasons. They sent a weakened side to Montpellier and lost 30-27 and also went down by three points to Connacht in Galway, leaving themselves the tricky task of winning in Toulouse this Sunday. It does not help that their key playmaker Danny Cipriani limped off on Saturday with a sore-looking lower leg injury, nor that Toulouse are one of only two teams to have won all their five pool games thus far. The good news is that, if selected, Jake Polledri will make sizeable dents in any defence and their 18-year-old wing Louis Rees-Zammit looks a threat in any company. So good has the fleet-footed newcomer been in recent weeks that it will a surprise if Wales do not include him in their Six Nations squad to be named on Wednesday, if only to sidestep any possibility of England nipping in and trying to poach the Penarth-born flyer themselves.</p>",

Pool 4: Racing 92 and Saracens have it all to play for Racing 92\u2019s bonus-point victory over Munster delivered the pool title and left the Irish province all but eliminated. Racing trailed for long periods but the strength of their bench gave them the means to pull away with three tries in the final 10 minutes. Racing may require something from their final match at Saracens on a day when the holders need to win to have a chance of going through as one of the best runners-up, vying with Gloucester and Northampton, who also have 14 points but both finish their campaigns in France. Glasgow are also in the mix on 12 points but Munster\u2019s failure to leave Paris with a bonus point means they need Saracens to secure no more than one on Sunday, take five off the Ospreys and have other results go their way. If Sarries go through, they could find themselves in Exeter in the last eight. \u2022 Match report: Ospreys 15-22 Saracens Pool 5: Cipriani injury hurts Gloucester when it matters If Gloucester fail to progress in Europe this season they will not have to look far for the reasons. They sent a weakened side to Montpellier and lost 30-27 and also went down by three points to Connacht in Galway, leaving themselves the tricky task of winning in Toulouse this Sunday. It does not help that their key playmaker Danny Cipriani limped off on Saturday with a sore-looking lower leg injury, nor that Toulouse are one of only two teams to have won all their five pool games thus far. The good news is that, if selected, Jake Polledri will make sizeable dents in any defence and their 18-year-old wing Louis Rees-Zammit looks a threat in any company. So good has the fleet-footed newcomer been in recent weeks that it will a surprise if Wales do not include him in their Six Nations squad to be named on Wednesday, if only to sidestep any possibility of England nipping in and trying to poach the Penarth-born flyer themselves.",

Answer yes and you\u2019ve seen a deepfake. The 21st century\u2019s answer to Photoshopping, deepfakes use a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to make images of fake events, hence the name deepfake. Want to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&amp;v=yaq4sWFvnAY&amp;feature=emb_logo\" title=\"\">put new words</a> in a politician\u2019s mouth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/04/a-deep-fake-app-will-make-us-film-stars-but-will-we-regret-our-narcissism\" title=\"\">star in your favourite movie</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCBTZh41Ris&amp;feature=emb_logo\" title=\"\">dance like a pro</a>? Then it\u2019s time to make a deepfake.</p> <h2>What are they for?</h2> <p>Many are pornographic. The AI firm Deeptrace found 15,000 deepfake videos online in September 2019, a near doubling over nine months. A staggering <a href=\"https://deeptracelabs.com/mapping-the-deepfake-landscape/\" title=\"\">96% were pornographic</a> and 99% of those mapped faces from female celebrities on to porn stars. As new techniques allow unskilled people to make deepfakes with a handful of photos, fake videos are likely to spread beyond the celebrity world to fuel revenge porn. As Danielle Citron, a professor of law at Boston University, puts it: \u201cDeepfake technology is being weaponised against women.\u201d Beyond the porn there\u2019s plenty of spoof, satire and mischief.</p> <h2>Is it just about videos?</h2> <p>No. Deepfake technology can create convincing but entirely fictional photos from scratch. A non-existent Bloomberg journalist, \u201cMaisy Kinsley\u201d, who had a profile on LinkedIn and Twitter, was probably a deepfake. Another LinkedIn fake, \u201cKatie Jones\u201d, claimed to work at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, but is thought to be a deepfake created for a foreign spying operation.</p> <p>Audio can be deepfaked too, to create \u201c<a href=\"https://modulate.ai/\" title=\"\">voice skins</a>\u201d or \u201d<a href=\"https://www.respeecher.com/\" title=\"\">voice clones</a>\u201d of public figures. Last March, the chief of a UK subsidiary of a German energy firm paid nearly \u00a3200,000 into a Hungarian bank account after being <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402\" title=\"\">phoned by a fraudster who mimicked the German CEO\u2019s voice</a>. The company\u2019s insurers believe the voice was a deepfake, but the evidence is unclear. Similar scams have reportedly used recorded WhatsApp voice messages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61f857b39fd48a847fb1f8bce039710b536c4c2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61f857b39fd48a847fb1f8bce039710b536c4c2f/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A comparison of an original and deepfake video of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A comparison of an original and deepfake video of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How are they made?</h2> <p>University researchers and special effects studios have long pushed the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with video and image manipulation. But deepfakes themselves were born in 2017 when a Reddit user of the same name posted doctored porn clips on the site. The videos swapped the faces of celebrities \u2013 Gal Gadot, Taylor Swift, Scarlett Johansson and others \u2013 on to porn performers.</p> <p>It takes a few steps to make a face-swap video. First, you run thousands of face shots of the two people through an AI algorithm called an encoder. The encoder finds and learns similarities between the two faces, and reduces them to their shared common features, compressing the images in the process. A second AI algorithm called a decoder is then taught to recover the faces from the compressed images. Because the faces are different, you train one decoder to recover the first person\u2019s face, and another decoder to recover the second person\u2019s face. To perform the face swap, you simply feed encoded images into the \u201cwrong\u201d decoder. For example, a compressed image of person A\u2019s face is fed into the decoder trained on person B. The decoder then reconstructs the face of person B with the expressions and orientation of face A. For a convincing video, this has to be done on every frame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14084b223de94e8bb98f982e39c35eeb46f7882a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14084b223de94e8bb98f982e39c35eeb46f7882a/0_0_5105_3062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Original and deepfake videos of Vladimir Putin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comparing original and deepfake videos of Russian president Vladimir Putin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandra Robinson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another way to make deepfakes uses what\u2019s called a generative adversarial network, or Gan. A Gan pits two artificial intelligence algorithms against each other. The first algorithm, known as the generator, is fed random noise and turns it into an image. This synthetic image is then added to a stream of real images \u2013 of celebrities, say \u2013 that are fed into the second algorithm, known as the discriminator. At first, the synthetic images will look nothing like faces. But repeat the process countless times, with feedback on performance, and the discriminator and generator both improve. Given enough cycles and feedback, the generator will start producing <a href=\"https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2017-10_Progressive-Growing-of\" title=\"\">utterly realistic faces</a> of completely nonexistent celebrities.</p> <h2>Who is making deepfakes?</h2> <p>Everyone from academic and industrial researchers to amateur enthusiasts, visual effects studios and porn producers. Governments might be dabbling in the technology, too, as part of their <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/06/22/controversial-gchq-unit-domestic-law-enforcement-propaganda/\" title=\"\">online strategies</a> to discredit and disrupt extremist groups, or <a href=\"https://apnews.com/bc2f19097a4c4fffaa00de6770b8a60d\" title=\"\">make contact</a> with targeted individuals, for example.</p> <h2>What technology do you need?</h2> <p>It is hard to make a good deepfake on a standard computer. Most are created on high-end desktops with powerful graphics cards or better still with computing power in the cloud. This reduces the processing time from days and weeks to hours. But it takes expertise, too, not least to touch up completed videos to reduce flicker and other visual defects. That said, plenty of tools are now available to help people make deepfakes. Several companies will <a href=\"https://deepfakesweb.com/\" title=\"\">make them for you</a> and do all the processing in the cloud. There\u2019s even a mobile phone app, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/02/chinese-face-swap-app-zao-triggers-privacy-fears-viral\" title=\"\">Zao</a>, that lets users add their faces to a list of TV and movie characters on which the system has trained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ce9be28462732664457fcf75d0a320f7a70c351\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ce9be28462732664457fcf75d0a320f7a70c351/0_0_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese face-swapping app Zao\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese face-swapping app Zao has caused privacy concerns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imaginechina/SIPA USA/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How do you spot a deepfake?</h2> <p>It gets harder as the technology improves. In 2018, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02877\" title=\"\">US researchers</a> discovered that deepfake faces don\u2019t blink normally. No surprise there: the majority of images show people with their eyes open, so the algorithms never really learn about blinking. At first, it seemed like a silver bullet for the detection problem. But no sooner had the research been published, than deepfakes appeared with blinking. Such is the nature of the game: as soon as a weakness is revealed, it is fixed.</p> <p>Poor-quality deepfakes are easier to spot. The lip synching might be bad, or the skin tone patchy. There can be flickering around the edges of transposed faces. And fine details, such as hair, are particularly hard for deepfakes to render well, especially where strands are visible on the fringe. Badly rendered jewellery and teeth can also be a giveaway, as can strange lighting effects, such as inconsistent illumination and reflections on the iris.</p> <p>Governments, universities and tech firms are all funding research to detect deepfakes. Last month, the first <a href=\"https://deepfakedetectionchallenge.ai/\" title=\"\">Deepfake Detection Challenge</a> kicked off, backed by Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon. It will include research teams around the globe competing for supremacy in the deepfake detection game.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/07/facebook-bans-deepfake-videos-in-run-up-to-us-election\" title=\"\">Facebook last week banned deepfake videos that are likely to mislead viewers</a> into thinking someone \u201csaid words that they did not actually say\u201d, in the run-up to the 2020 US election. However, the policy covers only misinformation produced using AI, meaning \u201cshallowfakes\u201d (see below) are still allowed on the platform.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"99f253713f3cb1a945ea6129625e3141132762eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99f253713f3cb1a945ea6129625e3141132762eb/0_0_3399_2040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman watches a deepfake video of Donald Trump and Barack Obama.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman watches a deepfake video of Donald Trump and Barack Obama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Lever/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Will deepfakes wreak havoc?</h2> <p>We can expect more deepfakes that harass, intimidate, demean, undermine and destabilise. But will deepfakes spark major international incidents? Here the situation is less clear. A deepfake of a world leader pressing the big red button should not cause armageddon. Nor will deepfake satellite images of troops massing on a border cause much trouble: most nations have their own reliable security imaging systems.</p> <p>There is still ample room for mischief-making, though. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/07/tesla-chief-elon-musk-smokes-marijuana-on-live-web-show\" title=\"\">Tesla stock</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/07/tesla-chief-elon-musk-smokes-marijuana-on-live-web-show\" title=\"\"> crashed</a> when Elon Musk smoked a joint on a live web show. In December, Donald Trump flew home early from a Nato meeting when genuine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/footage-appears-to-show-world-leaders-joking-about-trump-at-nato-summit\" title=\"\">footage emerged</a> of other world leaders apparently mocking him. Will plausible deepfakes shift stock prices, influence voters and provoke religious tension? It seems a safe bet.</p> <h2>Will they undermine trust?</h2> <p>The more insidious impact of deepfakes, along with other synthetic media and fake news, is to create a zero-trust society, where people cannot, or no longer bother to, distinguish truth from falsehood. And when trust is eroded, it is easier to raise doubts about specific events.</p> <p>Last year, Cameroon\u2019s minister of communication dismissed as fake news a video that Amnesty International believes shows Cameroonianthe country\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/09/digitally-dissecting-atrocities-amnesty-internationals-open-source-investigations/\" title=\"\">soldiers executing civilians</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=What%20does%20the%20law%20say%3F&amp;description=Deepfakes%20are%20not%20%3Cstrong%3Eillegal%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20per%20se%2C%20but%20producers%20and%20distributers%20can%20easily%20fall%20foul%20of%20the%20law.%20Depending%20on%20the%20content%2C%20a%20deepfake%20may%20infringe%20copyright%2C%20breach%20data%20protection%20law%2C%20and%20be%20defamatory%20if%20it%20exposes%20the%20victim%20to%20ridicule.%20There%20is%20also%20the%20specific%20criminal%20offence%20of%20sharing%20sexual%20and%20private%20images%20without%20consent%2C%20ie%20%3Cstrong%3Erevenge%20porn%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2C%20for%20which%20offenders%20can%20receive%20up%20to%20two%20years%20in%20jail.%20%0A%0AIn%20Britain%20the%20law%20is%20split%20on%20this.%20In%20Scotland%2C%20revenge%20porn%20law%20includes%20deepfakes%20by%20making%20it%20an%20offence%20to%20disclose%2C%20or%20threaten%20to%20disclose%2C%20a%20photo%20or%20film%20which%20shows%20or%20appears%20to%20show%20another%20person%20in%20an%20intimate%20situation.%20But%20in%20England%2C%20the%20statute%20carefully%20excludes%20images%20that%20have%20been%20created%20solely%20by%20altering%20an%20existing%20image.%0A%0A&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"law\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=What%20does%20the%20law%20say%3F&description=Deepfakes%20are%20not%20%3Cstrong%3Eillegal%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20per%20se%2C%20but%20producers%20and%20distributers%20can%20easily%20fall%20foul%20of%20the%20law.%20Depending%20on%20the%20content%2C%20a%20deepfake%20may%20infringe%20copyright%2C%20breach%20data%20protection%20law%2C%20and%20be%20defamatory%20if%20it%20exposes%20the%20victim%20to%20ridicule.%20There%20is%20also%20the%20specific%20criminal%20offence%20of%20sharing%20sexual%20and%20private%20images%20without%20consent%2C%20ie%20%3Cstrong%3Erevenge%20porn%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2C%20for%20which%20offenders%20can%20receive%20up%20to%20two%20years%20in%20jail.%20%0A%0AIn%20Britain%20the%20law%20is%20split%20on%20this.%20In%20Scotland%2C%20revenge%20porn%20law%20includes%20deepfakes%20by%20making%20it%20an%20offence%20to%20disclose%2C%20or%20threaten%20to%20disclose%2C%20a%20photo%20or%20film%20which%20shows%20or%20appears%20to%20show%20another%20person%20in%20an%20intimate%20situation.%20But%20in%20England%2C%20the%20statute%20carefully%20excludes%20images%20that%20have%20been%20created%20solely%20by%20altering%20an%20existing%20image.%0A%0A&link=false\">law</a> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump, who admitted to boasting about grabbing women\u2019s genitals in a recorded conversation, later suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/29/denying-accuracy-of-access-hollywood-tape-would-be-trumps-biggest-lie\" title=\"\">the tape </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/29/denying-accuracy-of-access-hollywood-tape-would-be-trumps-biggest-lie\" title=\"\">was not real</a>. In Prince Andrew\u2019s BBC interview with Emily Maitlis, the prince <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/06/jeffrey-epstein-virginia-roberts-giuffre-prince-andrew-photo\" title=\"\">cast doubt on the authenticity of a photo</a> taken with Virginia Giuffre, a shot her attorney insists is genuine and unaltered.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem may not be so much the faked reality as the fact that real reality becomes plausibly deniable,\u201d says Prof Lilian Edwards, a leading expert in internet law at Newcastle University.</p> <p>As the technology becomes more accessible, deepfakes could mean trouble for the courts, particularly in child custody battles and employment tribunals, where faked events could be entered as evidence. But they also pose a personal security risk: deepfakes can mimic biometric data, and can potentially trick systems that rely on face, voice, vein or gait recognition. The potential for scams is clear. Phone someone out of the blue and they are unlikely to transfer money to an unknown bank account. But what if your \u201cmother\u201d or \u201csister\u201d sets up a video call on WhatsApp and makes the same request?</p> <h2>What\u2019s the solution?</h2> <p>Ironically, AI may be the answer. Artificial intelligence already helps to spot fake videos, but many existing detection systems have a serious weakness: they work best for celebrities, because they can train on hours of freely available footage. Tech firms are now working on detection systems that aim to flag up fakes whenever they appear. Another strategy focuses on the provenance of the media. Digital watermarks are not foolproof, but a blockchain online ledger system could hold a tamper-proof record of videos, pictures and audio so their origins and any manipulations can always be checked.</p> <h2>Are deepfakes always malicious?</h2> <p>Not at all. Many are entertaining and some are helpful. Voice-cloning deepfakes can <a href=\"https://www.projectrevoice.org/\" title=\"\">restore people\u2019s voices</a> when they lose them to disease. Deepfake videos can enliven galleries and museums. In Florida, the Dal\u00ed museum has a deepfake of the surrealist painter who introduces his art and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=130&amp;v=BIDaxl4xqJ4&amp;feature=emb_logo\" title=\"\">takes selfies with visitors</a>. For the entertainment industry, technology can be used to improve the dubbing on foreign-language films, and more controversially, resurrect dead actors. For example, the late James Dean is due to star in Finding Jack, a Vietnam war movie.</p> <h2>What about shallowfakes?</h2> <p>Coined by Sam Gregory at the human rights organisation Witness, shallowfakes are videos that are either presented out of context or are doctored with simple editing tools. They are crude but undoubtedly impactful. A shallowfake video that slowed down Nancy Pelosi\u2019s speech and made the US Speaker of the House sound slurred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/24/facebook-leaves-fake-nancy-pelosi-video-on-site\" title=\"\">reached millions of people</a> on social media.</p> <p>In another incident, Jim Acosta, a CNN correspondent, was temporarily banned from White House press briefings during a heated exchange with the president. A shallowfake video released afterwards appeared to show him making contact with an intern who tried to take the microphone off him. It later emerged that the video had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/19/jim-acosta-white-house-press-pass-trump-administration-suspend-letter\" title=\"\">sped up at the crucial moment</a>, making the move look aggressive. Costa\u2019s press pass was later reinstated.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s Conservative party used similar shallowfake tactics. In the run-up to the recent election, the Conservatives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/05/tories-unrepentant-about-doctored-video-of-keir-starmer-tv-appearance\" title=\"\">doctored a TV interview</a> with the Labour MP Keir Starmer to make it seem that he was unable to answer a question about the party\u2019s Brexit stance. With deepfakes, the mischief-making is only likely to increase. As Henry Ajder, head of threat intelligence at Deeptrace, puts it: \u201cThe world is becoming increasingly more synthetic. This technology is not going away.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "What is a deepfake? Have you seen Barack Obama call Donald Trump a \u201ccomplete dipshit\u201d, or Mark Zuckerberg brag about having \u201ctotal control of billions of people\u2019s stolen data\u201d, or witnessed Jon Snow\u2019s moving apology for the dismal ending to Game of Thrones? Answer yes and you\u2019ve seen a deepfake. The 21st century\u2019s answer to Photoshopping, deepfakes use a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to make images of fake events, hence the name deepfake. Want to put new words in a politician\u2019s mouth, star in your favourite movie, or dance like a pro? Then it\u2019s time to make a deepfake. What are they for? Many are pornographic. The AI firm Deeptrace found 15,000 deepfake videos online in September 2019, a near doubling over nine months. A staggering 96% were pornographic and 99% of those mapped faces from female celebrities on to porn stars. As new techniques allow unskilled people to make deepfakes with a handful of photos, fake videos are likely to spread beyond the celebrity world to fuel revenge porn. As Danielle Citron, a professor of law at Boston University, puts it: \u201cDeepfake technology is being weaponised against women.\u201d Beyond the porn there\u2019s plenty of spoof, satire and mischief. Is it just about videos? No. Deepfake technology can create convincing but entirely fictional photos from scratch. A non-existent Bloomberg journalist, \u201cMaisy Kinsley\u201d, who had a profile on LinkedIn and Twitter, was probably a deepfake. Another LinkedIn fake, \u201cKatie Jones\u201d, claimed to work at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, but is thought to be a deepfake created for a foreign spying operation. Audio can be deepfaked too, to create \u201cvoice skins\u201d or \u201dvoice clones\u201d of public figures. Last March, the chief of a UK subsidiary of a German energy firm paid nearly \u00a3200,000 into a Hungarian bank account after being phoned by a fraudster who mimicked the German CEO\u2019s voice. The company\u2019s insurers believe the voice was a deepfake, but the evidence is unclear. Similar scams have reportedly used recorded WhatsApp voice messages. How are they made? University researchers and special effects studios have long pushed the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with video and image manipulation. But deepfakes themselves were born in 2017 when a Reddit user of the same name posted doctored porn clips on the site. The videos swapped the faces of celebrities \u2013 Gal Gadot, Taylor Swift, Scarlett Johansson and others \u2013 on to porn performers. It takes a few steps to make a face-swap video. First, you run thousands of face shots of the two people through an AI algorithm called an encoder. The encoder finds and learns similarities between the two faces, and reduces them to their shared common features, compressing the images in the process. A second AI algorithm called a decoder is then taught to recover the faces from the compressed images. Because the faces are different, you train one decoder to recover the first person\u2019s face, and another decoder to recover the second person\u2019s face. To perform the face swap, you simply feed encoded images into the \u201cwrong\u201d decoder. For example, a compressed image of person A\u2019s face is fed into the decoder trained on person B. The decoder then reconstructs the face of person B with the expressions and orientation of face A. For a convincing video, this has to be done on every frame. Another way to make deepfakes uses what\u2019s called a generative adversarial network, or Gan. A Gan pits two artificial intelligence algorithms against each other. The first algorithm, known as the generator, is fed random noise and turns it into an image. This synthetic image is then added to a stream of real images \u2013 of celebrities, say \u2013 that are fed into the second algorithm, known as the discriminator. At first, the synthetic images will look nothing like faces. But repeat the process countless times, with feedback on performance, and the discriminator and generator both improve. Given enough cycles and feedback, the generator will start producing utterly realistic faces of completely nonexistent celebrities. Who is making deepfakes? Everyone from academic and industrial researchers to amateur enthusiasts, visual effects studios and porn producers. Governments might be dabbling in the technology, too, as part of their online strategies to discredit and disrupt extremist groups, or make contact with targeted individuals, for example. What technology do you need? It is hard to make a good deepfake on a standard computer. Most are created on high-end desktops with powerful graphics cards or better still with computing power in the cloud. This reduces the processing time from days and weeks to hours. But it takes expertise, too, not least to touch up completed videos to reduce flicker and other visual defects. That said, plenty of tools are now available to help people make deepfakes. Several companies will make them for you and do all the processing in the cloud. There\u2019s even a mobile phone app, Zao, that lets users add their faces to a list of TV and movie characters on which the system has trained. How do you spot a deepfake? It gets harder as the technology improves. In 2018, US researchers discovered that deepfake faces don\u2019t blink normally. No surprise there: the majority of images show people with their eyes open, so the algorithms never really learn about blinking. At first, it seemed like a silver bullet for the detection problem. But no sooner had the research been published, than deepfakes appeared with blinking. Such is the nature of the game: as soon as a weakness is revealed, it is fixed. Poor-quality deepfakes are easier to spot. The lip synching might be bad, or the skin tone patchy. There can be flickering around the edges of transposed faces. And fine details, such as hair, are particularly hard for deepfakes to render well, especially where strands are visible on the fringe. Badly rendered jewellery and teeth can also be a giveaway, as can strange lighting effects, such as inconsistent illumination and reflections on the iris. Governments, universities and tech firms are all funding research to detect deepfakes. Last month, the first Deepfake Detection Challenge kicked off, backed by Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon. It will include research teams around the globe competing for supremacy in the deepfake detection game. Facebook last week banned deepfake videos that are likely to mislead viewers into thinking someone \u201csaid words that they did not actually say\u201d, in the run-up to the 2020 US election. However, the policy covers only misinformation produced using AI, meaning \u201cshallowfakes\u201d (see below) are still allowed on the platform. Will deepfakes wreak havoc? We can expect more deepfakes that harass, intimidate, demean, undermine and destabilise. But will deepfakes spark major international incidents? Here the situation is less clear. A deepfake of a world leader pressing the big red button should not cause armageddon. Nor will deepfake satellite images of troops massing on a border cause much trouble: most nations have their own reliable security imaging systems. There is still ample room for mischief-making, though. Last year, Tesla stock crashed when Elon Musk smoked a joint on a live web show. In December, Donald Trump flew home early from a Nato meeting when genuine footage emerged of other world leaders apparently mocking him. Will plausible deepfakes shift stock prices, influence voters and provoke religious tension? It seems a safe bet. Will they undermine trust? The more insidious impact of deepfakes, along with other synthetic media and fake news, is to create a zero-trust society, where people cannot, or no longer bother to, distinguish truth from falsehood. And when trust is eroded, it is easier to raise doubts about specific events. Last year, Cameroon\u2019s minister of communication dismissed as fake news a video that Amnesty International believes shows Cameroonianthe country\u2019s soldiers executing civilians. Donald Trump, who admitted to boasting about grabbing women\u2019s genitals in a recorded conversation, later suggested the tape was not real. In Prince Andrew\u2019s BBC interview with Emily Maitlis, the prince cast doubt on the authenticity of a photo taken with Virginia Giuffre, a shot her attorney insists is genuine and unaltered. \u201cThe problem may not be so much the faked reality as the fact that real reality becomes plausibly deniable,\u201d says Prof Lilian Edwards, a leading expert in internet law at Newcastle University. As the technology becomes more accessible, deepfakes could mean trouble for the courts, particularly in child custody battles and employment tribunals, where faked events could be entered as evidence. But they also pose a personal security risk: deepfakes can mimic biometric data, and can potentially trick systems that rely on face, voice, vein or gait recognition. The potential for scams is clear. Phone someone out of the blue and they are unlikely to transfer money to an unknown bank account. But what if your \u201cmother\u201d or \u201csister\u201d sets up a video call on WhatsApp and makes the same request? What\u2019s the solution? Ironically, AI may be the answer. Artificial intelligence already helps to spot fake videos, but many existing detection systems have a serious weakness: they work best for celebrities, because they can train on hours of freely available footage. Tech firms are now working on detection systems that aim to flag up fakes whenever they appear. Another strategy focuses on the provenance of the media. Digital watermarks are not foolproof, but a blockchain online ledger system could hold a tamper-proof record of videos, pictures and audio so their origins and any manipulations can always be checked. Are deepfakes always malicious? Not at all. Many are entertaining and some are helpful. Voice-cloning deepfakes can restore people\u2019s voices when they lose them to disease. Deepfake videos can enliven galleries and museums. In Florida, the Dal\u00ed museum has a deepfake of the surrealist painter who introduces his art and takes selfies with visitors. For the entertainment industry, technology can be used to improve the dubbing on foreign-language films, and more controversially, resurrect dead actors. For example, the late James Dean is due to star in Finding Jack, a Vietnam war movie. What about shallowfakes? Coined by Sam Gregory at the human rights organisation Witness, shallowfakes are videos that are either presented out of context or are doctored with simple editing tools. They are crude but undoubtedly impactful. A shallowfake video that slowed down Nancy Pelosi\u2019s speech and made the US Speaker of the House sound slurred reached millions of people on social media. In another incident, Jim Acosta, a CNN correspondent, was temporarily banned from White House press briefings during a heated exchange with the president. A shallowfake video released afterwards appeared to show him making contact with an intern who tried to take the microphone off him. It later emerged that the video had been sped up at the crucial moment, making the move look aggressive. Costa\u2019s press pass was later reinstated. The UK\u2019s Conservative party used similar shallowfake tactics. In the run-up to the recent election, the Conservatives doctored a TV interview with the Labour MP Keir Starmer to make it seem that he was unable to answer a question about the party\u2019s Brexit stance. With deepfakes, the mischief-making is only likely to increase. As Henry Ajder, head of threat intelligence at Deeptrace, puts it: \u201cThe world is becoming increasingly more synthetic. This technology is not going away.\u201d",

Mike German, a former FBI agent who is now a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice, wrote in an email that the DHS framing was \u201chighly misleading because white supremacists are responsible for the bulk of this violence and almost all of the fatalities that result\u201d. \u201cThere is little evidence,\u201d he added, \u201cthat environmentalists have engaged in the types of deadly violence that would meet the statutory definition of domestic terrorism, as codified by Congress\u201d. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Sam Jessup, one of the activists named in the document, said the bulletin shed light on the role law enforcement and intelligence agencies have played in suppressing dissent. \u201cEquating mass murder by white supremacists with what Michael and I did is totally obscene,\u201d Jessup said in an email. \u201cThis whole infrastructure of so-called security has done little more than secure the future of the fossil fuel industry by terrorizing people into silence.\u201d Jessup, 34, served as a driver and videographer, live-streaming the action in North Dakota. Michael Foster, a former family therapist who lives in Seattle, turned the valve. Foster said even though the action involved a high level of legal risk, it was a small price to pay in light of the cascading impacts of climate change. \u201cThe only way to force society to change fast enough is to refuse to participate and fill the jails,\u201d Foster said. Both he and Jessup were convicted on felony conspiracy charges and Foster spent six months in jail. During closing arguments the prosecutor compared Foster to the Unabomber and the 9/11 hijackers. He is now on probation and barred from engaging in direct action protest for another two years. In the more than three years since the action , several states have passed legislation making it a crime to trespass on property containing critical infrastructure.The Trump administration has advocated for stiffer penalties against activists who engage in non-violent direct action targeting fossil fuel infrastructure. Carl Williams, executive director of the Water Protector Legal Collective, which has defended a number of DAPL protesters, says the push to criminalize dissent is part of a larger rightwing strategy that has also targeted the BDS movement and Black Lives Matter. \u201cI think there is a strategy that rightwing forces are using to criminalize dissent,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis bulletin shows that dirty hand.\u201d But Williams also says it shows that these same movements are making inroads. \u201cLiberation movements know that this is happening and we\u2019re fighting against it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing this because they\u2019re afraid of the power of these movements.\u201d Adam Federman is a reporting fellow with Type Investigations.",

But even Shaffer, the Republican party chair in Howard county, is not sure he\u2019ll be voting for Trump again.</p> \n<p>The voters who migrated from Barack Obama to Trump in the county on Iowa\u2019s border with Minnesota were among nearly 8 million across the US who switched parties four years ago. In swing states such as Iowa they were decisive in delivering the White House to the Republicans.</p> \n<p>Shaffer is confident that Trump can win their support again. He argues that what the president\u2019s opponents see as his negatives \u2013 his litany of false claims, Twitter battles and impeachment \u2013 will only strengthen a presidential campaign again built around the image of the outsider fighting the system.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s still a Don Quixote. People like that. They like a fighter,\u201d said Shaffer.</p> \n<p>But the Republican county chair, a former farmer who works in river conservation, is not without doubts. He calls himself a 60/40 Republican because he likes most of what he sees about Trump.

So while he is already mapping out the president\u2019s campaign in Howard county, he has also been checking out the Democratic presidential contenders.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve toyed with this whole idea of Pete Buttigieg just because I love his positive message. That was what was so endearing about Ronald Reagan. It was always that shining city on the hill. Morning in America.

In Wisconsin, Trump overturned a 213,000-vote margin for Obama in 2012 to win by less than 23,000 or 0.77% of the ballot. In Michigan, the president pulled off the narrowest margin of victory in the history of presidential elections in the state with a win by just 10,704 votes.</p> \n<p>This week, and at various stages in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, the Guardian is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-voters-who-swung-to-trump\">returning to three counties</a> in Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan that flipped from Obama to Trump to ask which way they will go in November. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f7634534-6e3b-4eea-9d4e-3792602f58e9\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>The voters who swung to Trump&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>Voters swung from Barack Obama to Donald Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa in 2016\u2019s presidential election \u2013 helping propel him to a narrow victory.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p><b>Chris McGreal </b>will report from three key swing voter counties in these states as the 2020 election campaign unfolds, regularly travelling around them, talking to voters, workers, business owners, party activists and strategists.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>Will these voters stay with Trump in 2020?

But she is not convinced that the party\u2019s national leadership has learned the lessons she flagged up in her resignation blog. \u201cI don\u2019t know that they\u2019ve come very far on it,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Hubka, though, has changed. Sanders\u2019 loss in 2016 was a salutary lesson. She was drawn in by his plans for publicly funded healthcare for all and his long history of campaigning against income inequality. Hubka thought the energy of Sanders\u2019 organisation and support would sweep him to the nomination.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"04ff111a9f9502de8f6d45afe2fe6caab4992e75\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04ff111a9f9502de8f6d45afe2fe6caab4992e75/0_0_4600_3067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Hubka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Hubka.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Gale/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAnd then when we butted up against reality. I could see where America was and OK, we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>This time around, Hubka is backing Buttigieg because she said he is less strident on issues such as healthcare reform, with his plan for a public insurance option alongside private plans. She also thinks Buttigieg is more appealing and less vulnerable to attack on his record than Joe Biden.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/iowa/\">The latest poll</a>has Buttigieg in a three-way tie with Sanders and the former vice-president in next month\u2019s Iowa caucus although the Indiana mayor trails behind his closest rivals in national polls.</p> \n<p>Hubka also reckons that if the message of the 2016 election was that voters wanted to shake up the system, after four years of Trump they are looking for something different. \u201cI feel from people that they want calm. They\u2019re tired. Trump says crazy shit,\u201d she said.</p> \n<h2>The battle</h2> \n<p>Shaffer agrees that many voters are looking for less confrontational leadership and acknowledges that Trump is not the man to calm things down.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be the battle. Trump thinks the system\u2019s a problem whereas Buttigieg or Biden are going to say the system can fix the problems. It\u2019s a whole different way of looking at how to solve problems,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Which has left Shaffer torn because both appeal to him in their way. He, like many Americans, wants to see politicians work together but he also wants significant changes to the system.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think my libertarian leanings allow me to be more open-minded to both sides of the political spectrum. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have had a hard time voting for Bill Clinton. Pete Buttigieg, he\u2019s got some cultural issues. Obviously, his gayness is an issue. But we elected our first black man as president and we came pretty darn close to having our first woman as president. So I don\u2019t see that as that big of an issue today as it was 20 years ago.\u201d</p> \n<p>One problem Shaffer won\u2019t have to face this year is the indifference of a Trump campaign that never really seemed to believe it could win four years ago. In 2016, the GOP county chair struggled to get hold even of basic campaign material to meet an unexpected demand for Vote Trump yard signs that were an early indication he was going to do better than predicted.</p> \n<p>\u201cI had to go to a local sign store and have them design a sign and pay for it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7e1ee05f5d01173d2307dc133195c1ad3dee444e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e1ee05f5d01173d2307dc133195c1ad3dee444e/0_0_4600_3067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Cresco, Iowa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downtown Cresco, Iowa.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Gale/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This year, the national Republican party has already sent a campaign instruction manual. Shaffer and the county GOP leadership held their first meeting on re-election strategy in December.</p> \n<p> \u201cI think our ground game has been pretty well thought out. It\u2019s very hi-tech. There\u2019s a lot of apps and types things for door knocking and stuff.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shaffer finds that, the economy aside, Trump\u2019s primary appeal is in ways that can seem un-Republican. The president\u2019s battles with the military hierarchy and the FBI may not go down well with the GOP leadership but Shaffer reckons Trump\u2019s willingness to call it as he sees it has bolstered his credibility with ordinary voters.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe exposed the Bushes for being warlike and saying that Iraq was a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people in the back of their minds thought that. But for patriotism, you didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p> \n<p>That goes down well in a region of the country that has sent disproportionately high number of soldiers to fight and die in conflicts that large numbers of Americans came to see as misguided at best.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhy are we going over there fighting wars for oil?.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s order to kill Suleimani earlier this month may yet test the belief that this is a president reluctant to get the US into new conflicts. But his earlier hesitancy to use force, such as the cancellation of a missile attack on Iran in June that would have cost dozens of lives, buys him the benefit of the doubt for now at least with voters who do not see a president as a warmonger.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4ece0e25cb3f307296de629cbcf492369569b42\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4ece0e25cb3f307296de629cbcf492369569b42/0_0_4600_3067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local maintenance on power lines in front of Neil Shaffer\u2019s property in Cresco, Iowa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local maintenance on power lines in front of Neil Shaffer\u2019s property in Cresco, Iowa.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Gale/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Immigration</h2> \n<p>Shaffer, though, is disturbed by Trump\u2019s language about immigrants and the enthusiasm in his county for building a wall on the Mexican border even though he said some of the industrial dairy and pig farms in the area are heavily reliant on foreign workers.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of those are undocumented workers. It\u2019s one of those things that we all know. No one says anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are here working. They\u2019re doing a tremendous service for our economy. I think Trump has politicised the dangers of it, exploited some tragedies, family tragedies for political gain. Just the like the other side does.

Then she backed Obama twice.</p> \n<p>In 2016, she toyed with voting for Trump because she liked his promise to shake up the system and his business-oriented policies.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen Trump first came on the scene, I\u2019m like, hell, yeah,\u201d said Gosch who moved to the county capital, Cresco, five years ago for her husband to work in his family\u2019s plumbing business. \u201cThen he started talking about the wall and calling all Mexican people criminals. And I\u2019m just like, wait a minute, I\u2019m brown.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f85f49a57bfe042916136a42a1541d20b3b7779\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f85f49a57bfe042916136a42a1541d20b3b7779/0_0_4600_3067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kelli Gosch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kelli Gosch.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Gale/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Gosch, who is mixed African American and Aborigine, is struck by \u201chow emboldened people are because the president is emboldening\u201d of racism. Her children are biracial and she describes them as looking more Latino than black. After other pupils saw Gosch at the school gates in Cresco, a 97% white city, they started racially abusing her daughter who is now 14.</p> \n<p>\u201cEver since we moved here \u2013 she was in third grade, she\u2019s now in eighth \u2013 she has been called a \u2018nigger\u2019 several times a year in school,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Gosch said that the first time her daughter heard the word she did not know what it meant. \u201cThen I\u2019m having to have the uncomfortable conversation with my child about the history of slavery when she\u2019s got a white father in the house.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gosch said the school acted swiftly each time but it did not stop the abuse. So she took to social media. \u201cI made it public, calling on the parents to respond to me. And it was amazing. I did not get one bad feedback and I was connecting with people that I didn\u2019t even know,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>But while she appreciated that parents came forward to express their support, she said they denied their own children were responsible for abuses and were dismissive of her view that Trump was creating a climate that legitimised racism.</p> \n<p>\u201cI feel like especially in this rural white town, people need to be uncomfortable and they need to talk about things. What I try to convey to people is we\u2019re already in dangerous territory with Trump being in office,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cRacism has always been there. Bigotry has always been there. People being idiots has always been there. But it was so hush-hush. Even the Ku Klux Klan, they wear masks. But now, when you have the leader of the free world, the most important position in the universe, and he says things that he\u2019s saying, it gives validity to people who are idiots.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is Neil Shaffer\u2019s job to get Donald Trump re-elected in a patch of rural Iowa that saw the largest swing in voters in the country from America\u2019s first black president to one of its most divisive in 2016. But even Shaffer, the Republican party chair in Howard county, is not sure he\u2019ll be voting for Trump again. The voters who migrated from Barack Obama to Trump in the county on Iowa\u2019s border with Minnesota were among nearly 8 million across the US who switched parties four years ago. In swing states such as Iowa they were decisive in delivering the White House to the Republicans. Shaffer is confident that Trump can win their support again. He argues that what the president\u2019s opponents see as his negatives \u2013 his litany of false claims, Twitter battles and impeachment \u2013 will only strengthen a presidential campaign again built around the image of the outsider fighting the system. \u201cHe\u2019s still a Don Quixote. People like that. They like a fighter,\u201d said Shaffer. But the Republican county chair, a former farmer who works in river conservation, is not without doubts. He calls himself a 60/40 Republican because he likes most of what he sees about Trump. Shaffer thinks the president has been good for the economy and is pleased with his conservative picks for the supreme court. Shaffer also rates Trump for not getting the country into any big wars, unlike the last Republican in the White House \u2013 at least for now, as the world awaits the fallout of the US assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. But Shaffer struggles with Trump\u2019s divisiveness, deeply dislikes his hostility to immigrants and wishes he would get off Twitter. So while he is already mapping out the president\u2019s campaign in Howard county, he has also been checking out the Democratic presidential contenders. \u201cI\u2019ve toyed with this whole idea of Pete Buttigieg just because I love his positive message. That was what was so endearing about Ronald Reagan. It was always that shining city on the hill. Morning in America. Tomorrow\u2019s a new day, and it\u2019s always gonna be better,\u201d he said of one of the Democratic frontrunners in Iowa. \u201cI went and saw Pete Buttigieg in Decorah. Sounded very moderate, very positive. Hardly even mentioned Trump, which I like. I like to listen to the plans not just the negativity.\u201d A 40% swing vote from Obama to Trump Howard county led a slew of counties across the midwest that flipped from Obama to Trump by significant margins four years ago and snatched the White House from Hillary Clinton even though she won the popular vote. The swing of more than 40% to Trump in Howard county, alongside the surge in support for him in other parts of north-eastern Iowa, helped deliver the state to the president by the biggest Republican margin since Reagan\u2019s first victory in 1980. In other midwestern states, big swings were instrumental in squeezing out narrow victories. In Wisconsin, Trump overturned a 213,000-vote margin for Obama in 2012 to win by less than 23,000 or 0.77% of the ballot. In Michigan, the president pulled off the narrowest margin of victory in the history of presidential elections in the state with a win by just 10,704 votes. This week, and at various stages in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, the Guardian is returning to three counties in Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan that flipped from Obama to Trump to ask which way they will go in November. Trump knows he can count on his core supporters, the ones frequently seen on television screens in Maga hats during his rallies. They will excuse him of almost anything. But victory in counties like Howard \u2013 struggling midwestern farm territory with about 9,000 residents and 98% white \u2013 depends on a different set of voters. Among them are women like spa owner Holly Rasmussen, who backed Obama twice and then flipped to Trump because she wanted to \u201cshake things up\u201d. Rasmussen is typical of a kind of voter found across swing counties who have plenty of doubts about the president but give him credit for one big thing \u2013 the economy \u2013 and have yet to be presented with a reason not to vote for him again even as Trump\u2019s critics attack him as a white nationalist, climate crisis denier and over dealings with Ukraine that have drawn accusations of treason. Rasmussen backed Trump in 2016 because she was \u201ccompletely sick\u201d of what she regarded as government overregulation of her cosmetology school, which she closed in frustration, opening a spa and salon in its place. Mostly she thinks Trump has done what he said he would. Rasmussen mentions a commonly heard observation in Howard county that there are more jobs than workers even though one in 10 of the population lives under the poverty line. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a job you\u2019re not looking,\u201d she said. \u201cThe factories have trouble finding workers \u2026 That is one thing I think is a lot better and I think that is one thing President Trump did do right.\u201d Confidence in the economy has risen sharply during Trump\u2019s three years in office and the president gets a good deal of credit for that even if Democrats say the ground was laid by Obama or question the quality of those jobs. That\u2019s a big plus for him in parts of America where steady work at decent pay can still be found even if few people feel prosperous. For that they are prepared to forgive Trump other sins. Rasmussen largely ignored the impeachment hearings until she caught a news report on a morning television show and began to pay attention. But she thinks the process is politically motivated and so far it has not shifted her support for the president. But Rasmussen, like a majority of Republicans, is concerned about some of Trump\u2019s public statements and perpetual tweeting. \u201cThe thing that drives me crazy is he just needs to climb down. I\u2019m not a Twitter fan,\u201d she said. \u201cHe seems so angry.\u201d Still, when Trump claims he is being unfairly treated there\u2019s a twinge of recognition among those voters who see an east coast liberal establishment that has painted them as white supremacists and fellow travellers for voting for him. For those who supported Obama and then jumped to Trump, accusations of racism don\u2019t add up and are mostly interpreted as a smear intended to discount concerns whether it\u2019s about the deepening struggle of the middle class to stay afloat financially or communities that feel increasingly alienated and left behind. Rasmussen said she isn\u2019t locked into voting for Trump again but so far hasn\u2019t been persuaded not to, although like many others she is waiting to see who the Democratic candidate is. \u201cI\u2019m very open-minded, and I was last time,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a huge downswing in support for Trump in the people I talk to. They\u2019ll say the same thing. Zip it a little bit. Bring it in. Calm down. But I don\u2019t see them saying I\u2019m not going to vote for him because he won\u2019t do that.\u201d Democrats challenge Some Democrats are tempted to turn away from the midwest, retreating from fighting to win a region that is whiter and older than many other parts of the country in favour of focusing on young and minority voters to deliver victory in emerging battlegrounds such as the south. But states such as Michigan and Wisconsin remain within reach for the Democrats and are crucial in putting together the electoral college votes to win the White House. In Iowa, the challenge for Democrats is to flip back voters like Rasmussen, or find new ones to offset her support for Trump, and again win a state Obama took with two thumping victories. In Howard county that falls to Laura Hubka, a US navy veteran who chairs the local Democratic party and who, like Shaffer, has also shifted her thinking over the past four years. Hubka was an enthusiastic Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016. After Clinton lost the election, she quit the party in disillusionment and wrote a furious denunciation of the Democrats under the headline \u201cWe are not the ones we were waiting for\u201d. \u201cWe say \u2018the truth is on our side,\u2019 but what if we are part of the lie?\u201d wrote Hubka who was a member of the Iowa Democratic state central committee and chair of the party in Howard county. Hubka said in the blog that the party\u2019s 2016 campaign was out of touch with the \u201c99% of American people who are struggling to work, live, eat and find some sort of American dream\u201d because the Democrats stopped talking to ordinary people and took their votes for granted. In March 2018, Hubka returned to the Democrats and again became the party chair in Howard county. But she is not convinced that the party\u2019s national leadership has learned the lessons she flagged up in her resignation blog. \u201cI don\u2019t know that they\u2019ve come very far on it,\u201d she said. Hubka, though, has changed. Sanders\u2019 loss in 2016 was a salutary lesson. She was drawn in by his plans for publicly funded healthcare for all and his long history of campaigning against income inequality. Hubka thought the energy of Sanders\u2019 organisation and support would sweep him to the nomination. \u201cAnd then when we butted up against reality. I could see where America was and OK, we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d she said. This time around, Hubka is backing Buttigieg because she said he is less strident on issues such as healthcare reform, with his plan for a public insurance option alongside private plans. She also thinks Buttigieg is more appealing and less vulnerable to attack on his record than Joe Biden. The latest pollhas Buttigieg in a three-way tie with Sanders and the former vice-president in next month\u2019s Iowa caucus although the Indiana mayor trails behind his closest rivals in national polls. Hubka also reckons that if the message of the 2016 election was that voters wanted to shake up the system, after four years of Trump they are looking for something different. \u201cI feel from people that they want calm. They\u2019re tired. Trump says crazy shit,\u201d she said. The battle Shaffer agrees that many voters are looking for less confrontational leadership and acknowledges that Trump is not the man to calm things down. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the battle. Trump thinks the system\u2019s a problem whereas Buttigieg or Biden are going to say the system can fix the problems. It\u2019s a whole different way of looking at how to solve problems,\u201d he said. Which has left Shaffer torn because both appeal to him in their way. He, like many Americans, wants to see politicians work together but he also wants significant changes to the system. \u201cI think my libertarian leanings allow me to be more open-minded to both sides of the political spectrum. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have had a hard time voting for Bill Clinton. Pete Buttigieg, he\u2019s got some cultural issues. Obviously, his gayness is an issue. But we elected our first black man as president and we came pretty darn close to having our first woman as president. So I don\u2019t see that as that big of an issue today as it was 20 years ago.\u201d One problem Shaffer won\u2019t have to face this year is the indifference of a Trump campaign that never really seemed to believe it could win four years ago. In 2016, the GOP county chair struggled to get hold even of basic campaign material to meet an unexpected demand for Vote Trump yard signs that were an early indication he was going to do better than predicted. \u201cI had to go to a local sign store and have them design a sign and pay for it,\u201d he said. This year, the national Republican party has already sent a campaign instruction manual. Shaffer and the county GOP leadership held their first meeting on re-election strategy in December. \u201cI think our ground game has been pretty well thought out. It\u2019s very hi-tech. There\u2019s a lot of apps and types things for door knocking and stuff.\u201d Shaffer finds that, the economy aside, Trump\u2019s primary appeal is in ways that can seem un-Republican. The president\u2019s battles with the military hierarchy and the FBI may not go down well with the GOP leadership but Shaffer reckons Trump\u2019s willingness to call it as he sees it has bolstered his credibility with ordinary voters. \u201cHe exposed the Bushes for being warlike and saying that Iraq was a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people in the back of their minds thought that. But for patriotism, you didn\u2019t say that.\u201d That goes down well in a region of the country that has sent disproportionately high number of soldiers to fight and die in conflicts that large numbers of Americans came to see as misguided at best. \u201cWhy are we going over there fighting wars for oil?.\u201d Trump\u2019s order to kill Suleimani earlier this month may yet test the belief that this is a president reluctant to get the US into new conflicts. But his earlier hesitancy to use force, such as the cancellation of a missile attack on Iran in June that would have cost dozens of lives, buys him the benefit of the doubt for now at least with voters who do not see a president as a warmonger. Immigration Shaffer, though, is disturbed by Trump\u2019s language about immigrants and the enthusiasm in his county for building a wall on the Mexican border even though he said some of the industrial dairy and pig farms in the area are heavily reliant on foreign workers. \u201cA lot of those are undocumented workers. It\u2019s one of those things that we all know. No one says anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are here working. They\u2019re doing a tremendous service for our economy. I think Trump has politicised the dangers of it, exploited some tragedies, family tragedies for political gain. Just the like the other side does. It\u2019s sad.\u201d Trump\u2019s language on immigrants and immigration is central to Kelli Gosch\u2019s view of the president. In 2004, with a husband serving on the frontline in Afghanistan, she voted for George W Bush. Then she backed Obama twice. In 2016, she toyed with voting for Trump because she liked his promise to shake up the system and his business-oriented policies. \u201cWhen Trump first came on the scene, I\u2019m like, hell, yeah,\u201d said Gosch who moved to the county capital, Cresco, five years ago for her husband to work in his family\u2019s plumbing business. \u201cThen he started talking about the wall and calling all Mexican people criminals. And I\u2019m just like, wait a minute, I\u2019m brown.\u201d Gosch, who is mixed African American and Aborigine, is struck by \u201chow emboldened people are because the president is emboldening\u201d of racism. Her children are biracial and she describes them as looking more Latino than black. After other pupils saw Gosch at the school gates in Cresco, a 97% white city, they started racially abusing her daughter who is now 14. \u201cEver since we moved here \u2013 she was in third grade, she\u2019s now in eighth \u2013 she has been called a \u2018nigger\u2019 several times a year in school,\u201d she said. Gosch said that the first time her daughter heard the word she did not know what it meant. \u201cThen I\u2019m having to have the uncomfortable conversation with my child about the history of slavery when she\u2019s got a white father in the house.\u201d Gosch said the school acted swiftly each time but it did not stop the abuse. So she took to social media. \u201cI made it public, calling on the parents to respond to me. And it was amazing. I did not get one bad feedback and I was connecting with people that I didn\u2019t even know,\u201d she said. But while she appreciated that parents came forward to express their support, she said they denied their own children were responsible for abuses and were dismissive of her view that Trump was creating a climate that legitimised racism. \u201cI feel like especially in this rural white town, people need to be uncomfortable and they need to talk about things. What I try to convey to people is we\u2019re already in dangerous territory with Trump being in office,\u201d she said. \u201cRacism has always been there. Bigotry has always been there. People being idiots has always been there. But it was so hush-hush. Even the Ku Klux Klan, they wear masks. But now, when you have the leader of the free world, the most important position in the universe, and he says things that he\u2019s saying, it gives validity to people who are idiots.\u201d",

There is a temptation to retreat into comfortable harrumphing: \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that I\u2019m not the one who is not listening. Trump/Johnson/Corbyn/Thunberg [insert name of your bete noire here] is the one who is not listening. They need this book, not me.\u201d It\u2019s clear to most right-thinking people, however, regardless of their sympathies, that we live in an age where many struggle to listen. And yet, more than ever, we expect to be heard. There\u2019s a mismatch there. And something\u2019s got to give.</p> <p>Murphy approaches this topic as an old-school journalist with a prolific interviewing record for the <em>New York Times</em>. She prides herself on being such a good listener that she is able to help her subjects reach insights they might not otherwise have uncovered. The ability to listen actively and attentively is something that has become a rare commodity, she argues. \u201cWhen I interview people \u2013 whether it\u2019s a person on the street, CEO or celebrity \u2013 I often get the sense that they are unaccustomed to having someone listen to them.\u201d</p> <p>It has always been true that in any conversation we can have a tendency to formulate our next great and profound utterance instead of listening to the person talking to us. But in recent times, this bad habit has been compounded, both because of the speed, immediacy and individualism of social media and because of the apparent threat that divisions seem to evoke. Murphy argues persuasively that we shut off \u2013 needlessly \u2013 as soon as we feel attacked or when we feel the other person\u2019s point of view runs counter to ours. In fact, this is the very moment when we should breathe deeply, realise that we are not under physical attack and listen intently.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We benefit from \u201cbeing fascinated by \u2013 rather than fearful of \u2013 the unpredictability of others\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Deep listening encourages us to ask: \u201cWhy does that person think that? Do they know something we don\u2019t? What can we learn from them about how they see the world?\u201d The consequences are deep. If someone feels listened to, they are more likely to listen back. And we are likely to understand something better even if we will never share their point of view. \u201cNegative capability\u201d is a sign of highly evolved listener: this is the ability to cope with grey areas, contradictory ideas, doubt and uncertainty without getting angry. This technique is extremely useful, especially in the context of contemporary \u201cdebate\u201d (very often people shouting and not listening). It\u2019s the opposite of Donald Trump\u2019s assertion: \u201cMy primary consultant is myself.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of what Murphy is writing about here seems incredibly simple, but many observations struck me as inspiringly profound. The idea that \u201cpeople get lonely for lack of listening\u201d. The fact that, as any good interviewer knows, everyone has something interesting to say if you ask the right questions. The proposition that the better we know someone, the less we listen to them properly (or, really, at all) because we don\u2019t expect them to surprise us.</p> <p>Murphy\u2019s argument that we should initiate face-to-face conversations with strangers is particularly inspiring. We benefit from \u201cbeing fascinated by \u2013 rather than fearful of \u2013 the unpredictability of others\u201d. She makes a strong case for the idea that the moments in which we feel most alive are the moments of unexpected connection and of a break in routine. Listening can easily provide us with these boosts for free and with little effort. Also, give yourself a pat on the back if you ever find yourself pausing and saying in response (honestly): \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u201d or: \u201cI\u2019d like to think about that.\u201d Congratulations: you were actually really listening for once.</p> <p>This is smart and playful Malcolm Gladwell-style analysis that reads as both challenging and oddly reassuring. It feels like a reiteration of something essential you once knew but that somehow you had forgotten about. Kate Murphy is here to remind us \u2013 entertainingly and compellingly \u2013 exactly why it matters so much, especially right now.

Deep listening encourages us to ask: \u201cWhy does that person think that? Do they know something we don\u2019t? What can we learn from them about how they see the world?\u201d The consequences are deep. If someone feels listened to, they are more likely to listen back. And we are likely to understand something better even if we will never share their point of view. \u201cNegative capability\u201d is a sign of highly evolved listener: this is the ability to cope with grey areas, contradictory ideas, doubt and uncertainty without getting angry. This technique is extremely useful, especially in the context of contemporary \u201cdebate\u201d (very often people shouting and not listening). It\u2019s the opposite of Donald Trump\u2019s assertion: \u201cMy primary consultant is myself.\u201d A lot of what Murphy is writing about here seems incredibly simple, but many observations struck me as inspiringly profound. The idea that \u201cpeople get lonely for lack of listening\u201d. The fact that, as any good interviewer knows, everyone has something interesting to say if you ask the right questions. The proposition that the better we know someone, the less we listen to them properly (or, really, at all) because we don\u2019t expect them to surprise us. Murphy\u2019s argument that we should initiate face-to-face conversations with strangers is particularly inspiring. We benefit from \u201cbeing fascinated by \u2013 rather than fearful of \u2013 the unpredictability of others\u201d. She makes a strong case for the idea that the moments in which we feel most alive are the moments of unexpected connection and of a break in routine. Listening can easily provide us with these boosts for free and with little effort. Also, give yourself a pat on the back if you ever find yourself pausing and saying in response (honestly): \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u201d or: \u201cI\u2019d like to think about that.\u201d Congratulations: you were actually really listening for once. This is smart and playful Malcolm Gladwell-style analysis that reads as both challenging and oddly reassuring. It feels like a reiteration of something essential you once knew but that somehow you had forgotten about. Kate Murphy is here to remind us \u2013 entertainingly and compellingly \u2013 exactly why it matters so much, especially right now.

      "bodyText": "Animal welfare charity Humane Society International staff have described what they say are apocalyptic scenes on fire-ravaged Kangaroo Island, in South Australia, where they have set up a base rescuing injured wildlife. More than a third of 160km long Kangaroo Island has burned. The video and pictures released by the charity\u2019s disaster response team shows a scorched landscape of scarred trees, ash-coloured earth and animal carcasses. They also show vision of koalas and other animals being rescued, given water, carried to safety in washing baskets and cared for in a temporary veterinary hospital. Evan Quartermain, the group\u2019s Australian head of programs and manager of the Wildlife Land Trust, a network of 600 sanctuaries across the country, said the damage on the island was hard to describe. \u201cIt is extremely emotional,\u201d he said in a statement issued by the organisation. \u201cIn some places you can\u2019t walk 10 metres without coming across another carcass.\u201d Erica Martin, the charity\u2019s chief executive, said in a badly hit area that burned a week ago they found one live koala among thousands of dead koalas, kangaroos, wallabies and birds. \u201cThe scenes were nothing short of apocalyptic.\u201d The severity and extent of the fires, concentrated in the island\u2019s biodiversity-rich western region, have prompted ecologists to express grave fears for the future of some of Kangaroo Island\u2019s unique and endangered wildlife. They are particularly concerned for the Kangaroo Island dunnart, a mouse-like marsupial endemic to the island, and the glossy black-cockatoo, a unique subspecies that has been the focus of two decades of community conservation work. Heidi Groffen, an ecologist with the local Land for Wildlife organisation, last week told Guardian Australia the island was a refuge, or \u201clittle Noah\u2019s Ark\u201d, for endangered species. The fires started with lightning strikes in the Flinders Chase national park. They continue to burn. Two people have been killed, and the farming and tourism industries badly affected. Humane Society International has been working on the island with local groups, including the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park. Its team is led by Kelly Donithan, a global expert in disaster response. She said the damage to wildlife on the island was some of the worst she had seen. Donithan said the goal was to keep animals in the wild where possible. \u201cUnfortunately, the landscapes are so decimated that for many this hasn\u2019t been an option because there is nothing left for them to eat or drink, so they need to be taken in for care,\u201d she said. She said some animals were so badly burned that euthanasia was the only option. \u201cAmid all this death, every time we find an animal alive it feels like a miracle.\u201d The federal government announced on Monday $50m funding to help rescue and protect wildlife affected by the bushfire crisis, with a promise of more to come. Environment groups welcomed the commitment and said much more would be needed.",

      "body": "<h2>1) Bournemouth\u2019s lack of goals a major concern for Howe</h2> <p>Bournemouth\u2019s defending left a lot to be desired as they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/12/bournemouth-watford-premier-league-match-report\">crumbled against Watford</a> but their failure to penetrate Nigel Pearson\u2019s improving side was equally alarming. No team has scored fewer goals in the Premier League this season and those front\u2013foot displays of yesteryear \u2013 they scored almost 100 goals en route to promotion in 2015 and more than any team outside the top six last season \u2013 feel a distant memory following a ninth defeat in 11 league matches. \u201cHistorically we have always been free-scoring and we have always had goals in us,\u201d their manager, Eddie Howe, said. \u201cWe have always had the ability \u2013 even if we have conceded first \u2013 to come back and win games. That is probably where the feeling has gone missing, the creativity and that feeling we are going to score. We have to do better in that respect.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/12/bournemouth-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Bournemouth 0-3 Watford</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2) Alisson ensures Liverpool\u2019s title push has no weakness</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/tottenham-hotspur-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Another Liverpool win</a> and another that led to praise for a host of players in red. Quite right too, but there should also be an appreciation of the display delivered by the man in black. Yet again Alisson was outstanding with his positioning and handling, playing as a sweeper on occasion while every shot that came his way was, as ever, held with minimum fuss. No Premier League goalkeeper has a better clean sheets percentage than Alisson this season (46), or has a higher save percentage (83.9). Since arriving from Roma for \u00a366.9m in July 2018 the Brazilian has provided Liverpool with a calm, brilliant authority that was severely lacking during the days of Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius. Should Liverpool, as most people expect, win the title, then Alisson will have contributed as greatly as any outfield player. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/tottenham-hotspur-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tottenham 0-1 Liverpool</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"147e699eb103ad364f0b73b384839a9ae3e0c0be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/147e699eb103ad364f0b73b384839a9ae3e0c0be/0_0_3500_2606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alisson reacts after Roberto Firmino scored the only goal at Spurs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alisson reacts after Roberto Firmino scored the only goal at Spurs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Tables turn despite Manchester City brilliance</h2> <p>Manchester City have stumbled at times this season but the momentum is building nicely now. Kevin De Bruyne keeps getting better, making all the players around him look good, even if Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Gabriel Jesus and Riyad Mahrez hardly need the help. Were Pep Guardiola\u2019s men to embark on a longer hot streak than they did to finish their triumphant 2018-19 campaign, and win their remaining 16 Premier League fixtures, they would finish with 95 points. But considering the form the leaders, Liverpool, are currently in \u2013 not to mention their 14-point advantage \u2013 this would be nothing more than a minor inconvenience for them. Last season supporters everywhere marvelled at the ludicrous circumstance that a team as good as Liverpool ended up without the title. In May the tables will have turned. <strong>Luke McLaughlin</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/12/aston-villa-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Aston Villa 1-6 Manchester City</a></em></p> <h2>4) James and Hudson-Odoi flourishing on Chelsea\u2019s right</h2> <p>The future of Chelsea\u2019s right flank appeared to be taken care of during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/chelsea-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">the win over Burnley</a>. Reece James and Callum Hudson\u2011Odoi have risen through the ranks together and their interplay caused plenty of problems for Sean Dyche\u2019s side. James, a right\u2011back whose crossing ability rivals Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s, never stopped marauding forward and Hudson\u2011Odoi, who is regaining confidence after recovering from a ruptured achilles tendon, capped a fine display with his first Premier League goal. Their understanding was seen in the way they combined for Chelsea\u2019s second, a slick one\u2011two creating space for James to cross for Tammy Abraham to head home. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s just the start of the partnership as far as first-team football goes,\u201d Frank Lampard said. \u201cWhen Callum is being as aggressive as he was today and Reece is behind him, of course it is a big thing.\u201d <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/chelsea-burnley-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea 3-0 Burnley</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68229a5559443cccd5be187bb567bcaa64bc9ab1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68229a5559443cccd5be187bb567bcaa64bc9ab1/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reece James in action against Burnley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reece James in action against Burnley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elli Birch/IPS/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) Aubameyang absence is a chance for Martinelli</h2> <p>As if Mikel Arteta\u2019s in-tray had not been full enough, losing the man he readily calls \u201cprobably the most important player\u201d is a blow he could certainly have done without. There were no complaints about Pierre\u2011Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">red card at Crystal Palace</a> but there is a risk his absence for three games will seriously expose the fact that he has bailed Arsenal out on more occasions than anyone would care to remember since arriving in January 2018. The nature of Arteta\u2019s response, with slim resources to call upon, will be important in maintaining the positive vibes he has created. \u201cHopefully they have to take a step forward now,\u201d he said of those who might shoulder Aubameyang\u2019s burden. \u201cSomeone else has to do it and I want to see their reaction too.\u201d It could be a chance for Gabriel Martinelli, the gifted 18-year-old, to reassert his potential. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Crystal Palace 1-1 Arsenal</a></em></p> <h2>6) Ings playing himself into England form</h2> <p>Danny Ings could have had a hat\u2011trick in Southampton\u2019s impressive comeback <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/leicester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">win at Leicester</a>. But the 27-year-old\u2019s winner offered more compelling evidence that he is thriving under the tutelage of Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. Surely a first England call-up since he won his solitary cap under Roy Hodgson against Lithuania in 2015 is now on the cards. Brendan Rodgers, who signed him for Liverpool from Burnley that summer, certainly thinks so. With Jamie Vardy apparently not keen on making himself available for Euro 2020 and Bournemouth\u2019s Callum Wilson badly out of form, Rodgers said Ings is making a strong case after scoring seven times in the league since the start of December. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt,\u201d said the Leicester manager. \u201cHe just needs to keep the consistency and availability and he\u2019ll show he\u2019s one of the best strikers about.\u201d <strong>Ed Aarons </strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/leicester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Leicester 1-2 Southampton</a></em></p> <h2>7) Maguire laments United\u2019s lack of consistency</h2> <p>On Sunday it will be a year since Manchester United last won three consecutive league games. As Harry Maguire identified after this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/manchester-united-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\">convincing victory against Norwich</a>, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side are leading a hand-to-mouth existence. \u201cOur problem has been inconsistency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have played two good games and one bad and it has not been good enough. We are not getting carried away. It was a good performance, a clean sheet, a win, but we have to go again on Wednesday and get another good result.\u201d That is an FA Cup replay against Wolves. At least United do have a supremely consistent performer in Marcus Rashford \u2013 scorer of two against Norwich on his 200th appearance. \u201cHe\u2019s a top player with top quality,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cHe has everything.\u201d Sunday\u2019s opponents, though, are Liverpool at Anfield, so United may suffer another setback. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/manchester-united-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester United 4-0 Norwich</a></em></p> <h2>8) Moyes needs to fix West Ham\u2019s goalkeeping problem fast</h2> <p>The controversy surrounding Robert Snodgrass\u2019s disallowed goal may comfortably overshadow West Ham\u2019s performance at Sheffield United <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/10/sheffield-united-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\">on Friday night</a> but there were serious concerns away from VAR for David Moyes to digest. The Hammers\u2019 pursuit of a new goalkeeper \u2013 with Middlesbrough\u2019s Darren Randolph still on their radar \u2013 will likely have intensified over the weekend, with Lukasz Fabianski seemingly suffering a recurrence of his hip injury and another error from his replacement. David Martin\u2019s mistake, which led to Oli McBurnie\u2019s winner, was the latest example of the Hammers\u2019 deep-lying issues in goal, something Moyes will need to resolve quickly if he is to steer the Hammers away from the relegation zone. Throw in their lack of potency up front and this was a frustrating night for West Ham long before VAR intervened. <strong>Aaron Bower </strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/10/sheffield-united-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sheffield United 1-0 West Ham</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"20643883910d98b1aef1da12d38c201424a082aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20643883910d98b1aef1da12d38c201424a082aa/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oli McBurnie celebrates after the Blades capitalised on David Martin\u2019s error.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oli McBurnie celebrates after the Blades capitalised on David Martin\u2019s error.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Walcott\u2019s refusal to go down could be an invitation to dive</h2> <p>Carlo Ancelotti was quite diplomatic about the fourth-minute penalty Everton were denied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/everton-brighton-hove-albion-premier-league-match-report\">against Brighton</a>, considering a goal so early might have lifted the post-derby gloom almost immediately. \u201cI think it was a penalty,\u201d the manager said of the incident when Lewis Dunk clearly pulled Theo Walcott\u2019s shirt as he tried to reach Dominic Calvert\u2011Lewin\u2019s flick and attempt a shot. \u201cBut Theo didn\u2019t go down and that made the referee\u2019s job quite difficult.\u201d True, though even after a VAR check the penalty was refused, despite the tug being visible to most in the ground. If the combination of officials who studied it decided advantage needed to be played because Walcott was still on his feet with a chance of scoring, the result will be managers telling their players to go to ground at every opportunity \u2013 especially if their finishing is as weak as Walcott\u2019s. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/everton-brighton-hove-albion-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Everton 1-0 Brighton</a></em></p> <h2>10) Nuno sends out message about his toothless Wolves</h2> <p>Something about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/wolves-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\">Wolves\u2019 draw with Newcastle</a> suggested Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was sending a message to his bosses. With Diogo Jota injured, Pedro Neto was given a chance to shine. He struggled, not the only summer signing to do so at Molineux this season, with Jes\u00fas Vallejo and Patrick Cutrone having already departed. But Neto stayed on until the 85th minute as Wolves laboured in their hunt for a winner. One look at the bench showed why: a collection of inexperienced players, with the 21-year-old Benny Ashley-Seal, who made his full debut last week, the only forward. The message was plain: Wolves are short of attacking options. Nuno made clear to the media he wants new forwards in this window, as he has been doing for some time, but on this occasion he may have chosen other means to get his point across. <strong>Paul

      "bodyText": "1) Bournemouth\u2019s lack of goals a major concern for Howe Bournemouth\u2019s defending left a lot to be desired as they crumbled against Watford but their failure to penetrate Nigel Pearson\u2019s improving side was equally alarming. No team has scored fewer goals in the Premier League this season and those front\u2013foot displays of yesteryear \u2013 they scored almost 100 goals en route to promotion in 2015 and more than any team outside the top six last season \u2013 feel a distant memory following a ninth defeat in 11 league matches. \u201cHistorically we have always been free-scoring and we have always had goals in us,\u201d their manager, Eddie Howe, said. \u201cWe have always had the ability \u2013 even if we have conceded first \u2013 to come back and win games. That is probably where the feeling has gone missing, the creativity and that feeling we are going to score. We have to do better in that respect.\u201d Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Bournemouth 0-3 Watford 2) Alisson ensures Liverpool\u2019s title push has no weakness Another Liverpool win and another that led to praise for a host of players in red. Quite right too, but there should also be an appreciation of the display delivered by the man in black. Yet again Alisson was outstanding with his positioning and handling, playing as a sweeper on occasion while every shot that came his way was, as ever, held with minimum fuss. No Premier League goalkeeper has a better clean sheets percentage than Alisson this season (46), or has a higher save percentage (83.9). Since arriving from Roma for \u00a366.9m in July 2018 the Brazilian has provided Liverpool with a calm, brilliant authority that was severely lacking during the days of Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius. Should Liverpool, as most people expect, win the title, then Alisson will have contributed as greatly as any outfield player. Sachin Nakrani \u2022 Match report: Tottenham 0-1 Liverpool 3) Tables turn despite Manchester City brilliance Manchester City have stumbled at times this season but the momentum is building nicely now. Kevin De Bruyne keeps getting better, making all the players around him look good, even if Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Gabriel Jesus and Riyad Mahrez hardly need the help. Were Pep Guardiola\u2019s men to embark on a longer hot streak than they did to finish their triumphant 2018-19 campaign, and win their remaining 16 Premier League fixtures, they would finish with 95 points. But considering the form the leaders, Liverpool, are currently in \u2013 not to mention their 14-point advantage \u2013 this would be nothing more than a minor inconvenience for them. Last season supporters everywhere marvelled at the ludicrous circumstance that a team as good as Liverpool ended up without the title. In May the tables will have turned. Luke McLaughlin \u2022 Match report: Aston Villa 1-6 Manchester City 4) James and Hudson-Odoi flourishing on Chelsea\u2019s right The future of Chelsea\u2019s right flank appeared to be taken care of during the win over Burnley. Reece James and Callum Hudson\u2011Odoi have risen through the ranks together and their interplay caused plenty of problems for Sean Dyche\u2019s side. James, a right\u2011back whose crossing ability rivals Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s, never stopped marauding forward and Hudson\u2011Odoi, who is regaining confidence after recovering from a ruptured achilles tendon, capped a fine display with his first Premier League goal. Their understanding was seen in the way they combined for Chelsea\u2019s second, a slick one\u2011two creating space for James to cross for Tammy Abraham to head home. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s just the start of the partnership as far as first-team football goes,\u201d Frank Lampard said. \u201cWhen Callum is being as aggressive as he was today and Reece is behind him, of course it is a big thing.\u201d Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: Chelsea 3-0 Burnley 5) Aubameyang absence is a chance for Martinelli As if Mikel Arteta\u2019s in-tray had not been full enough, losing the man he readily calls \u201cprobably the most important player\u201d is a blow he could certainly have done without. There were no complaints about Pierre\u2011Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s red card at Crystal Palace but there is a risk his absence for three games will seriously expose the fact that he has bailed Arsenal out on more occasions than anyone would care to remember since arriving in January 2018. The nature of Arteta\u2019s response, with slim resources to call upon, will be important in maintaining the positive vibes he has created. \u201cHopefully they have to take a step forward now,\u201d he said of those who might shoulder Aubameyang\u2019s burden. \u201cSomeone else has to do it and I want to see their reaction too.\u201d It could be a chance for Gabriel Martinelli, the gifted 18-year-old, to reassert his potential. Nick Ames \u2022 Match report: Crystal Palace 1-1 Arsenal 6) Ings playing himself into England form Danny Ings could have had a hat\u2011trick in Southampton\u2019s impressive comeback win at Leicester. But the 27-year-old\u2019s winner offered more compelling evidence that he is thriving under the tutelage of Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. Surely a first England call-up since he won his solitary cap under Roy Hodgson against Lithuania in 2015 is now on the cards. Brendan Rodgers, who signed him for Liverpool from Burnley that summer, certainly thinks so. With Jamie Vardy apparently not keen on making himself available for Euro 2020 and Bournemouth\u2019s Callum Wilson badly out of form, Rodgers said Ings is making a strong case after scoring seven times in the league since the start of December. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt,\u201d said the Leicester manager. \u201cHe just needs to keep the consistency and availability and he\u2019ll show he\u2019s one of the best strikers about.\u201d Ed Aarons \u2022 Match report: Leicester 1-2 Southampton 7) Maguire laments United\u2019s lack of consistency On Sunday it will be a year since Manchester United last won three consecutive league games. As Harry Maguire identified after this convincing victory against Norwich, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side are leading a hand-to-mouth existence. \u201cOur problem has been inconsistency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have played two good games and one bad and it has not been good enough. We are not getting carried away. It was a good performance, a clean sheet, a win, but we have to go again on Wednesday and get another good result.\u201d That is an FA Cup replay against Wolves. At least United do have a supremely consistent performer in Marcus Rashford \u2013 scorer of two against Norwich on his 200th appearance. \u201cHe\u2019s a top player with top quality,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cHe has everything.\u201d Sunday\u2019s opponents, though, are Liverpool at Anfield, so United may suffer another setback. Jamie Jackson \u2022 Match report: Manchester United 4-0 Norwich 8) Moyes needs to fix West Ham\u2019s goalkeeping problem fast The controversy surrounding Robert Snodgrass\u2019s disallowed goal may comfortably overshadow West Ham\u2019s performance at Sheffield United on Friday night but there were serious concerns away from VAR for David Moyes to digest. The Hammers\u2019 pursuit of a new goalkeeper \u2013 with Middlesbrough\u2019s Darren Randolph still on their radar \u2013 will likely have intensified over the weekend, with Lukasz Fabianski seemingly suffering a recurrence of his hip injury and another error from his replacement. David Martin\u2019s mistake, which led to Oli McBurnie\u2019s winner, was the latest example of the Hammers\u2019 deep-lying issues in goal, something Moyes will need to resolve quickly if he is to steer the Hammers away from the relegation zone. Throw in their lack of potency up front and this was a frustrating night for West Ham long before VAR intervened. Aaron Bower \u2022 Match report: Sheffield United 1-0 West Ham 9) Walcott\u2019s refusal to go down could be an invitation to dive Carlo Ancelotti was quite diplomatic about the fourth-minute penalty Everton were denied against Brighton, considering a goal so early might have lifted the post-derby gloom almost immediately. \u201cI think it was a penalty,\u201d the manager said of the incident when Lewis Dunk clearly pulled Theo Walcott\u2019s shirt as he tried to reach Dominic Calvert\u2011Lewin\u2019s flick and attempt a shot. \u201cBut Theo didn\u2019t go down and that made the referee\u2019s job quite difficult.\u201d True, though even after a VAR check the penalty was refused, despite the tug being visible to most in the ground. If the combination of officials who studied it decided advantage needed to be played because Walcott was still on his feet with a chance of scoring, the result will be managers telling their players to go to ground at every opportunity \u2013 especially if their finishing is as weak as Walcott\u2019s. Paul Wilson \u2022 Match report: Everton 1-0 Brighton 10) Nuno sends out message about his toothless Wolves Something about Wolves\u2019 draw with Newcastle suggested Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was sending a message to his bosses. With Diogo Jota injured, Pedro Neto was given a chance to shine. He struggled, not the only summer signing to do so at Molineux this season, with Jes\u00fas Vallejo and Patrick Cutrone having already departed. But Neto stayed on until the 85th minute as Wolves laboured in their hunt for a winner. One look at the bench showed why: a collection of inexperienced players, with the 21-year-old Benny Ashley-Seal, who made his full debut last week, the only forward. The message was plain: Wolves are short of attacking options. Nuno made clear to the media he wants new forwards in this window, as he has been doing for some time, but on this occasion he may have chosen other means to get his point across.

      "body": "<p>Bad decisions are going to haunt Bill O\u2019Brien this offseason, and may cost him his job.</p> <p>The Houston Texans leapt out to a red-hot start in Kansas City, taking a 21-0 lead in the blink of an eye. For the Kansas City Chiefs it was a different story: Andy Reid\u2019s team was off to an Andy-Reid-Team-In-The-Playoffs sort of start. They didn\u2019t look ready to play and had a bunch of miscues. A mistake led to a walk-in touchdown. Tyreek Hill muffed a punt. They dropped four passes in the first quarter alone, which was striking given that they had had four dropped passes in the preview six weeks combined. This would be another Andy Reid adventure: a good regular season, a brilliant offensive mind, a disappointing postseason collapse. But O\u2019Brien wasn\u2019t going to let Reid maintain his postseason incompetence dynasty so easily.</p> <p>Up 21-0, O\u2019Brien opted to kick a field goal on fourth-and-one from the KC 13-yard line, rather than go for the throat. That decision is fine in a vacuum; the Texans took a 24-0 lead. What came next was a mess: the Chiefs had scored their first touchdown but were still in deep trouble when O\u2019Brien opted for \u2013 or allowed his special teams coach to call \u2013 a fake punt from his team\u2019s own 31. KC stopped it. After the fake punt, the revitalized Chiefs rattled off five touchdowns without reply, ending the day with a 51-31 victory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/12/patrick-mahomes-kansas-city-chiefs-houston-texans-nfl-playoffs\">Five-star Mahomes leads Chiefs to 24-point comeback against stunned Texans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such a commanding early lead allowed O\u2019Brien to expose his incompetence. Weird, this football thing. The Texans were cautious when they should have risked and risked when caution called.</p> <p>But this game was about more than O\u2019Brien\u2019s fourth-down calls. It was about Watson and Mahomes, two young quarterbacks who embody the changing nature of the most important position in sports, who seem set to forge a Manning-Brady type rivalry for the next 10 years at least. The AFC runs through them now.</p> <p>The non-mobile quarterbacks who win strictly with their arm, playing with rhythm and tempo, are now dinosaurs. You cannot win with Brady (or at least the early, non-pocket mover edition rather than his current incarnation) or Manning anymore. The game is too fast, and defenders and defenses are too versatile, too complex. Nowadays you need a quarterback who can improvise, break the script every once in a while, and isn\u2019t afraid to make risky throws. You need a Watson or Wilson or Rodgers.</p> <p>Mahomes is the greatest example. He\u2019s an off-script magic-maker who doubles as the most efficient passer in the game. Mahomes has a way of making the simple revelatory. Some passes exist only because he envisions them, and dares to throw them. He\u2019s so loose-limbed, with such arrhythmic patterns, it sometimes looks as if different parts of his body are moving at different rates:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/thecheckdown/status/1216475357236191232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THIS IS WHERE LEGENDS ARE MADE. <a href=\"https://t.co/2WMpAHhIx2\">pic.twitter.com/2WMpAHhIx2</a></p>&mdash; The Checkdown (@thecheckdown) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thecheckdown/status/1216475357236191232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>How do you defend that? You don\u2019t. It\u2019s impossible.</p> <p>Sunday felt like a reminder that Mahomes is the league\u2019s real MVP, but that shouldn\u2019t absolve O\u2019Brien of scrutiny. His job, as coaches love to parrot, is to put his team in the best position to succeed. He didn\u2019t; he failed.</p> <p>This was about O\u2019Brien the personnel man as much as O\u2019Brien the coach. This is a man who ousted former general manager Rick Smith and assumed control of the Texans 53-man roster, as well as all the ingoings and outgoings. O\u2019Brien the coach and O\u2019Brien the personnel man could never get on the same page. He chucked first-round picks at quick fixes, most notably Laremy Tunsil arriving to protect Deshaun Watson\u2019s blindside to the tune of two first-round picks. He also shipped out Jadeveon Clowney after failing to agree on a contract extension.</p> <p>Trading a generational player should bring back a generation of players. O\u2019Brien landed a pair of blah energy players and a third-round pick. And it\u2019s that kind of hubris that tells you a fake punt, in your own half, on the road, in the playoffs, against a Mahomes-led offense is a good idea. Clowney would have come in handy on Sunday. JJ Watt was the only Texans player to secure multiple quarterback pressures (two). The team as a whole finished with five total pressures, a season-low for Mahomes.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s game was an instant classic, the dawn of a new era: Texans v Chiefs. Watson v Mahomes. Kansas City took the first round. It would be wise for Houston to move on from O\u2019Brien before the second-round rolls around next January.</p> <h2>Stat of the week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/packers/status/1216550591150936064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronRodgers12?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AaronRodgers12</a> \ud83c\udfaf <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tae15adams?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tae15adams</a>! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEAvsGB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SEAvsGB</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoPackGo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoPackGo</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/8VsgtAViTQ\">pic.twitter.com/8VsgtAViTQ</a></p>&mdash; Green Bay Packers (@packers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/packers/status/1216550591150936064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Aaron Rodgers was at his absolute best on Sunday. The future Hall of Famer completed all six of his passes that travelled more than 10 yards through the air for 145 yards and two touchdowns. Rodgers had completed just 23.6% of those passes in his previous three games. The Packers outschemed a shabby Seahawks defense, but the result still could have been different but for three you\u2019ve-got-to-be-kidding-me throws from Rodgers. As usual, he delivered when it mattered.</p> <h2><strong>MVP of the week</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f8153826dc00fbc577da5d596fe15590d5028f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f8153826dc00fbc577da5d596fe15590d5028f3/0_292_4776_2866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Derrick Henry receives well-deserved congratulations from fans as he leaves the field on Saturday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derrick Henry receives well-deserved congratulations from fans as he leaves the field on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Derrick Henry, RB, Titans. </strong>The numbers and milestones from Henry\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/11/baltimore-ravens-tennessee-titans-playoff-score\">Saturday night performance are astonishing</a>. Take your pick from any of these:</p> <p>- Henry rushed for 195 yards on 30 carries, the first time a running back has had two 180-yard games in the same postseason.</p> <p>- It was the third consecutive game Henry had rushed for 180 yards: 211 v the Texans, 182 v the Patriots, and the 195 on Saturday night.</p> <p>- In his past eight games, he has gained 1,273 rushing yards, the third-most in NFL history over an eight-game span.</p> <p>- Henry became the heaviest player in playoff history <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1216197437041197056\">to throw for a touchdown</a>.</p> <p>Even more impressive was the visual. Henry is a 6ft 3in, 247lbs block of cement. He is the most physically imposing back in the league, with the raw power to run through a defensive lineman, and just enough wiggle to skip away from linebackers and safeties at the second-level. We\u2019ve had beefed-up backs before, but what separates Henry is his breakaway speed. Three-yard runs turn into 40-yard gallops in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>The volume on Henry\u2019s plate is unique in this pass-happy age. It\u2019s become a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that\u2019s true: Henry gets stronger as the game goes on. Or, more accurately, Henry maintains his Superman levels as opponents tire. After all, this is a guy who once carried the ball 57 times in a high school game. Fifty seven!</p> <h2><strong>Quote of the week</strong></h2> <p><em>\u201cI like that!\u201d</em> \u2013 Richard Sherman mimicking Kirk Cousins after intercepting the Vikings quarterback on Saturday.</p> <p>Few players have done a better job of crafting the narrative that they\u2019re disrespected in order to fuel themselves, despite being universally acknowledged as great, as Richard Sherman.

Now, he\u2019s just tacking on gold jacket moments. Even at 31, Sherman\u2019s genius remains in full bloom. He shut down one-half of the field against the Vikings, conceding just one reception of nine yards on three targets. This year he is allowing just 10 receiving yards <em>per game. </em>The Niners pass-rush receives most of the team\u2019s accolades, but Sherman is playing as well as ever, speed never being the most important part of his game. He now has six seasons with more interceptions than touchdowns allowed, cementing his place as the best cornerback of the post-Revis era.</p> <h2>Video of the week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FieldYates/status/1216493696184614912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Put Eric Fisher in the Hall of Fame \ud83c\udf7b. <a href=\"https://t.co/AGjY7W9WiD\">pic.twitter.com/AGjY7W9WiD</a></p>&mdash; Field Yates (@FieldYates) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FieldYates/status/1216493696184614912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Celebration of the year goes to Eric Fisher.

Stefanski flopped in front of a national audience against the San Franisco 49ers on Saturday, up against a fellow finalist for the Browns job, Niners defensive coordinator Robert Salah. But judging him based on that one-game sample size is silly. Stefanski has done a good job with the Vikings offense in a little over a year on the job and is considered a darling among football\u2019s analytics people.

As formations continue to spread out, and mobile quarterbacks become the norm, the requirements for top linebackers are more specific.

      "bodyText": "Bad decisions are going to haunt Bill O\u2019Brien this offseason, and may cost him his job. The Houston Texans leapt out to a red-hot start in Kansas City, taking a 21-0 lead in the blink of an eye. For the Kansas City Chiefs it was a different story: Andy Reid\u2019s team was off to an Andy-Reid-Team-In-The-Playoffs sort of start. They didn\u2019t look ready to play and had a bunch of miscues. A mistake led to a walk-in touchdown. Tyreek Hill muffed a punt. They dropped four passes in the first quarter alone, which was striking given that they had had four dropped passes in the preview six weeks combined. This would be another Andy Reid adventure: a good regular season, a brilliant offensive mind, a disappointing postseason collapse. But O\u2019Brien wasn\u2019t going to let Reid maintain his postseason incompetence dynasty so easily. Up 21-0, O\u2019Brien opted to kick a field goal on fourth-and-one from the KC 13-yard line, rather than go for the throat. That decision is fine in a vacuum; the Texans took a 24-0 lead. What came next was a mess: the Chiefs had scored their first touchdown but were still in deep trouble when O\u2019Brien opted for \u2013 or allowed his special teams coach to call \u2013 a fake punt from his team\u2019s own 31. KC stopped it. After the fake punt, the revitalized Chiefs rattled off five touchdowns without reply, ending the day with a 51-31 victory. Such a commanding early lead allowed O\u2019Brien to expose his incompetence. Weird, this football thing. The Texans were cautious when they should have risked and risked when caution called. But this game was about more than O\u2019Brien\u2019s fourth-down calls. It was about Watson and Mahomes, two young quarterbacks who embody the changing nature of the most important position in sports, who seem set to forge a Manning-Brady type rivalry for the next 10 years at least. The AFC runs through them now. The non-mobile quarterbacks who win strictly with their arm, playing with rhythm and tempo, are now dinosaurs. You cannot win with Brady (or at least the early, non-pocket mover edition rather than his current incarnation) or Manning anymore. The game is too fast, and defenders and defenses are too versatile, too complex. Nowadays you need a quarterback who can improvise, break the script every once in a while, and isn\u2019t afraid to make risky throws. You need a Watson or Wilson or Rodgers. Mahomes is the greatest example. He\u2019s an off-script magic-maker who doubles as the most efficient passer in the game. Mahomes has a way of making the simple revelatory. Some passes exist only because he envisions them, and dares to throw them. He\u2019s so loose-limbed, with such arrhythmic patterns, it sometimes looks as if different parts of his body are moving at different rates: How do you defend that? You don\u2019t. It\u2019s impossible. Sunday felt like a reminder that Mahomes is the league\u2019s real MVP, but that shouldn\u2019t absolve O\u2019Brien of scrutiny. His job, as coaches love to parrot, is to put his team in the best position to succeed. He didn\u2019t; he failed. This was about O\u2019Brien the personnel man as much as O\u2019Brien the coach. This is a man who ousted former general manager Rick Smith and assumed control of the Texans 53-man roster, as well as all the ingoings and outgoings. O\u2019Brien the coach and O\u2019Brien the personnel man could never get on the same page. He chucked first-round picks at quick fixes, most notably Laremy Tunsil arriving to protect Deshaun Watson\u2019s blindside to the tune of two first-round picks. He also shipped out Jadeveon Clowney after failing to agree on a contract extension. Trading a generational player should bring back a generation of players. O\u2019Brien landed a pair of blah energy players and a third-round pick. And it\u2019s that kind of hubris that tells you a fake punt, in your own half, on the road, in the playoffs, against a Mahomes-led offense is a good idea. Clowney would have come in handy on Sunday. JJ Watt was the only Texans player to secure multiple quarterback pressures (two). The team as a whole finished with five total pressures, a season-low for Mahomes. Sunday\u2019s game was an instant classic, the dawn of a new era: Texans v Chiefs. Watson v Mahomes. Kansas City took the first round. It would be wise for Houston to move on from O\u2019Brien before the second-round rolls around next January. Stat of the week Aaron Rodgers was at his absolute best on Sunday. The future Hall of Famer completed all six of his passes that travelled more than 10 yards through the air for 145 yards and two touchdowns. Rodgers had completed just 23.6% of those passes in his previous three games. The Packers outschemed a shabby Seahawks defense, but the result still could have been different but for three you\u2019ve-got-to-be-kidding-me throws from Rodgers. As usual, he delivered when it mattered. MVP of the week Derrick Henry, RB, Titans. The numbers and milestones from Henry\u2019s Saturday night performance are astonishing. Take your pick from any of these: - Henry rushed for 195 yards on 30 carries, the first time a running back has had two 180-yard games in the same postseason. - It was the third consecutive game Henry had rushed for 180 yards: 211 v the Texans, 182 v the Patriots, and the 195 on Saturday night. - In his past eight games, he has gained 1,273 rushing yards, the third-most in NFL history over an eight-game span. - Henry became the heaviest player in playoff history to throw for a touchdown. Even more impressive was the visual. Henry is a 6ft 3in, 247lbs block of cement. He is the most physically imposing back in the league, with the raw power to run through a defensive lineman, and just enough wiggle to skip away from linebackers and safeties at the second-level. We\u2019ve had beefed-up backs before, but what separates Henry is his breakaway speed. Three-yard runs turn into 40-yard gallops in the blink of an eye. The volume on Henry\u2019s plate is unique in this pass-happy age. It\u2019s become a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that\u2019s true: Henry gets stronger as the game goes on. Or, more accurately, Henry maintains his Superman levels as opponents tire. After all, this is a guy who once carried the ball 57 times in a high school game. Fifty seven! Quote of the week \u201cI like that!\u201d \u2013 Richard Sherman mimicking Kirk Cousins after intercepting the Vikings quarterback on Saturday. Few players have done a better job of crafting the narrative that they\u2019re disrespected in order to fuel themselves, despite being universally acknowledged as great, as Richard Sherman. Michael Jordan would be proud. Sherman was waltzing to the Hall of Fame after his out-of-this-world production in Seattle, including backbreaking plays in big-time spots. Now, he\u2019s just tacking on gold jacket moments. Even at 31, Sherman\u2019s genius remains in full bloom. He shut down one-half of the field against the Vikings, conceding just one reception of nine yards on three targets. This year he is allowing just 10 receiving yards per game. The Niners pass-rush receives most of the team\u2019s accolades, but Sherman is playing as well as ever, speed never being the most important part of his game. He now has six seasons with more interceptions than touchdowns allowed, cementing his place as the best cornerback of the post-Revis era. Video of the week Celebration of the year goes to Eric Fisher. The Chiefs were so rampant against the Texans that their left tackle was able to take time to douse himself in beer in the midst of a 51-7 scoring run. Elsewhere around the league -- The Browns hired ex-Vikings offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski as their new head coach this weekend. Stefanski flopped in front of a national audience against the San Franisco 49ers on Saturday, up against a fellow finalist for the Browns job, Niners defensive coordinator Robert Salah. But judging him based on that one-game sample size is silly. Stefanski has done a good job with the Vikings offense in a little over a year on the job and is considered a darling among football\u2019s analytics people. Stefanski will be the fourth Cleveland coach in three seasons. -- The sports TV moment of the year goes to Fox. During the half-time break of the Packers-Seahawks game, Jimmy Johnson was told he had made the Pro Football Hall of Fame, in front of his colleagues, and with his former quarterback Troy Aikman watching on from the booth. Johnson and his teammates were overwhelmed with emotion. Johnson will enter the Hall of Fame before he enters the Cowboys ring of honor, such is the ego of Jerry Jones. -- A trend worth noting in the playoffs: every team in the divisional round had speed, size, and versatility at linebacker \u2013 guys as comfortable lining up inside as on the edge. As formations continue to spread out, and mobile quarterbacks become the norm, the requirements for top linebackers are more specific. You\u2019re hard-pressed to find a more complete duo right now than San Francisco\u2019s Fred Warner and Kwon Alexander.",

It would only appear during erections. \u201cIt was like the skin wasn\u2019t stretching because something was holding it back,\u201d the 49-year-old recalls. Soon, he began experiencing pains in the night. Then his penis developed a bend. \u201cI thought: \u2018That\u2019s not right \u2013 what\u2019s that about?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jones, who has chosen not to use his real name, did what any concerned middle-aged person would: he researched his symptoms online. The results pointed to a condition he had never heard of before, but which affects as many as one in 10 men: Peyronie\u2019s disease. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d just associated that word with the beer,\u201d he says.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/mens-health/is-it-normal-to-have-a-curved-penis/%0D\" title=\"\">Peyronie\u2019s</a> is an often painful scarring or bending of the penis that can make sex uncomfortable or impossible. It involves the growth of fibrous plaque, or harder tissue, in the walls of the penis. A ring of plaque can create an hourglass shape in an erection. A growth on one side can bring on a bend. In severe cases, the bend can be 90 degrees or more.</p> <p>The condition, which is named after the 18th-century French surgeon who first studied it, tends to affect men in their 40s or older. It is thought to be a response to injury, perhaps during sport or vigorous sex. The trauma, which can go unnoticed at the time, causes the scar tissue to build up. Peyronie\u2019s may also be genetic in some men, while <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473459\" title=\"\">studies</a> have in some cases linked it to low testosterone.</p> <p>Doctors say diagnoses have risen significantly in recent years as men become more comfortable seeking help. Asif Muneer, a consultant urological surgeon and andrologist in London, credits the cultural impact of Viagra and media coverage of sexual health with chipping away the embarrassment barrier. \u201cA lot of them come with their partners now, which never used to happen,\u201d he says, adding that he sees at least one new Peyronie\u2019s case a day, on average.</p> <p>Yet Muneer, who works in the NHS and for HCA UK, a large private health group, says awareness remains low, given the disease\u2019s potentially life-changing, emotionally traumatic effects. Treatment can be complex and uncomfortable \u2013 and can require invasive surgery. Moreover, a drug only recently approved for Peyronie\u2019s is rarely available on the NHS \u2013 and is about to be withdrawn entirely from Europe by its American manufacturer.</p> <p>Jones\u2019s symptoms, which he first noticed three years ago, grew steadily worse, the bend eventually reaching about 60 degrees. \u201cAt that point, I didn\u2019t want to have any sex, not only because of the embarrassment and what it was doing to my mental state, but because it would have been very difficult physically,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Like many men who develop Peyronie\u2019s, Jones initially feared a cancerous growth. He saw his GP early on and was eventually referred to Muneer. It took three months of tests to confirm the diagnosis. At first, Jones was prescribed a vacuum pump to stimulate circulation and reduce any loss in length \u2013 Peyronie\u2019s can cause significant shortening, creating further emotional distress. Jones still uses the pump four times a week.</p> <p>At one point, surgery became Jones\u2019s best hope of halting and correcting the bend. A Nesbit procedure involves removing a wedge of the longer, unaffected side of the bent penis to bring it back into line. Sex can become easier, or possible, again, but the payoff is further shortening. \u201cAnd I\u2019d already lost about one and a half inches,\u201d Jones says. He decided not to go under the knife.</p> <p>Different drugs have been tried out in Peyronie\u2019s cases, to varying levels of success. At the time surgery became an option, Muneer told Jones about Xiapex. The enzymes in the drug have been shown to dissolve the collagen that forms most of the plaque, reducing the constriction that creates the bend.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.sps.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LMEN__Xiapex_Peyronies_July15.pdf%0D\" title=\"\">NHS review</a> of evidence in 2015 found that Xiapex, which is injected into the penis, was less invasive, risky and resource-intensive than surgery, if not suitable in all cases. But it is also categorised as a high-cost drug, then costing \u00a31,300 per cycle, typically of three injections over three months.</p> <p>Muneer says Xiapex is very rarely funded by NHS trusts, while surgery still is. With a contribution from his work\u2019s private health policy, Jones was able to get the drug privately. But he still had to contribute almost \u00a33,000 himself, including additional costs for the treatment. \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d he says. \u201cAvoid it and say, well, that\u2019s a really nice holiday, or try and get on with it and sort it out?\u201d</p> <p>Jones had his third injection the day before we speak. He compares it to a visit to the dentist, \u201cbut down there\u201d; the drug is injected after a local anaesthetic. He has to massage his penis to encourage the reduction in the bend, and has already noticed an improvement. But Muneer says that Xiapex is about to be quietly taken off the market less than five years after its launch. \u201cIt will mean patients who want to avoid surgery won\u2019t have that option,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Xiapex, branded Xiaflex in the US, is distributed in Europe by Sobi, a Swedish pharmaceutical company. Sobi declined to share sales figures, but confirmed that Endo Pharmaceuticals, which makes the drug, has decided \u201cto terminate the collaboration with Sobi \u2026 [We] will accordingly not distribute Xiapex in 2020\u201d. The <a href=\"https://dupuytrenssociety.blogspot.com/2019/11/xiapex-to-be-discontinued.html?spref=tw%0D\" title=\"\">withdrawal</a> will also affect patients with <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dupuytrens-contracture/%0D\" title=\"\">Dupuytren\u2019s contracture</a>, which causes fingers to bend towards the palm of the hand (the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/08/bill-nighy-interview-second-best-exotic-marigold-hotel\" title=\"\">Bill Nighy</a> has had it since his 20s).</p> <p>Endo declined to answer any questions about the drug, which remains patent protected, or to address the concerns of men who will no longer be able to access it. Nor would it explain or even confirm the decision to abandon its European customers. \u201cThanks for reaching out. We have no further comment,\u201d Heather Zoumas Lubeski, the company\u2019s executive director of corporate affairs, tells me in a one-line email.</p> <p>Jones, who is in a long and supportive marriage, fears for men like him for whom Xiapex offers the best hope of a return to something like a normal life. \u201cI would be distraught if it hadn\u2019t been available,\u201d he says. His sex life has, unsurprisingly, suffered. As well as the bend, Peyronie\u2019s can cause broader dysfunction and performance anxiety. Jones has to take Viagra, which means he and his wife have to plan sex ahead of time \u2013 sex that is also likely to be painful, even if it is successful.</p> <p>\u201cPut it this way: if I were single or a younger man, I wouldn\u2019t have been looking at meeting anyone ever again in the condition I\u2019m in,\u201d he says. \u201cMy only other option would be to go and have the chop, but then I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d have left. I don\u2019t know how I could have coped with it. I probably wouldn\u2019t want to be around, to be honest \u2026 You feel like you\u2019re not a man any more.\u201d</p> <p>Jones received some counselling on the NHS, but he would like more research and funding for non-surgical treatments, and for more men to feel comfortable getting help. Muneer suspects that many men are reluctant to do so, which means the true rates could be higher than thought. It is estimated that it affects between <a href=\"https://www.tsft.nhs.uk/media/45080/Peyronies.pdf\" title=\"\">3%</a> and <a href=\"https://www.baus.org.uk/_userfiles/pages/files/Patients/Leaflets/Peyronies.pdf\" title=\"\">10%</a> of adult men \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/well/live/a-new-treatment-for-a-painful-penis-curvature.html%0D\" title=\"\">up to 23%</a> in the 40-70 age group. That could equate to as many as 2.5 million cases in the UK.</p> <p>But Muneer is pleased to see attitudes change, even if treatment can be challenging. The ubiquity of camera phones has also helped, he says. \u201cWhen I started, people were bringing in out-of-focus Polaroids,\u201d he explains. \u201cNow I can get a better idea of the problem. I had one architect who even added the angle of his bend to the photo.\u201d</p> <p>Jones was in the military before construction and is familiar with male-dominated tea-breaks in which sexual health chat tends not to feature. \u201cI talk about a lot, but even I wouldn\u2019t talk about this at work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important to get this condition out there, so other people can read about it and understand it, and know that it\u2019s not easy, but help is out there.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2020. An earlier version equated the estimate of Peyronie\u2019s disease affecting 10% of adult men to being \u201cas many as 250,000 cases in the UK\u201d. That figure is more like 2.5 million men. </p>",

Sobi declined to share sales figures, but confirmed that Endo Pharmaceuticals, which makes the drug, has decided \u201cto terminate the collaboration with Sobi \u2026 [We] will accordingly not distribute Xiapex in 2020\u201d. The withdrawal will also affect patients with Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, which causes fingers to bend towards the palm of the hand (the actor Bill Nighy has had it since his 20s). Endo declined to answer any questions about the drug, which remains patent protected, or to address the concerns of men who will no longer be able to access it. Nor would it explain or even confirm the decision to abandon its European customers. \u201cThanks for reaching out. We have no further comment,\u201d Heather Zoumas Lubeski, the company\u2019s executive director of corporate affairs, tells me in a one-line email. Jones, who is in a long and supportive marriage, fears for men like him for whom Xiapex offers the best hope of a return to something like a normal life. \u201cI would be distraught if it hadn\u2019t been available,\u201d he says. His sex life has, unsurprisingly, suffered. As well as the bend, Peyronie\u2019s can cause broader dysfunction and performance anxiety. Jones has to take Viagra, which means he and his wife have to plan sex ahead of time \u2013 sex that is also likely to be painful, even if it is successful. \u201cPut it this way: if I were single or a younger man, I wouldn\u2019t have been looking at meeting anyone ever again in the condition I\u2019m in,\u201d he says. \u201cMy only other option would be to go and have the chop, but then I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d have left. I don\u2019t know how I could have coped with it. I probably wouldn\u2019t want to be around, to be honest \u2026 You feel like you\u2019re not a man any more.\u201d Jones received some counselling on the NHS, but he would like more research and funding for non-surgical treatments, and for more men to feel comfortable getting help. Muneer suspects that many men are reluctant to do so, which means the true rates could be higher than thought. It is estimated that it affects between 3% and 10% of adult men \u2013 and up to 23% in the 40-70 age group. That could equate to as many as 2.5 million cases in the UK. But Muneer is pleased to see attitudes change, even if treatment can be challenging. The ubiquity of camera phones has also helped, he says. \u201cWhen I started, people were bringing in out-of-focus Polaroids,\u201d he explains. \u201cNow I can get a better idea of the problem. I had one architect who even added the angle of his bend to the photo.\u201d Jones was in the military before construction and is familiar with male-dominated tea-breaks in which sexual health chat tends not to feature. \u201cI talk about a lot, but even I wouldn\u2019t talk about this at work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important to get this condition out there, so other people can read about it and understand it, and know that it\u2019s not easy, but help is out there.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2020. An earlier version equated the estimate of Peyronie\u2019s disease affecting 10% of adult men to being \u201cas many as 250,000 cases in the UK\u201d. That figure is more like 2.5 million men.",

Masterplanned as an eventual community of 5,000, it has housed acolytes who came to learn Soleri\u2019s construction techniques and help make cast bells, which were sold to finance the project. It is a magical environment, \u2018hippy modernism\u2019 with domes and carvings and rooftops looking out on to the Sonoran desert just north of Phoenix.\u201d Benesse House, Kagawa, Japan Jani Kristoffersen, Guise \u201cThe small, remote island of Naoshima is the most sublime combination of art and nature. The island offers some of the world\u2019s greatest art experiences, as well as impressive nature. Benesse House offers something truly original: to be alone with some of the greatest pieces of art one can find.\u201d Camino Real Polanco, Mexico City, Mexico Carlos Jim\u00e9nez, Carlos Jim\u00e9nez Studio \u201cAlthough a prime business hotel, it is also a great, family-friendly place filled with space and light. Like a small city, it is crossed by colour-infused streets that look into gardens, fountains, trees and pools. It never disappoints.\u201d Thunderbird Hotel, Marfa, Texas Grace Mortlock, Other Architects \u201cFrom its famous \u2018Marfa Lights\u2019 to the minimalist appeal of Donald Judd\u2019s house and studio, Marfa is all about the atmosphere. It appears mirage-like on the roadside, after a long drive from Houston or San Antonio. The Thunderbird Hotel looks like a standard Americana motel, but has just enough sophisticated touches to make your stay comfortable and chic. For a one-horse town, there are an improbably large number of great bars and restaurants within walking distance.\u201d The Oberoi Beach Resort, Lombok, Indonesia Achille Salvagni, Achille Salvagni Architetti \u201cLombok, compared with Bali, remains relatively unspoiled, so this is a magnificent place in which to really unwind in the sun and eat fresh seafood and relax in the sun.\u201d Hotel Brosundet, \u00c5lesund, Norway Craig Dykers, Sn\u00f8hetta \u201cStay in Room 47 \u2013 the Molja Lighthouse.

But the show\u2019s longtime host, Alex Trebek, who is currently battling stage four pancreatic cancer, did not acknowledge the rectification and did not award Needle the extra $200 a correct answer would have earned. The clue, in the category Where\u2019s That Church, was \u201cBuilt in the 300s AD, the Church of the Nativity\u201d. After Needle was ruled incorrect, contest Jack McGuire buzzed in with \u201cIsrael\u201d. He was awarded the $200. The prominent political pollster James Zogby was another to weigh in, branding the decision to mark Needle wrong \u201coutrageous\u201d. \u201cIf \u2018Israel\u2019 had been the answer it would have been bad enough,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut the fact that she gave \u2018Palestine\u2019 as the \u2026 answer and was told it was wrong makes it an outrage and an insult to history, reality, the thousands of oppressed Palestinians of Bethlehem.\u201d The Church of the Nativity dates to 325AD and is a recognised world heritage site. Israel has occupied the West Bank, which includes East Jerusalem and Bethlehem, since the Six Day War of 1967, although under a United Nations security council resolution, the international community refuses to accept Israeli sovereignty. Donald Trump fuelled the already fiery dispute by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem in 2018, recognising the city as the capital of Israel. Dozens of Palestinians were killed and 1,200 injured by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip in ensuing protests. Sony Pictures Television, which produces Jeopardy for NBC, did not respond to reporters\u2019 requests for comment. On Sunday evening, the latest posts on the show\u2019s official Twitter feed referred only to the greatest of all time tournament between its three most successful contestants: Ken Jennings, James Holzhauer and Brad Rutter.",

Despite a heavy security presence on the streets of the capital, small protests flared up at several universities in Tehran throughout Sunday against both the shooting down of the Ukraine International Airlines jet last Wednesday and the subsequent days of official denials that an Iranian missile was responsible. \u201cThey tell us the lie that it is America, but our enemy is right here,\u201d a crowd shouted at Tehran\u2019s Shahid Beheshti University, and compared the Revolutionary Guards and their paramilitary allies to Islamic State. \u201cYou\u2019re our Isis,\u201d they said. Footage posted online showed demonstrations taking place in other cities including Tabriz, Shiraz and Kermanshah. As the sun went down, columns of security vans, including some fitted with cages, were seen streaming towards Tehran\u2019s Azadi Square. Several hundred protesters also made their way there, marching through subway stations and along streets, singing revolutionary anthems and chanting, \u201cdeath to the dictator\u201d. Later footage showed flood lights illuminating teargas in the air and protesters wearing cloths across their mouths as they continued to chant anti-regime slogans. \u201cThey fired teargas in the Azadi subway station,\u201d said a man in one clip. \u201cNo one can get out, everybody is getting suffocated.\u201d Another video from Tehran showed a trail of blood on a sidewalk. \u201cI saw seven people shot,\u201d said a male voice holding the camera. \u201cThere is blood everywhere.\u201d The veracity of the footage could not be independently confirmed. The resurgent anti-government protests threaten to tip Iran\u2019s regime into crisis just as it was riding a wave of nationalist sentiment after the killing of top general Qassem Suleimani by a US drone strike on 3 January. Iran\u2019s response \u2013 a carefully calibrated but heavily publicised ballistic missile attack on US forces in Iraq last Wednesday \u2013 was supposed to bring catharsis and demonstrate the regime\u2019s power. Instead, by leading to the shooting down of a passenger jet loaded with Iranian citizens, it has humiliated the military and exposed some of its top leaders as having lied to the country for days until the admission on Saturday morning that an Iranian missile was responsible for the crash. Two state TV hosts resigned in protest over false reporting over the incident and Iranian media outlets joined the outcry, running front-page headlines that read, \u201cAshamed\u201d and \u201cUnbelievable\u201d. Iranian officials on Sunday defended the brief arrest of Macaire, the UK\u2019s envoy to the country, saying he was \u201carrested as [an] unknown foreigner in an illegal gathering\u201d. \u201cWhen police informed me a man\u2019s [been] arrested who claims to be UK amb[assador], I said IMPOSSIBLE!,\u201d wrote Seyed Abbas Araghchi, the deputy foreign minister, on Twitter. \u201cOnly after my phone conversation w[ith] him I identified, out of big surprise, that it\u2019s him. 15 mins later he was free.\u201d Macaire tweeted that he had attended what was advertised as a vigil, left as it began to turn into a protest and was detained half an hour later. The Tasnim news agency, which is linked to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, reported on Sunday that Macaire had been using a shop near the protests as a place of \u201ccoordination\u201d. A few dozen members of the Basij paramilitary group gathered outside the UK embassy calling for its closure. The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, condemned the ambassador\u2019s arrest as a \u201cflagrant violation of international law\u201d and said Iran was marching towards \u201cpariah status\u201d. Donald Trump used the unrest to intensify pressure on the Islamic Republic and declare his support for the demonstrators. \u201cDO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS,\u201d Trump said in a tweet direct at the Iranian government. \u201cThe World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching.\u201d Suffocating US sanctions have sent Iran into deep recession, and a hike in the official price of fuel in November led to the largest protests in the 40-year history of the regime, to which the government responded by walling off Iran\u2019s internet for several days and killing hundreds of demonstrators. On Sunday, in a meeting between Iranian president Hassan Rouhani and the visiting emir of Qatar, both sides agreed de-escalation was the \u201conly solution\u201d to the regional crisis, the emirate\u2019s ruler said. Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani said: \u201cWe agreed ... that the only solution to these crises is de-escalation from everyone and dialogue.\u201d The leaders of the UK, France and Germany on Sunday issued a joint statement calling on Iran to return to full compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and refrain from further violence. \u201cWe urge Iran to reverse all measures inconsistent with the agreement and return to full compliance,\u201d the leaders said in the statement issued by the office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Iran had been complying with the deal until the US unilaterally pulled out in May 2018, imposing the sanctions that had incentivised Tehran to give up its nuclear program. Since then it has gradually walked away from the agreement in incremental steps that reduce the time it would take for the country to develop a nuclear weapon, although it maintains its nuclear research is peaceful. \u201cWe call on Iran to refrain from further violent action or proliferation; and we remain ready to engage with Iran on this agenda in order to preserve the stability of the region,\u201d the joint statement added. The Revolutionary Guards commander, Hossein Salami, said on Sunday his forces were \u201cmore upset than anyone\u201d over the shooting down of the plane, but other officials accused the US and its allies of exploiting the tragedy. \u201cIran\u2019s enemies want to take revenge on the Guards for a military mistake,\u201d said Ali Shirazi, a representative of the Quds force, the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 external arm. The victims of the crash include 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians, 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Germans and three British nationals.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Q</strong> I am thinking about buying a property jointly with my stepdad. He currently owns his own property jointly with my mother. The value is about \u00a3300,000. My mother suffers from dementia and until recently has been cared for by my stepfather, but he is no longer able to cope so it has been recently decided that my mother should move into a care home.</p> <p>My stepfather has been advised to split their joint cash savings so that my mother\u2019s half can be used to pay for her care fees.</p> <p>He is now, understandably, very upset and has decided to sell their joint property so that my mother\u2019s half of the proceeds of the sale can also go towards her care home costs. He plans to use his cash savings of about \u00a3100,000 to buy another home before selling his current one. However, that won\u2019t be enough to buy a suitable property so I have offered to help out with the purchase of a house we have found which has a price of \u00a3137,500.</p> <p>He has transferred his savings to my account so that I can buy the house which he will live in. It would appear that this arrangement is not without pitfalls so we plan to get advice from a solicitor to make sure that no complications arise at a later date.<br><strong>DF</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> There is no need for your stepfather to sell the home he owns with your mother if he plans to carry on living there after your mother has moved into her care home. So before you go ahead with the purchase of the smaller property, your stepfather may want to reconsider his plans. In its factsheet \u201cProperty and paying for residential care\u201d, Age UK makes it very clear that if the spouse or partner of someone who moves permanently into a care home is going to stay living in a jointly-owned home, its value \u201cwill not be counted at all in the means test\u201d (used by a local authority to assess how much someone should contribute to the cost of their care). So rather than going to a solicitor, you might want to get in touch with Age UK Advice (0800 169 6565 or <a href=\"http://www.ageuk.org.uk/\">www.ageuk.org.uk</a>) to get sensible advice on how your mother\u2019s care home costs should be funded. You should also be aware that if your stepfather did decide to downsize, your mother\u2019s share of the sale proceeds of the family home would then have to be included in her mean test or financial assessment by the local authority.</p> <p>If your stepfather wants to go ahead with the purchase of the smaller property you have found, the easiest way to avoid future pitfalls would be for him to buy it in his name with his savings and a loan from you to top them up to the amount necessary to pay the purchase price.

      "bodyText": "Q I am thinking about buying a property jointly with my stepdad. He currently owns his own property jointly with my mother. The value is about \u00a3300,000. My mother suffers from dementia and until recently has been cared for by my stepfather, but he is no longer able to cope so it has been recently decided that my mother should move into a care home. My stepfather has been advised to split their joint cash savings so that my mother\u2019s half can be used to pay for her care fees. He is now, understandably, very upset and has decided to sell their joint property so that my mother\u2019s half of the proceeds of the sale can also go towards her care home costs. He plans to use his cash savings of about \u00a3100,000 to buy another home before selling his current one. However, that won\u2019t be enough to buy a suitable property so I have offered to help out with the purchase of a house we have found which has a price of \u00a3137,500. He has transferred his savings to my account so that I can buy the house which he will live in. It would appear that this arrangement is not without pitfalls so we plan to get advice from a solicitor to make sure that no complications arise at a later date. DF A There is no need for your stepfather to sell the home he owns with your mother if he plans to carry on living there after your mother has moved into her care home. So before you go ahead with the purchase of the smaller property, your stepfather may want to reconsider his plans. In its factsheet \u201cProperty and paying for residential care\u201d, Age UK makes it very clear that if the spouse or partner of someone who moves permanently into a care home is going to stay living in a jointly-owned home, its value \u201cwill not be counted at all in the means test\u201d (used by a local authority to assess how much someone should contribute to the cost of their care). So rather than going to a solicitor, you might want to get in touch with Age UK Advice (0800 169 6565 or www.ageuk.org.uk) to get sensible advice on how your mother\u2019s care home costs should be funded. You should also be aware that if your stepfather did decide to downsize, your mother\u2019s share of the sale proceeds of the family home would then have to be included in her mean test or financial assessment by the local authority. If your stepfather wants to go ahead with the purchase of the smaller property you have found, the easiest way to avoid future pitfalls would be for him to buy it in his name with his savings and a loan from you to top them up to the amount necessary to pay the purchase price. You may also have to stump up the cash to pay the stamp duty land tax (SDLT) bill which will be due if he buys before selling the jointly-owned property. Assuming that you already own property, there would also be an SDLT bill for you if you bought the property in your name. There would also be inheritance tax complications if you went ahead with your original plan.",

It reminds me of who I was at school. My path back then was always \u201cdo what you love and do what you\u2019re good at\u201d. I studied dance because I loved it and sang because I loved it, and my entire education was filled with fond memories because of that, and I was now starting to build that back into my adult life. Although my job is in the creative industry, the day-to-day skills I use are not so I have had to learn the importance of finding time to include creativity in my life. I sing, go to dance classes and make my own Christmas cards. I fear that if these creative outlets stagnate I may relapse and if keeping healthy means doing things I love all the time, I am certainly not going to complain. My anxiety attacks came out of nowhere and, to this day, I am still clueless as to what sets them off. Now, though, I am feeling a lot better. When I am anxious, distraction is key and singing does exactly that. It sends me into autopilot, a state in which my body works without instruction, but with pure passion and joy \u2013 a meditative state. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are weeks when the last thing I want to do after work is go to choir practice and I long to go home to bed. But I go because I know I am guaranteed to come out feeling great. I will leave having loved every second, learned something new and progressed my vocal skills. More importantly, I will have exercised my creativity and held my anxiety at bay. What more could I ask for?",

      "bodyText": "Turkey is gearing up for another turbulent year in both domestic politics and on the world stage as its president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, deploys troops to Libya while fighting off new breakaway parties at home. In an emergency session over the new year break, the Turkish parliament passed a bill authorising the deployment of troops to support Libya\u2019s embattled UN-recognised government, a significant flex of Ankara\u2019s diplomatic and military muscle which risks a major escalation in the complex nine-year-old conflict. So far, just 35 soldiers have been sent in an advisory capacity to Tripoli, Erdo\u011fan said on Sunday. But the Guardian understands as many as 300 Syrian fighters on Turkey\u2019s payroll have also already arrived to prop up Fayez al-Sarraj, Libya\u2019s prime minister, in the face of an ongoing march on the capital from Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar. The bold move from Turkey is motivated by a desire to head off regional rivals Egypt and the UAE in the Libyan proxy war and to defend a recent memorandum of understanding with Sarraj, in which Ankara and Tripoli agreed to carve out drilling rights in the Mediterranean over the objections of Egypt, France and Greece. Unlike last October\u2019s incursion into Kurdish-held parts of Syria, however, intervention in Libya has little support among the Turkish public, adding to the ruling government coalition\u2019s mounting domestic headaches. Both former prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu and former finance minister Ali Babacan have quit Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development party (AKP) in recent months to form their own breakaway opposition parties. Largely as a result of Turkey\u2019s economic woes, in the last year the AKP has lost 10% of its membership, creating a disillusioned new bloc of voters Davuto\u011flu and Babacan hope to court. For the first time, the AKP suffered humiliating defeats in several major cities in the 2019 local elections, and the sense that Erdo\u011fan has begun to lose his magic touch after 17 years in office was compounded by an embarrassing strategic miscalculation to re-run Istanbul\u2019s mayoral race. While Turkey is not supposed to hold a general election until 2023, under the country\u2019s new presidential system opposition party alliances would only need to shave off a few percentage points from the AKP\u2019s coalition with the rightwing Nationalist Movement party (MHP) to destroy the government\u2019s already weakened majority. \u201cThis movement has been growing for a long time, but after the Istanbul rerun was the moment when [the new parties] realised they needed to come out into the open,\u201d said Suat K\u0131n\u0131kl\u0131o\u011flu, a former AKP MP. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of soul-searching in the conservative camp at the moment and it\u2019s great they have started to speak and criticise freely. \u201cWe thought in the past that the Good party [\u0130yi party, formed in 2017] would provide this outlet, but it never gained much traction. \u201cSplinter groups have not emerged in an economic context like this before. It\u2019s difficult to gauge how much effect they will have \u2026 three years is a long time in Turkish politics.\u201d Turkey\u2019s foreign policy ambitions make the future unpredictable. Of late, Erdo\u011fan has taken to shifting public attention away from domestic issues to global ones \u2013 often suggesting the country is locked in an existential struggle with foes such as the US and Kurdish militant groups \u2013 to whip up nationalistic support. Intervention in Libya is likely to be framed as part of the same strategy. It is not clear how the government will deal with the potential new domestic threat. Tactics used in the past to weaken the opposition, such as removing the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic party (HDP) and Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) representatives from office under the pretext of legal or criminal challenges, are likely to intensify, according to Sinem Adar, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. \u201cPersonally, I am not so sure that elections will play a central role in bringing political change because of the increasingly nationalist and expansionist worldview of the ruling regime in Turkey,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see the manifestations of this logic in the military incursions in Syria, the eastern Mediterranean and Libya. From a pessimistic point of view, 2020 might deepen Turkey\u2019s political crisis by shifting towards the deployment of non-constitutional means.\u201d",

It is being billed as a \u201cfamily\u201d meeting. Senior royal aides will attend only if requested. The royals will have read documents in advance outlining the implications of different proposals. The scenarios have been drawn up by officials following consultations, including with representatives of the UK and Canadian governments.</p> \n<p><strong>What are the issues?</strong></p> \n<p>Pinning down exactly how Harry and Meghan see their future \u201cnew progressive\u201d roles. Discussions will include how the couple will divide their time between the UK and North America, and whether they can they retain their HRH titles.</p> \n<p>The central issue will be how they are to be funded, and who will foot their security costs.</p> \n<p>They will remain the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, but retaining their HRH status has risks. They say they will carry out royal duties \u201cas called upon\u201d. As such, they will be representing the Queen and the UK. But they also want to be \u201cfinancially independent\u201d and able to earn an income. One pitfall is a risk of conflict between their royal and charitable roles and any commercial interests. Potentially, it leaves them open to accusations of cashing in on their royal status, or of tarnishing the royal brand.</p> \n<p><strong>What does the Queen want?</strong></p> \n<p>First and foremost, she wants real progress to be made on Monday. Officials have been asked to work \u201cat pace\u201d. She wants a plan within days. She and other senior royals will want to keep the couple within the institution as far as is possible, but she will want them to feel that they have been given real and proper opportunity to explore a new way of working, and not feel pressured into something they do not want.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c2b8a51c-cb3d-41e7-bb79-1d9a091d0c28\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d2Q5bXvEgMg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>What exactly do Harry and Meghan want?</strong></p> \n<p>Their <a href=\"https://sussexroyal.com/\">new website</a> is scant on detail.

Primarily, they want the ability to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/11/prince-harry-meghan-face-potential-fight-protect-sussex-royal-brand\">earn an income</a> unfettered by royal constraints. They want to give up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/how-harry-and-meghan-may-start-cutting-the-royal-purse-strings\">sovereign grant money</a>, which is about 5% of their present expenditure excluding security and official overseas travel. The rest is met by Charles, through his Duchy of Cornwall income. One issue will be how much Charles is prepared to pay as the couple transition to becoming \u201cfinancially independent\u201d.</p> \n<p><strong>Is there a middle way?</strong></p> \n<p>A Commonwealth role could be a compromise, releasing them from the day-to-day grind of the royal diary, yet allowing them to live overseas and perform on a global stage. Harry is already president of the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Trust and Meghan is vice-president.</p> \n<p>Canada, which appears to be their chosen destination, is a realm, with the Queen as head of state. There may be a way of engineering a hybrid royal role. The head of the civil service, Sir Mark Sedwill, is understood to have been exploring the potential of a Commonwealth role.</p>",

It is being billed as a \u201cfamily\u201d meeting. Senior royal aides will attend only if requested. The royals will have read documents in advance outlining the implications of different proposals. The scenarios have been drawn up by officials following consultations, including with representatives of the UK and Canadian governments. What are the issues? Pinning down exactly how Harry and Meghan see their future \u201cnew progressive\u201d roles. Discussions will include how the couple will divide their time between the UK and North America, and whether they can they retain their HRH titles. The central issue will be how they are to be funded, and who will foot their security costs. They will remain the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, but retaining their HRH status has risks. They say they will carry out royal duties \u201cas called upon\u201d. As such, they will be representing the Queen and the UK. But they also want to be \u201cfinancially independent\u201d and able to earn an income. One pitfall is a risk of conflict between their royal and charitable roles and any commercial interests. Potentially, it leaves them open to accusations of cashing in on their royal status, or of tarnishing the royal brand. What does the Queen want? First and foremost, she wants real progress to be made on Monday. Officials have been asked to work \u201cat pace\u201d. She wants a plan within days. She and other senior royals will want to keep the couple within the institution as far as is possible, but she will want them to feel that they have been given real and proper opportunity to explore a new way of working, and not feel pressured into something they do not want. What exactly do Harry and Meghan want? Their new website is scant on detail. They have expressed their intent to \u201cstep back\u201d, but to continue with charitable work, and to support the Queen when asked. Primarily, they want the ability to earn an income unfettered by royal constraints. They want to give up the sovereign grant money, which is about 5% of their present expenditure excluding security and official overseas travel. The rest is met by Charles, through his Duchy of Cornwall income. One issue will be how much Charles is prepared to pay as the couple transition to becoming \u201cfinancially independent\u201d. Is there a middle way? A Commonwealth role could be a compromise, releasing them from the day-to-day grind of the royal diary, yet allowing them to live overseas and perform on a global stage. Harry is already president of the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Trust and Meghan is vice-president. Canada, which appears to be their chosen destination, is a realm, with the Queen as head of state. There may be a way of engineering a hybrid royal role. The head of the civil service, Sir Mark Sedwill, is understood to have been exploring the potential of a Commonwealth role.",

      "body": "<p>Confronted by climate breakdown, the extinction crisis and rising inequalities, it is easy to feel anxious and hopeless. I feel those things, but in recent months I\u2019ve also been heartened by a surge of grassroots action, of diverse people responding in myriad ways to multiplying crises. To call it an ecosystem of resistance would be overly dramatic, but it is a flowering of good deeds and positive care for local neighbourhoods.</p> <p>In my blue corner of conservative Norfolk, traditionally slow to adopt national trends, I\u2019ve encountered all kinds of inspiring work. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/28/when-did-we-become-this-cruel-poverty-looms-large-for-norwich-voters\" title=\"\">Norwich Soup Movement </a>is one of four women-led volunteer groups providing hot suppers for the homeless every day of the week. <a href=\"https://eveshillvegco.com/\" title=\"\">Eves Hill Veg Co</a> is a community market garden (again women-led), which trains people in horticulture and grows healthy fruit and veg for local people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/23/muddy-kids-learn-best-outdoor-learning-children-mainstream\" title=\"\">Dandelion Education</a> is an outdoor nursery and forest school with an enlightened focus on improving youth mental health, run by two brilliant former teachers. The <a href=\"https://www.felbecktrust.org.uk/\">Felbeck Trust</a> is one of scores of new micro-local conservation groups seeking to restore wildlife.</p> <p>This explosion of local kindness is clearly a response to a need and a failure \u2013 of political institutions and mainstream charities to provide the basic building blocks of a good life. But does it have theoretical underpinnings? Are there books inspiring this new localism? </p> <p>Hannah Claxton, who quit her glamorous job in Damon Albarn\u2019s management team to set up Eves Hill Veg Co \u2013 on land donated by a local farmer \u2013 cites Raj Patel\u2019s book about the \u201cworld food system\u201d, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/15/healthmindandbody.health\" title=\"\">Stuffed and Starved</a></em>, as a \u201cmassive influence\u201d on her community garden. It is \u201cthe book I recommend to anyone trying to join up the dots about changing the way our food is grown and sold\u201d, she says. Claxton\u2019s project is also shaped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/01/how-economic-growth-has-become-anti-life\" title=\"\">Vandana Shiva</a>\u2019s work in India and her books, such as <em>Soil Not Oil</em>, which demonstrate the importance of women working together. \u201cOther books have described these ideas well,\u201d Claxton says; \u201cbut those two stand out as making me believe: \u2018Yes, this is what I need to do.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Claxton is in the vanguard of a market garden renaissance that is one response to the realisation that carbon-intensive industrial food production is bad for both consumers and producers. Another radical change is stirring larger landowners. The intensively farmed British countryside is set to be transformed more drastically than at any time since the 1970s: Brexit and the slashing of agricultural subsidies could bankrupt many farms.</p> <p>In Norfolk, two estates, Ken Hill and Somerleyton, are rewilding significant tracts of their land. They have been influenced by the unlikely 2018 bestseller <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/28/wilding-isabella-tree-review-farm-return-nature\" title=\"\">Wilding</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/28/wilding-isabella-tree-review-farm-return-nature\" title=\"\"> by Isabella Tree.</a> Few expected the story of a wealthy couple who inherited a 3,500-acre estate in Sussex to be the biggest nature writing success of the past 18 months, but <em>Wilding</em> has sold more than 150,000 copies and spawned a movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8607ebb6293d68af32496d658d8d20776e002ea9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8607ebb6293d68af32496d658d8d20776e002ea9/0_1119_4507_5633/800.jpg\" alt=\"Isabella Tree.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It just hit the moment\u2019 ... Isabella Tree.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Cullen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been completely amazed,\u201d Tree says from her study at Knepp, the farm that she and her husband, Charlie Burrell, have radically transformed. \u201cIf I\u2019d published this book six years ago, I don\u2019t think it would have done anything. It just hit the moment.\u201d</p> <p><em>Wilding</em> tells of the collapse of their conventional mixed dairy farm, and how they auctioned off their farm machinery, rewilded their land and accidentally discovered a new model of farming. Nineteen years on, Knepp is challenging concepts from three millennia of farming such as \u201chedgerow\u201d, \u201cfield\u201d and \u201cweed\u201d, as well as conservation orthodoxies that we must \u201cmanage\u201d land to help certain species. It is a profitable farm that also features an abundance of wildlife, including new (returned) species such as storks and beavers and rarities that are vanishing from everywhere else \u2013 from turtle doves to nightingales.</p> <p>Tree is now inundated with requests for help and talks. Knepp hosted 2,000 people on special \u201csafaris\u201d in 2017; this year it will host 6,000; 31 farmers from the area around Knepp have signed up to join a neighbourhood \u201ccluster group\u201d to improve the wider landscape for nature. \u201cThe loveliest thing is that they are all responding to that message of hope. There\u2019s so much eco-gloom out there, the feeling that we can actually turn things around is what people are grabbing on to \u2026 Great white egret flying over!\u201d Tree interrupts herself, as she spots one of Knepp\u2019s latest exciting arrivals.</p> <p>The first question she is always asked is a practical one: how can I rewild my land/garden/backyard? Tree thinks wilding can occur in tiny settings with the right interventions, and recommends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/28/the-garden-jungle-dave-goulson-review\" title=\"\">Dave Goulson\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/28/the-garden-jungle-dave-goulson-review\" title=\"\">The Jungle Garden</a></em>. She is now writing <em>The Wilding Handbook</em> to provide practical advice for everyone from big landowners to window-box owners.</p> <p>Nature writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/26/our-place-by-mark-cocker-review\" title=\"\">Mark Cocker </a>believes that Tree has started a movement. \u201cGrassroots activism is breaking out beyond the confines of the establishment and it\u2019s possible that <em>Wilding</em> is the one book that has catalysed it.\u201d His own book, <em>Our Place</em>, published in 2018, tells the history of British conservation in the 20th century and ends with a powerful list of hard truths that society must confront if nature\u2019s decline is to be reversed.</p> <p>Cocker is interested in what the plethora of new micro-local conservation groups reveals about mainstream conservation charities, many of which he thinks are now \u201cirrelevant\u201d to ordinary people who \u201cactually want to be more emotionally identified with the action that takes place\u201d. Charities such as the National Trust and the RSPB are \u201ctrapped by the size of their membership\u201d, which makes them cautious. Even so, he believes they are still \u201cvery important because they are repositories for cumulative wisdom \u2013 they provide jobs and an outlet for members. They are channelling money in all the right directions but in terms of the needs of the moment, it\u2019s a 16-year-old girl sitting outside her school in Sweden who is making the weather.\u201d</p> <p>Neighbourhood conservation efforts other than the remarkable rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion </a>are often driven by volunteers who Cocker believes aren\u2019t prepared to think globally or act \u201cpolitically\u201d. \u201cThey are very happy to act locally, but they fall away the moment anyone makes noises beyond the parapet of their village boundaries,\u201d he says. Localism\u2019s big challenge is to unite and form part of a global effort, he argues. Cocker wants the vast but disparate British environmental movement to come together in a \u201ccouncil of nature\u201d, which could apply proper pressure to central government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"241b92a87ce454060e267afbff5b6d4ae8669203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/241b92a87ce454060e267afbff5b6d4ae8669203/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beavers are returning to English rivers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beavers are returning to English rivers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Symes/Devon Wildlife Trust/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Rob Hopkins, the co-founder of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/15/transition-towns-way-forward\" title=\"\">Transition Network</a>, meaningful change is now most likely not at the centre but through local government. The Transition movement began in Hopkins\u2019s home town of Totnes, Devon, in 2006, when people began sharing ideas of how to move from a carbon-based economy to a healthier, more sustainable community. Community change often begins with food. \u201cYou don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission around food. It\u2019s not expensive. You just need people, tools and a deadline,\u201d Hopkins says. In Totnes, \u201cit\u2019s been a fairly lonely furrow for a long time. Finally the surrounding world is starting to catch up a little bit.\u201d Now that 245 local authorities across the UK have declared a climate emergency, which requires tough new carbon-reduction targets, councils will require the practical ideas of the Transition movement.</p> <p>When we are told we must cut carbon emissions by 80%, \u201cWhere\u2019s the story in that? Where\u2019s the \u2018I have a dream\u2019 in that? What would that smell like?\u201d Hopkins asks. \u201cWhat communities can do so powerfully is to tell stories.\u201d His new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/16/london-sustainable-environmentalist-tooting-pop-up\" title=\"\">From What Is to What If</a></em>, offers many inspiring stories of practical action, from the National Park City movement to the Bristol streets that have banned cars to allow children to play. Hopkins argues that we are \u201cfrogs in the boiling pan of imaginative decline\u201d and we can and must leap free. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jun/04/iraq.samjones\" title=\"\">Paolo Lugari</a>, the founder of a Colombian experiment in sustainable living, put it: \u201cWe are not confronting an energy crisis, but one of imagination and enthusiasm.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are social creatures living in a time that is trying to stop us from being that</p> <footer> <cite>Rob Hopkins</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In France, some local mayors have already instituted radical neighbourhood changes. The former mayor of impoverished Grande-Synthe near Dunkirk made all public transport free, created allotments around apartment blocks, and passed on to the poor savings made from converting to low-energy street lights. In Ungersheim in Alsace, the mayor Jean-Claud Mensch created a community solar farm, made all school food organic and created market gardens to grow that food. \u201cThis is a win- win-win-win-win,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this happen everywhere? It\u2019s good for everything \u2013 physical and mental health, schooling, the local economy, the neighbourhood. There is so much waiting to happen, if you can just get beyond these \u2018yes, buts\u2019 all the time.\u201d</p> <p>There are two obvious \u201cyes, buts\u201d about burgeoning localism. One is that if individuals devote all their energies to parochial concerns they won\u2019t bring about national or international political change. If we do good deeds in our market garden or forest school, we\u2019re not demanding systemic change: we\u2019re letting Boris Johnson\u2019s government get away with it. Another fear is that local action simply fulfils David Cameron\u2019s vision of a \u201cbig society\u201d, proving governments don\u2019t have to provide essential local services or even a safety net; instead we have the survival of the fittest communities.</p> <p>Hopkins argues that people don\u2019t choose between community action or wider political activism. Lots of Transition Totnes folk have joined Extinction Rebellion; the energy, he says, flows back and forth. \u201cWe really resisted the \u2018big society\u2019 quite vehemently. We can\u2019t do business as usual and expect local people to run libraries. It\u2019s not about communities doing things that governments should be doing. Transition groups really change the narrative about what\u2019s possible, and do stuff governments could not do, wouldn\u2019t imagine doing, wouldn\u2019t dream of doing.\u201d</p> <p>I have discovered through my own volunteering for a couple of forest schools that the best way to chase away anxiety and despair is to do something positive locally with other people \u2013 something that isn\u2019t driven by money. As Hopkins says: \u201cI\u2019ve never been anywhere where anybody has said: \u2018I was doing all right until I got involved in this Transition stuff,\u2019 or: \u2018I was doing all right until I learned to grow my own food.\u2019 We are social creatures living in a time that is trying to stop us from being that. There\u2019s something good for the heart about being involved in projects with other people.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Patrick Barkham\u2019s Wild Child, about children, nature and volunteering in forest schools, </em><em>will be published by Granta in May.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Confronted by climate breakdown, the extinction crisis and rising inequalities, it is easy to feel anxious and hopeless. I feel those things, but in recent months I\u2019ve also been heartened by a surge of grassroots action, of diverse people responding in myriad ways to multiplying crises. To call it an ecosystem of resistance would be overly dramatic, but it is a flowering of good deeds and positive care for local neighbourhoods. In my blue corner of conservative Norfolk, traditionally slow to adopt national trends, I\u2019ve encountered all kinds of inspiring work. The Norwich Soup Movement is one of four women-led volunteer groups providing hot suppers for the homeless every day of the week. Eves Hill Veg Co is a community market garden (again women-led), which trains people in horticulture and grows healthy fruit and veg for local people. Dandelion Education is an outdoor nursery and forest school with an enlightened focus on improving youth mental health, run by two brilliant former teachers. The Felbeck Trust is one of scores of new micro-local conservation groups seeking to restore wildlife. This explosion of local kindness is clearly a response to a need and a failure \u2013 of political institutions and mainstream charities to provide the basic building blocks of a good life. But does it have theoretical underpinnings? Are there books inspiring this new localism? Hannah Claxton, who quit her glamorous job in Damon Albarn\u2019s management team to set up Eves Hill Veg Co \u2013 on land donated by a local farmer \u2013 cites Raj Patel\u2019s book about the \u201cworld food system\u201d, Stuffed and Starved, as a \u201cmassive influence\u201d on her community garden. It is \u201cthe book I recommend to anyone trying to join up the dots about changing the way our food is grown and sold\u201d, she says. Claxton\u2019s project is also shaped by Vandana Shiva\u2019s work in India and her books, such as Soil Not Oil, which demonstrate the importance of women working together. \u201cOther books have described these ideas well,\u201d Claxton says; \u201cbut those two stand out as making me believe: \u2018Yes, this is what I need to do.\u2019\u201d Claxton is in the vanguard of a market garden renaissance that is one response to the realisation that carbon-intensive industrial food production is bad for both consumers and producers. Another radical change is stirring larger landowners. The intensively farmed British countryside is set to be transformed more drastically than at any time since the 1970s: Brexit and the slashing of agricultural subsidies could bankrupt many farms. In Norfolk, two estates, Ken Hill and Somerleyton, are rewilding significant tracts of their land. They have been influenced by the unlikely 2018 bestseller Wilding by Isabella Tree. Few expected the story of a wealthy couple who inherited a 3,500-acre estate in Sussex to be the biggest nature writing success of the past 18 months, but Wilding has sold more than 150,000 copies and spawned a movement. \u201cI\u2019ve been completely amazed,\u201d Tree says from her study at Knepp, the farm that she and her husband, Charlie Burrell, have radically transformed. \u201cIf I\u2019d published this book six years ago, I don\u2019t think it would have done anything. It just hit the moment.\u201d Wilding tells of the collapse of their conventional mixed dairy farm, and how they auctioned off their farm machinery, rewilded their land and accidentally discovered a new model of farming. Nineteen years on, Knepp is challenging concepts from three millennia of farming such as \u201chedgerow\u201d, \u201cfield\u201d and \u201cweed\u201d, as well as conservation orthodoxies that we must \u201cmanage\u201d land to help certain species. It is a profitable farm that also features an abundance of wildlife, including new (returned) species such as storks and beavers and rarities that are vanishing from everywhere else \u2013 from turtle doves to nightingales. Tree is now inundated with requests for help and talks. Knepp hosted 2,000 people on special \u201csafaris\u201d in 2017; this year it will host 6,000; 31 farmers from the area around Knepp have signed up to join a neighbourhood \u201ccluster group\u201d to improve the wider landscape for nature. \u201cThe loveliest thing is that they are all responding to that message of hope. There\u2019s so much eco-gloom out there, the feeling that we can actually turn things around is what people are grabbing on to \u2026 Great white egret flying over!\u201d Tree interrupts herself, as she spots one of Knepp\u2019s latest exciting arrivals. The first question she is always asked is a practical one: how can I rewild my land/garden/backyard? Tree thinks wilding can occur in tiny settings with the right interventions, and recommends Dave Goulson\u2019s The Jungle Garden. She is now writing The Wilding Handbook to provide practical advice for everyone from big landowners to window-box owners. Nature writer Mark Cocker believes that Tree has started a movement. \u201cGrassroots activism is breaking out beyond the confines of the establishment and it\u2019s possible that Wilding is the one book that has catalysed it.\u201d His own book, Our Place, published in 2018, tells the history of British conservation in the 20th century and ends with a powerful list of hard truths that society must confront if nature\u2019s decline is to be reversed. Cocker is interested in what the plethora of new micro-local conservation groups reveals about mainstream conservation charities, many of which he thinks are now \u201cirrelevant\u201d to ordinary people who \u201cactually want to be more emotionally identified with the action that takes place\u201d. Charities such as the National Trust and the RSPB are \u201ctrapped by the size of their membership\u201d, which makes them cautious. Even so, he believes they are still \u201cvery important because they are repositories for cumulative wisdom \u2013 they provide jobs and an outlet for members. They are channelling money in all the right directions but in terms of the needs of the moment, it\u2019s a 16-year-old girl sitting outside her school in Sweden who is making the weather.\u201d Neighbourhood conservation efforts other than the remarkable rise of Extinction Rebellion are often driven by volunteers who Cocker believes aren\u2019t prepared to think globally or act \u201cpolitically\u201d. \u201cThey are very happy to act locally, but they fall away the moment anyone makes noises beyond the parapet of their village boundaries,\u201d he says. Localism\u2019s big challenge is to unite and form part of a global effort, he argues. Cocker wants the vast but disparate British environmental movement to come together in a \u201ccouncil of nature\u201d, which could apply proper pressure to central government. For Rob Hopkins, the co-founder of the Transition Network, meaningful change is now most likely not at the centre but through local government. The Transition movement began in Hopkins\u2019s home town of Totnes, Devon, in 2006, when people began sharing ideas of how to move from a carbon-based economy to a healthier, more sustainable community. Community change often begins with food. \u201cYou don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission around food. It\u2019s not expensive. You just need people, tools and a deadline,\u201d Hopkins says. In Totnes, \u201cit\u2019s been a fairly lonely furrow for a long time. Finally the surrounding world is starting to catch up a little bit.\u201d Now that 245 local authorities across the UK have declared a climate emergency, which requires tough new carbon-reduction targets, councils will require the practical ideas of the Transition movement. When we are told we must cut carbon emissions by 80%, \u201cWhere\u2019s the story in that? Where\u2019s the \u2018I have a dream\u2019 in that? What would that smell like?\u201d Hopkins asks. \u201cWhat communities can do so powerfully is to tell stories.\u201d His new book, From What Is to What If, offers many inspiring stories of practical action, from the National Park City movement to the Bristol streets that have banned cars to allow children to play. Hopkins argues that we are \u201cfrogs in the boiling pan of imaginative decline\u201d and we can and must leap free. As Paolo Lugari, the founder of a Colombian experiment in sustainable living, put it: \u201cWe are not confronting an energy crisis, but one of imagination and enthusiasm.\u201d In France, some local mayors have already instituted radical neighbourhood changes. The former mayor of impoverished Grande-Synthe near Dunkirk made all public transport free, created allotments around apartment blocks, and passed on to the poor savings made from converting to low-energy street lights. In Ungersheim in Alsace, the mayor Jean-Claud Mensch created a community solar farm, made all school food organic and created market gardens to grow that food. \u201cThis is a win- win-win-win-win,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this happen everywhere? It\u2019s good for everything \u2013 physical and mental health, schooling, the local economy, the neighbourhood. There is so much waiting to happen, if you can just get beyond these \u2018yes, buts\u2019 all the time.\u201d There are two obvious \u201cyes, buts\u201d about burgeoning localism. One is that if individuals devote all their energies to parochial concerns they won\u2019t bring about national or international political change.

      "body": "<p>With each passing year, the opening of new air routes reshapes our mental map of Europe. Once-favoured way stations on rail and ferry itineraries from England to the Alps have slipped from visibility. Areas on the near continent previously feted by English artists and writers are now bypassed. Where in the past an Italian grand tour might have included a few nights along the way in the Moselle or Rhine valleys, today\u2019s travellers jet directly to their main destination. As recently as the 1960s, many travellers to Savoy might have stopped en route in the Jura (straddling the French-Swiss border), and the Vosges region to its north was a popular stepping stone en route to the Black Forest.</p> <p>But the rail routes of yesteryear are still there: across Europe myriad small towns, often distant from the smaller airports that serve budget airlines, make perfect short-break destinations for those inclined to take the train.</p> <p>The launch this month of a new<a href=\"https://www.interrail.eu/en/interrail-passes/global-pass\" title=\"\"> four-day Interrail pass</a> (valid for any four days within a one-month period) gives the opportunity to break the journey on both the outbound and homebound legs. And with prices starting from \u20ac185 in second class and \u20ac246 in first (for 12-27-year-olds), it\u2019s easy to plan outward and return journeys on different routes, thereby making the journey itself as important as the destination.</p> <p>Here are three rail trip ideas worth considering in 2020.</p> <h2><strong>A taste of Burgundy</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0ccb3970afb1e01bfc997f0e5bfddea5bdc0cc7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ccb3970afb1e01bfc997f0e5bfddea5bdc0cc7f/0_0_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"vineyards in Savigny les Beaune, near Beaune.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grape outdoors \u2026 vineyards in Savigny les Beaune, near Beaune.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Massimo Santi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trains still stop a the villages of <a href=\"https://www.thetrainline.com/en/train-times/gevrey-chambertin-to-meursault\" title=\"\">Gevrey-Chambertin and Meursault</a>, as they have done every day since this stretch of the classic line from Paris to the French Riviera opened in 1849. These days it is mainly locals and dedicated wine lovers who use this line, where the station names sound like a roll call of great Burgundy wines: Gevrey-Chambertin, Vougeot, Nuits-Saints-Georges, Beaune, Meursault and Rully. And in all these places it is just a short step from the platform to the vineyards.</p> <p>Those in the know opt for Beaune as a base. The striking walled town claims to be the wine capital of Burgundy, but lovers of the region\u2019s crisp white chardonnay or silky pinot noir often regard Beaune as the wine capital of the world. There is a clutch of fine hotels in the town centre, with <a href=\"http://www.hotel-cep-beaune.com/fr/\" title=\"\">H\u00f4tel Le Cep</a> (doubles from \u20ac169 room-only) offering enough creature comforts and fine wines to satisfy the most fastidious oenophile. Try the set lunch in the hotel\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurant (\u20ac28 for two courses).</p> <p>But the beauty of Beaune is that you don\u2019t need to spend that sort of money. On my last visit, in November, I stayed at the modestly priced but very comfortable <a href=\"http://hoteldefrance-beaune.com/\" title=\"\">H\u00f4tel de France </a>(doubles from \u20ac55.80) right by the railway station, whose restaurant, Le Tast\u2019Vin, offers good, unpretentious fare (two-course lunch \u20ac16).</p> <p>Beaune is eminently walkable. The town centre, a 15-minute stroll from the station, has more boutique businesses devoted to wine than one town really deserves. Thomas Javouhey and his team at <a href=\"https://domainedesvins.pagesperso-orange.fr/\" title=\"\">Domaine des Vins</a> will guide visitors through the essence of Burgundy with small tasting measures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d42f106bc62bf4e50d1350da44cd5e78fc3a3ac3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d42f106bc62bf4e50d1350da44cd5e78fc3a3ac3/0_366_5600_3360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beaune, the region\u2019s wine capital, seen from its basilica \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beaune, the region\u2019s wine capital, seen from its basilica.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luciano Mortula/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.beaune-tourism.com/discover/hospices-de-beaune-wine-auction\" title=\"\">Hospices de Beaune</a>, a former charitable hospital, is considered one of the finest examples of French 15th-century architecture. It is also one of the largest vineyard owners in the region, and every November hosts a three-day festival celebrating the food and wines of Burgundy to coincide with its annual wine auction, run by Christie\u2019s. It also houses the extraordinarily beautiful Last Judgment altarpiece, painted in around 1445-1450 by Rogier van der Weyden.</p> <p>In the Saturday market flanking the Hospices, stalls overflow with local produce, including \u00c9poisses and Saint-Florentin cheeses, Bresse chickens, <em>jambon persill\u00e9</em> (jellied ham with parsley) and <em>torte beaunoise</em> (Beaune pork pie).</p> <p>From Beaune, it\u2019s an easy cycle on quiet roads to Auxey-Duresses, passing (and sampling) the wines of Pommard, Volnay and Monthelie along the way. Or you can push out further and explore the 60km <a href=\"https://www.beaune-tourism.com/discover/burgundy-wines/visit-wineries-and-vineyards-of-burgundy-near-beaune/the-route-des-grands-crus\" title=\"\">Route des Grands Crus</a>.</p> <p>Those travelling on an Interrail pass could make a day trip by train to Nevers in the Loire Valley, just two hours away on a direct regional service from Beaune. Nevers is a historic town known for its long tradition of fine fa\u00efence porcelain manufacture. It\u2019s one of those unsung places that are instantly appealing, with a gothic/romanesque cathedral and an imposing ducal palace.</p> <p>From here there\u2019s a direct train back to Paris \u2013 on the Ligne du Bourbonnais, which is another splendid provincial route, with its own feast of vineyards. The line runs through the chalky vineyards where Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 is produced, with fine views over to Sancerre on the other bank of the Loire.</p> <p><strong>Train </strong><strong>details</strong> Beaune is about six hours by train from London with one change in Paris (Gare du Nord to Gare de Bercy, where trains for Beaune depart). Return fares start at about \u00a3120 with <a href=\"https://raileurope.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Rail Europe</a>; or use a four-day Interrail pass (supplements for Eurostar travel). A good plan is an overnight stop in Paris, a few days in Beaune then, on the morning of departure, make the detour to Nevers, spending the rest of that day exploring there, returning from Nevers to London, via Paris, the following day.</p> <h2><strong>North Sea breezes</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c2d112395d4738af9fe8b8776c74fed49e7872e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c2d112395d4738af9fe8b8776c74fed49e7872e/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Middelburg, with canals and period houses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t pass the port \u2026 the Dutch city of Middelburg, with canals accessed from the sea via locks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Steinmetz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For decades, the natural route to the Netherlands for Londoners was by paddle steamer from Queenborough, on the Isle of Sheppey in north Kent, to Vlissingen on the Dutch coast, which the British invariably referred to as Flushing. From there, the usual first stop was Middelburg, just four miles inland. Generations of British travellers, clutching their Baedeker or Murray guidebooks, used to stop overnight in Middelburg, but with the demise of the Flushing ferry in 1989, Middelburg slipped from the English horizon.</p> <p>Yet Middelburg is as lovely as ever and makes a perfect introduction to the Netherlands. This Zeeland town on the North Sea feels a long way from the big Dutch cities. Rotterdam is two hours away by train; Amsterdam is three. It\u2019s hard to credit these days, but Middelburg was once a global force in maritime trade, and during the Renaissance was a European leader in the development of optical and maritime instruments: the telescope was invented here.</p> <p>Middelburg\u2019s maritime and fashion history can be explored at the <a href=\"https://www.zeeuwsmuseum.nl/en?set_language=en&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjNLo5d_k5gIVirTtCh3O7Q5iEAAYASAAEgJ1qPD_BwE\" title=\"\">Zeeuws museum</a> before relaxing over a beer at <a href=\"http://www.biercafemiddelburg.nl/\" title=\"\">De Vliegende Hollander</a> on leafy Damplein square.

My top tip for an unusual trip is Mariazell, in a soft, forested landscape where the Alps dip towards the Danube valley. Mariazell is three hours by train from the nearest airport (Vienna), so the town has never figured on major tourist routes. It has, however, held a special appeal in Catholic Europe since a 12th-century monk built a shrine (<em>zell</em>) on the spot where a rock miraculously broke apart. A steady stream of pilgrims, many arriving on foot clutching rosary beads, come every year to experience the peculiar devotional energy of this town in the Austrian hills.</p> <p>The final leg to Mariazell is along a narrow-gauge line from the town of Sankt P\u00f6lten.

      "bodyText": "With each passing year, the opening of new air routes reshapes our mental map of Europe. Once-favoured way stations on rail and ferry itineraries from England to the Alps have slipped from visibility. Areas on the near continent previously feted by English artists and writers are now bypassed. Where in the past an Italian grand tour might have included a few nights along the way in the Moselle or Rhine valleys, today\u2019s travellers jet directly to their main destination. As recently as the 1960s, many travellers to Savoy might have stopped en route in the Jura (straddling the French-Swiss border), and the Vosges region to its north was a popular stepping stone en route to the Black Forest. But the rail routes of yesteryear are still there: across Europe myriad small towns, often distant from the smaller airports that serve budget airlines, make perfect short-break destinations for those inclined to take the train. The launch this month of a new four-day Interrail pass (valid for any four days within a one-month period) gives the opportunity to break the journey on both the outbound and homebound legs. And with prices starting from \u20ac185 in second class and \u20ac246 in first (for 12-27-year-olds), it\u2019s easy to plan outward and return journeys on different routes, thereby making the journey itself as important as the destination. Here are three rail trip ideas worth considering in 2020. A taste of Burgundy Trains still stop a the villages of Gevrey-Chambertin and Meursault, as they have done every day since this stretch of the classic line from Paris to the French Riviera opened in 1849. These days it is mainly locals and dedicated wine lovers who use this line, where the station names sound like a roll call of great Burgundy wines: Gevrey-Chambertin, Vougeot, Nuits-Saints-Georges, Beaune, Meursault and Rully. And in all these places it is just a short step from the platform to the vineyards. Those in the know opt for Beaune as a base. The striking walled town claims to be the wine capital of Burgundy, but lovers of the region\u2019s crisp white chardonnay or silky pinot noir often regard Beaune as the wine capital of the world. There is a clutch of fine hotels in the town centre, with H\u00f4tel Le Cep (doubles from \u20ac169 room-only) offering enough creature comforts and fine wines to satisfy the most fastidious oenophile. Try the set lunch in the hotel\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurant (\u20ac28 for two courses). But the beauty of Beaune is that you don\u2019t need to spend that sort of money. On my last visit, in November, I stayed at the modestly priced but very comfortable H\u00f4tel de France (doubles from \u20ac55.80) right by the railway station, whose restaurant, Le Tast\u2019Vin, offers good, unpretentious fare (two-course lunch \u20ac16). Beaune is eminently walkable. The town centre, a 15-minute stroll from the station, has more boutique businesses devoted to wine than one town really deserves. Thomas Javouhey and his team at Domaine des Vins will guide visitors through the essence of Burgundy with small tasting measures. The Hospices de Beaune, a former charitable hospital, is considered one of the finest examples of French 15th-century architecture. It is also one of the largest vineyard owners in the region, and every November hosts a three-day festival celebrating the food and wines of Burgundy to coincide with its annual wine auction, run by Christie\u2019s. It also houses the extraordinarily beautiful Last Judgment altarpiece, painted in around 1445-1450 by Rogier van der Weyden. In the Saturday market flanking the Hospices, stalls overflow with local produce, including \u00c9poisses and Saint-Florentin cheeses, Bresse chickens, jambon persill\u00e9 (jellied ham with parsley) and torte beaunoise (Beaune pork pie). From Beaune, it\u2019s an easy cycle on quiet roads to Auxey-Duresses, passing (and sampling) the wines of Pommard, Volnay and Monthelie along the way. Or you can push out further and explore the 60km Route des Grands Crus. Those travelling on an Interrail pass could make a day trip by train to Nevers in the Loire Valley, just two hours away on a direct regional service from Beaune. Nevers is a historic town known for its long tradition of fine fa\u00efence porcelain manufacture. It\u2019s one of those unsung places that are instantly appealing, with a gothic/romanesque cathedral and an imposing ducal palace. From here there\u2019s a direct train back to Paris \u2013 on the Ligne du Bourbonnais, which is another splendid provincial route, with its own feast of vineyards. The line runs through the chalky vineyards where Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 is produced, with fine views over to Sancerre on the other bank of the Loire. Train details Beaune is about six hours by train from London with one change in Paris (Gare du Nord to Gare de Bercy, where trains for Beaune depart). Return fares start at about \u00a3120 with Rail Europe; or use a four-day Interrail pass (supplements for Eurostar travel). A good plan is an overnight stop in Paris, a few days in Beaune then, on the morning of departure, make the detour to Nevers, spending the rest of that day exploring there, returning from Nevers to London, via Paris, the following day. North Sea breezes For decades, the natural route to the Netherlands for Londoners was by paddle steamer from Queenborough, on the Isle of Sheppey in north Kent, to Vlissingen on the Dutch coast, which the British invariably referred to as Flushing. From there, the usual first stop was Middelburg, just four miles inland. Generations of British travellers, clutching their Baedeker or Murray guidebooks, used to stop overnight in Middelburg, but with the demise of the Flushing ferry in 1989, Middelburg slipped from the English horizon. Yet Middelburg is as lovely as ever and makes a perfect introduction to the Netherlands. This Zeeland town on the North Sea feels a long way from the big Dutch cities. Rotterdam is two hours away by train; Amsterdam is three. It\u2019s hard to credit these days, but Middelburg was once a global force in maritime trade, and during the Renaissance was a European leader in the development of optical and maritime instruments: the telescope was invented here. Middelburg\u2019s maritime and fashion history can be explored at the Zeeuws museum before relaxing over a beer at De Vliegende Hollander on leafy Damplein square. The best rooms and food are at new boutique hotel and brasserie Franklin (doubles from \u20ac105 room-only) in a gorgeous 18th-century building on the pedestrianised Vlasmarkt. Middelburg is perfect for just wandering and enjoying cobbled streets and cosy cafes, but it\u2019s also worth venturing out of town to see the windy surroundings. There are sea views aplenty of course, but the wind can be trying, so it\u2019s no surprise that low-slung recumbent bicycles are very popular here. Bikes can be rented in town and it\u2019s an easy pedal out on the well-signed cycleway to seaside Domburg and the remarkable dyke route along the coast to Westkapelle, where the fish soup at Brasserie De Zeezot wins accolades from far and wide. Train details Middelburg is 5\u00bc hours by train from London with a change in Rotterdam. Return fares at b-europe.com start at about \u20ac128. A stay in Middelburg combines nicely with an overnight stop in Brussels or Antwerp. Note that at present there are no direct Eurostar services from Rotterdam back to London, so passengers have to disembark in Brussels and pass through UK immigration, which adds about an hour to the journey time. A direct Rotterdam-London Eurostar is expected to start this spring.

Keir Starmer is well out in front on 68. Jess Phillips (22), Lisa Nandy (24) and Rebecca Long-Bailey (26) are also over the threshold, but the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry (10) is among those struggling to gain enough support. Clive Lewis, the shadow treasury minister, is trailing further behind on just four nominations.</p> \n<p>The hopefuls will make their final behind-the-scenes pitches to colleagues today to try to get over the line. On the weekend Starmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/11/keir-starmer-tacks-to-left-momentum-makes-its-pick-labour-leader\">denounced the \u201cfree-market model\u201d as a failure</a> and backed higher taxes on the wealthiest to pay for better public services. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/12/jess-phillips-laboour-shadow-cabinet-would-include-yvette-cooper-rachel-reeves\">Phillips has pledged to have a cabinet that is \u201cat least 50% women\u201d </a>and says she would bring back Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves, both of whom left under Corbyn. Nandy will call for the party to reconnect with its heartland voters, in her first speech of the campaign today in east London. Long-Bailey has played down descriptions of her as \u201cCorbyn\u2019s candidate\u201d. She says she wants to abolish the House of Lords and would not stand in the way of another Scottish referendum on independence.</p> \n<p>The deputy leadership field is headed by Angela Rayner, who has 72 nominations. Ian Murray \u2013 the party\u2019s only MP in Scotland \u2013 is also in the running with 30 nominations. Those who qualify in the two contests then need to get the nominations of 33 local constituency parties or three Labour affiliates \u2013 including at least two trade unions \u2013 to enter the final postal ballot of party members and registered supporters.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Sandringham summit </strong>\u2013 The Queen will meet face to face with princes Charles, William and Harry today over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s bombshell announcement last week that they will step back as senior royals.

Demonstrators shouted: \u201cThey tell us the lie that it is America, but our enemy is right here.\u201d London meanwhile<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/12/uk-ambassador-iran-denies-street-protests-arrest-rob-macaire\"> has denounced the brief arrest of its ambassador in Tehran</a> on Saturday as a \u201cviolation of international law\u201d. The protests threaten to tip Iran\u2019s regime into crisis just as it was riding a wave of nationalist sentiment after the killing of top general Qassem Suleimani. Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau meanwhile has vowed he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/13/trudeau-tells-iran-crash-vigil-he-will-pursue-justice-and-accountability\">will pursue \u201cjustice and accountability\u201d</a> for the victims, at a vigil for those killed. His comments came as the US defence secretary, Mark Esper contradicted President Trump\u2019s claims that Iran had planned attacks on four US embassies. Asked if there had been a specific or tangible threat, Esper said: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/12/mark-esper-defends-trump-iran\">\u201cI didn\u2019t see one with regard to four embassies.\u201d</a></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Thailand dementia care </strong>\u2013 British families are sending elderly relatives abroad because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/12/families-sending-relatives-with-dementia-to-thailand-for-care\">suitable care can\u2019t be found at home</a>.

There are an estimated 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Brexit border checks </strong>\u2013 The Irish border could yet upset Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, with predictions it will be \u201calmost impossible\u201d to put systems in place to manage the border the end of this year.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Keir Starmer out in front as deadline approaches Good morning and welcome to this Monday briefing with Alison Rourke. The final candidates for the Labour leadership contest will be known today with contenders needing to garner 22 nominations by 2.30pm to go into the next round. Keir Starmer is well out in front on 68. Jess Phillips (22), Lisa Nandy (24) and Rebecca Long-Bailey (26) are also over the threshold, but the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry (10) is among those struggling to gain enough support. Clive Lewis, the shadow treasury minister, is trailing further behind on just four nominations. The hopefuls will make their final behind-the-scenes pitches to colleagues today to try to get over the line. On the weekend Starmer denounced the \u201cfree-market model\u201d as a failure and backed higher taxes on the wealthiest to pay for better public services. Phillips has pledged to have a cabinet that is \u201cat least 50% women\u201d and says she would bring back Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves, both of whom left under Corbyn. Nandy will call for the party to reconnect with its heartland voters, in her first speech of the campaign today in east London. Long-Bailey has played down descriptions of her as \u201cCorbyn\u2019s candidate\u201d. She says she wants to abolish the House of Lords and would not stand in the way of another Scottish referendum on independence. The deputy leadership field is headed by Angela Rayner, who has 72 nominations. Ian Murray \u2013 the party\u2019s only MP in Scotland \u2013 is also in the running with 30 nominations. Those who qualify in the two contests then need to get the nominations of 33 local constituency parties or three Labour affiliates \u2013 including at least two trade unions \u2013 to enter the final postal ballot of party members and registered supporters. * * * Sandringham summit \u2013 The Queen will meet face to face with princes Charles, William and Harry today over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s bombshell announcement last week that they will step back as senior royals. The meeting comes after international applications suggested that Prince Harry and his wife were seeking to register the \u201cSussex Royal\u201d brand as a global trademark for a range of items and activities including clothing, stationery and the running of \u201cemotional support groups\u201d. On the weekend, William expressed his sadness over tensions with his brother, reportedly telling a friend: \u201cI\u2019ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can\u2019t do that any more; we\u2019re separate entities.\u201d * * * Iran protests \u2013 Teargas has been used to break up a second day of anti-government protests in Tehran, with anger mounting over the official denials that the Ukrainian passenger plane was accidentally shot down. Demonstrators shouted: \u201cThey tell us the lie that it is America, but our enemy is right here.\u201d London meanwhile has denounced the brief arrest of its ambassador in Tehran on Saturday as a \u201cviolation of international law\u201d. The protests threaten to tip Iran\u2019s regime into crisis just as it was riding a wave of nationalist sentiment after the killing of top general Qassem Suleimani. Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau meanwhile has vowed he will pursue \u201cjustice and accountability\u201d for the victims, at a vigil for those killed. His comments came as the US defence secretary, Mark Esper contradicted President Trump\u2019s claims that Iran had planned attacks on four US embassies. Asked if there had been a specific or tangible threat, Esper said: \u201cI didn\u2019t see one with regard to four embassies.\u201d * * * Thailand dementia care \u2013 British families are sending elderly relatives abroad because suitable care can\u2019t be found at home. Researchers visiting private care homes in Chiang Mai have found eight homes where guests from the UK are living thousands of miles away from home. \u201cThailand already has a long history of medical tourism and it\u2019s now setting itself up as an international hub for dementia care,\u201d said Dr Caleb Johnston, a senior lecturer in human geography at Newcastle University. There are an estimated 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK. * * * Brexit border checks \u2013 The Irish border could yet upset Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, with predictions it will be \u201calmost impossible\u201d to put systems in place to manage the border the end of this year. Failure to comply with the withdrawal agreement could result in the European commission bringing infringement proceedings, according to the Institute for Government. The PM remains adamant that there will be no checks or new reporting systems on trade crossing the Irish sea, despite Ireland and the EU insisting that those would have to be in place to protect the Irish border. On Monday the PM will visit Belfast, where he and Irish PM Leo Varadkar will hold talks with the DUP first minister, Arlene Foster, and Sinn F\u00e9in deputy first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill at Stormont to demonstrate their support for the new power-sharing government. * * * No regrets \u2013 The vast majority of women who have abortions do not regret their actions, according to a new study.

Paul Blackburn spent a quarter of a century in prison after being found guilty of a terrible crime. But after his conviction was quashed, he has tried in vain to get an apology for what he went through. Plus: Zoe Williams on an extraordinary year for Greggs.

The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Another moderate Liberal, Jason Falinski, said the party would continue to \u201cdrive responsible policy on climate change\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need practical and sensible policy here and seek ambitious action globally,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But as moderates welcomed the shift, conservative MPs were warning against a change in policy.</p> \n<p>The Queensland Nationals MP Llew O\u2019Brien told the Courier Mail that if Australia went beyond its current commitments, it would be \u201cpure symbolism at the expense of the economy\u201d.</p> \n<p>The former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce also issued a thinly veiled warning that the government risked a backlash in the bush if it moved to ramp up emission reduction targets.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo the person in the weatherboard and iron, the solution is not: you\u2019ll lose your job and we\u2019ll put up your power prices, because that is not a solution, that is another problem,\u201d Joyce told Guardian Australia.</p> \n<p>Joyce said the royal commission into the bushfires needed to be \u201cabsolutely pragmatic\u201d in its focus, looking at how to prevent a repeat of the crisis without straying to \u201cglobal\u201d issues.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf it goes off on a path of a macro global view, it will not ultimately bring people together, it will tear people apart,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/12/scott-morrison-flags-bushfires-royal-commission-and-says-coalition-could-bolster-emissions-targets\">Scott Morrison flags bushfires royal commission and says Coalition could bolster emissions reduction</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cGlobal outcomes must be managed globally.\u201d</p> \n<p>The divide comes as Morrison insists the role of climate change is \u201cnot in dispute\u201d within his ranks, despite several MPs denying the role of a warmer planet as an underlying cause of the severe bushfire season.</p> \n<p>The Nationals MP George Christensen was the latest to promote his view that climate change was not a factor, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gchristensenmp/\">telling his supporters on Facebook</a> that climate change is not \u201ca bogey man who can go around lighting bushfires\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI post this because those who are politicising this tragedy by pushing their extreme green political agenda while the fires still burn absolutely disgust me,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/07/craig-kelly-interview-piers-morgan-calls-mp-disgraceful-for-denying-climate-link-to-bushfires\">The Liberal MP Craig Kelly last week caused a storm of controversy</a> after appearing on UK television to argue that there was \u201cno link\u201d between climate change and Australia\u2019s drought.</p> \n<p>Following the appearance, Morrison told his MPs that backbenchers should not do any international media interviews.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Moderate Liberals have seized on Scott Morrison\u2019s apparent shift on climate change policy to argue the government will do more to cut emissions, as some conservatives push back against any \u201csymbolism\u201d that could damage the economy. In a sign of the challenge facing the prime minister as he seeks to \u201cevolve\u201d climate change policy, government MPs have split over the prime minister\u2019s comments on the weekend that the Coalition wanted to reduce emissions \u201ceven further\u201d than current commitments. While saying Australia\u2019s 2030 emission reduction targets remain government policy, Morrison said he wanted to do \u201cbetter\u201d and would only rely on the use of carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol if needed. Australia is the only country relying on carryover credits to meet its Paris 2030 target of 26% to 28% of 2005 levels by 2030, which critics say do not represent the cuts required to limit global warming to as close to 1.5C as possible. Katie Allen, the Liberal MP for the Victorian seat of Higgins, welcomed Morrison\u2019s remarks, telling her constituents that she would be a \u201cstrong voice\u201d in the party room for stronger action on climate change. \u201cI\u2019m excited we are starting to move in the right direction \u2013 but we have a lot more to do,\u201d Allen told her supporters on Facebook. \u201cI have been and will continue to be a strong voice for Climate Action inside the tents.\u201d When asked if she supported the aim of net zero emissions by 2050 and lifting \u201cclean energy ambitions\u201d in line with the global efforts to keep the world below 1.5C warming, Allen said she agreed more needed to be done. \u201cI\u2019m working on influencing that agenda. We need to have higher ambitions to lead the world in renewables \u2013 not just to drive down our own emissions but help other countries with theirs,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe have a diplomatic strength that should be used to help strengthen the global agenda on climate action.\u201d The self-styled modern Liberal MP Tim Wilson also endorsed Morrison\u2019s comments, saying the commitment at the last election to \u201ccut emissions, but not jobs\u201d was a baseline for action. \u201cThe prime minister has rightly identified there\u2019ll be more evolution of policy to cut emissions, but not jobs, and I look forward to contributing to that important evolution,\u201d Wilson told Guardian Australia. Dave Sharma, the MP for Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s former seat of Wentworth, said he was \u201cpleased to hear\u201d Morrison\u2019s comments on the importance of responding to climate change and promoted the government\u2019s plan to \u201ccontinue to evolve our policies with a view to reducing our emissions further\u201d. Another moderate Liberal, Jason Falinski, said the party would continue to \u201cdrive responsible policy on climate change\u201d. \u201cWe need practical and sensible policy here and seek ambitious action globally,\u201d he said. But as moderates welcomed the shift, conservative MPs were warning against a change in policy. The Queensland Nationals MP Llew O\u2019Brien told the Courier Mail that if Australia went beyond its current commitments, it would be \u201cpure symbolism at the expense of the economy\u201d. The former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce also issued a thinly veiled warning that the government risked a backlash in the bush if it moved to ramp up emission reduction targets. \u201cTo the person in the weatherboard and iron, the solution is not: you\u2019ll lose your job and we\u2019ll put up your power prices, because that is not a solution, that is another problem,\u201d Joyce told Guardian Australia. Joyce said the royal commission into the bushfires needed to be \u201cabsolutely pragmatic\u201d in its focus, looking at how to prevent a repeat of the crisis without straying to \u201cglobal\u201d issues. \u201cIf it goes off on a path of a macro global view, it will not ultimately bring people together, it will tear people apart,\u201d he said. \u201cGlobal outcomes must be managed globally.\u201d The divide comes as Morrison insists the role of climate change is \u201cnot in dispute\u201d within his ranks, despite several MPs denying the role of a warmer planet as an underlying cause of the severe bushfire season. The Nationals MP George Christensen was the latest to promote his view that climate change was not a factor, telling his supporters on Facebook that climate change is not \u201ca bogey man who can go around lighting bushfires\u201d. \u201cI post this because those who are politicising this tragedy by pushing their extreme green political agenda while the fires still burn absolutely disgust me,\u201d he said. The Liberal MP Craig Kelly last week caused a storm of controversy after appearing on UK television to argue that there was \u201cno link\u201d between climate change and Australia\u2019s drought. Following the appearance, Morrison told his MPs that backbenchers should not do any international media interviews.",

      "bodyText": "Since its founding six years ago, Guardian Cities has grown from a small experiment into a huge community. Together \u2013 as editors, writers, photographers and film-makers, along with architecture experts, urban planners, gentrification activists, cycling evangelists, canalboat dwellers, homeless people, theatre-makers, refugees and the rest of a motley crew of contributors and readers from nearly 600 cities \u2013 we have tried to shape how the world understands urbanisation: namely, as one of the truly transformative global phenomena of the 21st century. We started Guardian Cities because we saw that everywhere on Earth, people were flooding into cities. More concrete was poured in the last couple of years in China than the US used in the entire 20th century. China now has 100 cities with more than 1 million people, while some developing megalopolises in Africa and elsewhere may hit 80 million residents; the 100 million city is no longer a fantastical proposition. Most of this growth has been largely unplanned, with people literally building their own houses and roads \u2013 though what some consider slums are really just the roots of new neighbourhoods. The challenges can seem overwhelming. The new desirability of cities has seen millions of poorer residents kicked out of their homes, sometimes literally bulldozed for expensive apartment towers. Air pollution from cars, particularly diesel engines (sold to us as safer, and only now revealed as the opposite), chokes many streets, hurting children in particular. The climate crisis threatens us with overheating and floods. Poverty remains a scourge. The concretisation of our environment can, if we\u2019re not vigilant, cut us off from the natural world, turning vibrant human societies into bloodless mechanised economies. But if cities are places of great inequality and tumultuous change, they are also hives of innovation \u2013 to paraphrase Homer Simpson, both the cause of, and solution to, so many of our problems. Ignore the haters: cities writ large are safer, healthier and more productive than any other form of human habitation. Despite the rise of the internet, it remains in cities where people are best able to gather, exchange ideas and test out solutions. We are rewilding, cycling, densifying and in some cases even floating. In five years Copenhagen may become the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral city. Tolerance and difference are at their highest in cities. They certainly aren\u2019t for everyone, but more people can live together in cities, with less total impact, than in any other form of habitation.

We have looked at how we live now; asked great living artists to show us their cities; looked at cities as they might have been; and illustrated the surprising ways they actually are. We\u2019ve profiled the living and the dead, traced the story of cities back 6,000 years, celebrated the most important buildings and exposed privately owned public space. We\u2019ve tried to reinvigorate photojournalism, made films, published long reads, designed interactives, sailed canal boats, hosted live events and told jokes. 2019 was a particularly vibrant year for us. Our Guardian Concrete Week series on the evils of cement won the Foreign Press Association Award for Environment and Science. The Empty Doorway, our series of profiles of the lives of people who died homeless, took home the British Journalism Award for Features. Our revelation of the segregated playgrounds scandal was even nominated for Campaign of the Year \u2013 and we earned several other awards for our cycling and mobility coverage and the illustrated city series.

Against a backdrop of concern among economists that Britain is ill-equipped to combat another downturn on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis, the New Economics Foundation thinktank said a green plan to beat a future slump was required. In the event of a recession, it said the government should spend at least 2% of gross domestic product (GDP), or around \u00a330bn, to decarbonise the economy, by investing in renewable energy projects, planting trees, transport infrastructure, electric vehicles, and retrofitting homes with new insulation. For a larger economic shock, as much as 3% of GDP, or around \u00a350bn, could be spent. Leading economists including former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers and the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, Olivier Blanchard, have called on governments around the globe to prepare for future economic shocks with readily available blueprints to raise government spending. It comes as central banks, including the Bank of England, have limited capacity to provide support because interest rates remain close to the lowest levels on record more than a decade after the financial crisis. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has hinted that Threadneedle Street could cut rates soon, while warning that it is running out of ways to combat recessions. The foundation said that raising investment in green infrastructure was required regardless of whether Britain was facing a recession or not. However, it said that a plan for fighting a future downturn should have decarbonisation at its core. Rolling out an expansive green spending round would help the government to avoid mistakes made responding to the last recession, the thinktank said, arguing that ministers missed an opportunity to decarbonise the economy following the 2008 slump. It said that spending around \u00a310.5bn on a mass insulation programme for homes \u2013 equivalent to only a third of the coalition government\u2019s tax cuts between 2010 and 2013 \u2013 would have enabled residential emissions to fall by around 30% by 2018.

That was the beginning of the reset. By the time I was on stage, I felt calm.\u201d</p> <p>Weightlifting has not only given Fostekew a way to boost her mood. It also inspired the standup show, now on tour, that has been causing all her nervousness. It\u2019s called Hench, a term meaning strong and muscular. When a guy at the gym called Fostekew this one day when he saw her lifting, it threw her into a crisis.</p> <p>On stage, dressed in gym gear, she explores this crisis, delving into her conflicted feelings about how weightlifting has changed her body. Comments from people around her (a \u201cyuck\u201d from her mum at the thought of women with muscly arms; her female personal trainer calling an athletic woman \u201cunfeminine\u201d) led to thoughts about the restrictions surrounding how her gender is allowed to be strong.

They will be accused of ungratefulness for living and thriving in a 100%-not-racist country that has provided them with the opportunity to appear on Newsnight approximately once a year to be sneered at. The chosen protagonists \u2013 the princess, the pop star, the TV presenter, the politician \u2013 ensure that the conversation is never really about racism. Confining our attention to elite victims conveniently shrinks the subject to something neat and quick: it can be packaged into a short viral video, a highly quotable column that is basically an extended tweet, a studio shouting match that will light up social media. There will be no time to discuss the laziness, complicity and complacency of a media class that has turned racism into a spectator sport. There will be no time to discuss the unique toxicity of tabloid culture, and why it thrives in the UK. There will be no time to discuss the large swathes of a deeply conservative country that are goaded and taunted by a cultural showreel from the metropolis that inflames and excludes them. There will be no time to talk about the rightwards creep of our political culture under successive Tory governments that have consistently turned up the dial on nativism. There will be no time to position these elite victims as central characters in a culture war led by the right \u2013 one that has weaponised the word \u201cwoke\u201d to discredit any efforts, or even gestures, towards social justice. There will be no time for anything but performance. And in the performance, behind a mask of innocent inquiry, the same old interrogation \u2013 which pretends to ask about racism in Britain, but in fact only hopes to smoke you out in the open and then draw some blood. Look out. It\u2019s behind you. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist. Her latest book is We Need New Stories: Challenging the Toxic Myths Behind Our Age of Discontent",

      "body": "<p>Doing an interview over the phone can be a thankless job: lines get crossed, you awkwardly interrupt one another and, without the intimacy of a face to face encounter, it\u2019s hard to get a sense of the other person. But doing a phone interview with Brian Cox \u2013 the acclaimed actor, that is, not the pop-star-turned-particle-physicist with the same name \u2013 is such a hoot that if we met in person I would have probably dissolved into a puddle of hysteria.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, not now, I\u2019m having an important conversation!\u201d he barks when someone has the temerity to try to enter his hotel room 45 minutes into our chat. \u201cSo where was I? Ah yes \u2026\u201d And he launches back into the anecdote about the time Princess Margaret felt him up. The man has so much charisma \u2013 and so many anecdotes \u2013 to burn, I can practically feel my phone melting against my face.</p> <p>Cox has a place in north London, as well as a family home in New York, where he lives with his wife, Nicole Ansari, and their two sons. But we are talking by phone because he is still in Los Angeles, celebrating his triumph at the Golden Globes last weekend. He was named best actor in a TV series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/21/filthy-rich-why-the-awful-antics-of-succession-are-so-addictive\" title=\"\">for his role on HBO\u2019s Succession as Logan Roy</a>, the oligarch who occasionally encourages but largely torments his four grasping, feuding children. The show (which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/29/succession-comedy-drama-tv-media-barons-jesse-armstrong\" title=\"\">created by Peep Show\u2019s Jesse Armstrong</a> and will shoot its third season this year) is brilliant on wealth, media tycoons and corrupt dynastic families and feels breathtakingly of the moment. But the smart writing and acting make it timeless. Cox\u2019s performance as the inscrutable then suddenly, terrifyingly, raging centre of the family already feels definitive.</p> <p>Yet when his name was announced last Sunday, he was shocked. \u201cWell, you never know with these things, do you? I thought I was maybe in with a chance, if only from a longevity point of view,\u201d he says with a low rumble of a laugh. At 73, he will celebrate 60 years in the business next year. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised I\u2019m still standing, I really am,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Afterwards, he celebrated his win \u2013 and Succession\u2019s win, which was named best TV drama \u2013 by \u201ctaking lots of selfies\u201d. Elton John paid his respects: \u201cHe was very praising of my Churchill, which was kind,\u201d says Cox, who played the PM in the eponymous 2017 film. Leonardo DiCaprio also stopped by to tell him: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to work with you.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019ve taken long enough about it,\u201d Cox growled back. Has Cox always wanted to work with DiCaprio? \u201cMmmm, I don\u2019t think in those terms,\u201d he says affably.</p> <p>Mainly he celebrated with the cast, even giving Kieran Culkin, who plays Cox\u2019s onscreen son, a big kiss on the mouth as he went up to get his award. \u201cI\u2019m close to all my boys. We\u2019re very family-like, which is ironic as we play such a dysfunctional family,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I ask if that closeness makes it harder for him to torture them on the show, such as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/19/best-tv-shows-2019-no-1-succession\" title=\"\">the infamous \u201cboar on the floor\u201d segment</a>, when Logan makes family members scrabble for sausages.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I love being nasty to my children!\u201d he cackles.</p> <p>Such is Succession\u2019s popularity that Logan Roy has become <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/fashion/article/succession-billionaire-dressing\" title=\"\">something of a fashion icon</a>. The style press loves his power cardigans, I tell him. \u201cHa! It\u2019s all such bollocks, what [playwright] David Storey would call \u2018a soulless stirring of the pot\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Given that Cox is one of Britain\u2019s most prolific actors, celebrated as much for his theatre work (he won an Olivier in 1988 for Titus Andronicus) as he is for his TV roles (Nuremberg, Deadwood, Bob Servant Independent) and film successes (Manhunter, Braveheart, Super Troopers, The Bourne Identity), it would be ludicrous to describe this as his moment. Even in his relatively small roles \u2013 as the disapproving headmaster in Rushmore, say, or the terrifying writing guru in Adaptation \u2013 Cox has always dominated the screen. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/12/from-succession-to-the-loudest-voice-grotesque-masculinity-has-us-gripped\" title=\"\">Logan Roy has caught the public\u2019s imagination</a> in a way that feels new to him.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing how much audiences love Logan\u2019s cruelty,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a reflection of the state we\u2019re in. All of our moral certainties have gone by the wayside with the elections, with the Etonian twit in the UK and the pink Pinocchio in the White House, and you feel you can\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s like with the impeachment: it\u2019s so clear that [Trump] is a bad man, but the Republican senators say: \u2018No, it\u2019s not this, it\u2019s that\u2019, but it\u2019s all bollocks. He\u2019s a horrible human being and he\u2019s fucking everything up and he doesn\u2019t give a shit,\u201d says Cox, palpably only just warming up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cce69026b88b3f85befb402f02df1f3ca0dc71ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce69026b88b3f85befb402f02df1f3ca0dc71ee/0_158_6708_4025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Logan Roy in Succession\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Logan Roy in Succession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Home Box Office/Graeme Hunter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cox is a Labour supporter who has campaigned for Scottish independence. So he wasn\u2019t wildly impressed with the results of last month\u2019s election. \u201cAch! The Brits are so feudal. They don\u2019t listen to a civil servant like Jeremy Corbyn, but they will listen to a windbag Tory like Johnson. And my country has suffered for it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I have heard that Cox is a fan of cannabis so I ask if that helps him cope with the political situation in the US and UK. There is a long pause and I worry I\u2019ve overstepped a line.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely great and I recommend it to everyone \u2013 get stoned!\u201d he says with deep feeling. \u201cIt does make the politics easier to bear. It\u2019s a way of dealing with idiocy.\u201d</p> <p>Has he always been a stoner? \u201cI didn\u2019t start until I was 50,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very against it, actually. You know, I got married at 21 to an upper-middle-class English girl \u2013 well, with Scots parentage, but you know English Scots are the most English! Hahaha! We had two children, one went to St Paul\u2019s, one went to Cheltenham Ladies College. It was all done proper. It wasn\u2019t who I was, but happy wife, happy life. Then when I was 50, I realised I missed out on what was going on with young people because I was so square, and I was working so hard, I needed something to relax. So I discovered the wonderful world of cannabis.\u201d</p> <p>There have been inevitable comparisons between Logan Roy and Rupert Murdoch, despite Cox\u2019s denials (\u201cRupert Murdoch has fuck all to do with it, and you can quote me on that,\u201d he barked at the Golden Globes). But it must be strange for him, having played a media tycoon now for two seasons, to see the ongoing dominance of Fox News in the US, or to watch Michael Bloomberg\u2019s bid for the presidency.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s interesting. All these guys, whether they\u2019re liberal or the opposite, they see themselves as leaders. And they all have their own problems \u2013 clearly, because we\u2019re suffering because of their problems! We\u2019ve suffered under the hands of the Murdoch press and Conrad Black and now Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>And yet despite the show depicting how extreme wealth corrupts extremely, it has accrued fans among that demographic. Cox was recently in a cafe in Primrose Hill, north London, when he was approached by a man who told him that he and his wife liked Succession, \u201cbut she found it a little hard to watch sometimes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s your wife?\u201d asked Cox. \u201cElisabeth Murdoch,\u201d he replied. \u201cCan you go a bit easier on her next season?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019ll try,\u2019\u201d says Cox.</p> <p>Murdochs aside, the family most reminiscent of the Roys are the Trumps, particularly the children. \u201cThere are certain similarities. You know, entitlement is just such an awful thing, and it\u2019s the same in our country with [Prince] Andrew. I mean, what an idiot, what an outstanding dumb fuck: \u2018I don\u2019t know who that young woman was, and I don\u2019t sweat.\u2019 It\u2019s ridiculous! I\u2019m so cross with the idiocy of what we allow. It just shows how ridiculous the notion of monarchy is,\u201d he says.</p> <p>So I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s not a fan of The Crown, I say. There\u2019s another pause. \u201cI love it!\u201d he says, and makes a loud guilty laugh. \u201cI resisted it for ever and a day and then I started to watch it and it was like heroin. I was completely hooked \u2013 and that\u2019s how they get you.\u201d</p> <p>Jesse Armstrong wove some of Cox\u2019s biography into Logan\u2019s, making the character a native of Dundee and even shooting some scenes in Cox\u2019s hometown. Like Logan, Cox has a daughter and three sons from two marriages and, also like his alter ego, his childhood was unimaginably different from the one he was able to give his kids.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where Logan and I cross over, we really do. It\u2019s very hard for [my children] to understand certain things, it\u2019s just one of those things. My kids don\u2019t have the Roys\u2019 sense of entitlement, thank God, because we\u2019re not that rich. But we had a holiday in London and we went to the Savoy for Christmas lunch and it cost a few shillings \u2013 I didn\u2019t get that as a boy,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Cox was born and raised in Dundee, the youngest of five children of a butcher and a spinner. The family was always poor but when Cox was eight their situation worsened immeasurably after his father died from cancer. Soon after, his mother had a severe nervous breakdown and was given electric shock treatment. From the age of 10, Cox was largely raised by his sisters and on some nights, there was so little food in the house he would go to the local chippie and beg for battered scraps.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who don\u2019t know poverty haven\u2019t lived, quite frankly. You know everything is conditional,\u201d he says. To this day, he has a bigger wardrobe than his wife because he is a terrible hoarder \u2013 after growing up with nothing, he can\u2019t bear to give anything away.</p> <p>Cox stumbled through school, leaving at 15 with no qualifications. He worked as a stage manager (\u201cWorst stage manager ever \u2013 I always left the iron on\u201d) before going to Lamda to study acting.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I came to London as a student in the 60s, it was a great period of social mobility,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was in the wake of John Osborne and the angry young man, the rise of people like Albert Finney and Peter O\u2019Toole. And that\u2019s a legacy I\u2019m so proud of, that I was at the tail end of. I was given a grant and had my expenses paid, and I was grateful for it. And now it\u2019s like that never happened. I think it would be bloody impossible for me [to become an actor] if I were starting today. The tragedy in the UK is there\u2019s a whole working class that is being removed from the culture.\u201d</p> <p>I ask what he thinks about the arguments over whether British acting is too dominated by posh people and he jumps in before I finish.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame Damian Lewis or Eddie Redmayne or whatsisname, er, Benedict Cumberpast, er, Cumberpat, no, Cumberbatch \u2013 that\u2019s it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, talent is talent and one has to be careful about not being mean. But it says something about our creative work that we haven\u2019t got an even playing field. Egalitarian thinking is completely lacking in the UK,\u201d he says.</p> <p>This lack of egalitarianism sparks another thought. There is a brief cheeky \u201cShall I tell this or not? Yes, I shall\u201d hesitation.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, when I was a young actor I was touched up by Princess Margaret,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Brian, I am going to need more details on this.</p> <p>\u201cI was at the Royal Court. I was doing a play with Alan Bates and it was my 23rd birthday and I\u2019d been given a red shirt from Lindsay Anderson. I\u2019d just washed my hair so I was sort of glistening, heh heh heh, and I walked in and was introduced to her. She put her fingers on my shirt, and said: \u2018This is a lovely shirt.\u2019 And she started to run her fingers down the inside of my shirt. And I went: Uh oh! What do you do when you\u2019re being touched up by a royal?\u201d</p> <p>What do you do?</p> <p>\u201cIt was so funny. James Bolam, he could see what was going on and started going \u2018Ooooh\u2019 out of the side of his mouth, which somehow said princess didn\u2019t take in at all. She just kept saying: \u2018You were so wonderfully hooded on stage. I wanted to know more about you \u2026\u2019 She was an extraordinay creature. I excused myself and said: \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am,\u2019 and it came to a natural end.\u201d</p> <p>What an amazing man Cox is, working his way up from begging for scraps in Dundee to the absolute top of the Hollywood tree ( \u201cI know, I must write my memoir\u201d). Even his Brooklyn apartment is so smart that the New York Times once did a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/realestate/downtown-brooklyn-home-of-brian-cox-and-nicole-ansari.html\" title=\"\">whole article about it</a>. This included the memorable detail that he and his wife have separate bedrooms and a studio that they \u201ctryst in\u201d. Is this true? He has a shag room?</p> <p>\u201cYeah! We do. The problem is in New York City it\u2019s bloody hard to find the space. But it\u2019s basically her room and I\u2019m allowed to visit occasionally, heh heh heh,\u201d he cackles in a manner that is, undeniably, deliciously, Logan Roy-ish.</p> <p><em>Succession will return to Sky and NOW TV in 2020 and is available on Sky Store now</em></p>",

They don\u2019t listen to a civil servant like Jeremy Corbyn, but they will listen to a windbag Tory like Johnson. And my country has suffered for it,\u201d he says. I have heard that Cox is a fan of cannabis so I ask if that helps him cope with the political situation in the US and UK. There is a long pause and I worry I\u2019ve overstepped a line. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely great and I recommend it to everyone \u2013 get stoned!\u201d he says with deep feeling. \u201cIt does make the politics easier to bear. It\u2019s a way of dealing with idiocy.\u201d Has he always been a stoner? \u201cI didn\u2019t start until I was 50,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very against it, actually. You know, I got married at 21 to an upper-middle-class English girl \u2013 well, with Scots parentage, but you know English Scots are the most English! Hahaha! We had two children, one went to St Paul\u2019s, one went to Cheltenham Ladies College. It was all done proper. It wasn\u2019t who I was, but happy wife, happy life. Then when I was 50, I realised I missed out on what was going on with young people because I was so square, and I was working so hard, I needed something to relax. So I discovered the wonderful world of cannabis.\u201d There have been inevitable comparisons between Logan Roy and Rupert Murdoch, despite Cox\u2019s denials (\u201cRupert Murdoch has fuck all to do with it, and you can quote me on that,\u201d he barked at the Golden Globes). But it must be strange for him, having played a media tycoon now for two seasons, to see the ongoing dominance of Fox News in the US, or to watch Michael Bloomberg\u2019s bid for the presidency. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s interesting. All these guys, whether they\u2019re liberal or the opposite, they see themselves as leaders. And they all have their own problems \u2013 clearly, because we\u2019re suffering because of their problems! We\u2019ve suffered under the hands of the Murdoch press and Conrad Black and now Donald Trump.\u201d And yet despite the show depicting how extreme wealth corrupts extremely, it has accrued fans among that demographic. Cox was recently in a cafe in Primrose Hill, north London, when he was approached by a man who told him that he and his wife liked Succession, \u201cbut she found it a little hard to watch sometimes\u201d. \u201cWho\u2019s your wife?\u201d asked Cox. \u201cElisabeth Murdoch,\u201d he replied. \u201cCan you go a bit easier on her next season?\u201d \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019ll try,\u2019\u201d says Cox. Murdochs aside, the family most reminiscent of the Roys are the Trumps, particularly the children. \u201cThere are certain similarities. You know, entitlement is just such an awful thing, and it\u2019s the same in our country with [Prince] Andrew. I mean, what an idiot, what an outstanding dumb fuck: \u2018I don\u2019t know who that young woman was, and I don\u2019t sweat.\u2019 It\u2019s ridiculous! I\u2019m so cross with the idiocy of what we allow. It just shows how ridiculous the notion of monarchy is,\u201d he says. So I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s not a fan of The Crown, I say. There\u2019s another pause. \u201cI love it!\u201d he says, and makes a loud guilty laugh. \u201cI resisted it for ever and a day and then I started to watch it and it was like heroin. I was completely hooked \u2013 and that\u2019s how they get you.\u201d Jesse Armstrong wove some of Cox\u2019s biography into Logan\u2019s, making the character a native of Dundee and even shooting some scenes in Cox\u2019s hometown. Like Logan, Cox has a daughter and three sons from two marriages and, also like his alter ego, his childhood was unimaginably different from the one he was able to give his kids. \u201cThat\u2019s where Logan and I cross over, we really do. It\u2019s very hard for [my children] to understand certain things, it\u2019s just one of those things. My kids don\u2019t have the Roys\u2019 sense of entitlement, thank God, because we\u2019re not that rich. But we had a holiday in London and we went to the Savoy for Christmas lunch and it cost a few shillings \u2013 I didn\u2019t get that as a boy,\u201d he says. Cox was born and raised in Dundee, the youngest of five children of a butcher and a spinner. The family was always poor but when Cox was eight their situation worsened immeasurably after his father died from cancer. Soon after, his mother had a severe nervous breakdown and was given electric shock treatment. From the age of 10, Cox was largely raised by his sisters and on some nights, there was so little food in the house he would go to the local chippie and beg for battered scraps. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t know poverty haven\u2019t lived, quite frankly. You know everything is conditional,\u201d he says. To this day, he has a bigger wardrobe than his wife because he is a terrible hoarder \u2013 after growing up with nothing, he can\u2019t bear to give anything away. Cox stumbled through school, leaving at 15 with no qualifications. He worked as a stage manager (\u201cWorst stage manager ever \u2013 I always left the iron on\u201d) before going to Lamda to study acting. \u201cWhen I came to London as a student in the 60s, it was a great period of social mobility,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was in the wake of John Osborne and the angry young man, the rise of people like Albert Finney and Peter O\u2019Toole. And that\u2019s a legacy I\u2019m so proud of, that I was at the tail end of. I was given a grant and had my expenses paid, and I was grateful for it. And now it\u2019s like that never happened. I think it would be bloody impossible for me [to become an actor] if I were starting today. The tragedy in the UK is there\u2019s a whole working class that is being removed from the culture.\u201d I ask what he thinks about the arguments over whether British acting is too dominated by posh people and he jumps in before I finish. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame Damian Lewis or Eddie Redmayne or whatsisname, er, Benedict Cumberpast, er, Cumberpat, no, Cumberbatch \u2013 that\u2019s it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, talent is talent and one has to be careful about not being mean. But it says something about our creative work that we haven\u2019t got an even playing field. Egalitarian thinking is completely lacking in the UK,\u201d he says. This lack of egalitarianism sparks another thought. There is a brief cheeky \u201cShall I tell this or not? Yes, I shall\u201d hesitation. \u201cYou know, when I was a young actor I was touched up by Princess Margaret,\u201d he says. Brian, I am going to need more details on this. \u201cI was at the Royal Court. I was doing a play with Alan Bates and it was my 23rd birthday and I\u2019d been given a red shirt from Lindsay Anderson. I\u2019d just washed my hair so I was sort of glistening, heh heh heh, and I walked in and was introduced to her. She put her fingers on my shirt, and said: \u2018This is a lovely shirt.\u2019 And she started to run her fingers down the inside of my shirt. And I went: Uh oh! What do you do when you\u2019re being touched up by a royal?\u201d What do you do? \u201cIt was so funny. James Bolam, he could see what was going on and started going \u2018Ooooh\u2019 out of the side of his mouth, which somehow said princess didn\u2019t take in at all. She just kept saying: \u2018You were so wonderfully hooded on stage. I wanted to know more about you \u2026\u2019 She was an extraordinay creature. I excused myself and said: \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am,\u2019 and it came to a natural end.\u201d What an amazing man Cox is, working his way up from begging for scraps in Dundee to the absolute top of the Hollywood tree ( \u201cI know, I must write my memoir\u201d). Even his Brooklyn apartment is so smart that the New York Times once did a whole article about it. This included the memorable detail that he and his wife have separate bedrooms and a studio that they \u201ctryst in\u201d. Is this true? He has a shag room? \u201cYeah! We do. The problem is in New York City it\u2019s bloody hard to find the space. But it\u2019s basically her room and I\u2019m allowed to visit occasionally, heh heh heh,\u201d he cackles in a manner that is, undeniably, deliciously, Logan Roy-ish. Succession will return to Sky and NOW TV in 2020 and is available on Sky Store now",

Last month the ruling Nepal Communist party (NCP) also tabled a \u201cspecial service bill\u201d that would allow the National Investigation Department to collect information without a warrant or court order. The information technology bill is expected to be debated by MPs this month. Critics fear it will pass with ease because the NCP holds a majority in parliament. The Electronic Transaction Act (ETA), passed in 2008 to fight cybercrime, has already been used to restrict online comment. Critics say the new law will further curtail free speech. Arjun Giri, an editor at the online news portal Tandav News, was detained for four days last April under the ETA after writing a story alleging fraud against a powerful local businessman that was shared on Facebook. \u201cI got a shocking call after a few days from the local police. Police took me into custody, citing that I violated the Electronic Transaction Act,\u201d Giri said. Other journalists and activists raised the alarm over his detention. \u201cIf media and journalists did not raise their voices for me I would have been in jail now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis government is misusing its power and becoming a dictator.\u201d More recently the rapper Samir Ghising, also known as VTEN, was jailed for a week under the act for \u201cantisocial, vulgar and derogatory language, and spreading the wrong message in society in his songs\u201d. Comedian Pranesh Gautam was jailed for nine days in June for critiquing a film on his YouTube channel. According to Freedom Forum, 38 journalists were arrested, detained or questioned by police in 2019. Taranath Dahal, the forum\u2019s director, said: \u201cThe situation is sinister. If the proposed bill becomes law, the media and journalist[s] will be the most targeted. \u201cWe are living in the digital era and we will not be allowed to give our opinions, or speak and express our feelings, due to fear of a heavy fine and jail punishment, which will promote self-censorship. That means there will be no public debate. \u201cIf we don\u2019t debate there is no democracy.\u201d But Kalyani Kumari Khadka, chairman of the development and technology committee, which introduced the legislation, said: \u201cThese clauses on the bill are extremely needed because our society is going out of control.\u201d Earlier attempts to restrict press freedoms met with protests that eventually forced the government to row back. But journalist and former newspaper editor Dhruba Hari Adhikary said the situation remained \u201cvery dangerous\u201d. \u201cBoth parliamentary bills, if allowed to become law, will adversely affect citizens\u2019 constitutional rights relating to freedom of opinion and expression. The direct effect of [proposed] restrictive provisions will be on journalists, but the ultimate impact will be on people as a whole. Their right to be informed citizens of the country is being curbed for no fault of theirs. \u201cConstitutionally, Nepal is a democratic country, not a communist country like North Korea. So, the present ruling party cannot \u2013 and must not \u2013 be allowed to make laws which seek to dilute the norms and values cherished in a democratic society.\u201d",

Cheshire police said that while they were \u201cconcerned\u201d at the wrongful jailing of Paul Blackburn, who was convicted as a teenager in 1978 for the attempted murder and sexual assault of a young boy, no apology was needed as procedures at the time of the investigation were \u201cvery different\u201d. Blackburn, then in a reform school in Warrington, Cheshire, was arrested shortly after he turned 15. The only notable evidence against him was a confession he signed after four hours of questioning by two senior officers, with no parent or lawyer present. The appeal court, which quashed the conviction in 2005, two years after Blackburn was released on license, said the police claim he wrote the confession unaided \u201ccan now be seen to have been untrue\u201d after linguistic analysis showed it was littered with police jargon almost certainly unknown to a poorly-educated teenager. The ruling said this cast doubt on other police claims. The Guardian covered Blackburn\u2019s case for its Justice on Trial series in 2009. In follow-up interviews recorded for the Today in Focus podcast, the lead appeal court judge, Sir David Keene, recalled it as \u201ca shocking case\u201d. Keene, who is now retired and thus able to speak publicly for the first time, said the evidence about Blackburn\u2019s confession was \u201cmanifestly absurd\u201d and that the police should apologise. \u201cIn the light of the findings of our court about the way in which some of the officers of that force had lied at trial, leading to a wrongful conviction, I would have thought it would have been appropriate for them to apologise,\u201d he said. When asked about Keene\u2019s view, assistant chief constable Matt Burton said the Cheshire police would not do so, despite accepting the appeal court decisions. Burton said the force was \u201csatisfied that we do not need to reopen the investigation\u201d, an apparent intimation they still believe Blackburn was responsible. \u201cAn independent investigation into the conduct of the officers involved in this case was also undertaken in 1996 which concluded that there was no evidence of any misconduct nor was there any evidence to pursue criminal proceedings against the officers concerned,\u201d Burton said. \u201cThis case was investigated more than 40 years ago, at a time when the procedures and rules around the questioning of suspects and the submission of evidence were very different to that of today.\u201d Blackburn\u2019s ordeal in more than a dozen prisons over his sentence was made even worse by his refusal to accept the protection offered to sex offenders because he maintained his innocence. Over his first 15 years in jail, Blackburn said, he endured \u201cbeatings on a daily basis, abuse on a daily basis, spit on a daily basis\u201d, adding: \u201cThe first time I was placed on report officially by a prison officer, was for refusing a direct order to mop my own blood up off the floor.\u201d Blackburn was later assisted by older, more educated prisoners, who helped him push for an appeal. While he has worked since his release to highlight other miscarriages of justice, Blackburn has described how he still struggles to cope with the trauma of his experiences in prison. \u201cI still get quite distressed, on a daily basis, replaying things over and over again,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re standing there doing the ironing, and all of a sudden your in Full Sutton [jail], in the punishment block. Different things will set me off \u2013 uniforms, keys, all this sort of thing.\u201d Some semblance of stability has been brought by marriage, and by compensation Blackburn was awarded after the appeal \u2013 though changes to the system made under the 2010 coalition government means it would be unlikely he would be awarded this now.

Failure to implement the new systems will risk legal action by the European commission against Britain, the Institute for Government says. In a new report, it says: \u201cThe [Brexit] deal has the support of no Northern Irish political parties and it looks almost impossible to complete the practical changes, for government and business, by the end of the year. Failure to comply with the withdrawal agreement could see the European commission begin infringement proceedings and the UK ending up at the ECJ [European court of justice].\u201d Johnson\u2019s government remains adamant that there will be no checks or new reporting systems on trade crossing the Irish sea, despite Ireland and the EU insisting that those would have to be in place to protect the Irish border. The prime minister\u2019s intention to establish a trade deal with the EU by the end of December 2020 was also dealt a blow by Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, at the weekend as he indicated the bloc would be in no rush to work to Johnson\u2019s timetable. In a blunt assessment of the likelihood of satisfying Johnson\u2019s \u201cambitious\u201d vision, he said the fact that Britain had put the timescale for a trade deal into law did not mean the other 27 European countries would fall in line. \u201cIn my view, it\u2019s probably going to take longer than a year,\u201d he said. The IfG\u2019s report says HMRC has previously stated similar systems to the proposed customs arrangements for Northern Ireland would take five years to develop and implement. Part of the problem is that until the new trade deal between the UK and the EU is struck, the details of the Northern Ireland arrangements cannot be finalised. The complicated system for Northern Ireland involves the region effectively staying in the single market but in the UK customs zone. This potentially means tariff charges and rebates, paperwork and physical checks on certain fresh foods and live animals going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. In the new report, \u201cGetting Brexit done: what happens now?\u201d, the IfG says Brexit will be far from done on 31 January when the UK formally leaves the EU with the expected ratification of the withdrawal agreement ending the article 50 process. \u201cThe UK will formally leave the EU at the end of January, and in that sense Brexit will be done, but many of the biggest Brexit jobs will be far from over,\u201d it says. \u201cIt will continue to dominate government for years to come. The prime minister may hope to end Brexit\u2019s dominance in the public debate after 31 January, but in Whitehall it will continue to be the biggest and most challenging task faced by a government in decades.\u201d Under the deal sealed by Johnson with the EU last October, animals and fresh food going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to some physical checks, with a tariff and tariff rebate system operating for the first time. These are there to protect any substandard goods seeping into the EU\u2019s single market through smuggling over the Irish border into the Republic of Ireland. While all sides recognise the complexities of the new system, little public attention has been paid to the fact that new computer systems cannot be designed by either HMRC, ferry companies, or manufacturers or suppliers like Tesco until the trade deal with the EU is done. The report says: \u201cWith the details of how the border will operate still unclear \u2013 and likely to be so for some months \u2013 and no preparatory work having happened for checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the 11-month timeline is almost certainly undeliverable.\u201d It notes that Sir Jon Thompson, a former chief executive of HMRC, said that a similar customs systems involving rebates could take up to five years to develop and implement.

      "bodyText": "Deep in the Yanomami indigenous reserve on the northern reaches of the Brazilian Amazon, the ruins of an illegal goldminers\u2019 camp emerge after an hour in a small plane and two in a boat. No roads reach here. Wooden frames alongside the Uraricoera River that once supported shops, bars, restaurants, a pharmacy, an evangelical church and even brothels are all that is left of the small town. The army burned and trashed it as part of an operation aimed at stamping out wildcat mining on the reserve. The army may have taken away the town, but they left the garimpeiros, as the miners are called, who this morning are hunched around a freezer, waiting for the soldiers camped downriver to leave so they can get back to work. Up to 20,000 garimpeiros are estimated by Brazilian NGO Instituto Socioambiental to have invaded this reserve, where mining and unauthorised outsiders are currently prohibited. But the garimpeiros may not remain unauthorised for long: the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has promised to legalise their work with a bill in Congress. \u201cI know it is illegal,\u201d says Bernardo Gomes, 59, sitting by the frame of a bar. Formerly a worker at mining giant Vale, Gomes says his time at the company taught him how to protect the environment. \u201cToday, unfortunately, I am helping to destroy it,\u201d he says, explaining that a nearby patch of dead trees was suffocated by mud sucked out of the nearby mining pit. Some of his companions decline to talk, including a young woman who arrives carrying a bottle of whiskey and a speaker playing pop music. \u201cWant a photo? Naked?\u201d she jokes. In eight days reporting from different locations in the Yanomami reserve, the Guardian saw numerous mining pits and barges. Camps and bases had been destroyed along the Uraricoera \u2013 but its banks still teemed with outsiders. With 9.6m hectares (23.7m acres) of wild forest \u2013 an area bigger than Portugal \u2013 Yanomami is Brazil\u2019s largest reserve. A fifth of its indigenous population died from diseases after 40,000 garimpeiros flooded the reserve in the 1980s, according to Survival International. The miners were expelled and the area declared a reserve in 1992 following a campaign by Survival, photographer Claudia Andujar and Davi Kopenawa, director of the Hutukara Yanomami Association, which invited the Guardian to visit the reserve. But the current garimpeiro invasion worsened after Bolsonaro took office. The president has said the reserve is too big for its population of around 26,000 indigenous people, and its mineral riches should be exploited. His ministers have met garimpo leaders. But garimpeiros bring malaria, prostitution and violence, indigenous leaders argue, while scientists say the mercury the miners use to separate gold particles from mud and silt enters rivers and the food chain. Their pits and barges upset ecosystems, scare away wildlife, and fill rivers with mud that distorts fish behaviour and breeding. Indigenous people used to call this upriver region Paix\u00e3o de Mutum \u2013 or Curassow\u2019s Passion \u2013 after the large, pheasant-like bird they hunted here. Now it is known as Tatuz\u00e3o \u2013 Big Armadillo \u2013 for the pits that miners have gouged out of the forest. Miners have replaced the mutum. \u201cSomebody should help us. The government doesn\u2019t care, it wants to finish indigenous people off,\u201d says Geraldo Magalh\u00e3es, 42, a Ye\u2019kwana indigenous man and deputy chief of Waik\u00e1s village, a two-hour boat-ride away. In November leaders of the majority Yanomami and much smaller Ye\u2019kwana tribes sent a letter to Bolsonaro. \u201cWe do not want garimpo and mining on our land,\u201d it said. \u201cGarimpo out!\u201d Funai, the national agency which works to protect indigenous lands, plans to reopen three bases in the reserve. But repeated army operations have failed to shift the miners. Just a few minutes upriver from the ruined camp, work has already resumed in an enormous mining pit, where tarpaulin and scaffolding made of logs and twine hold up a bank of earth. Three men toil waist-deep in mud with a hose jetting water under an uprooted tree. Mud pours down a rough wooden sluice, while black smoke belches from a deafening diesel engine: a hand-operated industrial hell amid the wild tropical beauty. \u201cWe are here to get gold. These are our riches,\u201d says garimpeiro Fredson Pedrosa, 40. \u201cEveryone here is counting on the army leaving so they can work again.\u201d The men are from small towns in Brazil\u2019s impoverished north and north-east, where they say minimum-salary wages of around US$250 a month (\u00a3194) are barely enough to live on. \u201cYou do this to keep your family,\u201d says Denilson Nascimento, 33. Garimpeiros say they voted for Bolsonaro after he promised to legalise their trade. \u201cWe know it damages the environment,\u201d says Antonio Almeida, 24, who runs a bar here. \u201cBut there is a lot of nature, no way you can kill it all.\u201d Wildcat mining is deeply entwined with local life in Waik\u00e1s. Four villagers work as boatmen for the miners, others sell food at Tatuz\u00e3o and two run a smaller mining site nearby. Tolls on the garimpo boats paid for generators, boat motors and televisions. \u201cThe garimpo is a reality and they\u2019re used to it,\u201d says Edmilson Estev\u00e3o, 33, who was raised in the village and works for the Ye\u2019kwana association Wanasseduume. Some villagers work with the mining, others reject it, but the Ye\u2019kwana keep their differences to themselves. \u201cSame family, same blood,\u201d he says. The garimpo has impacted heavily on hunting, fishing and water quality. \u201cThe prey is getting further and further away. Fish are disappearing, and are contaminated with mercury,\u201d says J\u00falio Ye\u2019kwana, 39, Wanasseduume\u2019s president. \u201cWild pigs used to live around the village. Not anymore.\u201d When mining in the Tatuz\u00e3o area was operating at full pelt, the river where children bathe and families collect water thickened with mud. \u201cThe water was very dirty,\u201d says Nivaldo Edamya, 34, the village chief. \u201cWhat garimpo does is bad. Deforestation, various diseases, that\u2019s why I am against them.\u201d Academic research on the impacts of garimpo \u2013 or Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) \u2013 on biodiversity backs up these complaints. Marcelo Oliveira, a conservation specialist at the World Wildlife Fund has found high mercury levels in fish as far as 150km from ASGM sites in the Amazon. He and other researchers found mercury in Amazon river dolphins \u2013 nearly half of those studied had dangerously high levels \u2013 and other researchers found record mercury levels in jaguar fur near ASGM sites in the Brazilian Pantanal. \u201cThis is an invisible problem,\u201d he says. Birds and larger mammals are sensitive to changes in forest cover and vegetation and flee garimpo areas, says David Lutz, a US-based research assistant professor in environmental studies at Dartmouth College who has studied ASGM in the Peruvian Amazon for a decade. \u201cMassive disturbance. This is like a bomb going off. This is as drastic as you\u2019ll see,\u201d he says, after viewing photos of Tatuz\u00e3o. A study carried out by Lutz and colleagues in Peru found water quality was severely impacted near ASGM sites. Mud and silt thickened rivers, reducing visibility, which would disturb seasonal behaviour and even the breeding habits of fish and the life cycles of insects. \u201cThere is a handful of species that can handle this change, so those species become dominant and it lowers the numbers of other species,\u201d says Lutz. Near Waik\u00e1s, two rough-hewn wooden barges used to dredge for gold are hidden in a tributary. Banks of sand, stones and mud sucked up by the barges had formed in the river. \u201cThey are reshaping the river structure,\u201d says Lutz. \u201cThis will really change the sediment.\u201d In the 1980s and 1990s, William Milliken, an ethnobotanist at Kew Gardens documented the impacts in Yanomami areas degraded by ASGM, such as disappearing caiman and a reduction in plants such as fish poison vine. \u201cIt\u2019s likely to happen again,\u201d he said. The mercury that miners use to separate gold particles from mud and silt is dumped into rivers and burned off into the air, says Luis Fernandez, a tropical ecologist and director at the Wake Forest University centre for Amazon Scientific Innovation in the US. Mercury spreads into the aquatic ecosystem via a process called biomagnification and concentrates rapidly as it passes up the food chain. \u201cThe food chain acts like a signal amplifier,\u201d he says. \u201cEnvironmental chemistry in the tropics is much faster than in temperate regions.\u201d A study published in 2018 found that 92% of indigenous people in a village near Waik\u00e1s, where a garimpo site operated, had higher than safe levels of mercury in their hair. In Waik\u00e1s, the level was 28%. \u201cHere, all the garimpeiros use it [mercury],\u201d says one miner.

Young men and teenage boys gather daily at the health post to charge cellphones they bought working on garimpo sites reached by hours of walking. One site abandoned this year was just a few hours away. This is creating a generational divide with their parents, who still hunt with bows and arrows. \u201cThe garimpo is not our friend. We call it a disease,\u201d says Tibiana Yanomama, 42. His son Oziel, 15, escaped to the nearest garimpo with his friend Marcos, 21. Both spent three weeks working there, clearing jungle, before Tibiana went and dragged them back. \u201cI wanted shoes, a machete, a sharpening file,\u201d Marcos says. \u201cI wanted a hammock. I wanted to work.\u201d He was paid five grams of gold (worth around $180). He saw garimpeiros working with mercury and drank beer and sugar cane rum. \u201cI got very drunk,\u201d he says, with a nervous laugh. Tibiana is furious with Oziel. \u201cThe youth don\u2019t listen,\u201d he says. And he is livid with Bolsonaro\u2019s plans to legalise garimpo. \u201cWhat does he want for Brazil? This forest is Brazil,\u201d he says. Oziel caught malaria, a recurrent problem in garimpo camps, where pools of waste water provide breeding grounds for mosquitos. The Maloca Paapi\u00fa health post handles 15 new cases a week. For the Yanomami, nature and spirituality are intrinsically linked: every rock, every waterfall, every bird, every monkey has a spirit, says Maneose Yanomama, 55, shaman of the Sikamabi-U community. And the spirits of nature are sounding the alarm. \u201cThe whites are getting closer. They are damaging our land, they are destroying our rivers, they are ruining our forests,\u201d he said. \u201cNature is very scared.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

The mystery was only solved <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-31146971\">in 2015</a> when the Seal Mammal Research Institute saw a bull seal attacking, then eating, seal pups.

Nature is not sentimental. So, if you find a dead seal, don\u2019t panic. But do <a href=\"http://ukstrandings.org/how-to-report-a-stranding/\">report it</a> to the <a href=\"https://strandings.org/smass/\">Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme</a> or, outside Scotland, to the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 January 2020.

Seal skin \u2013 a swatch of flank from a body half buried in the sand. And down the beach, another prone shape, then another. One pewter, with a dark patina, the second dappled like a horse. Neither had a head. It was strange to see them: their sleek, glossy shape, and then \u2013 neckline falling open like a bag \u2013 their contents pouring out upon the sand, thin pink streamers of flesh and the knotted rope of vertebrae. This winter, there has been a spate of headless seals washing up along the north-east coast of Scotland. To begin with, they caused a minor panic. The 11 \u201cmutilated\u201d pups reported along the Dornoch Firth in December were initially assumed to have been shot and decapitated. It\u2019s not the first time such an alarm has been sounded. Back in 2010, scores of seals bearing distinctive lacerations washed up in Norfolk and east Scotland. The mystery was only solved in 2015 when the Seal Mammal Research Institute saw a bull seal attacking, then eating, seal pups. Cannibalism, this suggested, was far more common than realised. These poor souls on the Scapa sands were perhaps victims of a seal serial killer too; or else they died of natural causes (as half of pups do, during their first winter) then lost their heads to the waves. Nature is not sentimental. So, if you find a dead seal, don\u2019t panic. But do report it to the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme or, outside Scotland, to the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 January 2020. An editing oversight meant that we omitted to include details for reporting a dead seal in Scotland. This has now been rectified.",

The play wants to move us beyond cultural stereotypes, and to show us we have more in common than we suspect.</p> <p>The first act could do with a little tightening, but has many wonderful moments setting the characters up for the big wedding showdown. Mick, who is gay, seems the most drawn from real life: we see Jack Charles in beret and trench coat, unsuccessfully trying to hail a taxi, and we learn that \u2013 like Charles \u2013 Mick works with prisoners and is a member of the stolen generations. At one point, a fellow cast-member can even be spotted reading Charles\u2019s terrific autobiography, A Born-Again Blackfella.</p> <p>As the travelling troubadours through the first act morph into a wedding band, and casual clothes morph into bow ties and brocade, a mash of love songs segue us through \u2013 from the Home and Away theme to Daryl Braithwaite\u2019s The Horses.

But as their little secret suddenly becomes known to all in the room, accusations of \u201cwhoring bitch\u201d let fly. \u201cOh you Maoris, think you\u2019re so effin\u2019 cultural!\u201d shouts Ruth. Sylvia, standing now in front of the head table, won\u2019t let that insult stand: \u201cI\u2019ve had yeast infections with more culture than the lot of ya!\u201d The chaos that ensues is masterfully controlled by co-directors Rachael Maza \u2013 artistic director of Indigenous Australian company Ilbijerri theatre \u2013 and Tukiwaho, who co-wrote Black Ties with Torres Strait writer John Harvey. A co-production by Ilbijerri and New Zealand\u2019s Te Re\u0304hia theatre, the ambition of scale here \u2013 13 performers including the band, and a drastic and effective flip of the stage and point-of-view for the second act \u2013 is augmented by the ambition of bringing people together, as we are encouraged to talk with the strangers on our tables. But in the first act, we\u2019re just flies on the wall, watching Kane and his intended best man Jerome (Dion Williams) travel across the ditch to get permission to marry Sylvia and Robert\u2019s daughter \u2013 fearful of a Once Were Warriors-style violent greeting. The lads are granted an impromptu p\u014dwhiri, a Maori welcome ceremony, which becomes enmeshed with the disco classic It\u2019s Raining Men, sung by the fabulous best friend of the bride, trans woman Shannon (Brady Peeti). This early cross-cultural moment is a little like that outback scene in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, when didgeridoos and campfire mash with I Will Survive. Later, under a disco silver ball and clutching a bottle of red wine, Shannon will bring her own lovelorn drama to the wedding reception; sisters will fight and unite around our tables, but the band will play on. Comedy can convey a host of serious issues, including problems common to many cultures \u2013 such as absent fathers. Black Ties also wants to remind us that, while these are stories of colonised peoples with similar histories, Australia\u2019s history of forced Indigenous child removals \u2013 and the lack of a Treaty \u2013 continues to resonate as unfinished business. The play wants to move us beyond cultural stereotypes, and to show us we have more in common than we suspect. The first act could do with a little tightening, but has many wonderful moments setting the characters up for the big wedding showdown. Mick, who is gay, seems the most drawn from real life: we see Jack Charles in beret and trench coat, unsuccessfully trying to hail a taxi, and we learn that \u2013 like Charles \u2013 Mick works with prisoners and is a member of the stolen generations. At one point, a fellow cast-member can even be spotted reading Charles\u2019s terrific autobiography, A Born-Again Blackfella. As the travelling troubadours through the first act morph into a wedding band, and casual clothes morph into bow ties and brocade, a mash of love songs segue us through \u2013 from the Home and Away theme to Daryl Braithwaite\u2019s The Horses. The audience is finally encouraged to dance with the players. If only we all moved as one more often. Black Ties plays at Sydney Town Hall for Sydney festival until 18 January, then at Perth festival 13 to 16 February, Asia TOPA festival in Melbourne 21-29 February, New Zealand festival of the arts in Wellington 4\u20137 March, and Auckland arts festival 11\u201315 March.",

Canavan wrote to Kaeser in December with a plea \u201cnot to be intimidated by the noisy anti-coal minority targeting the Adani Carmichael mine project and companies providing services to it.\u201d He wrote: \u201cIf the protestors achieve their goals of ending coalmining by bullying companies into submission, the result would be millions more people without a home, without access to electricity and without as much hope as they otherwise could have.\u201d In the statement, he said the project was also \u201capproved\u201d by the indigenous Wangan and Jagalingou people which was \u201cvery important to us\u201d. That approval is strongly disputed by a group of Wangan and Jagalingou people. Adani took court action to prevent that group, led by Adrian Burragubba, from setting up camp on the land. The Queensland Government in 2019 extinguished native title over Wangan and Jagalingou to enable the mining project to proceed. Kaeser said he was personally \u201cmoved\u201d by messages from Australians who had \u201cdescribed that their homes and their country is burning and suffering from these terrible fires\u201d. The Adani coalmine will extract an initial 10m tonnes of thermal coal per year from a site 300km inland and transport it along a railway line to Adani\u2019s Abbot Point Port for export. Kaeser said there were competitors to the railway signalling contract the company signed on 10 December 2019, which meant \u201cwhether or not Siemens provides the signaling, the project will still go ahead\u201d. Last week Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said Siemens had \u201cthe power to stop, delay or at least interrupt the building of the huge Adani coalmine in Australia\u201d and people should push the company \u201cto make the only right decision\u201d. Greens leader Richard Di Natale had also written to Siemens, and warned the company risked \u201creputational damage\u201d over the deal. Galilee Blockade spokesperson Ben Pennings said: \u201cSiemens has just trashed their billion dollar reputation for a $30m contract. Their reckless indifference to the suffering of Australians will be judged harshly, now and in the history books.\u201d \u201cSiemens\u2019 expertise is vital to the Adani coal railway and there is too much at stake to give up. Citizens will escalate their protests until Siemens listens to the science and choose the right side of history. \u201cAdani will never have social licence to build a new thermal coalmine in Australia. Our challenge is to turn this discontent into civil disobedience powerful enough to overcome any government repression.\u201d Australian Conservation Foundation senior campaigner Christian Slattery said the Siemens announcement, \u201cwhile bushfires rage in Australia, is nothing short of shameful\u201d. He said: \u201cThe company has shown its true colours with this decision. It has a climate change policy, but it is hollow and empty. Sadly, Siemens has shown it is no better than the fossil fuel companies it works with.\u201d The Galilee Basin has been identified as one of the largest untapped sources of coal in the world, and campaigners and scientists have warned the Adani mine will open the way to several other coal mining projects in the region. Slattery added: \u201cIf constructed, the infrastructure for Adani\u2019s mine will open the Galilee Basin to one of the largest expansions of thermal coal mining on the planet. \u201cSiemens claims to support the Paris Agreement, but now it is committed to work on one of the world\u2019s biggest carbon bombs.\u201d \u201cThe unfolding bushfire crisis in Australia, which has killed at least 28 people and more than one billion native animals is a terrifying foretaste of the climate change future if more coal mines are dug.\u201d An Adani spokesperson said: \u201cWe are pleased to be working with Siemens as the company is known for its exceptional experience in building rail signalling infrastructure around the world. \u201cWith construction of the Carmichael Project well and truly under way we have repeatedly demonstrated that we will not be intimidated or deterred from delivering on our promises to regional Queenslanders, Australians and people in developing nations who desperately need affordable energy to help lift them out of poverty.\u201d",

So they sing heavy metal in a choral tradition, for example.\u201d</p> <p>The aim of the work, Boonstra says, is marrying two seemingly unrelated practices with each other. \u201cIt\u2019s a daring approach because the outcome is unpredictable, but undoubtedly interesting! It was beautiful to see the two groups collaborate with respect and curiosity about each other\u2019s practice, trying to find points of connection, but also looking at where tensions might be interesting as well.\u201d</p> <p>Asia TOPA associate director Kate Ben-Tovim also recommends Metal.</p> <p>\u201cIndonesia is a hot-bed for heavy metal - even President Jokowi is a known metal fan!\u201d she says. \u201cAnd Tikoro are part of a really interesting underground music scene that is flourishing in Java at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cMetal also taps into a certain spirit of resistance for young Indonesians. I\u2019ll be interested to see if some of this broader socio-political undertone is reflected in the work.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly a medium you don\u2019t see often. \u201cTo have a heavy metal music ensemble live on stage for a contemporary dance work is pretty unusual; it\u2019s going to be intense!\u201d Ben-Tovim says.</p> <p>\u201cLucy\u2019s choreography is always so thoughtful with each new work, genuinely unique from the last, and she has such a beautiful, fluid choreographic voice.

      "bodyText": "Asia TOPA\u2019s 2020 program is so extensive it spreads over three full months. From January to March, the festival will bring a stunning and multi-art form collection of works to venues around Melbourne and the regional hubs of Bendigo, Geelong and Castlemaine. What unites this diverse schedule of events is Asia TOPA\u2019s dedication to showcasing the creative work of artists and cultures throughout the Asia-Pacific region, a remit that means audiences can catch everything from a Vietnamese bamboo circus to an Indonesian heavy metal choir. Events in the Asia TOPA program are windows into cultures and practices that don\u2019t often make it to Australian shores, with artists from 17 Asia-Pacific countries and regions represented this year. So how do you know where to start? For a handful of the events you really can\u2019t miss, we asked six of the festival\u2019s key directors and curators for their picks of the 2020 program. SAIGON When SAIGON premiered at Avignon Festival in 2017, the deeply moving family saga quickly became the hottest ticket at the world\u2019s largest theatre festival. Photograph: Jean-Louis Fernandez / Asia TOPA. Asia TOPA creative director Stephen Armstrong is particularly excited about SAIGON, a play commissioned by the Avignon Festival, from director Caroline Guiela Nguyen, about a family between Vietnam and France. \u201cSAIGON is an exquisitely crafted, large-scale drama,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cMs Nguyen is a wildly talented young artist trusting theatre with the power to dissolve the distances between culture, time and memory - and especially the distance between her own life as a Parisienne and her Vietnamese mother\u2019s life in exile. \u201cThis is not a play about the politics of war but about absences - how stories of departure, of exile, of people who are missing in their own families become living mythologies. \u201cI loved this production so much for its big-hearted theatricality, for its music, its energy and spontaneity, and of course for its truthfulness. I loved that this quintessentially Vietnamese diaspora story connects all of us with migrant pasts to one another.\u201d Book tickets. Metal Five dancers and eight metal-heads share the stage in this meeting of cultures, art forms, languages and belief systems. Photograph: Angus Kemp and Wayne Smith / Asia TOPA. Asia TOPA\u2019s public program curator Dr Sadiah Boonstra recommends Metal, a powerful dance work by Melbourne choreographer Lucy Guerin and Indonesian artist Robi Rusdiana. \u201cThe work is a collaboration between heavy metal group Ensemble Tikoro, from Bandung, Indonesia, and contemporary dance company Lucy Guerin Inc, from Melbourne,\u201d Boonstra says. \u201cEnsemble Tikoro is an amazing group of singers that explore and experiment with throat singing techniques and combine various singing traditions too. So they sing heavy metal in a choral tradition, for example.\u201d The aim of the work, Boonstra says, is marrying two seemingly unrelated practices with each other. \u201cIt\u2019s a daring approach because the outcome is unpredictable, but undoubtedly interesting! It was beautiful to see the two groups collaborate with respect and curiosity about each other\u2019s practice, trying to find points of connection, but also looking at where tensions might be interesting as well.\u201d Asia TOPA associate director Kate Ben-Tovim also recommends Metal. \u201cIndonesia is a hot-bed for heavy metal - even President Jokowi is a known metal fan!\u201d she says. \u201cAnd Tikoro are part of a really interesting underground music scene that is flourishing in Java at the moment. \u201cMetal also taps into a certain spirit of resistance for young Indonesians. I\u2019ll be interested to see if some of this broader socio-political undertone is reflected in the work.\u201d It\u2019s certainly a medium you don\u2019t see often. \u201cTo have a heavy metal music ensemble live on stage for a contemporary dance work is pretty unusual; it\u2019s going to be intense!\u201d Ben-Tovim says. \u201cLucy\u2019s choreography is always so thoughtful with each new work, genuinely unique from the last, and she has such a beautiful, fluid choreographic voice. I can\u2019t wait to see how she brings her dancers and these musicians together.\u201d Book tickets. Abida Parveen One of the greatest spiritual singers alive today performs an exclusive show at Hamer Hall. Photograph: Mobeen Ansari / Asia TOPA. Ayesha Bux, founder of the Muslim cultural festival SalamFest, says you can\u2019t miss legendary Sufi singer Abida Parveen, who will be performing in an Australian exclusive at Asia TOPA. Parveen rarely plays outside Pakistan. \u201cIt has taken three decades for her to agree to perform in Australia, which makes it a rare opportunity to experience the phenomenon that is Abida Ji,\u201d Bux says. \u201cWitnessing an artist of this calibre perform is not only a once-in-a-lifetime experience but a transformative journey that transcends borders, gender and age.\u201d Parveen\u2019s status as one of the most revered Sufi singers alive has great cultural significance, Bux says. \u201cIn an art form that is male dominated, she is considered the best artist alive and has paved the way for many young female artists in the subcontinent. She has broken through many barriers put in front of her, and has become the unmatched voice in Sufi music today. \u201cThe Sufi music scene, especially in her home country of Pakistan, is deeply sacred and in some ways exclusive. Women are not traditionally allowed to or encouraged to train in classical Sufi singing. Parveen has overcome societal, religious and cultural barriers to her art and has amassed an audience worldwide, a groundbreaking discography and an indisputable reputation.\u201d Book tickets.

Director of The SUBSTATION Brad Spolding can\u2019t wait to see datamatics [ver. 2.0] and Shiro, a pair of works that will take over Arts Centre Melbourne\u2019s Hamer Hall for one night. Both pieces on the double bill blend music and visual elements in exciting new ways; datamatics [ver 2.0] is an immersive and mesmerising audiovisual performance by revered artist Ryoji Ikeda, while Shiro, the work of Japanese duo NONOTAK, is an on-stage installation that sits somewhere between architecture, light sculpture and electronic music. \u201cThis is a chance for Melbourne audiences to experience Ikeda performing for themselves,\u201d Spolding says. \u201cAudiences will experience the foundations of the genre as well as the future of what is possible.\u201d He describes the shows as \u201cimmersive\u201d and \u201chypnotic\u201d. Spolding has curated these two works as part of the SUBSONIC series in Asia TOPA which also includes Dragon Ladies Don\u2019t Weep, Boris with Merzbow, Akio Suzuki and Terre Thaemlitz. Book tickets. The Planet - A Lament This stirring, provocative work merges film with live dance to impart a moving story of creation set against the backdrop of environmental disaster. Photograph: Asia TOPA. Associate director Kate Ben-Tovim says one of this year\u2019s standouts is The Planet - A Lament, a work Asia TOPA co-commissioned from pioneering Indonesian director Garin Nugroho. \u201cGarin is one of the most important voices in Indonesian cultural life,\u201d Ben-Tovim says. \u201cHe\u2019s a filmmaker - currently Indonesia\u2019s 2020 Oscars selection with the controversial Memories of My Body - but also a theatre and dance director and an outspoken advocate for the importance of religious and cultural diversity in contemporary Indonesia. \u201cIn this work he is reflecting on a community devastated by natural disaster; a very real experience for people in Indonesia, as we have seen again in the past few weeks with the terrible Jakarta floods.\u201d The Planet - A Lament blends mediums: it\u2019s a song cycle, but set against the backdrop of a film.

Since then at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/mothers-daughters-fathers-sons-the-victims-of-the-australian-bushfires\">27 people have lost their lives</a>,<a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.au/news/news/2020/statement-from-wwf-australia-on-australia-s-bushfire-emergency#gs.qy0ydb\"> millions of animals have died</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-03/navy-starts-bushfires-evacuations--in-mallacoota/11838424\">navy has been called in to evacuate beaches</a>. The devastating impacts of climate change are tragically becoming real for many. And many, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/03/ive-always-voted-liberal-but-after-sheltering-my-family-on-a-beach-i-cannot-support-this-government\">bushfire survivors</a> to<a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-06/climate-change-deniers-hinder-fire-response-says-business-group/11843530\"> business leaders</a> to<a href=\"https://www.nowtolove.com.au/news/local-news/female-firefighters-australia-62052\"> firefighters</a>, are calling for action.</p> <p>As a result, we are in a moment where the opportunity to implement effective and long-lasting policy to lower Australia\u2019s climate pollution could finally be within reach. Indeed, the independent MP Zali Steggall has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/08/zali-steggall-urges-modern-liberals-to-support-her-proposed-climate-change-bill\">announced her intention to introduce a climate bill</a> into federal parliament in March. Meanwhile the New South Wales energy minister, Matt Kean, has <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/kean-tasks-chief-scientist-to-ensure-nsw-not-left-behind-on-green-energy-jobs-20191228-p53nbx.html\">asked the state\u2019s chief scientist to identify opportunities for NSW to lead on climate action</a>. Even the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/nsw-young-liberals-climate-push-puts-them-at-odds-with-morrison-government\"> NSW Young Liberals</a> have put forward a plan to act on climate.</p> <p>To grasp this opportunity we must learn critical lessons from the past.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/13/scott-morrison-suffers-blow-to-personal-approval-rating-in-first-poll-of-2020\">Scott Morrison suffers blow to personal approval rating in first poll of 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is not the first time that public support for climate action has been sky high, nor the first time that political opportunity for far-reaching policy has presented itself. In 2007 Kevin Rudd was elected with a huge mandate to act on climate. In 2011 the Gillard government, with support of the crossbench, implemented the extremely effective clean energy future package. And last year people across the country worked tirelessly to make the federal election a climate election.</p> <p>In all three of these cases, we lost in the how \u2013 <em>how</em> should Australia go about acting on climate?</p> <p>In the first instance, we lost momentum for action because we could not agree on the effectiveness of a policy \u2013 would the carbon pollution reduction scheme with its 5% emissions reduction target be a springboard for further action, or lock in rights to pollute for our biggest emitters?</p> <p>In the second case, climate deniers such as Tony Abbott weaponised the carbon price policy for political ends, running the extremely effective \u201cAxe the tax\u201d scare campaign. Furthermore, the carbon price was for many Australians an abstract policy idea disconnected from their lives but perceived to be hurting their hip pockets.</p> <p>In the third, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/02/one-in-three-voters-confused-about-which-party-has-better-energy-policy\">a poll by the Australia Institute</a> found that there was simply not enough awareness of the differences between the two main parties\u2019 energy and climate policies. With renewable energy booming, the federal Coalition was able to paint itself has having a reasonable and sensible climate policy, even though it has anything but.</p> <p>I raise these painful moments in history not to rehash the past but rather to see what we can learn for the future. Because we need to recognise that from public policy and political perspective, climate change is hard \u2013 the causes (burning fossil fuels and reducing carbon sinks) are distant from the impacts geographically and temporarily.

      "bodyText": "In late 2019, before the bushfires hit crisis level, concern about climate change in Australia was at record levels. Since then at least 27 people have lost their lives, millions of animals have died and the navy has been called in to evacuate beaches. The devastating impacts of climate change are tragically becoming real for many. And many, from bushfire survivors to business leaders to firefighters, are calling for action. As a result, we are in a moment where the opportunity to implement effective and long-lasting policy to lower Australia\u2019s climate pollution could finally be within reach. Indeed, the independent MP Zali Steggall has announced her intention to introduce a climate bill into federal parliament in March. Meanwhile the New South Wales energy minister, Matt Kean, has asked the state\u2019s chief scientist to identify opportunities for NSW to lead on climate action. Even the NSW Young Liberals have put forward a plan to act on climate. To grasp this opportunity we must learn critical lessons from the past. This is not the first time that public support for climate action has been sky high, nor the first time that political opportunity for far-reaching policy has presented itself. In 2007 Kevin Rudd was elected with a huge mandate to act on climate. In 2011 the Gillard government, with support of the crossbench, implemented the extremely effective clean energy future package. And last year people across the country worked tirelessly to make the federal election a climate election. In all three of these cases, we lost in the how \u2013 how should Australia go about acting on climate? In the first instance, we lost momentum for action because we could not agree on the effectiveness of a policy \u2013 would the carbon pollution reduction scheme with its 5% emissions reduction target be a springboard for further action, or lock in rights to pollute for our biggest emitters? In the second case, climate deniers such as Tony Abbott weaponised the carbon price policy for political ends, running the extremely effective \u201cAxe the tax\u201d scare campaign. Furthermore, the carbon price was for many Australians an abstract policy idea disconnected from their lives but perceived to be hurting their hip pockets. In the third, a poll by the Australia Institute found that there was simply not enough awareness of the differences between the two main parties\u2019 energy and climate policies. With renewable energy booming, the federal Coalition was able to paint itself has having a reasonable and sensible climate policy, even though it has anything but. I raise these painful moments in history not to rehash the past but rather to see what we can learn for the future. Because we need to recognise that from public policy and political perspective, climate change is hard \u2013 the causes (burning fossil fuels and reducing carbon sinks) are distant from the impacts geographically and temporarily. Its solutions practically are many and the policies needed often complex. Not to mention the fact that Australia has a powerful fossil fuel lobby and, in each of these moments, it took advantage of the disagreement, disconnection and lack of understanding to good effect. Looking forward, we are now presented with both a policy challenge and communications challenges. First, can those who care about climate unite behind practical solutions and policy options that will be: effective at lowering emissions; connect with real people\u2019s lives; and are easy and compelling for the average person to understand? Second, can we communicate a set of success measures against which everyday Australians can judge the effectiveness of a policy or a government on climate? I propose five tests or questions that could help us meet these policy and communications challenges: Is carbon pollution going down in real terms? Can the government point to real-world action and policies that are being implemented now, this year, to lower emissions that are commensurate with the scale of the problem? Does the government have a plan to fully decarbonise every sector of the economy \u2013 electricity, transport, industry, buildings, agriculture and land use? And ones that address the biggest opportunities and threats, for example a renewable export plan and a bushfire plan? Do these plans deliver co-benefits in each sector that make people\u2019s lives better? For example, creating new jobs, new industries, healthier and more liveable? homes, less traffic congestion, lower electricity bills and less air pollution. Is the government or policy reducing and removing support for fossil fuels and/or other causes of climate change? If the answer is no to these questions, the policy isn\u2019t working, the government isn\u2019t acting on climate, it\u2019s unlikely to be popular and thus long-lasting and it isn\u2019t fulfilling our obligations under the Paris agreement. The basic idea that underpins these tests is that actually to address climate change we need a plan, or in reality multiple plans. For too long, climate policy insiders and commentators have been obsessed with carbon pricing. Carbon prices, like other policies can be well designed and effective, or badly designed and ineffective. But whether a carbon price is well designed or not, it\u2019s only one tool in the policy toolkit for decarbonising Australia. Other tools include regulatory changes, investment in research and development, new standards, support for new markets and so forth. A plan is needed for each sector of the Australian economy that brings together these different policy levers or tools and different actors to do the hard work of decarbonisation. Work, that the climate science says is urgently required but, if done right, could lead to a better, more prosperous Australia. The good news is we are starting to see different organisations calling for a plan. For example, WWF-Australia is calling for a climate plan and have done the research needed to communicate it to mainstream Australia. Farmers for Climate Action are calling for the development of a climate and agriculture strategy. The Climate and Health Alliance is advocating for a climate and health plan.

The good news is all of these organisations are building diverse coalitions, talking about the non-environmental benefits that can be delivered by acting on climate in their respective sectors. Australian\u2019s trust in its political leadership is at an all-time low, perhaps this is a moment that leaders across all states and territories to redeem our faith in politics and end the climate wars, with the humble task of drawing up a plan.

He purchased an anti-pollution face mask online on 3 December. \u201cMy friends would tell you that I am very quick to \u2026 jump on a fad,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea of buying a mask appealed to me because it seemed very dumb at the time.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell took strange pleasure in researching his purchase. \u201cIt\u2019s quite funny to get into the very small world of fashion face masks because the websites are trying to make something that is horrific seem quite appealing \u2026 There is a certain Blade Runner-y feeling of embracing our fashionable dystopia that I enjoyed.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually he settled on a respirator from <a href=\"https://cambridgemask.com/\">Cambridge Mask Co</a>. At A$48 plus shipping, the mask is lower cost than many other designer masks. Mitchell found the brand\u2019s extensive range of colours and prints appealing too, although his first choice \u2013 a shade of deep teal \u2013 was sold out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4920e1a3ea96287c9a765c49b70272d3e6ef5caf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4920e1a3ea96287c9a765c49b70272d3e6ef5caf/0_225_5759_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Models adjust colourful masks from Cambridge Mask Co.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models adjust colourful masks from Cambridge Mask Co.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cambridge Mask Co</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cambridge Mask Co\u2019s chief operating officer Nina Griffee explains that the range of colours isn\u2019t about creating a product that\u2019s \u201cfashionable\u201d. She says fine particle-filtering face masks can look quite militaristic but \u201cby adding colour you can convince a five-year-old to wear a mask.\u201d The masks were originally developed for residents of highly polluted cities, where \u201cyou don\u2019t have one mask you have three or four,\u201d says Griffee. When wearing a face mask is commonplace \u201cit\u2019s nice if it matches your coat\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/02/household-haze-how-to-reduce-smoke-in-your-home-without-an-air-purifier\">Household haze: how to reduce smoke in your home without an air purifier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the days of poor air quality stretched on across swathes of eastern and southern Australia, what started as almost a joke became \u201creally handy and helpful\u201d for Mitchell. Those who\u2019d mocked him started to see sense in his decision. People even asked him for advice on social media, where he\u2019d shared photographs of himself wearing the mask.</p> <h2>\u2018I look like a ninja\u2019</h2> <p>Around the time Mitchell was making his purchase, Katherine Brickman, who also lives in Sydney, was suffering from \u201ca smoker\u2019s cough that turned into a respiratory infection\u201d and realised \u201cI needed some way of commuting to work without getting sick\u201d.</p> <p>Brickman consulted with a co-worker \u2013 \u201ca real fashion kid\u201d \u2013 who was already wearing a mask, and then researched the health recommendations that had come out during the California wildfires of 2018. She decided there was \u201cno point in wearing one that\u2019s not comfortable\u201d, and eventually bought a mask from Swedish company <a href=\"https://www.airinum.com/\">Airinum</a>. She describes their website as \u201cthe Apple store of face masks\u201d, and says she found their extensive fit information and video tutorials particularly persuasive.</p> <p>Airinum masks start at US$69. Brickman says \u201cthe one I got was slightly pricey, but I felt I could justify that cost because I can wash it and reuse it\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4cfe622e233b07eef887a9350b899370565bfc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4cfe622e233b07eef887a9350b899370565bfc9/56_0_1293_776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screen grab from the Airinum website, which Katherine Brickman says reminds her of the Apple Store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sleek Airinum website.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Airinum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mask delivered on the promise of comfort, to some extent. \u201cIt has padding around the nose. It\u2019s as comfortable as you would expect a face mask to be. You get the warm air of your breath as you exhale on your face. That\u2019s not pleasant.\u201d However, she adds, \u201cI get so comfortable wearing it I sometimes almost go to drink coffee through it.\u201d</p> <p>Originally Brickman hoped for a mask that would not look \u201ctoo threatening\u201d. She opted for a simple black and laments: \u201cIt\u2019s threatening ... I look like a ninja.\u201d</p> <h2>Face masks meet fashion</h2> <p>Meo, a New Zealand-based anti-pollution mask manufacturer who use a wool filtration system, have a particularly bold fashion offering. They collaborated with one of New Zealand\u2019s biggest designers, Karen Walker, on a range of air masks that have interchangeable covers, featuring bird prints, filagrees and shooting stars. A representative for Karen Walker says Meo recently experienced \u201ca spike in sales in Australia across their range\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/10/australia-is-choking-on-smoke-so-are-air-purifiers-the-answer\">Australia is choking on smoke \u2013 so are air purifiers the answer?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Griffee, who is based between Hong Kong and Perth, says the demand for Cambridge Mask Co\u2019s product in Australia has been unprecedented. \u201cThis took everyone by surprise ... since customs have been busy over Christmas, we\u2019re having stock problems at the moment,\u201d although she adds they will have product back in stock on Amazon Australia over the next few days. Griffee has noticed \u201cunfortunately some opportunists will buy 10 or 20 masks and list them on Amazon for $100\u201d. She is dismayed by these acts of scalping, saying \u201cIt\u2019s not good behaviour \u2026 This is not a time when people should be profiteering. We hope to have this problem fixed as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Jack Graham has also seen an uplift in inquiries from Australian residents since the bushfire crisis started. \u201cPeople just want to know when they can get them.\u201d</p> <p>He says while it has been \u201can opportunity\u201d, it is not one he relishes. \u201cWe took the air in Australia for granted,\u201d he says, explaining that the idea for the company was born out of the founders\u2019 appreciation for returning to fragrant Sydney air after trips overseas. Lately they\u2019ve been wearing their own prototypes because of the smoke. \u201cComing back to Australia was always refreshing for us. We lived near the bush, so we always had that clean air ... That\u2019s changed.\u201d</p> <h2>Tips for would-be mask wearers</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Fit is key: </strong>The websites of most air filtration masks feature comprehensive fit information. Pay close attention because if the mask does not seal properly on your face, it will not protect against fine particles and it will not be comfortable.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Wear </strong><strong>it tight: </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s more comfortable when it\u2019s tighter,\u201d says Scott Mitchell. \u201cI\u2019d recommend anyone to really strap that thing in.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Avoid lipstick: </strong>Katherine Brickman says she learned that tip the hard way.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Say no to scalpers: </strong>Nina Griffee says Cambridge Mask Co\u2019s products retail at A$48 \u2013 if you spot their masks at a higher price, it is an unauthorised reseller. </p></li> <li><p><strong>Keep it clean: </strong>One of the appeals of Airinum\u2019s masks, for Brickman, was the carry case they came in. \u201cThat way it wasn\u2019t getting dirty at the bottom of my handbag.\u201d While other masks, including Meo\u2019s, also come with carry pouches, any small drawstring bag should do.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Pair with small-framed sunglasses: </strong>Good face masks tend to sit quite high on the bridge of your nose, making larger sunglasses uncomfortable to wear.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Smile with your eyes: </strong>Learning to communicate warmth in new ways helped Brickman get over her self-consciousness about wearing a mask. That, and the fact that \u201cwhen you get into the city everyone\u2019s wearing them\u201d.</p></li> </ul>",

As unprecedented bushfires continue to rage across Australia\u2019s eastern and southern coasts, towns and cities across the country have recorded multiday stretches of hazardous air quality. Across the eastern and southern coasts of Australia, bushfire smoke has shut down businesses and major events and led doctors to warn of lasting health consequences. Hardware chain Bunnings has air-freighted in hundreds of thousands of face masks and respirators from international suppliers in order to keep up with demand. While many consumers are visiting their local hardware stores in order to acquire PM2.5 filtering face masks, others are looking online for a more comfortable, longer-wearing and stylish solution. As air quality worsens, premium reusable face masks are a growing accessory category worldwide. In China and India, lifestyle bloggers review them as they would a new nail polish shade or handbag. In Sydney, Scott Mitchell was an early adopter. He purchased an anti-pollution face mask online on 3 December. \u201cMy friends would tell you that I am very quick to \u2026 jump on a fad,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea of buying a mask appealed to me because it seemed very dumb at the time.\u201d Mitchell took strange pleasure in researching his purchase. \u201cIt\u2019s quite funny to get into the very small world of fashion face masks because the websites are trying to make something that is horrific seem quite appealing \u2026 There is a certain Blade Runner-y feeling of embracing our fashionable dystopia that I enjoyed.\u201d Eventually he settled on a respirator from Cambridge Mask Co. At A$48 plus shipping, the mask is lower cost than many other designer masks. Mitchell found the brand\u2019s extensive range of colours and prints appealing too, although his first choice \u2013 a shade of deep teal \u2013 was sold out. Cambridge Mask Co\u2019s chief operating officer Nina Griffee explains that the range of colours isn\u2019t about creating a product that\u2019s \u201cfashionable\u201d. She says fine particle-filtering face masks can look quite militaristic but \u201cby adding colour you can convince a five-year-old to wear a mask.\u201d The masks were originally developed for residents of highly polluted cities, where \u201cyou don\u2019t have one mask you have three or four,\u201d says Griffee. When wearing a face mask is commonplace \u201cit\u2019s nice if it matches your coat\u201d. As the days of poor air quality stretched on across swathes of eastern and southern Australia, what started as almost a joke became \u201creally handy and helpful\u201d for Mitchell. Those who\u2019d mocked him started to see sense in his decision. People even asked him for advice on social media, where he\u2019d shared photographs of himself wearing the mask. \u2018I look like a ninja\u2019 Around the time Mitchell was making his purchase, Katherine Brickman, who also lives in Sydney, was suffering from \u201ca smoker\u2019s cough that turned into a respiratory infection\u201d and realised \u201cI needed some way of commuting to work without getting sick\u201d. Brickman consulted with a co-worker \u2013 \u201ca real fashion kid\u201d \u2013 who was already wearing a mask, and then researched the health recommendations that had come out during the California wildfires of 2018. She decided there was \u201cno point in wearing one that\u2019s not comfortable\u201d, and eventually bought a mask from Swedish company Airinum. She describes their website as \u201cthe Apple store of face masks\u201d, and says she found their extensive fit information and video tutorials particularly persuasive. Airinum masks start at US$69. Brickman says \u201cthe one I got was slightly pricey, but I felt I could justify that cost because I can wash it and reuse it\u201d. The mask delivered on the promise of comfort, to some extent. \u201cIt has padding around the nose. It\u2019s as comfortable as you would expect a face mask to be. You get the warm air of your breath as you exhale on your face. That\u2019s not pleasant.\u201d However, she adds, \u201cI get so comfortable wearing it I sometimes almost go to drink coffee through it.\u201d Originally Brickman hoped for a mask that would not look \u201ctoo threatening\u201d. She opted for a simple black and laments: \u201cIt\u2019s threatening ... I look like a ninja.\u201d Face masks meet fashion Meo, a New Zealand-based anti-pollution mask manufacturer who use a wool filtration system, have a particularly bold fashion offering. They collaborated with one of New Zealand\u2019s biggest designers, Karen Walker, on a range of air masks that have interchangeable covers, featuring bird prints, filagrees and shooting stars. A representative for Karen Walker says Meo recently experienced \u201ca spike in sales in Australia across their range\u201d. Griffee, who is based between Hong Kong and Perth, says the demand for Cambridge Mask Co\u2019s product in Australia has been unprecedented. \u201cThis took everyone by surprise ... since customs have been busy over Christmas, we\u2019re having stock problems at the moment,\u201d although she adds they will have product back in stock on Amazon Australia over the next few days. Griffee has noticed \u201cunfortunately some opportunists will buy 10 or 20 masks and list them on Amazon for $100\u201d. She is dismayed by these acts of scalping, saying \u201cIt\u2019s not good behaviour \u2026 This is not a time when people should be profiteering. We hope to have this problem fixed as soon as possible.\u201d Jack Graham has also seen an uplift in inquiries from Australian residents since the bushfire crisis started. \u201cPeople just want to know when they can get them.\u201d He says while it has been \u201can opportunity\u201d, it is not one he relishes. \u201cWe took the air in Australia for granted,\u201d he says, explaining that the idea for the company was born out of the founders\u2019 appreciation for returning to fragrant Sydney air after trips overseas. Lately they\u2019ve been wearing their own prototypes because of the smoke. \u201cComing back to Australia was always refreshing for us. We lived near the bush, so we always had that clean air ... That\u2019s changed.\u201d Tips for would-be mask wearers Fit is key: The websites of most air filtration masks feature comprehensive fit information. Pay close attention because if the mask does not seal properly on your face, it will not protect against fine particles and it will not be comfortable. Wear it tight: \u201cIt\u2019s more comfortable when it\u2019s tighter,\u201d says Scott Mitchell. \u201cI\u2019d recommend anyone to really strap that thing in.\u201d Avoid lipstick: Katherine Brickman says she learned that tip the hard way. Say no to scalpers: Nina Griffee says Cambridge Mask Co\u2019s products retail at A$48 \u2013 if you spot their masks at a higher price, it is an unauthorised reseller. Keep it clean: One of the appeals of Airinum\u2019s masks, for Brickman, was the carry case they came in. \u201cThat way it wasn\u2019t getting dirty at the bottom of my handbag.\u201d While other masks, including Meo\u2019s, also come with carry pouches, any small drawstring bag should do. Pair with small-framed sunglasses: Good face masks tend to sit quite high on the bridge of your nose, making larger sunglasses uncomfortable to wear. Smile with your eyes: Learning to communicate warmth in new ways helped Brickman get over her self-consciousness about wearing a mask. That, and the fact that \u201cwhen you get into the city everyone\u2019s wearing them\u201d.",

Prior to a trip to Belfast, the prime minister welcomed the historic deal that restored the cross-community coalition at Stormont. \u201cAfter three years, Stormont is open for business again with an executive who can now move forward with improving people\u2019s lives and delivering for all communities in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. Johnson said he hoped in particular that the Northern Ireland executive would be able to resolve the current industrial action in the local NHS and drive forward public sector reforms. \u201cThe next decade will be an incredible time of opportunity for Northern Ireland and the whole of the United Kingdom as we come together to unleash the potential of our four nations,\u201d Johnson added. Johnson and the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, will hold talks with the DUP first minister, Arlene Foster, and Sinn F\u00e9in deputy first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill, at Stormont on Monday to demonstrate support for the new power-sharing government in the region, at the same time as the five-party cross-community coalition restarts the process of running the province\u2019s health, education, transport and other devolved ministries. The Northern Ireland assembly will reopen for business after an unprecedented Saturday sitting of the regional parliament that took place three years after the collapse of the power-sharing devolved government. Sinn F\u00e9in withdrew from the Stormont executive over the role of their main coalition partners, the Democratic Unionist party, in a controversial, botched green energy scheme that wasted hundreds of millions of pounds. Johnson said on Sunday that local politicians had \u201cshown great leadership\u201d in agreeing to what he described as a \u201cfair and balanced deal in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland\u201d. Varadkar said that political leaders in the region deserved praise \u201cfor their decision to put the people they represent first and make measured compromises to reach a deal\u201d. One of the first issues that the new devolved government will have to tackle is the crisis in the NHS. Northern Ireland has the longest waiting lists in the UK and is facing further strike action from NHS workers including nurses over a disparity in pay between them and their colleagues on the other side of the Irish Sea. The newly appointed health minister and former Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann pledged on Sunday to resolve the ongoing industrial action and will meet unions this week. Central government has promised to inject hundreds of millions of pounds into the Northern Ireland NHS in the aftermath of the political agreement that led to the restoration of the devolved government. The Irish government has also made financial pledges within the agreement to honour commitments to part-fund some north/south projects, such as the A5 dual carriageway and a redevelopment of the Ulster canal system. Commenting on the need to end the health strike, Swann said: \u201cObviously, the financial package for the new executive and support from other ministerial colleagues will be central to making that happen. We need our nurses and other health workers back at work. There\u2019s a massive challenge for all of us in making our health service better and our great staff have a vital role to play in that.\u201d The UUP health minister also vowed that he would not allow the two dominant parties in the ruling coalition \u2013 Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionists \u2013 to \u201cplay party politics with health\u201d. All of the ministries in the devolved government were allocated to parties in proportion to their seats in the assembly except Justice. That ministry is elected on a cross-community vote as part of an agreement dating back ten years. The centrist Alliance party and its leader, Naomi Long, will now head up the department in charge of policing and the courts because unionists have insisted that Sinn F\u00e9in cannot control the Justice ministry given that party\u2019s past association with the IRA. At the core of the deal that resurrected the devolved power-sharing government was a plan by the British and Irish government to create two new \u201clanguage commissioners\u201d as part of a cultural policy to put Irish on the same legal par with English while protecting Ulster British culture. Over the last three years Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s key demand to re-enter coalition with the Democratic Unionists has been for a stand-alone Irish language act that would put Gaelic on an equal par to English. Unionists have opposed such a move but, in a bid to address their concerns, the two governments drew up plans for \u201can Ulster British language commissioner dealing with Ulster Scots language and associated culture and heritage\u201d as well as an Irish language commissioner.",

The 2020 Sex and Power Index from the Fawcett Society, a women\u2019s rights and equality charity, charts how women remain missing in significant numbers from top jobs in politics, the law, civil service, trade unions, charities, professional bodies and sport bodies. The index, published on Monday 13 January, also reveals an alarming lack of women of colour across the top jobs in all sectors. Sam Smethers, the Fawcett Society\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cDespite much lip service about the importance of having women in top jobs, today\u2019s data shows we are still generations away from achieving anything close to equality. We are wasting women\u2019s talent and skills.\u201d She added: \u201cMale dominance of positions of power remains strong, as this 2020 Sex and Power Index shows. If we want change, we have to make it happen. That means quotas, targets and policy interventions to remove the barriers to women\u2019s progression.\u201d The report detailed how many women are in top jobs in different sectors, including: The law: the supreme Court now has two female justices out of 12 (17%). Since its formation in 2009, there has never been a minority ethnic supreme court judge. Business: just over one in 20 chief executives of FTSE 100 companies are women. None are women of colour. Education: women make up just 39% of secondary headteachers, a rise of 6% since 2005. Among university vice-chancellors, 30% are women \u2013 but only 1% of them are women are colour. Media: women comprise 21% of national newspaper editors, with four women in the top jobs. Sport: 21% of national sport governing body CEOs are women, down from 26% in 2018. Only 4% of football clubs who have ever been in the Premier League are led by women. House of Commons: 34% of MPs are women \u2013 up only 2% in the recent election. BAME women now make up 17% of female MPs, which is in line with the population as a whole. House of Lords: the proportion of women is at 27%. Only 2% of all peers are women of colour. Devolved parliaments/national assemblies: there are no minority ethnic women in the Scottish parliament, the Welsh national assembly or the Northern Ireland assembly. Cabinet: 30% of the cabinet are women, as are 47% of the shadow cabinet. Civil service: about a third of permanent secretaries are women (up from 31% in 2018 to 34% currently). There are no women of colour in these roles. The Fawcett Society is calling on the government to improve gender pay gap reporting by reducing the threshold for doing so to 100-plus employees, requiring companies to publish action plans and introducing reporting on the gender pay gap by ethnicity. It is also urging the introduction of time-limited quotas for use across public bodies and the boards of large corporate organisations and for the government to make flexible working the default. This report comes as the Fawcett Society launches the Pay and Progression of Women of Colour Project. Working in partnership with the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, the two-year investigation will seek to understand the inequalities and intersecting barriers faced by BAME women and the solutions they think will help them to overcome them. Dr Zubaida Haque, the trust\u2019s deputy director, said: \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing to think that there has been a significant and growing black and ethnic minority population in this country (now one in six people) since the arrival of Empire Windrush in 1948 and yet we have never had a non-white supreme court judge, or a civil service permanent secretary or a CEO of FTSE 100 companies who is a woman of colour.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2020. An earlier version said \u201conly 4% of Premier League clubs are led by women\u201d. To clarify, the research looked at the 49 clubs who have ever been in the Premier League, not the 20 who currently hold that status.",
