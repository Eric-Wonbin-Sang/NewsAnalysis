Its estimate is based on an analysis of data in the NHS Staff Survey of the views and experiences of 497,000 health service personnel in England. The most recent edition of the survey, published in February, found that many staff put in extra hours for no extra pay, and that some do as much as 11 hours a week unpaid overtime. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said staff working beyond their standard shift were paying the price for the NHS\u2019s widespread workforce shortages. \u201cThe NHS is in crisis after nearly a decade of Tory cuts and it\u2019s a disgrace that its dedicated staff, who always put their patients first, are having to pick up the pieces to fill the gaps left by this crisis made in Downing Street,\u201d Ashworth said. The number of vacant posts in the NHS in England has risen in recent years, leaving hospitals, ambulance services and mental health services short of about 100,000 doctors, nurses and other staff. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s Tories have let the NHS, its staff and our country badly down by intentionally slashing funding for staff training and scrapping the nursing bursary,\u201d Ashworth added. Applications to study nursing have fallen by 30% and the number of students starting relevant degree courses by 9% since then chancellor, George Osborne, scrapped the bursary for nurses, midwives and some other health professionals in 2016. NHS bosses privately regard that as a serious mistake. Labour\u2019s analysis highlights the staff survey\u2019s finding that doctors and dentists work an average of 3.6 hours a week unpaid overtime.

An interim version of the long-awaited NHS People Plan, unveiled in June, did not include measures to boost numbers that would involve spending more money or altering immigration rules. However, Johnson last week unveiled plans to make it easier for overseas doctors and nurses to come to Britain and work in the NHS. Dave Prentis, Unison\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cChronic understaffing has left us with a system propped up by the goodwill of devoted health workers.

      "bodyText": "The Chilean singer Mon Laferte exposed her breasts during a broadcast of the Latin Grammys, in the latest of a string of high-profile shows of support for anti-government demonstrators in her home country. The 36-year-old singer-songwriter made her silent protest against police brutality on Thursday night as she walked the award ceremony\u2019s red carpet in Las Vegas. At one point, Laferte stopped and opened her black jacket to reveal the phrase \u201cEn Chile torturan violan y matan\u201d written on her chest \u2013 \u201cIn Chile they torture, rape and kill\u201d. Chile has been racked by more than a month of protests over political exclusion and economic inequality. More than 20 people have died in the unrest, at least five of them at the hands of state forces, who have also been accused of torture, rape and indiscriminate violence during the crackdown. Hundreds have been blinded after being shot with pellet guns by riot police, and thousands have been arrested, though most have been released soon after. Laferte went on to win the award for best alternative album \u2013 which she dedicated to the people of Chile. Later, she posted an image of her Grammys protest on Instagram, with the caption \u201cmy body free for a free homeland\u201d. Chilean musicians and sportsmen and women have been outspoken in their expressions of support for the protests, which started over a hike in subway fares and transformed into demands for sweeping changes to the economic and political model established by the dictator August Pinochet. Protesters won a significant victory early on Friday when the national congress agreed to hold a referendum next year to replace the constitution, but it was unclear if that move would be enough to placate the wave of fury against the embattled president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era. This week, players with the national football team announced they would not participate in next week\u2019s friendly against Peru. \u201cWe\u2019re footballers but above all we\u2019re people and citizens,\u201d the captain, Gary Medel, who plays in defence for Bologna, wrote on Twitter. \u201cRight now Chile has much more important priorities than next Tuesday\u2019s match.\u201d Several players also expressed support. \u201cThere\u2019s a difficult atmosphere and in my opinion we shouldn\u2019t play out of respect for what\u2019s happening in the country,\u201d Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s 74-time capped midfielder Charles Ar\u00e1nguiz said. The decision to cancel the game was taken following \u201ca team meeting\u201d on Wednesday morning at Chile\u2019s training center on the outskirts of the capital, Santiago, ANFP said. Coach Reinaldo Rueda then released all his players back to their clubs. The protest has also reached Chile\u2019s national jiu-jitsu team after players Iv\u00e1n Le\u00f3n and Cristian Araya unfurled protest banners on the podium after winning bronze in a match against Argentina. At the awards, Mon Laferte was one of several artists who spoke about the political climate in several Latin American countries.",

      "bodyText": "Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch became the third witness to testify in public impeachment hearings on Friday investigating whether Donald Trump sought to bribe Ukraine to boost his chance of re-election by investigating a US political rival. Yovanovitch was recalled by Trump from her post in Ukraine in May, shortly after the state department had asked her to stay on another year. \u201cThe question before us is not whether Donald Trump could recall an American ambassador with a stellar reputation for fighting corruption in Ukraine,\u201d said House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, \u201cbut why would he want to?\u201d Here are key takeaways from a hearing which sought to answer that question: 1) A bombshell hearing After relatively subdued testimony on Wednesday, the impeachment inquiry accelerated dramatically on Friday as Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators she felt \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d by Trump\u2019s personal attacks on her, and that she was \u201camazed\u201d corrupt elements in Ukraine had found willing American partners to take her down. While Trump has denied wrongdoing, the feeling that something very wrong indeed had happened was palpable as Yovanovitch, a widely respected, 33-year veteran of the foreign service, described her recall and a smear campaign that preceded it. 2) Trump\u2019s Twitter attack As Yovanovitch spoke, Trump unloaded on Twitter, writing \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?\u201d and \u201cIt is the US president\u2019s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\u201d Then, in an astonishing moment of political theater, Schiff read the tweets to Yovanovitch in real time and asked her to reply. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have such powers,\u201d she said. \u201cNot in Mogadishu, Somalia, and other places.\u201d Asked how it felt to be personally attacked by the president, Yovanovitch said, \u201cthe effect is intimidating.\u201d Schiff replied: \u201cI want to let you know that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.\u201d Fox News host Bret Baier tweeted on the possible consequences for Trump of his reckless tweet: \u201cShe was already a sympathetic witness &amp; the president\u2019s tweet ripping her allowed Schiff to point it out real time characterizing it as witness tampering or intimidation \u2013 adding an article of impeachment real-time.\u201d 3) The cowed Republicans So persuasive a figure was Yovanovitch \u2013 so plain was her dedication to country and seriousness of purpose \u2013 that not only did Republicans not dare to attack her, they often took turns praising her service and thanking her for it. The sharpest attack on Yovanovitch was leveled by Devin Nunes, the senior Republican on the committee, who wrote off Yovanovitch\u2019s dismissal as a mundane personnel matter. \u201cThis seems more appropriate for the subcommittee for human resources of the foreign affairs committee if there\u2019s issues with employment,\u201d Nunes said. But the visibly de-energized Republican side failed to mount a substantive rebuttal to Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony. 4) Enter Rudy For the first time in the impeachment hearings, investigators shone a spotlight on the role of Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal emissary who pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden while leading a smear campaign against Yovanovitch. The ambassador said she became aware Giuliani was spreading lies about her, accusing her of being an enemy of the president, early this year. Giuliani\u2019s motivations are under investigation by federal prosecutors. Two of his associates were trying to start a liquid natural gas export business in Ukraine, while a third associate, former general prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko, had previously clashed with Yovanovitch and wanted \u201crevenge,\u201d according to testimony. Last spring, Lutsenko gave Giuliani something he \u2013 and Trump \u2013 wanted: negative news lines in the US media about Joe Biden, from an official Ukrainian source: Lutsenko himself. 5) Danger ahead for Trump As the public hearing drew to a close, a new witness, David Holmes, arrived for a closed-door deposition. Ambassador Bill Taylor testified that Holmes, his aide, overheard Trump in a phone call ask ambassador Gordon Sondland how the \u201cinvestigations\u201d in Ukraine were coming. Holmes\u2019 arrival pointed to a potentially rocky week ahead for Trump. Holmes himself might testify in public. Sondland is scheduled to appear on Wednesday and could give damning first hand testimony about what Trump wanted in Ukraine, and why. \u201cWhile you are the beginning of this story, you are not the end of it,\u201d Schiff told Yovanovitch at the close of her testimony.",

And obviously, probably this arena, the O2, is the most special for me where I play my best tennis. The atmosphere here is something that we don\u2019t play in at all, anywhere else in the world. This is so special to us. Thank you very much for all the support and I hope a lot of you guys will come out tomorrow.</p> <p>Especially today, he has nothing to lose anymore, it\u2019s his last match of the season where he can just enjoy tennis, enjoy the atmosphere, enjoy the stadium and for me it was a must-win situation to go through. And yeah, he\u2019s probably been the best player in the world over the summer. Making it to 6 straight finals is unbelievable - you\u2019ve not seen that in a long time. So all credits to him, it was an unbelievable year. From basically being 20 in the world in the beginning of the year to world number 4 now is something incredible and I\u2019m sure next year he\u2019s going to be dangerous as well.</p> <p>I think I played two great matches, to be honest. The one in the middle wasn\u2019t the best but I\u2019m still through and that\u2019s the most important. Obviously, very special night against Rafa, my first win against him obviously in this stadium as well. I still gotta improve. It doesn\u2019t get easier now. We\u2019re in the semi-finals, only the best four players are still out here and of course I have to play my best tennis to have another chance.</p> <p>Actually, at this stage, not tough at all. We\u2019re playing the semi-finals of the world tour finals. I mean, playing here against your friend means that both of you have done incredibly well throughout the whole year and obviously also this week.

      "bodyText": "Saturday\u2019s order of play 2pm: [6] Stefanos Tsitsipas v Roger Federer [3] 8pm: [5] Dominic Thiem v Alexander Zverev [7] Finally, here is Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report from this afternoon. That\u2019s all from me today after another great day of tennis at the O2 Arena. Nadal vs Tsitsipas ended up as perhaps the second best match of the week and we have a fitting pair of semi-finals in store. With Nadal out, only 38 year-old Federer will represent the big 3 in the semis. Can he keep the youngsters at bay for one more week? Here is Sascha Zverev in his on-court interview: I\u2019m in the semis now again. And obviously, probably this arena, the O2, is the most special for me where I play my best tennis. The atmosphere here is something that we don\u2019t play in at all, anywhere else in the world. This is so special to us. Thank you very much for all the support and I hope a lot of you guys will come out tomorrow. Especially today, he has nothing to lose anymore, it\u2019s his last match of the season where he can just enjoy tennis, enjoy the atmosphere, enjoy the stadium and for me it was a must-win situation to go through. And yeah, he\u2019s probably been the best player in the world over the summer. Making it to 6 straight finals is unbelievable - you\u2019ve not seen that in a long time. So all credits to him, it was an unbelievable year. From basically being 20 in the world in the beginning of the year to world number 4 now is something incredible and I\u2019m sure next year he\u2019s going to be dangerous as well. I think I played two great matches, to be honest. The one in the middle wasn\u2019t the best but I\u2019m still through and that\u2019s the most important. Obviously, very special night against Rafa, my first win against him obviously in this stadium as well. I still gotta improve. It doesn\u2019t get easier now. We\u2019re in the semi-finals, only the best four players are still out here and of course I have to play my best tennis to have another chance. Actually, at this stage, not tough at all. We\u2019re playing the semi-finals of the world tour finals. I mean, playing here against your friend means that both of you have done incredibly well throughout the whole year and obviously also this week. It\u2019s a great honour to play against him, he\u2019s been unbelievable this year and it\u2019s gonna be a fun match hopefully. A strange match! Medvedev served incredibly well for long stretches, but other than that, he didn\u2019t have too much to offer. Understandably so, considering he is already out of the tournament. Zverev did what he had to do, more or less matching the Russian\u2019s serving, coming to the net well and playing a clean match to move into the semi-final. 21 winners and 19 errors from the German. The defending champ continues to fight for his title. The German does just enough to see out his rival. He will face Dominic Thiem in the semi-final. Tsitsipas will face Federer. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 6-6 (3-5) Alexander Zverev: Hawk-eye is Sascha Zverev\u2019s best friend. First Medvedev stops the point at *2-1 to challenge a deep forehand from the German, which hawkeye deems in. Then Zverev crushes a huge forehand down the line at 3-2 to Medvedev. The ball is called out but he challenges. A big serve from Zverev and a double fault from Medvedev. Suddenly, the German is two points away. That 104mph forehand from Zverev early on. Nice. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 6-6 Alexander Zverev: It\u2019s tiebreak time. Zverev crushes more huge serves and seals off another hold with a smooth backhand down the line. This was always the likeliest outcome. Now let\u2019s see who can keep up that serving and who will fail. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 6-5* Alexander Zverev: This set has moved at such a blinding pace. Medvedev once again saunters through a love service game. After sprinting to the net and slamming down a smash, he holds with an ace down the T. He has lost 4 points on his serve in this set. Zverev has lot 5. Easy. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 *5-5 Alexander Zverev: Medvedev took the first point of the game to move within three points of taking the set, but nothing more. Zverev responded with more nuclear serving to edge ahead again. Medvedev will rue the missed routine forehand at 30-15, but Zverev held to 30 with a huge serve followed by a solid overhead. A tiebreak is on the horizon. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 5-4* Alexander Zverev: That was a fantastic hold from Medvedev, saving break point to move within a game of levelling the match. After failing to win a point on Medvedev\u2019s serve for so long, Zverev finally made his move, crushing a great crosscourt forehand winner to lead 0-30. But Medvedev responded with two successive big serves. After double faulting to fall down break point, the Russian slammed an ace out wide and then a huge forehand down the line to move up game point. After a gruelling point, a Zverev backhand flew long and Medvedev survives. The crowd is cheering - no doubt they want Nadal in the semi-final and another Federer-Nadal classic in London. No doubt they also just want a great match. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 *4-4 Alexander Zverev: Is Zverev feeling the pressure after failing to win a point on Medvedev\u2019s serve for three and a half games? No chance. He slams down a love hold of his own with a series of huge serves. A huge 104mph forehand down the line winner from the German. He closed it off with a 120mph ace out wide. We continue. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 4-3* Alexander Zverev: Medvedev is growing in stature and he slams down yet another love hold to move ahead again. He struck a bomb of a crosscourt backhand winner to move up to 40-0, then forced a backhand error from Zverev with a nice inside out forehand. Medvedev has now won 14 points in a row on serve. Untouchable. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 *3-3 Alexander Zverev: At last, some pressure! Zverev led 30-0 with 15 points in a row on serve between the pair when he dumped a volley into the net after a nice low backhand passing shot from Medvedev. Zverev then double faulted badly to bring up 30-30. But he shrugged off the pressure and threw down two huge first serves to scupper the danger. No problem. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 3-2* Alexander Zverev: The break won\u2019t come here! Medvedev pounds more serves and collects another love hold, sealed with a big crosscourt forehand. He has now won 10 points in a row on his serve. The Russian\u2019s confidence seems to be growing. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 *2-2 Alexander Zverev. This time Zverev holds for 15 with yet another booming service game of his own. This time, he dismounts with a 140mph service winner down the T. Who will make the first move on return? Both players are in such a good service rhythm right now and have lost a combined two points on their serves so far in this set. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 2-1* Alexander Zverev: Medvedev holds with love service game of his own, pounding a great crosscourt forehand to move up 40-0. On game point, Zverev misses a forehand return. We move on. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 *1-1 Alexander Zverev: Zverev responds with a love hold of his own, closing off with a service winner down the T. It\u2019s difficult to overstate how quickly these service games are moving. Two 6\u20196 big servers on a fast court taking very little time between points. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 1-0* Alexander Zverev: Medvedev shrugs off the first set and holds to 15 with another slick hold and plenty of big serving, sealing the hold with a service winner. He is still in this match. First set: Daniil Medvedev 4-6 Alexander Zverev: Alexander Zverev is a set away from the semi-finals. Just as it seemed that Zverev had the set in his grasp, it all came a little undone. Zverev blasted a forehand drive volley long, then Medvedev easily slotted a forehand passing shot after a weak drop shot from Zverev. But the German has played well and he knows it. He remained calm and responded with a couple of big forehands on the first point, then some huge serving. He sealed the set with a big crosscourt forehand. Good work. First set: Daniil Medvedev 4-5* Alexander Zverev: These games are moving comically fast. Both players are serving huge and moving really quickly between points. Medvedev strings together another series of big serves, holding with a sweet forehand winner down the line. First set: Daniil Medvedev *3-5 Alexander Zverev: Zverev pieces together another great hold. The German keeps on coming forward - a nice little serve and volley from him at 30-15. A Medvedev return flies well long and the German is a game away. Q. I know that No. 1 at the start of the season wasn\u2019t a target for you at the end of the year, but now that you have it, now that you\u2019re sitting next to that trophy, does this mean as much to you as winning a Grand Slam? RAFAEL NADAL: Is different to -- I know is something big, and I know is something so important because it\u2019s something that you did it because to achieve this you have to play well 11 months. To win a Grand Slam you have to play well two weeks. But it\u2019s difficult to compare. For me personally, when you win a Grand Slam, you win a Grand Slam winning the last point, and that feeling you can\u2019t have it here, you know. You know, that\u2019s the big difference, you know. So I don\u2019t want to compare because will be not fair. Both things are great. Winning, for example, the US Open this year have been super emotional, especially the way that this have been. Having this with me is something unexpected and very emotional for me, because I think after all the things that I went through, means a lot to have this with me, no? Difficult to compare. Both things important. I don\u2019t want to say one (smiling). First set: Daniil Medvedev 3-4* Alexander Zverev: Medvedev responds with a lightning fast hold of his own. Plenty of big serving and sealed with his fourth ace. First set: Daniil Medvedev *2-4 Alexander Zverev: The most shocking stat of the day so far: Zverev is 5/5 in net points today. Zverev is one of the least capable net players in the top 50 and his confidence there today reflects his confidence in general. He produced a pair of really nice volleys at 15-15, then slammed down two successive aces to hold. Zverev\u2019s final ace was 144mph. It must be his biggest serve so far. Will he go higher? First set: Daniil Medvedev 2-3* Alexander Zverev: Medvedev was just down 0-30 and staring down the possibility of a double break. How did he react? Ace, ace, 131mph second serve ace. He held after a Zverev backhand flew long. Medvedev has no reason to hold back on second serves considering he is already out of the event. Expect more bombs soon. First set: Daniil Medvedev *1-3 Alexander Zverev: Zverev edges out a hold to retain his lead, but it sure wasn\u2019t easy. Medvedev is starting to make some progress and moved to 15-30 with a beautiful dropshot. But after a forehand error, Zverev won the essential 30-30 point by forcing a Medvedev error with some punishing crosscourt forehands. He held with a huge unreturned serve. I previously mentioned Zverev\u2019s big serving - he\u2019s currently averaging 139mph. A pressing question. Q. You turned 21 this year. I\u2019m curious if you actually feel like a grown adult? STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Yeah, yeah, for sure. I think this growth in me was also connecting with other people, which I wasn\u2019t really willing in a way to do before, because I was really concentrating on my tennis. That first interaction kind of got me a little bit more -- just got me to realize certain things that I didn\u2019t know before and how this world works and everything. And also, I was struggling as a child with fear of rejection, so I was never really able to open up and say what I feel and whatever. So this kind of has matured me over the last couple of months, taught me a lot of things. I feel much more as a 21-year-old now than I did before. It was also something that helped a lot, not just in my tennis over the last couple of months but also in my behavior and my everyday life. First set: Daniil Medvedev 1-2* Alexander Zverev: Some good work there from Medvedev to put himself on the board with a hold to 15. He opened the game really well with a great lob after chasing a Zverev dropshot at full sprint and the Russian closed it all up with a vicious forehand down the line set up by a big serve. First set: Daniil Medvedev *0-2 Alexander Zverev: Zverev has been serving absolutely huge this week, frequently scaling 140mph and above. He does so again in the opening game, slamming down an easy hold to 15. Beyond the big serving, a nice attempt at a drop shot at 30-15. The German moved in behind it and slotted away the easy volley. He looks very composed so far. First set: Daniil Medvedev 0-1* Alexander Zverev: That was a very shaky start from Medvedev, who looked like he was trying to shorten ralles as much as possible. Zverev just loaded every single ball onto the Russian\u2019s forehand and watched as he hit himself out of his first service game. However, the most eventful part of that game was Boris Becker attempting to catch a wayward ball in the stands. He failed and then he bowed his head in shame. Chin up, Boris. And who will be the world\u2019s second biggest Daniil Medvedev fan for the next few hours? The Russian\u2019s great enemy Stefanos Tsitsipas. If Medvedev wins, Tsitsipas faces Thiem and Nadal will face Federer. If Zverev wins, he will face Thiem and Tsitsipas will have to face Federer. Do check out Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report on Rafael Nadal\u2019s brilliant victory over Tsitsipas today. He will be the world\u2019s biggest Daniil Medvedev fan today. Here are the highlights from Medvedev\u2019s comprehensive win over Zverev. He turned the tables on Zverev this year, but for how long? Zverev leads the head to head 4-1, but Medvedev won their most recent meeting in the final. This will always be an interesting match-up given the contrasting routes of their young careers. Zverev broke through much earlier than Medvedev and has long since established himself as a future star, whereas Medvedev has been the revelation of the year. Their two diverging career routes reflect the fact that every player has their own path and they find their way in their own time. Zverev had some fighting words when looking ahead to his match against Medvedev... Q. Do you think when you play Daniil on Friday he\u2019ll be more tougher to beat because he\u2019s got nothing to lose? ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Is he out? He\u2019s out, right? No, he\u2019s not out. He\u2019s not out. If he wins in two... So there you go. He still has something to play for, I guess. He\u2019s not going to win in two, though. (Laughter.) Hello! Welcome to our coverage of the final group match of the ATP finals where Alexander Zverev will be looking to reach the semi-finals when he faces Daniil Medvedev in the O2 Arena. The scenario here is very simple: If Zverev wins, he advances from the group in second place and will face Dominic Thiem tomorrow. Medvedev is out, but if he wins then Rafael Nadal will qualify. This is a particularly strange situation because it\u2019s so rare for tennis players to play with nothing on the line. It is really anybody\u2019s guess how Medvedev will react to the situation. Will he care at all now that he can\u2019t qualify? Will he be determined to finish his first ATP Finals with a win? Will he play like he has nothing to lose in the rare instance where it\u2019s actually true? Who knows. We\u2019ll soon find out.",

      "bodyText": "But the evening belongs to the flying Finns, who have made it to the finals of a major championship for the very first time in their history. An end to 81 years of hurt. And a perfect excuse to whip off the old breeks and lounge around in your string vest and pants, sipping on a couple of ice-cold tins. Go on, enjoy yourself. Nobody\u2019s watching, and anyway, life\u2019s too short. Congratulations Finland, and thanks for reading Clockwatch! It\u2019s been a great evening for Sweden, who have secured their qualification from Group F. Switzerland meanwhile are as good as there, providing they don\u2019t embarrass themselves by failing to win in Gibraltar on Monday night. Denmark just need to avoid defeat in Dublin to make it through themselves, but that\u2019s easier said than done, given an Irish win would see Mick McCarthy\u2019s men through instead. It\u2019s going to be some match. With that, all the full-time results are in. Well done to Malta for limiting Spain to seven this time, a five-goal improvement on the farce of 1983. Bosnia-Herzegovina 0-3 Italy Denmark 6-0 Gibraltar Romania 0-2 Sweden Spain 7-0 Malta Switzerland 1-0 Georgia GOAL! Denmark 6-0 Gibraltar (Eriksen 90+3). Joe Chipolita, playing out from the back, rolls the ball straight at Christian Eriksen, who slams the ball into the bottom right. A ruthless punishment. Chipolita may now wish he\u2019d been sent off in the first half for barging into the ref. The ball drops towards Robert Skov, free, 12 yards out. He could take a touch and score, but opts for the spectacular volley instead. Swish! Air-swipe! Bah! There goes his chance for an international hat-trick. They don\u2019t come along every day, Robert, you know. GOAL! Spain 7-0 Malta (Navas 85). Jesus Navas, formerly of Manchester City, now of Sevilla, moves Spain into rout territory. If Malta ship a goal a minute for the remainder of the game, their infamous 1983 collapse will be overwritten in the record books. GOAL! Denmark 5-0 Gibraltar (Eriksen 85). Christian Eriksen cuts in from the right and shapes to shoot towards the left-hand corner. But instead he switches aim towards the bottom right. Kyle Goldwin is rooted to the spot, wrong-footed, and in it whistles. The Danes have been much better in this second half. After a slow start, this is becoming a real confidence builder ahead of Dublin. That\u2019s a huge goal for the Swiss, who as things stand leapfrog the Republic of Ireland into second place in Group D. They\u2019d be one point behind Denmark, and two ahead of the Irish, with only a visit to Gibraltar left on their itinerary. In other words, if they hold on to win tonight, they\u2019re practically through. Ireland and Denmark would battle it out for the final qualification spot on Monday. GOAL! Switzerland 1-0 Georgia (Itten 77). The Swiss break the deadlock in St Gallen! And it\u2019s a delightful goal. Denis Zakaria, to the right of the D, floats a diagonal chip towards Cedric Itten, who guides a gorgeously weighted header back across Giorgi Loria and into the right-hand corner. Incidentally, Spain\u2019s third, initially credited to Paco Alcacer, is now officially the work of Villarreal centre-back Pau Torres. Another debut goal. GOAL! Spain 6-0 Malta (Gerard 71). It continues, Villarreal striker Gerard the latest to chip in. It was still 8-1 at this point in 1983, so the 2019 vintage is catching up a bit. Oh Malta. GOAL! Spain 5-0 Malta (Olmo 69). Young winger Dani Olmo of Dinamo Zagreb, making his debut for Spain, gets on the scoresheet. If Malta aren\u2019t careful, this could soon turn into an ersatz tribute to that Euro 84 miracle. GOAL! Spain 4-0 Malta (Sarabia 63). Pablo Sarabia of PSG adds another. The 1983 score at this stage: 8-1, Poli Rincon completing a hat-trick just one minute after Maceda\u2019s aforementioned second. GOAL! Denmark 4-0 Gibraltar (Skov 64). The Danes wake up again. Daniel Wass makes it to the byline out on the right, then cuts back for Robert Skov, who opens his body and sidefoots crisply into the bottom left. GOAL! Spain 3-0 Malta (Alcacer 62). Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Paco Alcacer makes it three for the Red Fury. It was 7-1 at this point back in 1983, Antonio Maceda having just scored his second goal in three minutes. That quick double whammy apart, watching Denmark has been hard work this evening. To be fair, they\u2019ll already have one eye on Monday night\u2019s match in Dublin, and will be conserving energy accordingly. But still, this is time none of us are ever getting back. GOAL! Bosnia-Herzegovina 0-3 Italy (Belotti 52). Torino striker Andrea Belotti sends the runaway Group J leaders away down Easy Street. GOAL! Denmark 3-0 Gibraltar (Braithwaite 51). The Danes are clearly in the mind to right the wrongs of their turgid first-half display. Eriksen crosses from the left. Goldwin parries weakly, teeing up the in-rushing Martin Braithwaite, who smashes home with great feeling! GOAL! Denmark 2-0 Gibraltar (Gytkjaer 47). That\u2019s livened everyone up! A garden variety punt down the middle. Kyle Goldwin in the Gibraltar goal should deal with it easily, but instead rushes rashly out of his area, misjudging the flight, letting the ball bound over his confused noggin. Christian Gytkjaer is on hand to poke into an empty net. Oh dear. Here we go again, then. The second halves are underway, all across Europe. Despite the restart, it\u2019s fairly quiet at the Telia Parken in Copenhagen. Maybe everyone\u2019s got bored and chipped off down Mikkeller. Half-time Eurotainment. The half-time scores: Bosnia-Herzegovina 0-2 Italy Denmark 1-0 Gibraltar Romania 0-2 Sweden Spain 2-0 Malta Switzerland 0-0 Georgia Denmark troop off at the break in Copenhagen, currently held to a single goal by the minnows of Gibraltar. A smattering of boos. It\u2019s not exactly been dynamite. Speaking of which, any old excuse ... and if you haven\u2019t bought the classic book, be about your business! GOAL! Spain 2-0 Malta (Cazorla 41). Santi Cazorla with a second for Spain. All good and well, but they were 3-1 up by this stage in 1983. Standards are clearly slipping. GOAL! Bosnia-Herzegovina 0-2 Italy (Insigne 37). Lorenzo Insigne of Napoli puts the Azzurri one step closer to a perfect qualification record. GOAL! Romania 0-2 Sweden (Quaison 34). It looks as though Sweden are going to do a number on the Romanians again. Mainz striker Robin Quaison has doubled the Bl\u00e5gult\u2019s lead. As things stand, the Swedes will be at Euro 2020 next summer. In lieu of action, anyone for satire? Here\u2019s Simon McMahon. \u201cCongratulations to Finland blah blah blah, but I think even Scotland could have qualified from a group including the likes of Italy, Greece and Bosnia - it\u2019s not like any of them have won anything recently, is it? Unlike European giants Cyprus, Kazakhstan and San Marino that Scotland found themselves paired with. It\u2019s a conspiracy, I tell you.\u201d In Copenhagen, Gibraltar\u2019s Joe Chipolina has been booked for barging into the referee in the style of a galoot. He was unhappy at not being awarded a free kick, and \u201caccidentally\u201d ran into Istvan Vad of Hungary. That was hilariously saucy, an act of brazen cheek. He\u2019s very fortunate not to see red. GOAL! Spain 1-0 Malta (Morata 23). Alvaro Morata opens the scoring in Cadiz. Ah, Miles and Gil. GOAL! Romania 0-1 Sweden (Berg 18). First blood to the Swedes in Bucharest, drawn by Krasnodar striker Marcus Berg. GOAL! Bosnia-Herzegovina 0-1 Italy (Acerbi 21). Francesco Acerbi of Lazio opens the scoring for the 1968 champions, who have already won Group J at a canter. They\u2019re eight wins from eight, and are already in good shape to maintain their 100 percent record. Georgia are asking a few questions of the Swiss in the early exchanges in St Gallen. Kvilitaia, falling backwards, scoops a shot onto the right-hand post. Very unlucky. Meanwhile there\u2019s more goalframe-bothering action back in Copenhagen, where Jorgensen crashes a header off the crossbar from a couple of yards. Wass is hacked down by Olivero, just to the right of the Gibraltar box. It\u2019s one of the most ludicrously agricultural clatters you\u2019re ever likely to see, and the defender\u2019s got some brass neck arguing the toss as he goes in the referee\u2019s notebook. Skov, high on life, wastes the free kick by going direct for goal from a tight angle with way too much height and power. GOAL! Denmark 1-0 Gibraltar (Skov 12). A messy scramble in the Gibraltar box. Goldwin flaps, Roy Chipolina can\u2019t hack clear, and amid a melee also involving Eriksen and Braithwaite, Skov flicks home while falling to the floor. Skov finds plenty of space as he enters the Gibraltar box on the right. He dinks the ball past the keeper Goldwin, but Roy Chipolina is on hand to hack clear. Denmark\u2019s first real chance passes by. But no matter, because ... Nothing came of the corner, by the way. No quick starts in any of the five matches. Gibraltar can\u2019t get out of their half during the opening exchanges. It\u2019s something of a surprise, then, when they win the first corner of the match. It\u2019s gift-wrapped by Kjaer and Schmeichel, the former lumping a blind backpass towards a keeper nowhere near his own area. Very clumsy. Denmark are very fortunate that Kjaer\u2019s backpass wasn\u2019t directed at the goal, because had it been, that was one for Danny Baker\u2019s next bloopers VHS tape, whenever that\u2019s coming out. Here we go then! The five evening kick-offs are underway. Let\u2019s start by keeping an eye on Gibraltar, and how long they can hold out against Denmark in a very wet Copenhagen. Romania versus Sweden has plenty of historical resonance too. Revisit their USA \u201894 quarter final with the World Cup\u2019s premier historian. Ah yes, Spain versus Malta. Enjoy, enjoy. The teamsheets for the 7.45pm kick-offs have landed. Here they are, for your perusal ...

There are still five qualifiers to play, but whatever happens next, tonight belongs to Finland. And in particular Norwich City striker Teemu Pukki, whose nine goals in nine matches have propelled the Finns to their first-ever major finals. Only Harry Kane, Eran Zahavi and Cristiano Ronaldo have scored more during this campaign, and that\u2019s mighty fine company to be keeping. Giddy supporters are still cavorting across the pitch. In the stand, the great Jari Litmanen smiles beatifically. And up and down this vast country, Pukki parties will be breaking out, the striker\u2019s name sung all across the land... FULL TIME: Brazil 0-1 Argentina Lionel Messi\u2019s first-half goal, the rebound off his missed penalty, was the difference in Riyadh, and gives the Albiceleste (displaced) local bragging rights. FULL TIME: Armenia 0-1 Greece FULL TIME: Norway 4-0 Faroe Islands The other two early kick-offs end quietly by comparison. The 2004 champions Greece keep their play-off hopes alive with a win in Armenia. Norway are assured of a play-off berth whatever, but they\u2019ve kept hold of their dream of automatic qualification. FULL TIME: Finland 3-0 Lichtenstein. Jasse Tuominen and Teemu Pukki bring an end to 81 years of hurt, as Finland qualify for a major finals for the very first time in their history! Helsinki erupts in delight. The pitch fills with fans. A few eyes fill with tears. It\u2019s been a long wait. It\u2019s going to be a long night. Time to strip off the breeks and crack open a tin; the evening\u2019s only just begun. There won\u2019t be a hat-trick tonight for Teemu Pukki. He\u2019s substituted with six minutes to play, and having scored his eighth and ninth goals of Finland\u2019s first-ever successful qualifying campaign, receives the thunderous ovation he deserves! A huge smile breaks out deep within that hipster\u2019s beard. Finland are in full Pukki party mode now. Joni Kauko lashes a shot goalwards, only to see his rising effort deflected just over the bar. Lichtenstein just about deal with the two corners that follow, but the visitors are beginning to look rather ragged now, having defended so staunchly for so long. GOAL! Finland 3-0 Lichtenstein (Pukki 75). The goal-hungry Teemu Pukki latches onto a pass down the middle, rounds the keeper on the right, slaps a first shot against the chest of Andreas Malin on the line, then whips his second attempt past the brave defender and in. Finland\u2019s participation at Euro 2020 is beyond all doubt now! Incidentally, old pals Brazil and Argentina are currently shaking their hips for coin in Saudi Arabia. Here\u2019s the team-sheet for that one: Brazil: Alisson, Danilo, Eder Militao, Thiago Silva, Alex Sandro, Casemiro, Arthur, Lucas Paqueta, Gabriel Jesus, Willian, Firmino. Subs: Santos, Fuzato, Emerson, Renan Lodi, Felipe, Marquinhos, Fabinho, Douglas Luiz, Coutinho, Rodrygo, Richarlison, Wesley. Argentina: Andrada, Foyth, Pezzella, Otamendi, Tagliafico, De Paul, Paredes, Lo Celso, Messi, Lautaro Martinez, Ocampos. Subs: Marchesin, Musso, Damian Martinez, Acuna, Alario, Dominguez, Dybala, Gonzalez, Kannemann, Aguero, Pereyra, Perez, Rodriguez, Rojo, Saravia. They\u2019re midway through the second half right now, and it\u2019s been eventful. Gabriel Jesus won a penalty for Brazil, then missed it. Not long after, Lionel Messi earned a spot kick for Argentina ... and his effort was saved by Alisson Becker! Unfortunately for the Brazil and Liverpool keeper, he could only tee up Messi to slot home the rebound on 14 minutes. GOAL! Norway 3-0 Faroe Islands (Sorloth 62) GOAL! Norway 4-0 Faroe Islands (Sorloth 65) Well, the substitute Alexander Sorloth isn\u2019t messing about, is he. Two in three minutes for the young striker, currently on loan at Trabzonspor from our very own Crystal Palace. GOAL! Finland 2-0 Liechtenstein (Pukki 64 pen). Teemu Pukki slams his eighth goal of the campaign into the bottom left corner, sending the keeper the wrong way! Finland are now so, so close to their first-ever finals, and Helsinki erupts in delight! Penalty for Finland! Teemu Pukki very nearly loops a header into the top right. It\u2019s clawed out. But the Finns come straight back at Liechtenstein. Pyry Soiri cuts in from the left, and his driving run is brought to an undignified end by a defender in red. No second-half goals in the other two games yet. Norway still lead the Faroes 2-0 thanks to a couple of very early goals, Tore Reginiussen opening the scoring after four minutes, Iver Fossum doubling their lead on eight. Meanwhile Armenia trail 1-0 at home to Greece, the Euro 2004 champions leading by Dimitrios Limnios\u2019s 34th-minute goal. Finland are knocking at the door. Specifically Robin Lod, who has just had two attempts within 60 seconds. The first was a speculative dig from distance that\u2019s currently flying towards Iceland; the second was a snapshot from a left-wing cutback that whistled inches wide of the left-hand post. He really should have scored that second one. To Helsinki, then, where Finland are within touching distance of their first-ever major finals appearance. They\u2019re leading thanks to Jasse Tuominen\u2019s 21st-minute strike, swept home from 12 yards after Teemu Pukki\u2019s shot was blocked on the edge of the box. Tuominen very nearly made it 2-0 just after the start of the second half, but his header from a right-wing corner twanged off the right-hand post. So it\u2019s still just the slim 1-0 lead ... though the hosts are utterly dominant. Liechtenstein are offering nowt. First up, the teamsheets in the early kick-offs. You know, for kids completists. Armenia: Hayrapetyan, Hambardzumyan, Voskanyan, Calisir, Ishkhanyan, Kamo Hovhannisyan, Barseghyan, Grigoryan, Hovsepyan, Vardanyan, Karapetyan. Subs: Avetisyan, Danielyan, Sarkisov, Manucharyan, Harutyunyan, Simonyan, Yedigaryan, Babayan, Beglaryan, Kasparov, Arman Hovhannisyan.

Norway: Jarstein, Elabdellaoui, Ajer, Reginiussen, Aleesami, Fossum, Berge, Henriksen, Selnaes, Haland, King. Subs: Hovland, Thorsby, Ulvestad, Svensson, Gyrtebust, Sorloth, Daehli, Rosted, Nyland, Tarik Elyounoussi, Meling.

Subs: Kristian Joensen, Johannesen, Klaemint Olsen, Danielsen, Davidsen, Gestsson, Bartalsstovu, Eriksen, Frederiksberg, Egilsson. The great Jari Litmanen never graced a major international tournament. Neither did Sami Hyypi\u00e4. Or Mikael Forssell, Jussi J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen, Antti Niemi, Hannu Tihinen, Jonatan Johansson, Aki Riihilahti, Mixu Paatelainen, Petri Pasanen or Joonas Kolkka. Finland have never made it to the finals of either the World Cup or the European Championships, you see. They\u2019re the only major Nordic country yet to do so. But we\u2019re 45 minutes (plus stoppages) away from righting that historical wrong. Finland are a goal up against Liechtenstein in Helsinki right now, with the second half just kicking off. A win will guarantee them a place in next summer\u2019s Euro 2020 finals. Tim Sparv and Teemu Pukki are about to achieve what legends like Jari and Sami never could. This is happening! It\u2019s not the only Euro 2020 qualifier taking place tonight. Three games are currently in play, having kicked off at 5pm GMT ... Armenia 0-1 Greece (HT) Finland 1-0 Lichtenstein (HT) Norway 2-0 Faroe Islands (HT) ... while five more will get going at 7.45pm: Bosnia-Herzegovina v Italy Denmark v Gibraltar Switzerland v Georgia Romania v Sweden Spain v Malta All the action coming up, for your leisure and pleasure. It\u2019s on!",

      "bodyText": "The type of fuel used by ships has a substantial effect on cloud formation. Exhausts from dirty heavy oils leave a telltale trail of such dense cloud that they can be tracked from space. While ship emissions contain many chemicals including black carbon, researchers have discovered that it is the sulphate aerosols formed from the sulphur in the oil that is responsible for the clouds that sometimes trail behind ships for hundreds of miles. The tracking technology was developed because researchers are trying to discover what effect this pollution is having on climate change and rainfall but also it will help enforce new regulations to curb these emissions. Already there are prohibitions on using these sulphur-laden fuels in the North Sea, Baltic, English Channel and North America because of the damaging air pollution that drifts on land. Where these regulations are enforced the clouds associated with ship exhausts disappear. From January 2020 new regulations to clean up the shipping trade apply worldwide but some unscrupulous companies are expected to try and ignore them and continue to use the cheaper and dirtier heavy fuel oils. However, having tracked 17,000 ships, the researchers are confident they will be able to identify individual miscreants from space simply by monitoring the dense clouds behind the ships as they cross the oceans.",

Garrett will miss at least the remainder of the regular season and the postseason if Cleveland manage to qualify.

Rudolph\u2019s fingers wedged into the back of Garrett\u2019s helmet, presumably to try and remove it, which led to Garrett tearing Rudolph\u2019s helmet off and swinging it to hit the quarterback on top of his head. The resulting fracas led Pouncey punching and kicking Garrett after he had been tackled by other Steelers and Ogunjobi shoving Rudolph from his blind side after sustaining Garrett\u2019s hit.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RemewDSZmxo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RemewDSZmxo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Garrett incident was culmination of an nasty, violent game between AFC North rivals that conjured memories of the Steelers\u2019 January 2016 clash with the Cincinnati Bengals that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/05/steelers-bengals-game-violence-ryan-shazier-nfl\">featured a host of violent helmet-to-helmet hits and altercations</a>. As the NFL continues its public battle to prove that football doesn\u2019t endanger the long-term safety of its players, Thursday night was a brutal reminder of the game\u2019s inherent violence between whistles and after them.</p> <p>Prior to Garrett\u2019s abhorrent actions, however, his team-mate Damarious Randall was ejected for a ghastly helmet-to-helmet hit on a Steelers receiver. The NFL\u2019s structuring of their suspensions further demonstrates what they care about when combating football\u2019s violence problem: perception, not consequence, is what matters.</p> <p>Garrett\u2019s attack might be the dirtiest moment since Tennessee Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsVX7KvGdk\">stomped on the unprotected head of Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Andre Gurode</a> in 2006. Once the former No 1 overall pick and revered defensive lineman, who admired the poetry of Muhammad Ali and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MylesLGarrett/status/1157816422116077568\">Dragonball Z</a>, Garrett is now the face of NFL\u2019s violence obsession. That he swung the helmet at Rudolph, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/06/nfl-mason-rudolph-knocked-out-steelers-ravens\">who suffered an ugly concussion</a> against Baltimore earlier this season, only worsens the optics of the NFL season\u2019s lowest moment. Neither Cleveland quarterback Baker Mayfield nor head coach Freddie Kitchens spared Garrett in the postgame, calling the moment \u201cinexcusable\u201d and criticizing Garrett for hurting a team trying to save a disappointing season that began with playoff expectations.</p> <p>The indefinite suspension is the second major crackdown the NFL has issued to try and root out dirty play: earlier this season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/vontaze-burfict-suspension-nfl-tackles\">the league barred longtime offender Vontaze Burfict</a> for the season after the Raiders linebacker issued a late hit against the Indianapolis Colts.</p> <p>Oddly, the list of suspended players did not include Randall, who was ejected in the third quarter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/247KevinBoilard/status/1195181938090352641\">after a vicious helmet-to-helmet hit on Pittsburgh wide receiver Diontae Johnson</a>. For the NFL, indefinitely suspending Garrett is easy: weaponizing an opposing player\u2019s helmet away from the play is an indefensible act of brutality that isn\u2019t justified by any motive (some pointed out that Rudolph kicked Garrett in the groin before the attack). The bigger tell of <em>how much</em> the NFL cares about the game\u2019s endemic violence and risk of head trauma is whether it cares to penalize Randall. After absorbing Randall\u2019s full-speed helmet-to-helmet hit, Johnson left the game with a concussion and bleeding from his ears and could <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VersaceBoyEnt/status/1195183914052210688\">barely make it to the sideline injury tent</a> for evaluation.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RZx8zNlkK8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8RZx8zNlkK8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While the game doesn\u2019t happen in slow motion, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTBeard11/status/1195182337153089536\">the play is every bit as dirty in real speed</a>: Randall targets Johnson from some eight yards away and careens himself, helmet first, directly into Johnson\u2019s head after the ball dropped for an incomplete pass. The NCAA introduced the \u201ctargeting\u201d penalty in 2013, meaning intentional, forcible contact to a player\u2019s helmet would result in ejection and suspension for a full half of the next game. While defensive backs must deliver hits at full speed to try and prevent or mitigate big plays on offense, players know not to use the crown of their helmets as weapons. The damage that Randall delivered to Johnson on that hit was real and terrifying, even if the NFL deems it more acceptable in the context of gameplay.</p> <p>The Garrett moment will linger in the public consciousness for some time.

      "bodyText": "The NFL indefinitely suspended Myles Garrett on Friday after the Cleveland Browns star defensive lineman removed Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph\u2019s helmet and smashed it into Rudolph\u2019s head on Thursday night. Garrett will miss at least the remainder of the regular season and the postseason if Cleveland manage to qualify. The league also suspended Steelers offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey three games and Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi one game for their roles in the brawl and fined the teams $250,000 apiece. The altercation started with eight seconds remaining in the Browns\u2019 ugly 21-7 win over the Steelers when Rudolph and Garrett tangled on the turf after a meaningless third-down play. Rudolph\u2019s fingers wedged into the back of Garrett\u2019s helmet, presumably to try and remove it, which led to Garrett tearing Rudolph\u2019s helmet off and swinging it to hit the quarterback on top of his head. The resulting fracas led Pouncey punching and kicking Garrett after he had been tackled by other Steelers and Ogunjobi shoving Rudolph from his blind side after sustaining Garrett\u2019s hit. The Garrett incident was culmination of an nasty, violent game between AFC North rivals that conjured memories of the Steelers\u2019 January 2016 clash with the Cincinnati Bengals that featured a host of violent helmet-to-helmet hits and altercations. As the NFL continues its public battle to prove that football doesn\u2019t endanger the long-term safety of its players, Thursday night was a brutal reminder of the game\u2019s inherent violence between whistles and after them. Prior to Garrett\u2019s abhorrent actions, however, his team-mate Damarious Randall was ejected for a ghastly helmet-to-helmet hit on a Steelers receiver. The NFL\u2019s structuring of their suspensions further demonstrates what they care about when combating football\u2019s violence problem: perception, not consequence, is what matters. Garrett\u2019s attack might be the dirtiest moment since Tennessee Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth stomped on the unprotected head of Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Andre Gurode in 2006. Once the former No 1 overall pick and revered defensive lineman, who admired the poetry of Muhammad Ali and Dragonball Z, Garrett is now the face of NFL\u2019s violence obsession. That he swung the helmet at Rudolph, who suffered an ugly concussion against Baltimore earlier this season, only worsens the optics of the NFL season\u2019s lowest moment. Neither Cleveland quarterback Baker Mayfield nor head coach Freddie Kitchens spared Garrett in the postgame, calling the moment \u201cinexcusable\u201d and criticizing Garrett for hurting a team trying to save a disappointing season that began with playoff expectations. The indefinite suspension is the second major crackdown the NFL has issued to try and root out dirty play: earlier this season, the league barred longtime offender Vontaze Burfict for the season after the Raiders linebacker issued a late hit against the Indianapolis Colts. Oddly, the list of suspended players did not include Randall, who was ejected in the third quarter after a vicious helmet-to-helmet hit on Pittsburgh wide receiver Diontae Johnson. For the NFL, indefinitely suspending Garrett is easy: weaponizing an opposing player\u2019s helmet away from the play is an indefensible act of brutality that isn\u2019t justified by any motive (some pointed out that Rudolph kicked Garrett in the groin before the attack). The bigger tell of how much the NFL cares about the game\u2019s endemic violence and risk of head trauma is whether it cares to penalize Randall. After absorbing Randall\u2019s full-speed helmet-to-helmet hit, Johnson left the game with a concussion and bleeding from his ears and could barely make it to the sideline injury tent for evaluation. While the game doesn\u2019t happen in slow motion, the play is every bit as dirty in real speed: Randall targets Johnson from some eight yards away and careens himself, helmet first, directly into Johnson\u2019s head after the ball dropped for an incomplete pass. The NCAA introduced the \u201ctargeting\u201d penalty in 2013, meaning intentional, forcible contact to a player\u2019s helmet would result in ejection and suspension for a full half of the next game. While defensive backs must deliver hits at full speed to try and prevent or mitigate big plays on offense, players know not to use the crown of their helmets as weapons. The damage that Randall delivered to Johnson on that hit was real and terrifying, even if the NFL deems it more acceptable in the context of gameplay. The Garrett moment will linger in the public consciousness for some time. To watch a player swing a helmet around 20 yards away from the play is embarrassing for the league because it reinforces the notion that the NFL invites all forms of violence. The NFL desperately wants to avoid moments like the NBA\u2019s Malice at the Palace, Kermit Washington\u2019s punch of Rudy Tomjonavich or anything that resembles the aforementioned Bengals-Steelers catastrophe. Unless a suspension is announced for Randall, however, the league seems to be content with the kind of hits that subject its players to forcible head trauma consistent with high-speed car accidents. Randall will likely be fined for the hit and will presumably play in Cleveland\u2019s next game against the Dolphins. The Garrett moment embarrasses the league because of the perception of lawlessness, so it hammered him with a historic (and deserved) suspension. But when it looked at the Randall hit, however? To the NFL, that was just football.",

But, for 26 million British television viewers, the breakthrough erotic moment came on 9 January 1976. That Friday night ITV screened the first part of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHot1Shj0a8\" title=\"\">Bouquet of Barbed Wire</a>, written by Andrea Newman, who has died aged 81.</p> <p>In the opening scenes of what became a landmark TV show, known colloquially as \u201cBouquet\u201d, a married London publisher, Peter Manson, has a sulky lunch with Prue, a young woman just back from honeymoon. From his fury at her revelation that she is carrying her husband\u2019s child, and the lingering kisses they share as they part after the meal, the audience was led to believe that Peter was the woman\u2019s former lover, who feels cuckolded by her marriage.</p> <p>But the shocking realisation that Prue, played by Susan Penhaligon, is Peter\u2019s daughter exposed the daring darkness of the drama. Although incest was never depicted or specified, a scene in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/31/frank-finlay\" title=\"\">Frank Finlay</a>\u2019s Peter stiffly watches, dark glasses blessedly blurring his precise expression, as his son-in-law rubs sun cream around Prue\u2019s bikini-clad breasts, made clear that Newman had knowingly relocated Greek tragedy to the English upper classes. In others of the seven episodes, Peter seduces a secretary, who may reasonably be seen as a surrogate for the young woman he really desires; in another breach of family boundaries, Peter\u2019s wife, Cassie (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/20/sheila-allen\" title=\"\">Sheila Allen</a>), goes to bed with her son-in-law (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/11/james-aubrey-obituary\" title=\"\">James Aubrey</a>).</p> <p>Clive James, reviewing the series in the Observer, joked that, \u201cby the end, everyone had been to bed with everyone else, except the baby\u201d. The presenter Roy Plomley, interviewing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009mvv5\" title=\"\">Newman on a 1980 episode of Desert Island Discs</a>, accused the author of having a \u201csleazy\u201d imagination, and sniffed that \u201cguessing next week\u2019s [sexual] permutations became a sort of national game\u201d.</p> <p>On the recording, Newman audibly bridles at this comment, replying: \u201cI think there is an emotional logic to it. I don\u2019t see it how the critics have seen it at all.\u201d And, apart from Prue spending quite a lot of time in bikinis or underwear, Bouquet is rarely visually salacious. What shocked at the time \u2013 and remains powerful on re-viewing \u2013 is the constant boiling atmosphere of suppressed, transgressive desire. The director Tony Wharmby\u2019s bold decision to eschew the musical underscoring common in peak-time fiction \u2013 only a few notes are heard at the start and end of episodes \u2013 also gives the action the stark intensity of a stage drama.</p> <p>Finlay played Peter as an unstably dormant volcano of longing and guilt. The scripts contain allusions, through a metaphor involving ice-cream, to oral sex, and practices as exotic at the time as the avocado pear that the protagonist orders in a swanky restaurant. The controversy around the drama was also driven by its showing, with social precocity, women wanting and seeking sex.</p> <p>The name that the series made famous was a pseudonym, adopted by the writer when she published her first novel, A Share of the World, in 1964. Unusually, she then solidified her nom-de-plume by deed poll, and it was her stated wish that no attempt should be made by journalists, or indeed obituarists, to publish her birth names. This stipulation seems to relate to a deep sense of privacy, and a feeling that she truly found her identity only when becoming a writer, rather than any rejection of her family. Her 1969 novel A Bouquet of Barbed Wire (the indefinite article disappeared when she adapted the story for TV) is dedicated \u201cto my parents with love\u201d, and she told Plomley that her mother was an \u201camazing woman\u201d whose contribution included typing up books and scripts from Newman\u2019s longhand manuscripts.</p> <p>Her father was a reporter and photographer, her mother a secretary at the chemical company ICI, where the couple met. Their only child was born in Dover, Kent, but when the second world war broke out the family evacuated to Shropshire, while her father served in the RAF.

It is likely that Newman knew what she was doing, as her writing was full of subtle allusions. The sequel, Another Bouquet, a novel and LWT seven-parter that followed in 1977, took Newman\u2019s Manson household even closer to the <a href=\"https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/house-of-atreus.html\" title=\"\">House of Atreus</a>.</p> <p>A later TV series, An Evil Streak (ITV, 1999), relocated the legend of Troilus and Cressida to contemporary academia, starring Trevor Eve, who would also play Manson in the 2010 BBC remake of Bouquet of Barbed Wire.</p> <p>Newman declined an offer to script that show. Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004, she was also caring for her mother, who suffered from dementia before dying at the age of 97, and these two trials reduced her literary output in later years.</p> <p>Her subject matter of sexual intrigue inevitably encouraged speculation about a life that she liked to keep private. On his TV chatshow, Terry Wogan asked her, after cataloguing the liberated libidos of her female characters: \u201cAre you like that?\u201d Newman, after a perfectly timed pause, replied: \u201cI have my moments.\u201d</p> <p>She gave another interviewer the discreet precis: \u201cI have been dumped. I have done the dumping. I guess it evens out.\u201d</p> <p>In the TV industry, Newman is at least as significant as an influence as she was a practitioner. The now popular TV genre of glossy sex dramas \u2013 Doctor Foster, Deep Water, The Affair \u2013 seems unlikely to have existed if Bouquet had not. And at the time LWT commissioned Bouquet, while there were female writers working in British drama \u2013 Adele Rose, Fay Weldon, Jill Hyem, Elaine Morgan \u2013 the number was shamefully small, and none of them had yet been allowed sole authorship of a show on the scale (seven parts) and scheduling prominence of Newman\u2019s (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/01/carla-lane-obituary\" title=\"\">Carla Lane</a> had been an equivalent pioneer in the sitcom genre). Newman\u2019s Mackenzie (BBC One, 1980), a saga following three families through two decades, was, at 13 parts, the longest original British drama ever commissioned from a woman. Strong women TV writers who emerged in the 1980s - including Lynda La Plante and Paula Milne - walked the path Newman had cleared; La Plante, in particular, following the model of stories that co-existed as novels and mini-series.</p> <p>Newman lived with her illness for 15 years, but the cancer had recently become unresponsive to treatment. The only child of two only children, she left no family survivors, but, sparky and gregarious, had many devoted friends. A favoured relaxation was classical music, especially the Richards Strauss and Wagner, who were high on her Desert Island playlist. Her luxury, as told on the Radio 4 show, was an unlimited supply of Krug \u201959 champagne. </p> <p>\u2022 Andrea Newman, novelist and screenwriter, born 7 February 1938; died 9 November 2019</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>This article was amended on 17 November 2019, to correct how Andrea Newman met her first husband.</p>",

The now popular TV genre of glossy sex dramas \u2013 Doctor Foster, Deep Water, The Affair \u2013 seems unlikely to have existed if Bouquet had not. And at the time LWT commissioned Bouquet, while there were female writers working in British drama \u2013 Adele Rose, Fay Weldon, Jill Hyem, Elaine Morgan \u2013 the number was shamefully small, and none of them had yet been allowed sole authorship of a show on the scale (seven parts) and scheduling prominence of Newman\u2019s (Carla Lane had been an equivalent pioneer in the sitcom genre). Newman\u2019s Mackenzie (BBC One, 1980), a saga following three families through two decades, was, at 13 parts, the longest original British drama ever commissioned from a woman. Strong women TV writers who emerged in the 1980s - including Lynda La Plante and Paula Milne - walked the path Newman had cleared; La Plante, in particular, following the model of stories that co-existed as novels and mini-series. Newman lived with her illness for 15 years, but the cancer had recently become unresponsive to treatment. The only child of two only children, she left no family survivors, but, sparky and gregarious, had many devoted friends. A favoured relaxation was classical music, especially the Richards Strauss and Wagner, who were high on her Desert Island playlist. Her luxury, as told on the Radio 4 show, was an unlimited supply of Krug \u201959 champagne. \u2022 Andrea Newman, novelist and screenwriter, born 7 February 1938; died 9 November 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 17 November 2019, to correct how Andrea Newman met her first husband.",

The ongoing cost would be paid for by a new tax on tech giants, with the free broadband saving families on average \u00a330 a month, Labour says. In a speech in Lancaster Corbyn said that only 10% of Britain has access to full-fibre broadband, while in South Korea coverage is 98%. He said this showed how Labour would be using the power of the state to deliver an essential public service. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Labour believes that the British people deserve the very best.</p> \n   <p>As a country we should be proud of our history of building treasured public institutions and services.</p> \n   <p>In the 19th century it was the public waterworks.</p> \n   <p>In the 20th century it was our fantastic National Health Service, freeing people from the fear of illness.</p> \n   <p>British Broadband will be our treasured public institution for the 21st century, delivering fast and free broadband to every home.</p> \n   <p>Only the government has the planning ability, economies of scale and ambition to take this on.</p> \n   <p>This is a mission for everyone to get behind.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>My colleagues <strong>Mark Sweney </strong>and<strong> Patrick Collinson</strong> have a good analysis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/15/how-feasible-is-labour-free-broadband-plan-and-part-nationalisation-of-bt\">here </a>of how feasible the plan is.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Labour\u2019s plans has caused alarm in the City, where it was claimed that the party has massively underestimated the cost of its free full-fibre broadband offer and that the prospect of further nationalisation could halt further investment in the sector. </strong>The plan to nationalise Openreach, the broadband division of BT, caused particular shock because until last night Labour had claimed that it had no nationalisation plans beyond its existing commitments to bring rail, energy, water and the Royal Mail back in to public ownership. The BT chief executive <strong>Philip Jansen</strong> said Labour\u2019s plans would not cost \u00a320bn, as the party claimed, but closer to \u00a3100bn. <strong>Julian David,</strong> chief executive of tech trade association techUK, said Labour\u2019s plans would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the sector. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Re-nationalisation would immediately halt the investment being driven not just by BT but the growing number of new and innovative companies that compete with BT.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson dismissed the plan as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/15/general-election-corbyn-talks-free-broadband-as-johnson-launches-campaign-bus-live-news?page=with:block-5dce9d408f08eeb483f1817d#block-5dce9d408f08eeb483f1817d\">a \u201ccrazed communist scheme\u201d. </a></strong> And the Conservatives sought to play up fears that the Corbyn plan shows that Labour\u2019s nationalisation agenda will turn out to be more extensive than the party admits. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CCHQPress/status/1195303929879379969\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What will Corbyn nationalise next?</p>\u2014 CCHQ Press Office (@CCHQPress) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CCHQPress/status/1195303929879379969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 15, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But the Tories were also keen to stress their own plans to roll out improved broadband services, and there is likely to be some nervousness in CCHQ about how voters will react to the Labour giveaway. As a retail offer, it is big enough to get noticed - even by a public that seems bored and disengaged from the election. Corbyn\u2019s analysis of the problem faced by the public is sound (Ed Miliband had a very pithy summary<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ed_Miliband/status/1195114959455375362\"> here)</a>, and \u2018people like free stuff\u2019 is not a bad guide to electoral behaviour. But this is a plan that marks an extension of the nationalisation agenda (other services being nationalised by Labour were once in the public sector; broadband wasn\u2019t, because it did not exist in that era), and although voters might easily agree with Corbyn that the broadband service they are getting now is unsatisfactory, whether they think it would be any better under a monopoly state provider is another matter.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.libdems.org.uk/climate-emergency-fund\"><strong>Davey said the Lib Dems were calling for a \u00a3100bn spending programme over five years to tackle climate change.</strong></a> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our climate investment plan includes a new \u00a310bn renewable power fund.</p> \n   <p>It alone would leverage in over \u00a3100bn of extra private climate investment.</p> \n   <p>Not a new subsidy, but state climate finance, to fast-track clean power deployment and give a healthy profit to the taxpayer. Payback as we clean up.</p> \n   <p>This fund will confirm Britain as the world leader in offshore wind, and make</p> \n   <p>Britain the global number one in tidal power too.</p> \n   <p>From Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon to a whole suite of tidal power stations round our coast. Creating another new climate industry.</p> \n   <p>And we will invest \u00a315bn more to make every building in the country greener, with an emergency ten-year programme to save energy, end fuel poverty and cut heating bills. Cutting the average household\u2019s energy bill by a whopping \u00a3550 a year.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the Lib Dems would regulate the City to address the climate emergency.</strong> he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will regulate the City for climate.</p> \n   <p>From pension funds to banks, from the debt markets to the stock exchange.<br></p> \n   <p>Mandatory disclosure on fossil fuel investments, to expose investors to their climate risks.</p> \n   <p>New laws to require a financial institution or large corporate to publish their multi-year strategy to move to net zero.</p> \n   <p>New accounting standards and laws, to write down climate damaging assets to a zero value by 2045.</p> \n   <p>Under Liberal Democrats, the UK can become the gold standard of climate capitalism for the world.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that by remaining in the EU, the Lib Dems would generate a \u00a350bn \u201cremain bonus\u201d for the economy. </strong>The Lib Dems are committed to revoking article 50 if they form a majority government (which is probably impossible, given their size and the extent of their support).

But Balfour soon returned to the Commons in a byelection and served as leader of the opposition.</p> \n  <p>If the Tories lose the election, and Johnson loses his seat, he may decide to follow the Balfour example. Or he may decide to walk away and do something else.</p> \n  <p>The much more interesting question is, what would happen if Johnson loses his seat, but the Conservatives win.</p> \n  <p>In Britain the prime minister has always been a member of parliament and since 1902, when the Marquess of Salisbury stood down, the PM has always been a member of the House of Commons, not the House of Lords.</p> \n  <p>But there is nothing in the constitution or in law saying that the prime minister has to be an MP. And there are precedents for people serving in government and not being members of the Commons or the Lords. Harold Wilson made Patrick Gordon Walker foreign secretary even though he lost his seat in the 1964 election. But when Gordon Walker lost a byelection three months later, he had to stand down.</p> \n  <p>Unless there is something in the Conservative party rules saying the party leader has to be an MP (which the party may be able to bypass anyway), it would theoretically be possible for Johnson to remain as PM, even if he had lost his seat, pending a byelection at which he might return. This would be unprecedented, but precedent has become a poor guide to our politics recently. A lot would depend on whether his party accepted this (ie, whether he was still seen as an election winner), and perhaps on whether Buckingham Palace were willing go along with this arrangement. </p> \n  <p>Doubtless the idea of being prime minister but without having to turn up to PMQs every week might appeal to Johnson. Most politically-conscious Britons would consider it unthinkable to have a prime minister not sitting in parliament, but in many other parts of the world the head of the executive is not a member of the legislature and it is not entirely impossible to imagine that one day in the UK this could change.</p> \n  <p><em>UPDATE:</em> I\u2019ve corrected the post to reflect the fact that, by the time he lost his seat in the 1906 general election, Arthur Balfour had already been been replaced as prime minister by Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who replaced him when the Conservative government fell in December 1905, precipitating the election.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-15T17:08:28.858Z\">at 5.08pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dcec8808f083559fb1cc157\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-15T15:47:39.778Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faa403dc333d83da06b8d79d5bbf72405983d37e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/faa403dc333d83da06b8d79d5bbf72405983d37e/0_210_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson eating a candy stick which reads \u201cBack Boris\u201d during a general election campaign trail stop at Coronation Candy in Blackpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson eating a candy stick which reads \u201cBack Boris\u201d during a general election campaign trail stop at Coronation Candy in Blackpool.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dcec5328f08eeb483f183a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-15T15:45:07.422Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And if you don\u2019t trust polling, you can always try using focus groups to get an understanding of public opinion. <strong>Lord Ashcroft</strong>, the Conservative peer and polling specialist, is conducting regular focus groups during the election campaign.

Instead, it was mostly an attack on Labour, and Jeremy Corbyn in particular. Much of what Johnson was saying was not new. But the speech did include some criticism that was stronger than anything we\u2019ve heard from Johnson in recent days (and probably less honest).</p> \n  <p>On the Labour plan for free broadband, Johnson went beyond describing it as \u201ccrackpot\u201d (the line he used on the BBC this morning - see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/15/general-election-corbyn-talks-free-broadband-as-johnson-launches-campaign-bus-live-news?page=with:block-5dce71878f08aab51e1bf92e#block-5dce71878f08aab51e1bf92e\">9.39am)</a> and instead described it as a \u201ccrazed communist scheme\u201d (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/15/general-election-corbyn-talks-free-broadband-as-johnson-launches-campaign-bus-live-news?page=with:block-5dce9d408f08eeb483f1817d#block-5dce9d408f08eeb483f1817d\">12.45pm).</a> Johnson\u2019s language is reminiscent of the Tories describing Ed Miliband\u2019s plan for a cap on energy bills as \u201cMarxist\u201d -<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/23/tory-energy-bill-cap-will-save-families-100-damian-green-says\"> before adopting it two years later as party policy.</a></p> \n  <p>Johnson also claimed that, overall, Labour\u2019s plans were \u201cterrifying\u201d.

I have to say, I think their programme is truly scary, disastrous for this country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson made various claims about Corbyn that have already regularly been aired by the Tories in the campaign: that Labour would hold two referendums next year (highly questionable - Corbyn says he would not allow a Scottish independence referendum in 2020, although Johnson said \u201cthat is the price that Nicola Sturgeon will demand for putting Jeremy Corbyn in power); that Labour would spend an extra \u00a31.2tr over five years, costing taxpayers an extra \u00a32,400 per year (implausible, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/sajid-javid-five-year-labour-spend-plan-near-12tn\">it is based on assumptions about Labour spending that are partly flawed or unfounded)</a>; and that Corbyn sided with Russia at the time of the novichok poisoning attack (arguable - Corbyn was initially sceptical of the UK government\u2019s assessment that Russia was to blame, but Labour would contest that he \u201csided with\u201d Russia.)</p> \n  <p>However, Johnson also added two other allegations that have barely featured in this campaign; that Corbyn wants to get rid of the army, and that he does not approve of home ownership. Johnson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Come with us, a government that backs our armed services, thinks they are a force for good around the world. Go with Corbyn and his lot, who actually think that the armed services should be disbanded - that\u2019s what he said.</p> \n   <p>Come with us, a party that believes in helping people, wherever we possibly can, to have the satisfaction that comes from home ownership, which is absolutely right. Or go with Jeremy Corbyn, who actually thinks home ownership is a bad idea and is opposed to it. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The claim that Corbyn wants to get rid of the armed forces is based on a line he said <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/heres-what-jeremy-corbyn-really-6438877\">in a speech in 2012:</a> \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if every politician around the world instead of taking pride in the size of their armed forces did what Costa Rica have done and abolished their army, and took pride in the fact they don\u2019t have an army.\u201d You can argue that this shows that Corbyn wants the army to be disbanded - but only if you are not willing to accept that there is a difference between musing about an ideal world, and advocating actual policy.</p> \n  <p>As for the line about Corbyn and home ownership, I have no idea where that comes from (unless Johnson was talking about second home ownership, where Labour policy is unsympathetic). I have asked the Conservative party if they can supply evidence for this, and will let you know if I get a reply.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dcea51c8f083559fb1cbf6c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-15T13:17:37.833Z\">1.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Church of Scotland minister who accused Corbyn of being terrorist sympathiser suspended</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Rev Richard Cameron</strong>, who heckled Jeremy Corbyn on a visit to Glasgow on Wednesday and accused him of being a \u201cterrorist sympathiser\u201d has been suspended from his work as a minister while the Church of Scotland carries out an inquiry.</p> \n  <p>During the incident, the Scotstoun parish church minister told Corbyn: \u201cI thought you\u2019d be wearing your Islamic Jihad scarf.\u201d It later emerged that he had posted a series of Islamophobic and homophobic tweets, and that the Humanist Society Scotland had complained about Cameron\u2019s behaviour on social media nine months ago.</p> \n  <p>A Church of Scotland spokesperson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In accordance with our procedures Rev Richard Cameron has been administratively suspended.

If you detected an edgy undercurrent to the interview, that was why. </p> \n  <p>It got particularly tense when Munchetty started asking Johnson how people can relate to him as a family man.

It includes discounts on business rates, rate relief for pubs, money to reopen train stations and a \u00a3150m fund to help groups trying to take over and run pubs and post offices threatened with closure.

Jeremy Corbyn will outline the plan during a speech in Lancaster, saying: \u201cWhat was once a luxury is now an essential utility.\u201d The plan, estimated to cost about \u00a320bn, will be funded partly by high taxes on internet companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. For a comprehensive summary of the day\u2019s politics news, see my colleague Andrew Sparrow\u2019s wonderful election briefing: And, for those who want to read yet more, Peter Walker, Rajeev Syal and Heather Stewart have our main UK politics story this evening: A coalition of women\u2019s groups has written to political leaders asking what they will do to end violence against women and girls if they win the general election. The UK-wide coalition of more than 90 women\u2019s organisations is calling for legislation to protect all women from domestic abuse. They want decisive action on the crisis in rape justice, proper funding for support services, and a duty on employers to prevent sexual harassment. Sarah Green, the director of the End Violence Against Women coalition, said voters need to hear from party leaders and every candidate during the election that action in this area remains a priority. Issues relating to the abuse and violence experienced by women and girls are no longer \u2018behind closed doors\u2019. Times have changed and many women and men demand that the government make a high priority of ending and preventing this abuse in the first place. In their letter to the leaders, the coalition said: Violence against women and girls is not inevitable, but it is enduring because it relates to women\u2019s persistent inequality. This election is taking place at a time of crisis in the criminal justice response to rape \u2013 even though more women than ever are coming forward to report to the police, just 1.5% of cases are being prosecuted. Domestic abuse homicides are at their highest level for five years, reports of sexual harassment are reaching epidemic levels in our workplaces and education institutions and many women MPs are leaving political careers citing online abuse and threats of violence against them as factors. These issues are deeply related and require urgent action by an incoming government. Jeremy Corbyn has launched what is probably the most eye-catching, radical surprising policy of the election campaign so far, promising free, full-fibre broadband for everyone in the country. Labour would deliver it by 2030 by nationalising part of BT, with remote and rural areas of Britain currently getting the worst broadband receiving the new service first. The ongoing cost would be paid for by a new tax on tech giants, with the free broadband saving families on average \u00a330 a month, Labour says. In a speech in Lancaster Corbyn said that only 10% of Britain has access to full-fibre broadband, while in South Korea coverage is 98%. He said this showed how Labour would be using the power of the state to deliver an essential public service. He said: Labour believes that the British people deserve the very best. As a country we should be proud of our history of building treasured public institutions and services. In the 19th century it was the public waterworks. In the 20th century it was our fantastic National Health Service, freeing people from the fear of illness. British Broadband will be our treasured public institution for the 21st century, delivering fast and free broadband to every home. Only the government has the planning ability, economies of scale and ambition to take this on. This is a mission for everyone to get behind. My colleagues Mark Sweney and Patrick Collinson have a good analysis here of how feasible the plan is. Labour\u2019s plans has caused alarm in the City, where it was claimed that the party has massively underestimated the cost of its free full-fibre broadband offer and that the prospect of further nationalisation could halt further investment in the sector. The plan to nationalise Openreach, the broadband division of BT, caused particular shock because until last night Labour had claimed that it had no nationalisation plans beyond its existing commitments to bring rail, energy, water and the Royal Mail back in to public ownership. The BT chief executive Philip Jansen said Labour\u2019s plans would not cost \u00a320bn, as the party claimed, but closer to \u00a3100bn. Julian David, chief executive of tech trade association techUK, said Labour\u2019s plans would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the sector. He said: Re-nationalisation would immediately halt the investment being driven not just by BT but the growing number of new and innovative companies that compete with BT. Boris Johnson dismissed the plan as a \u201ccrazed communist scheme\u201d. And the Conservatives sought to play up fears that the Corbyn plan shows that Labour\u2019s nationalisation agenda will turn out to be more extensive than the party admits. But the Tories were also keen to stress their own plans to roll out improved broadband services, and there is likely to be some nervousness in CCHQ about how voters will react to the Labour giveaway. As a retail offer, it is big enough to get noticed - even by a public that seems bored and disengaged from the election. Corbyn\u2019s analysis of the problem faced by the public is sound (Ed Miliband had a very pithy summary here), and \u2018people like free stuff\u2019 is not a bad guide to electoral behaviour. But this is a plan that marks an extension of the nationalisation agenda (other services being nationalised by Labour were once in the public sector; broadband wasn\u2019t, because it did not exist in that era), and although voters might easily agree with Corbyn that the broadband service they are getting now is unsatisfactory, whether they think it would be any better under a monopoly state provider is another matter. The Tories claim a similar project in Australia has been a disaster. At this stage it is just too early to know how the electoral politics of this announcement will unfold. Johnson has faced questions about how \u201crelatable\u201d he is during a BBC Breakfast interview. In his encounter with the BBC\u2019s Naga Munchetty, and a subsequent hour-long phone-in on Radio 5 Live, there were also references to the fact that no one even knows for sure how many children he has. Johnson did not seem to enjoy the references to his private life, but he insisted - as he always does - that he would not talk about his family, and got through both programmes without significant embarrassment. Johnson has escalated his attacks on Cobyn and Labour, claiming that that Corbyn\u2019s plans are \u201cabsolutely terrifying\u201d. In a short speech unveiling his battlebus, he sought to justify this charge with a series of allegations about the opposition - many of which were partially or wholly untrue. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, has said his party would use regulation to make Britain \u201cthe gold standard of climate capitalism for the world\u201d. He also said that the Lib Dems were committed to a \u00a3100bn programme over five years to tackle climate change. Police are launching their biggest ever operation to keep election candidates safe from attacks and abuse amid rising concern from politicians about the dangers they face. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is writing the blog now. A former North Sea diver has been selected as the Brexit party\u2019s candidate in Tynemouth, despite the fact he lives in Australia and has only ever passed through the northern English seaside town. Ed Punchard, who survived the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster in 1988, claimed he had an affinity with Tynemouth, which is on the north bank of the Tyne, because it has a North Sea coast. The 62-year-old, who grew up in North Wales, said he was willing to leave Australia \u2013 where he has lived for the past 30 years \u2013 if he is elected. He said he has family links to the fishing industry in south-west England and felt at home in Tynemouth. He said: I have come here to win, not to muck about. I wouldn\u2019t have come if I had not thought I could do it. Tynemouth has been held by Labour\u2019s Alan Campbell since 1997. He is standing again. The other candidates are John Appleby for the Liberal Democrats, Lewis Bartoli for the Conservatives and Julia Erskine for the Greens. Another question from BTL (below the line). What happens if someone casts a postal vote and then dies before polling day? The answer to this one is easy; the vote still counts. But it begs a much harder, and more interesting, question; can the votes of the dead decide an election? In the new edition of Sex, Lies and Politics, a book edited by Philip Cowley and Robert Ford of 50 essays summarising the findings of research into elections and voting behaviour in a very readable manner, Kingsley Purdam addresses exactly this question. He says that 8.4m people requested postal votes in 2017 and that around 3,000 postal votes could have been completed by people who went on to die before polling day. That is around five votes per constituency. Purdam says that in North East Fife Stephen Gethins won by just two votes and \u201csuch a small margin could easily have been determined by voters who had already died before the count began.\u201d Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, has delivered a speech on Lib Dem economic policy this afternoon. Here are the main points. Davey said the Lib Dems were calling for a \u00a3100bn spending programme over five years to tackle climate change. He said: Our climate investment plan includes a new \u00a310bn renewable power fund. It alone would leverage in over \u00a3100bn of extra private climate investment. Not a new subsidy, but state climate finance, to fast-track clean power deployment and give a healthy profit to the taxpayer. Payback as we clean up. This fund will confirm Britain as the world leader in offshore wind, and make Britain the global number one in tidal power too. From Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon to a whole suite of tidal power stations round our coast. Creating another new climate industry. And we will invest \u00a315bn more to make every building in the country greener, with an emergency ten-year programme to save energy, end fuel poverty and cut heating bills. Cutting the average household\u2019s energy bill by a whopping \u00a3550 a year. He said the Lib Dems would regulate the City to address the climate emergency. he said: We will regulate the City for climate. From pension funds to banks, from the debt markets to the stock exchange. Mandatory disclosure on fossil fuel investments, to expose investors to their climate risks. New laws to require a financial institution or large corporate to publish their multi-year strategy to move to net zero. New accounting standards and laws, to write down climate damaging assets to a zero value by 2045. Under Liberal Democrats, the UK can become the gold standard of climate capitalism for the world. He said that by remaining in the EU, the Lib Dems would generate a \u00a350bn \u201cremain bonus\u201d for the economy. The Lib Dems are committed to revoking article 50 if they form a majority government (which is probably impossible, given their size and the extent of their support). Interestingly, although Davey spoke about the Lib Dem commitment to keep the UK in the EU, he did not mention revoking article 50. There have been claims that voters are reacting badly to this promise, and that instead the Lib Dems are more keen on stressing their commitment to backing remain in a second referendum. He said the Lib Dems would adopt \u201cwell-being budgeting\u201d. He said: What does well-being budgeting mean? Well, go check out the early experiments in New Zealand \u2013 where investment in mental health services has gone up. And then think what a well-being approach to human capital would mean for investment in education and training. I can confirm today, that investment in infants, children, young people and adults \u2013 their education, their training, their wellbeing \u2013 this would be the top day-to-day spending priority for the Liberal Democrats. He said the Lib Dems would aim for a structural surplus in current spending. He said: How you ensure that your day-to-day spending on things like salaries and benefits, is covered by your revenue, primarily tax receipts. The Resolution Foundation have proposed a new fiscal rule for day-to-day spending - that a government should target a structural surplus in current spending equal to 1% of national income over a parliament. And their rule retains sensible flexibility, allowing spending up to minus 1% of national income - if there\u2019s a downturn and forecasts turn out wide of the mark. Liberal Democrats will adopt that fiscal rule \u2013 and our spending plans meet it, with current account surpluses in every year of our five year costings. Here is a question from below the line prompted by the post at 2.34pm, saying Boris Johnson will be defending the smallest majority for a prime minister since 1924. Can Boris Johnson remain as prime minister if he loses his seat? In 1906 the Conservative leader Arthur Balfour lost his seat only weeks after being replaced as PM by the liberal, Henry Campbell-Bannerman. But Balfour soon returned to the Commons in a byelection and served as leader of the opposition. If the Tories lose the election, and Johnson loses his seat, he may decide to follow the Balfour example. Or he may decide to walk away and do something else. The much more interesting question is, what would happen if Johnson loses his seat, but the Conservatives win. In Britain the prime minister has always been a member of parliament and since 1902, when the Marquess of Salisbury stood down, the PM has always been a member of the House of Commons, not the House of Lords. But there is nothing in the constitution or in law saying that the prime minister has to be an MP. And there are precedents for people serving in government and not being members of the Commons or the Lords. Harold Wilson made Patrick Gordon Walker foreign secretary even though he lost his seat in the 1964 election. But when Gordon Walker lost a byelection three months later, he had to stand down. Unless there is something in the Conservative party rules saying the party leader has to be an MP (which the party may be able to bypass anyway), it would theoretically be possible for Johnson to remain as PM, even if he had lost his seat, pending a byelection at which he might return. This would be unprecedented, but precedent has become a poor guide to our politics recently. A lot would depend on whether his party accepted this (ie, whether he was still seen as an election winner), and perhaps on whether Buckingham Palace were willing go along with this arrangement. Doubtless the idea of being prime minister but without having to turn up to PMQs every week might appeal to Johnson. Most politically-conscious Britons would consider it unthinkable to have a prime minister not sitting in parliament, but in many other parts of the world the head of the executive is not a member of the legislature and it is not entirely impossible to imagine that one day in the UK this could change. UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected the post to reflect the fact that, by the time he lost his seat in the 1906 general election, Arthur Balfour had already been been replaced as prime minister by Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who replaced him when the Conservative government fell in December 1905, precipitating the election. And if you don\u2019t trust polling, you can always try using focus groups to get an understanding of public opinion. Lord Ashcroft, the Conservative peer and polling specialist, is conducting regular focus groups during the election campaign. He has just a report about the findings from his latest ones, conducted in three leave-voting, Labour-held seats (Stoke-on-Trent North, Bolton North East and West Bromwich East). According to Ashcroft\u2019s write-up, the groups divided into those who saw the election in terms of Brexit and those who did not. Amongst the latter group, opposition to the Tories was still quite high, Ashcroft says. The thoughts of those \u2013 including leave voters, and even some 2017 Conservatives \u2013 for whom Brexit is not the main priority illustrate that taking these seats from Labour is by no means a done deal for the Tories. With echoes of the last election, austerity still loomed large in these voters\u2019 minds. But Ashcroft also found people sceptical about Labour\u2019s proposals. And this week\u2019s policy news? \u201cPromises on the health service, which I don\u2019t believe;\u201d \u201cLabour said something about bringing back bursaries for nurses. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do it, but it was nice that they thought of it;\u201d \u201cThere was something about a Russian file that they won\u2019t release until after the election. It makes him sound a bit Trumpish;\u201d \u201cCorbyn is trying to get McDonald\u2019s workers up to \u00a315 an hour! If they do that, the price of food goes up, people don\u2019t go into McDonald\u2019s anymore and people lose their jobs;\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s more than half the people on the front line in the public sector;\u201d \u201cJust the money, Corbyn promising so many billion. They\u2019ll put another note in at the end of the term, and say \u2018sorry, there\u2019s no money left\u2019,\u201d \u201cLabour want to raise the Corporation Tax, don\u2019t they. Businesses will just move. There will already be a cost with Brexit, so if you then raise Corporation Tax, what incentive is there for any company to stay in this country?\u201d \u201cThe four-day week. I can get behind that;\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good if you\u2019re not self-employed. Who\u2019s going to pay me for a four-day week?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a business owner. If my staff come to me and say \u2018Jeremy Corbyn says I only have to work four days,\u2019 well, you\u2019re no use to me.\u201d Panelbase has released a new poll. Polls, of course, do not always turn out to be accurate predictors of election results, but they are a better guide than using hunches or guesswork. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has described the behaviour of Rupert Lowe, who stood down as a candidate for his party in the Labour/Tory marginal Dudley North yesterday, allowing no time for it to choose a replacement, as \u201cdisgusting\u201d. Farage also offered an apology to voters in the constituency, who now will not have the option of voting for his party. Lowe, a Brexit party MEP, announced his decision moments before the 4pm deadline for nominations. In their overnight press notice about their plans to revive neglected communities, the Conservatives said they would \u201creverse many of the Beeching rail cuts of the 1960s, reconnecting towns that have suffered since their railways were removed\u201d. The party said it would fund this through a \u00a3500m \u201cBeeching reversal fund\u201d. As the Press Association reports, Sim Harris, managing editor of industry newspaper Railnews, has said this fund \u201cis not going to buy you very much\u201d. Harris said opening many of the lines closed by the Beeching cuts would cost billions. He explained: [\u00a3500m] is not going to buy you very much railway. A rebuilt railway costs millions for each kilometre. It depends what\u2019s happened to the railway since it closed. If it\u2019s still there, and it\u2019s a matter of upgrading and reopening a freight line, that is the cheaper option, but you\u2019ve still got to spend money on the stations. It would cost far more than that to really reverse Beeching. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister) has said that agreeing a UK-EU free trade deal before the end of next year would be \u201cdifficult but not impossible\u201d. The government insists that the deal will have to be concluded within this period, because Boris Johnson says he will not extend the transition period. Speaking at the British Irish Council meeting, he said: In terms of negotiating a trade agreement before December 2020, it would be difficult but not impossible. Even though the deal might be agreed, we could run into issues with ratification. My aim is we will continue to have tariff-free trade with Great Britain, not just Northern Ireland. One consequence of nominations closing yesterday is that we now know Boris Johnson will defend his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency and that rumours that he might decamp to a safer seat turned out to be unfounded. As the Press Association reports, Johnson will go into the election trying to defend the smallest constituency majority for a prime minister in nearly 100 years. In 2017 he held his seat with a majority of just 5,034. No prime minister since 1924 has fought a general election while simultaneously defending such a slim personal majority. Nominations for the election have now closed. If you want to know who the candidates are standing in your area, there is a great page on our website here that will tell you. During an election campaign all leaders need a stump speech - a standard five-minute speech they can repeat over and over again, setting out why they should be elected. Boris Johnson has just delivered the latest version of his at the unveiling of the Conservative party\u2019s election battlebus. The Conservatives announced almost no new policy in the campaign so far (that may change when the manifesto eventually comes out) and there was little that was positive in the Johnson speech. Instead, it was mostly an attack on Labour, and Jeremy Corbyn in particular. Much of what Johnson was saying was not new. But the speech did include some criticism that was stronger than anything we\u2019ve heard from Johnson in recent days (and probably less honest). On the Labour plan for free broadband, Johnson went beyond describing it as \u201ccrackpot\u201d (the line he used on the BBC this morning - see 9.39am) and instead described it as a \u201ccrazed communist scheme\u201d (see 12.45pm). Johnson\u2019s language is reminiscent of the Tories describing Ed Miliband\u2019s plan for a cap on energy bills as \u201cMarxist\u201d - before adopting it two years later as party policy. Johnson also claimed that, overall, Labour\u2019s plans were \u201cterrifying\u201d. He said: And what is Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party offering? ... I think it\u2019s absolutely terrifying. I have to say, I think their programme is truly scary, disastrous for this country. Johnson made various claims about Corbyn that have already regularly been aired by the Tories in the campaign: that Labour would hold two referendums next year (highly questionable - Corbyn says he would not allow a Scottish independence referendum in 2020, although Johnson said \u201cthat is the price that Nicola Sturgeon will demand for putting Jeremy Corbyn in power); that Labour would spend an extra \u00a31.2tr over five years, costing taxpayers an extra \u00a32,400 per year (implausible, because it is based on assumptions about Labour spending that are partly flawed or unfounded); and that Corbyn sided with Russia at the time of the novichok poisoning attack (arguable - Corbyn was initially sceptical of the UK government\u2019s assessment that Russia was to blame, but Labour would contest that he \u201csided with\u201d Russia.) However, Johnson also added two other allegations that have barely featured in this campaign; that Corbyn wants to get rid of the army, and that he does not approve of home ownership. Johnson said: Come with us, a government that backs our armed services, thinks they are a force for good around the world. Go with Corbyn and his lot, who actually think that the armed services should be disbanded - that\u2019s what he said. Come with us, a party that believes in helping people, wherever we possibly can, to have the satisfaction that comes from home ownership, which is absolutely right. Or go with Jeremy Corbyn, who actually thinks home ownership is a bad idea and is opposed to it. The claim that Corbyn wants to get rid of the armed forces is based on a line he said in a speech in 2012: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if every politician around the world instead of taking pride in the size of their armed forces did what Costa Rica have done and abolished their army, and took pride in the fact they don\u2019t have an army.\u201d You can argue that this shows that Corbyn wants the army to be disbanded - but only if you are not willing to accept that there is a difference between musing about an ideal world, and advocating actual policy. As for the line about Corbyn and home ownership, I have no idea where that comes from (unless Johnson was talking about second home ownership, where Labour policy is unsympathetic). I have asked the Conservative party if they can supply evidence for this, and will let you know if I get a reply. The Rev Richard Cameron, who heckled Jeremy Corbyn on a visit to Glasgow on Wednesday and accused him of being a \u201cterrorist sympathiser\u201d has been suspended from his work as a minister while the Church of Scotland carries out an inquiry. During the incident, the Scotstoun parish church minister told Corbyn: \u201cI thought you\u2019d be wearing your Islamic Jihad scarf.\u201d It later emerged that he had posted a series of Islamophobic and homophobic tweets, and that the Humanist Society Scotland had complained about Cameron\u2019s behaviour on social media nine months ago. A Church of Scotland spokesperson said: In accordance with our procedures Rev Richard Cameron has been administratively suspended. This is to allow us to carry out an inquiry in relation to the incident which took place earlier this week and the subsequent complaints about his social media use. The Boris Johnson event was another of those where the close-up photographs make the room look packed, but where the wide-screen shots show that he was speaking to a relatively small audience. This is from the Manchester Evening News\u2019 Jennifer Williams. Here is some video from the Boris Johnson bus launch. Johnson has now finished. It was only a very short stump speech, but it did mark an escalation in campaign rhetoric. Some of what he was saying about Labour was even more extreme, and questionable, than what he has said in the past. I will post the quotes shortly. Johnson says he was not allowed to talk about Labour\u2019s plans in his BBC appearances his morning. (The presenters tried to get him to focus on Conservative plans, not just on attacking Labour.) But he says now he can talk about Labour. Labour\u2019s plans are terrifying, he says. He repeats his claims (which Labour denies) that Labour would hold two referendums next year. He claims that Labour is opposed to home ownership. Boris Johnson is now speaking at the launch of the Conservative battlebus. He says Brexit will be like angioplasty. It will clear the arteries, and allow the government to focus on other projects. Those will include rolling out broadband. But the Conservative plan will not be like the \u201ccrazed communist scheme\u201d outlined by Labour today. Here is an excellent Guardian explainer from my colleagues Mark Sweney and Patrick Collinson looking at how feasible the Labour free broadband plan is. McDonnell says Labour is introducing this policy partly because broadband connectivity is an issue that people kept raising at public meetings. And they made the point that children could not do their homework without broadband access. And so this is a measure that will tackle inequality, he says. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Q: Will you be able to get access to land to lay these cables? Corbyn says there will be some disruption as new cables are laid. But this is necessary, he says. Q: Do you rule out a non-aggression pact with the Liberal Democrats in the election? Jo Swinson knows that having a Labour government is the only way to stop Brexit. Corbyn says he is fighting the election on a pledge to end austerity, ending the problems introduced by the coalition government that included the Lib Dems. He says Labour would introduce an early budget. If other parties make ending austerity a point of negotiation, he would refuse. He says he is not going into coalition with any of the pro-austerity parties. In fact, he is not planning to go into coalition with anyone. He is planning a majority. Q: When would poorer communities see the benefits from this? Corbyn says remote rural areas, that do not get any broadband at the moment, will get this early on. People who want to expand small businesses in rural areas cannot do so without proper broadband. Q: Do you plan to stop people watching porn on the government\u2019s broadband service? Rebecca Long-Bailey says there will be a charter of internet rights. (She does not address the point about pornography.) Q: Other companies that provide broadband also provide things like landlines. How would you separate out those? And would broadband workers from all other companies get to keep their jobs? Long-Bailey says Labour does not want to stop other companies providing enhanced services. Workers who transfer will do so under TUPE. That means their rights will be protected. Q: Can you do this under EU laws? If not, is it a tacit admission that you want to leave? McDonnell says Labour has had legal advice saying this is compatible with EU law. Jeremy Corbyn and his colleagues are now taking questions. Q: Isn\u2019t the real problem with BT the fact that it has little competition. How would replacing it with a state monopoly make a difference? Corbyn says he is proposing a public service, like any other public service. He says his plan will improve the livelihoods of many people. Every person in the room uses a computer every day, he says. They need this kind of access. On public ownership, he says BT used to be in the public sector. Q: Can you really afford this? BT say your plans will cost twice as much as you claim. And won\u2019t ultimately taxpayers have to pay more? McDonnell says the \u00a320bn figure that Labour is using is a figure from the government\u2019s own review. Since privatisation, \u00a354bn has been paid out in share dividends. That is twice as much as full-fibre rollout would have cost. He says pension funds want the prospect of a steady income from something that is secure. This plan will offer that. Q: Can you deliver this without a majority Labour government? Corbyn says that issue does not arise because there is going to be a majority Labour government. McDonnell urges people to see Ken Loach\u2019s new film, Sorry We Missed You. It is shocking, he says. But it shows what is happening in the gig economy. He says the plan being announced today is huge. But it is one that will transform lives. McDonnell says for years people have said that taking on the multinationals is too difficult. But they accept that now is the time for it to happen. McDonnell says this is an example of a \u201cshovel-ready project\u201d that Labour would initiate immediately. McDonnell says this is not a return to the 1970s. This is public ownership for the future, he says. And the government will publish a charter of digital rights. McDonnell claims the Tories do not understand the problems facing the country, particularly the threat posed by the climate emergency. He says, when he is chancellor, he will not tolerate people dying from being homeless. He says it is important now for all infrastructure to be green. And, turning to broadband, he says that in South Korea state investment has led to 98% of the population being covered by full-fibre broadband. He says the UK has nothing like that scale of ambition. Now that is changing. Mark it in your diary, he says. It is a historic moment. British Broadband will be a new public service for the 21st century. It will have an infrastructure and a service arm, he says. And he says Labour will begin with the areas with the worst broadband. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is speaking now. He says, whatever the Conservatives throw at them, Labour will continue to be relentlessly positive in the campaign. Labour is costing every spending announcement, he says. But he says the Tory campaign is based on scaremongering. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is speaking now. She says there is clear evidence that rolling out full-fibre broadband will boost the economy. She says one CBI survey said a 10% increase in its reach could increase GDP by 1%. More people would be able to work at home under this plan, she says. And that would be good for the environment. It would also reduce the number of people shut out of the workforce. Corbyn says Labour has a track record of delivering tranformative change. Only Labour can deliver this project, he says. This will be at the heart of Labour\u2019s plans to tranform our society, he says. Corbyn says the initial upgrade will be funded by Labour\u2019s green transformation fund. And, when it comes to running costs, Labour will close down the tax loopholes exploited by the giant multinationals. They think they can get away with not paying their share. Well, I\u2019ve got news for them; not any more. Corbyn says Boris Johnson promised during the Tory leadership contest to make full-fibre broadband available for everyone. But people would have to pay for it. And now we have seen the government\u2019s plans. They involve copper cables that are already out of date, he says. Corbyn says there will be guaranteed jobs for people currently working in the broadband industry. Corbyn says the full-fibre broadband that Labour will deliver is the gold standard. It is the fastest and most secure. It will deliver \u201clightning fast\u201d download times, he says. The plans will save the average household \u00a330 a month on bills. Only eight to 10% of the UK has access to full-fibre broadband. In South Korea, it is 98%, he says. He says this is essential infrastructure. The best way for this to be provided is for the public to take control of it. Labour will create a new enterprise, British Broadband, overseeing a publicly owned network, delivering full-fibre broadband within 10 years. This will show Labour using public investment to transform the economy. This plan will also have national security implications, he says. The current companies have had little incentive to roll out full-fibre broadband to remote and rural areas. Labour would prioritise those areas. And then it would roll it out in towns. Finally it would complete the roll-out in urban centres. Jeremy Corbyn says at the start of the campaign he promised to put forward the most exciting plan ever seen. The party has not even published its manifesto, he says. When it comes next week, \u201cit is going to knock your socks off\u201d. He says he does not want to lead a government that allows people to think nothing ever changes. Today he is going to give a sneak preview. A Labour government will make broadband free for everybody. And not just any broadband, but the very fastest, full-fibre broadband, to every home in the country. He says, instead of billing customers, he will tax the internet giants such as Facebook and Google \u201cfairly\u201d to cover the running costs. Cat Smith, Labour\u2019s candidate for Lancaster and Fleetwood, is opening the Corbyn event. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give a speech on Labour\u2019s plans for free broadband in Lancaster. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson interview and phone-in with the BBC this morning. Johnson described Labour\u2019s plan for free broadband as \u201ccrackpot\u201d. Asked about his own plans for broadband, he said: What we are going to deliver is gigabyte broadband for all and what we won\u2019t be doing is some crackpot scheme that would involve many, many tens of billions of taxpayers\u2019 money nationalising a British business. He claimed that his decision not to publish the report into Russian interference in elections was nothing to do with his having something to hide. When asked if this was why it had not been published, he said that was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d the case. He claimed he was just following normal procedures. I see absolutely no reason to change the normal procedures for publishing ISC [intelligence and security committee] reports just because there\u2019s an election. Dominic Grieve, the chair of the committee, has strongly rejected the No 10 claim that the delay in the report\u2019s publication is routine. Johnson claimed there was no evidence of Russia interfering in UK elections. He said: There\u2019s no evidence of that and you\u2019ve got to be very careful before you ... you simply can\u2019t cast aspersions on everybody who comes from a certain country, just because of their nationality. He claimed not to know whether it was true that nine Russian oligarchs have given \u201cserious money\u201d to the Conservative party. Asked to confirm this, he said: \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d All donations were legitimate, he said: Frankly, all donations to the Conservative party are properly vetted and properly publicised, and I think all donations to the Conservative party and all other parties are properly vetted and properly publicised. I leave it to your teams of researchers to bring that fact before us - it\u2019s all there in the public domain. He said the government had \u201cgot to do better\u201d on the NHS. He declined an opportunity to clarify exactly how many children he has. The BBC\u2019s Rachel Burden told him this was an issue many people raised. She said: Lots of people have been in touch this morning saying, \u2018ask the prime minister how many children he has\u2019. That is a question that frequently comes up, just so you\u2019re aware.I think people find it odd that someone who is a public figure can\u2019t answer that question. Johnson said he did not comment on his children. But he told Burden she was wrong to assume that none of his children had gone to state schools. Your assertion that none of my children have been to state school is wrong. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. Ed Vaizey, the former Conservative minister for broadband, told the Today programme he thought Labour\u2019s plan for free broadband was \u201ccrazy\u201d. He explained: It will end up costing taxpayers a huge amount of money and I suspect it will delay the rollout of superfast broadband hugely. I think they will achieve completely the opposite effect \u2026 There\u2019s a difference between government investing strategically where there is market failure \u2013 and I\u2019ll acknowledge that in some areas there is market failure \u2013 and a wholesale nationalisation of the telecoms network. Australia have tried the sort of nationalisation approach with their broadband network. It\u2019s been a 10-year project, it\u2019s gone three times over-budget from $15bn dollars to $45-51bn dollars, and it\u2019s meant that Australia has dropped down the broadband rankings. Here is my colleague Rajeev Syel\u2019s most recent story about Labour\u2019s plan to provide free broadband, including what John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has been saying about it in interviews this morning. Jeremy Corbyn is giving a speech on this at 11am, and at the event he will also be taking questions, alongside McDonnell and Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary. We\u2019ll be covering it live. The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn has also been factchecking the PM. The Labour party has also been conducting its own factchecking scrutiny of what Boris Johnson said in the phone-in. The BBC\u2019s Reality Check team have posted two tweets about Boris Johnson\u2019s Radio 5 live phone-in. Welsh Labour has accused the leader of Plaid Cymru, Adam Price, of using offensive, populist and attention-grabbing language by comparing the oppression of people of colour over the centuries to being Welsh. When he addressed the Plaid conference last month, Price called for the Westminster government to pay its \u201cdebts\u201d to Wales. He said: We don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s charity \u2013 but reparation for a century of neglect that has left a country, rich in its resources, a bitter legacy of poverty, sickness, blighted lives and broken dreams. And in an interview published on Thursday by the Welsh thinktank iwa, Price said: We had an extractive economy with a political power centre outside of our nation. For most people that is analogous if not identical to the experience of colonialism. The context, of course, is going to be different in every case. The term internal colonialism was invented to describe the experience of African Americans in the United States. In fact, there is a quote from the 19th century where they were referencing our experience \u2013 the Welsh inside the British Isles \u2013 in order to explain their own experience of internal colonialism. I don\u2019t think you can understand the predicament we\u2019ve been left in without those two salient facts and the interrelationship between the two. Price said there was a \u201cgasp\u201d from the press when he made his remarks at conference and added: \u201cSometimes, let\u2019s be honest, you have to say very bold things in order to get a response.\u201d On Friday, Welsh Labour\u2019s health minister, Vaughan Gething, called for Price to apologise. He said: Plaid seek to present themselves as a party of tolerance and inclusion. Adam Price\u2019s choice yet again to use the provocative and racially loaded language of reparations is far from tolerant and inclusive. It is deliberately offensive attention-seeking. This isn\u2019t hidden, he brazenly admits it in the interview. He deliberately conflates the oppression of people of colour over the centuries with being Welsh, despite Wales\u2019s own role in that oppression being widespread and well documented. This is shameful. His faux-intellectual posturing is nothing more than Trumpian populism. We cannot allow this poison to take hold in our politics. Q: Your education was not typical. Johnson says he went to the same state primary school as Ed Miliband. Q: But you went to Eton. Can you ever see a time when state schools have the same resources as private ones? Johnson says he wants to level up school spending. Burden asks about Johnson\u2019s own children. They did not go to state schools, did they? Does he have any children who are still of school age? Johnson replies: I\u2019m not going to comment on my children, if that\u2019s all right. Burden says this issue does come up. She says many viewers say they want Johnson to be asked how many children he has. (See here.) Burden does not put the question to him directly, and he does not address it, saying he does not want to talk about his children, but he does say: Your assertion that none of my children have been to state schools is wrong. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary soon. Johnson says affordable childcare is \u201cthe holy grail\u201d. Q: There is a crisis in funding this. And it is women who are disproportionately affected. Johnson says he understands how important this issue is. He will be looking at what the government can do to help. Q: Why aren\u2019t you publishing the report on Russia before the election? Johnson says he sees no reason to change the normal procedures just because there is an election. Q: But it has been cleared for publication by the intelligence agencies. Johnson repeats the point about there being no need to change the standard publication procedures. (Dominic Grieve, the intelligence and security committee chair, has said it is not true to say that it is normal for No 10 to hold up a report like this for weeks. It has happened before, when a reports needs security clearance. But this report was cleared by the intelligence services some time ago.) Q: How many Russian oligarchs donate to the Conservative party? Johnson says those figures are publicly available. Rachel Burden asks about yesterday\u2019s A&amp;E waiting times. She says: Do you feel any sense of shame that the NHS has been brought to its knees by a Conservative government? At this point the caller intervenes, siding with Johnson. She says her personal experience of the NHS has been a good one. Johnson says he knows that the NHS needs more money. And so it would be crazy to waste next year having two referendums. (He keeps coming back to this attack line against Labour, that Labour denies. The party is only planning a single referendum, on Brexit, in 2020.) Johnsons says that when he was mayor of London, the city became one of the safest in the world. The murder rate went down to below 100 a year. Rachel Burden says that was only for a year. Johnson claims it was for several years. Burden says that\u2019s wrong. Here is an extract from a report my colleague Peter Walker wrote in June looking at Johnson\u2019s record as London mayor. Johnson said that as mayor from 2008 to 2016 he \u201ccut the murder rate by 50%\u201d, that knife crime went down, and he credited a rise in police stop-and-search operations with helping reduce crime. The reality is more mixed. The murder rate fell significantly, if not by 50% \u2013 from 155 in 2008 to a low of 94 in 2014. It did then start to rise again under Johnson, reaching 109 by 2016. The statistics for total knife offences varied over the eight years, but were only marginally lower at the end \u2013 9,937 in total for 2008-09, against 9,738 for 2015-16. Q: What are the Tories planning for mental health? Johnson says he wants to invest properly in mental health. He wants wraparound care. Q: Would you introduce free broadband? Johnson says what he would not do is introduce \u201csome crackpot scheme that would involve many, many billions of taxpayers\u2019 money nationalising a British business\u201d. Q: Parliament should get us out of the EU. And taking no deal off the table is a mistake. Parliament is not fit for purpose. Oliver Cromwell was right 500 years ago. Good luck to you. Johnson says he agrees. He thinks parliament has been \u201csenselessly\u201d blocking Brexit. And he agrees that the EU has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Listen to what President Macron is saying about creating a banking union and an European army. Macron is a brilliant guy, but this is not what the British want. Johnson says Labour would hold an independence referendum next year. And if Scotland joined the EU, it would have to adopt the euro. Rachel Burden, the presenter, interrupts Johnson. She says she does not want to let him spread \u201cdisinformation\u201d. Johnson says Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, has said she does want an independence referendum in 2020. Q: Are you committed to the union? Johnson says he is fully committed to the union. And Northern Ireland will remain part of UK customs territory. He says he takes it \u201cawry\u201d to be lectured on his commitment to the union from Jeremy Corbyn, who for years as actively sided with the IRA. The caller takes umbrage at this. She says in no way is she a Corbyn supporter. She knows full well about his background, she says. Rachel Burden says the BBC has asked customs experts if checks will be imposed on goods going from Northern Ireland to Britain. And the experts say that is not clear yet, because a joint committee will oversee the process. Johnson says, as prime minister, he is saying that there will not be checks. And in the last resort Stormont will have the power to end this arrangements. The caller says Stormont has not been sitting for 1,333 days. Johnson restates his claim that customs checks will not apply to goods being sent from Northern Ireland to Britain under his Brexit plan. This claim is contested, not least because Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has said \u201cexit summary declarations\u201d will have to apply to these goods. Q: Has anyone from the Conservatives promised anyone from the Brexit party a peerage? No, says Johnson. He ridicules the idea. He says it is on the Telegraph front page. Normally the Telegraph is reliable, he says. (He has been a highly paid columnist for years.) Q: So there have been no conversations with the Brexit party? Johnson says he cannot say that. He says people from rival parties do talk. But no peerages have been offered. Q: What about the Heathrow third runway? Johnson says he thinks the promoters of that project have yet to satisfy the authorities that the project will meet the right standards on access and air quality. These issues are being constested in the courts, he says. Q: My Tory candidate has failed Portishead. But I support your Brexit plan. What should I do? Johnson says he hopes the caller can support the Conservatives. He says there is a slightly \u201cfantastical\u201d proposal on broadband from Labour today. His party has a realistic plan, he says. Johnson says Labour\u2019s plan for free broadband is \u201cfantastical\u201d. Q: Our Tory candidate has promised for years to get a Portishead rail link into Bristol. But it has not been delivered. Can you promise this? Johnson says he cannot promise that route will be reopened. But today the Tories are unveiling plans to reverse the Beeching rail cuts. Was the Portishead line cut as part of those cuts? The caller says yes, it was. Q: Are you fully behind HS2? Johnson says this is a project with the costs mounting. It made sense to review it. Q: Are you fully behind it? Johnson says people deserve to know what his instincts are on this. But when it comes to scrapping something of national importance, \u201cI really do hestitate.\u201d Johnson suggests he is minded not to scrap HS2. BBC Radio 5 live\u2019s Rachel Burden starts. She says she wants to offer listeners as much clarity as possible. Q: [From someone who runs a fish and chip shop] How will you help businesses like mine? Johnson says he loves fish and chips. After Brexit the UK will take back control of its fishing waters. The government will support small businesses. It is putting \u00a32bn into training. And it wants to revitalise town centres too, he says. Q: Many shops feel it makes sense to stay below the threshold for paying VAT. This creates unfairness. It would be fairer if the threshold were reduced. We purchase potatoes, and we get fish from Iceland and Norway. Can you make it more of a level playing field? On VAT, Johnson says he gets the point. He will consider this. He understands the point about firms not having an incentive to stay below the point at which are are liable for VAT costs. Boris Johnson is now about to start taking questions from listeners on Radio 5 live. The phone-in is due to last an hour, and it is being shown on the BBC news channel too. While Boris Johnson was on BBC Breakfast, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was on the Today programme talking about the Labour manifesto promise to provide free \u201cfull-fibre\u201d broadband for every home and business in the UK by part-nationalising BT. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff has full coverage on the business live blog. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, picking up from Jedidajah Otte. Here is some more reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s BBC Breakfast interview. Full marks to the editor who decided to let Naga Munchetty do the interview. In an interview at Tory conference Johnson said that he did not know who Munchetty was, even though at that point the row generated by the BBC\u2019s decision to reprimand her for commenting on Donald Trump\u2019s racism had been headline news for days. If you detected an edgy undercurrent to the interview, that was why. It got particularly tense when Munchetty started asking Johnson how people can relate to him as a family man. At this point the PM seemed distinctly uneasy, but Munchetty spared him the question he probably dreads the most: how many children do you have? (As far as I know, the only journalists who have asked him this are Jason Groves and Jack Doyle from the Daily Mail, in an interview in July. They did not get an answer. Johnson has four children by his second wife and at least one other, but the question has not gone away because there are rumours he might have another.) Here is some more comment on the interview from journalists. And this is from Piers Morgan, the presenter of ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, who is accusing Johnson of another broken promise. The Johnson interview is over now. Here a first reaction from Sky\u2019s Rob Powell: Johnson says he wants every child in this country to have the most amazing opportunities, and that in order to achieve that, Brexit needs to get done. Munchetty says she wants to get a \u201cfeel\u201d for who he is. She asks him about his family life, which seems to be an uncomfortable question for the PM. He responds by saying again that he wants every child to unleash their full potential. Why is he relatable though?, he is asked. Munchetty plays a clip of him using a mop in a very awkward way. Has he ever used a mop before, she asks. She says he is very different from most people in this country, that he is privileged. Johnson is now asked whether he has done enough for the flood victims. He says you can never do enough for someone who has suffered in a flooding. Of course there\u2019s always more you can do, he says, but he will make sure that the insurers don\u2019t \u201cweasel out of their obligations\u201d to the flood victims. His government has put far more into flood defence than previous Labour governments, he says, \u00a32.6bn. They move on to migration. Is net migration going to rise and fall under a Conservative government? Johnson says \u201cit\u2019s a great thing\u201d that there are \u201cmore EU nationals in the UK than ever before\u201d. Once we come out of the EU, in January, we will take control of our borders, the PM says. When pressed for particular target numbers, Johnson says he doesn\u2019t want to play the numbers game. He says the problem is uncontrolled immigration, and that this is what Labour wants to pursue. He brings up an Australian-style point-based immigration system again. Is a brain surgeon or a porter getting more points? His analysts haven\u2019t decided yet, the PM says. Munchetty is now quizzing the PM on the NHS. Johnson tells a story of how he had to go to Hillingdon hospital last year because of a piece of glass in his foot. He says staff asked for more funding, and that the way to fund the NHS is to have a strong, robust economy. He says a Conservative government will rebuild Hillingdon hospital. What about record A&amp;E waiting times? Munchetty say \u00a320.5bn is the figure for increased NHS funding the Tories have pledged. Johnson retorts that the correct number is \u00a334bn, but seems startled. The PM is quizzed on GP numbers. 272 is the actual increase of GPs achieved last year, Munchetty says, not 5,000 as Jeremy Hunt promised as health secretary. Johnson says Labour wrecked the economy when they were in power. Boris Johnson is now on the BBC Breakfast sofa. Presenter Naga Munchetty says she wants to get clarity from party leaders in these interviews. She kicks off by challenging the PM\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done\u201d campaign slogan. Brexit won\u2019t be \u201cdone\u201d anytime soon, she says, there will be a transition period, and a second phase of negotiation on the future relationship. Boris Johnson responds saying it was parliament that caused the delay, and repeats his standard catalogue of Brexit-related soundbites, taking back control etc. He says if he gets a majority he will try to \u201cget Brexit done by January\u201d, adding he thinks Brexit can \u201cturbo-charge\u201d a one-nation agenda. One problem for Corbyn and McDonnell today will be that BT says that a full-fibre rollout will cost \u00a340bn \u2013 double the Labour estimate. This from Neil McRae, the chief network architect at BT: Chris Leslie, who defected from the Labour party to join what is now the Independent Group for Change, tweeted this yesterday evening, for those who missed it. Let\u2019s look at some reactions to Labour\u2019s pledge to roll out free broadband to every household and business over the next 11 years. This from Labour\u2019s David Lammy: And this from the Lib Dems\u2019 Sam Gyimah: Labour peer Andrew Adonis: This from Sky\u2019s Rowland Manthorpe: Hello, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Kate Lyons. The headlines suggest it won\u2019t be a boring day in politics. Labour\u2019s ambitious free-broadband-for-all pledge via a part-nationalisation of BT by 2030 is already prompting juicy reactions on Twitter. Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell will present further details of this \u00a320bn taxpayer-funded project at a campaign event in Lancashire, and people will be falling over themselves to grill them thoroughly. The event is due to start at 11am, followed by a Q&amp;A. But first McDonnell will be on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme and on Sky News at 8.30am. Boris Johnson, who has pledged \u00a35bn to roll out full-fibre broadband to every home by 2025, will be on BBC Breakfast at 8am and BBC Radio 5 Live at 9am. Let\u2019s go! The papers A reminder of what Boris Johnson was up to yesterday as he visited the West Monkton CEVC Primary School in Taunton, Somerset. In the latest instalment of the Guardian\u2019s People and Power series, Aamna Mohdin has written about the way a residents\u2019 Facebook group could swing the seat of Canterbury. Local newspaper editors once controlled the information that circled around a town or small city during an election. But in Canterbury in 2019, that power has fallen into the lap of the 32-year-old administrator of a Facebook group. Edd Withers set up the Canterbury Residents Group on Facebook five years ago in an attempt to bridge the divide between the city\u2019s large student population and its older residents. In a sign of the changing media environment that could shape this election, what started as a community project to bring generations together has turned into a lively and often chaotic rolling political conversation about all manner of issues affecting the city. Of the nearly 100 Canterbury residents who contacted the Guardian about the tight race in their constituency, Withers\u2019 Facebook group was mentioned more than a dozen times. While one resident described it as \u201ca good starting point to find the \u2018real\u2019 residents and the issues they are passionate about\u201d, another said they left the group \u201cbecause of the extreme views and bullying behaviour\u201d. Quite an interesting new campaign video from the Labour team. The drama around deals between parties continues to roil. Nigel Farage has attacked the Conservative party after it was claimed that senior Brexit party figures \u2013 including Ann Widdecombe \u2013 had been offered post-election roles or peerages as part of an attempt to get him to stand down more candidates at the general election. Farage said it showed \u201cthe system is corrupt and broken\u201d. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news. I\u2019m Kate Lyons and will be with you on the liveblog for the first hour or so of the day, before I hand over to my excellent colleagues. As usual, you can get in touch with your questions, thoughts, witticisms etc on Twitter or email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). It\u2019s a big day for promises as both Labour and the Conservatives roll out big-spending, crowd-pleasing election pledges. The Conservatives are offering a package to revitalise neglected towns while Labour is promising free full-fibre broadband for homes and businesses. Boris Johnson says a Tory government would spend hundreds of millions of pounds reviving dying high streets and struggling communities. It includes discounts on business rates, rate relief for pubs, money to reopen train stations and a \u00a3150m fund to help groups trying to take over and run pubs and post offices threatened with closure. Labour has criticised the proposal, saying the Conservatives are the ones responsible for destroying high streets and towns through \u201ca decade of vicious cuts to the services that people on our communities rely on\u201d. Meanwhile, Labour is promising free full-fibre broadband for every home and business by partly nationalising BT. Jeremy Corbyn will outline the plan during a speech in Lancaster, saying: \u201cWhat was once a luxury is now an essential utility.\u201d The plan, estimated to cost about \u00a320bn, will be funded partly by high taxes on internet companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. The Conservatives have criticised the policy, saying it was a \u201cfantasy plan to effectively nationalise broadband [that] would cost hardworking taxpayers tens of billions\u201d. As for what will happen today: Jeremy Corbyn will be announcing his broadband plan in a speech on digital infrastructure in Lancaster this morning. Boris Johnson will launch his campaign bus in Oldham at lunchtime. The Lib Dems go to Leeds where Ed Davey will be giving a speech in the afternoon on economics. And there is a big question mark hanging over the Brexit party\u2019s campaign events. There is meant to be a launch in Dudley for their candidate but it\u2019s unclear if that will go ahead \u2013 given the candidate has pulled out of the seat. Join us for the ride!",

The City executive and head of Finsbury PR resigned as the chairman of Open Britain, one of the pro-EU groups campaigning for a second referendum and the largest constituent organisation under the People\u2019s Vote umbrella. Open Britain\u2019s new chair is Anne Weyman, a former chief executive of the Family Planning Association, the Times disclosed. Her deputy is Geeta Sidhu-Robb, the founder of Nosh Detox, a nutrition business.

The prime minister was challenged on Friday on subjects as varied as crime, Brexit, the abandoned London garden bridge project and the number of children he has fathered. Following a relatively low-key start to the Conservative general election campaign, which has mainly involved Johnson being shepherded around carefully stage-managed events, he endured a one-hour grilling from BBC Radio 5 Live listeners, among other engagements. Johnson appeared uncomfortable on several occasions \u2013 not least when, during an interview on BBC One\u2019s Breakfast programme, he was asked how families across the country could relate to him. He eventually answered: \u201cI have not the faintest idea.\u201d Responding to a Radio 5 Live caller who asked about policies to tackle knife crime, Johnson said an increase in stop-and-search operations when he was London mayor between 2008 and 2016 had allowed 11,000 knives to be taken off the streets. However, this was a total that included weapons seized through means other than stop and search. He also repeated other questionable claims about crime when he was mayor, ones made repeatedly during the Tory leadership race, including that he had consistently reduced the number of murders in London to fewer than 100 a year. When the presenter, Rachel Burden, pointed out that this was wrong \u2013 it happened once during Johnson\u2019s eight years as mayor, with 94 murders in 2014, rising above 100 the next year \u2013 the PM stuck by his claim, saying: \u201cNo. Fewer than 100 for several years running.\u201d On another legacy of his time as mayor, Johnson tried to avoid blame for the cancelled garden bridge project, with losses of more than \u00a350m, saying this was the fault of his Labour successor, Sadiq Khan, for cancelling the scheme. Khan did withdraw support for the bridge, but as a means to limit public losses on a seemingly doomed plan, championed by Johnson, which had spent enormous sums despite not securing full planning approvals. On Brexit, Johnson repeated his regular complaint that parliament had blocked his deal \u2013 in fact MPs supported the second reading but sought more time to scrutinise it \u2013 and that there would be no checks or paperwork for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. Asked by a caller if, under his Brexit plan, he could commit to no such checks or paperwork, Johnson said: \u201cYes, I absolutely can.\u201d This is under debate, not least as Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, told a recent House of Lords committee that businesses would need to complete \u201cexit summary declarations\u201d for such shipments. Johnson\u2019s performance was mocked by Labour, with the party\u2019s press operation tweeting a series of links to articles debunking his claims. \u201cBoris Johnson can\u2019t help himself,\u201d one tweet began. Other errors were more straightforward and easier to verify. Asked by Burden what proportion of net migration to the UK came from the EU as opposed to other nations, Johnson said he believed it was about half. It is, Burden told him, just under a quarter. And some were merely political attack lines, if none the more accurate for that. Speaking later at a campaign event in Oldham, Greater Manchester, Johnson said Jeremy Corbyn \u201cactually thinks home ownership is a bad idea\u201d, not a view the Labour leader appears to have expressed. He also accused Corbyn of wanting to disband the armed forces, when the furthest Corbyn seems to have gone on this was a generalised wish for more countries to be able to act like Costa Rica and have no army. After his series of media interviews, Johnson travelled to Lancashire, where he unveiled his party\u2019s battlebus in the Labour safe-seat of Oldham West and Royton. He gave a stump speech to a group of party activists in front of the vehicle \u2013 adorned with the slogan: \u201cGet Brexit done, unleash Britain\u2019s potential\u201d \u2013 in a warehouse of the parcel delivery company DPD, which has been criticised in recent years for its couriers\u2019 working conditions. \u201cYou may ask: \u2018Why do we need a bus? Why do we need an election?\u2019 Well, the answer is that parliament is unfortunately paralysed,\u201d said Johnson. He likened parliament to \u201ca blocked artery at the heart of the British body politic\u201d and said that passing his Brexit deal would be like an angioplasty, \u201cunblocking the system and getting us back on our feet\u201d. The Tory party will on Saturday urge people to \u201cvote blue, go green\u201d, pledging a new \u00a3500m fund to protect the world\u2019s oceans and to triple tree-planting rates. \u201cThere is nothing more Conservative than protecting our environment and these measures sit alongside our world-leading commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,\u201d Johnson was set to say. Five questionable assertions Claim: Johnson said that as London mayor he reduced the murder rate to below 100 \u201cseveral years running\u201d. Fact: It was just one year: 2014. Claim: It was \u201cJeremy Corbyn and the Labour party\u201d who were responsible for delaying Brexit beyond 31 October. Fact: Johnson was obliged to seek a new date because of a law drawn up by backbenchers led by the Tory MP Oliver Letwin \u2013 although this was backed by Labour. Claim: The massive losses from the doomed London garden bridge were not his fault. Fact: As mayor of London, Johnson relentlessly pushed the project, despite repeated warnings about its viability. He has yet to fully explain his role in losses totalling more than \u00a350m. Claim: There will be no paperwork for Northern Irish firms exporting goods to the rest of the UK. Fact: This is not what Johnson\u2019s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has said. Claim: Labour, if elected, would have two referendums in 2020 \u2013 on Brexit and Scottish independence. Fact: Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly ruled out a second Scottish independence vote in the first period of government.",

She spoke about feeling undermined and threatened as the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr, and Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, spread smears against her. \u201cIf our chief representative is kneecapped, it limits our effectiveness to safeguard the vital national security interests of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cOur Ukraine policy has been thrown into disarray, and shady interests the world over have learned how little it takes to remove an American ambassador who does not give them what they want,\u201d Yovanovitch added. \u201cAfter these events, what foreign official, corrupt or not, could be blamed for wondering whether the ambassador represents the president\u2019s views?\u201d Yovanovitch then turned to the role of her superiors in the state department. \u201cI remain disappointed that the department\u2019s leadership and others have declined to acknowledge that the attacks against me and others are dangerously wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cAs foreign service professionals are being denigrated and undermined, the institution is also being degraded. This will soon cause real harm, if it hasn\u2019t already. \u201cMoreover, the attacks are leading to a crisis in the state department as the policy process is visibly unravelling, leadership vacancies go unfilled, and senior and mid-level officers ponder an uncertain future and head for the doors,\u201d Yovanovitch said. In apparent response, Trump tweeted: \u201cWe have vacancies in various departments because we do not want or need as many people as past administrations (and save great cost), and also, the Democrats delay the approval process to levels unprecedented in the history of our Country!\u201d Widespread vacancies in key ambassadorial posts and decision-making roles have hindered the state department\u2019s ability to function properly. Foreign diplomats in Washington regularly complain that many of their US counterparts have left the department and been replaced with officials in an acting capacity without authority to make decisions. Pompeo has sought to keep a low profile over the Ukraine scandal, dismissing it as background \u201cnoise\u201d. He has spent an increasing amount of time in his home state of Kansas, and giving interviews to Kansan media, adding fuel to speculation about a future Senate run. State department diplomats are growing increasingly restive and cynical about his promotion of buzzwords like \u201cswagger\u201d and his \u201cone team, one mission\u201d ethos. \u201cIt is very reminiscent of the army \u2018creed\u2019 which he probably remembers from his time at West Point in the army,\u201d a senior American diplomat said. \u201cThere is an apparent contradiction between the ethos and how he has behaved towards his own ambassadors and officials.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A series of howls and shrieks recorded in the Canadian wilderness have left a hunter and government biologists searching for explanations. Gino Meekis was out hunting grouse with his wife and grandson in the forests of north-western Ontario \u2013 more than 50km from the closest town \u2013 when they heard a series of eerie noises in the distance. \u201cWhen it let out the first scream, I thought it was a moose, but my mind changed when it screamed again and again,\u201d Meekis told Vice. A resident of Sioux Lookout, Meekis is an avid hunter and has grown accustomed to the sights and sounds of the region. Moose, black bears and wolves are relatively common sights in the backcountry. \u201cI\u2019ve heard many different animals in the wild but nothing like this. I grew up hunting with my grandfather for the first 12 years of my life,\u201d he said. The howls initially came from the distance but soon they appeared to move much closer, said Meekis. \u201cWe could hear it moving \u2026 it sounded kind of heavy,\u201d Meekis told CTV News. \u201cBut my wife, she got scared \u2026 picked up [our grandson] and started walking fast towards the vehicle.\u201d As the group retreated, Meekis pulled out his phone and began recording the howls as well as his grandson trying to mimic them. The video, since posted to YouTube, has received more than half a million views. Some speculated the sounds could come from a grizzly bear. While the species has never been documented in the region, a recent study found their range is dramatically larger than originally thought. Others speculated it could be a large wolf. But the footage also prompted speculation that it offered evidence of the Sasquatch (also known as Bigfoot) or Wendigo, two legendary cryptids said to roam the hinterlands of Canada. The latter, a figure from Indigenous folklore, is considered to be a malevolent spirit that can induce psychosis. Biologists with Ontario\u2019s ministry of resources and forestry are skeptical that the sounds come from an unidentified specifies \u2013 but also admit they are not certain of the source, said spokeswoman Jolanta Kowalski in an emailed statement to media. \u201cOur biologists say it could be a larger mammal \u2013 for example a wolf \u2013 but because it\u2019s a considerable distance from the recorder there is no way to know for sure.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cAn electric ute would be great,\u201d Rhys Jones says from the driver\u2019s seat of his ute while waiting out the front of the work site.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much it would cost in terms of set up and all that, but I\u2019ve been on jobs where I\u2019ve seen electric cars. They sneak up on ya. There\u2019s no motor in them, so the engines run silent.\u201d</p> <p>Three months ago the 28-year-old South Australian carpenter bought a brand new 2019 Nissan Navara, NP300 dual cab ute. It cost $42,000, before he installed a new canopy to protect his tools, an upgraded suspension system, a winch, a bulbar and a scrub bar. With all the extras, the final price came to $58,000.</p> <p>It was a decision Rhys says he made for work, though the set up meant he could also go camping, fishing and four-wheel-driving on the weekends with friends. That said, the job often makes it hard to get away. He works six days a week for his dad\u2019s construction company, Monday-through-Saturday, and is usually on site from 7am every morning.</p> <p>On engine preference, Rhys says he doesn\u2019t know what the fuss is about. He doesn\u2019t care so much what\u2019s under the hood, so long as it does what he needs it to do \u2013 though anything that would help cut fuel costs would be welcome.</p> <p>A read-out on the dash of his ute tells him he\u2019s been burning diesel at a rate of 11.4 litres every 100 kilometres. It doesn\u2019t help that Australian fuel is of such low quality the average person is paying $500 a year just to drive the country\u2019s roads.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fun paying for fuel,\u201d Rhys says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically burning money. Some people have different views on electric cars. On the way they were built, or how much energy they consume in that process.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind \u2019em. I\u2019m not out to save the world or anything, but I like trying to do the right thing by trying to stop fuel emissions and trying to stop global warming and all that. Little things that if everyone did them, would help.\u201d</p> <p>To date, however, the problem is that the choice in what vehicle to buy hasn\u2019t been much of a choice at all, thanks to the lax Australian regulations governing fuel efficiency, CO2 emissions and fuel quality. Combined, these have worked to preserve the dominance of petrol engines in the market, while turning the car a person drives into an unlikely political issue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b2d0838f3c11d4e081157170ed6743399b170f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b2d0838f3c11d4e081157170ed6743399b170f5/0_307_4628_2778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Going nowhere: Scott Morrison sits at the wheel of a a truck during a factory visit in Brisbane in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Going nowhere: Scott Morrison sits at the wheel of a a truck during a factory visit in Brisbane in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jono Searle/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in April, Scott Morrison broke a tenuous bipartisanship on electric vehicles (EVs) in the lead up to the federal election when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/07/shorten-wants-to-end-the-weekend-morrison-attacks-labors-electric-vehicle-policy\">slammed the innovations as a \u201cthreat to the weekend\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI tell you what,\u201d Scott Morrison said as the early April sun bore down on those <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOBZOsVlUWs\">gathered for a press conference in North Richmond</a>. \u201c[An electric vehicle] is not going to tow your trailer.

Back in April, Scott Morrison broke a tenuous bipartisanship on electric vehicles (EVs) in the lead up to the federal election when he slammed the innovations as a \u201cthreat to the weekend\u201d. \u201cI tell you what,\u201d Scott Morrison said as the early April sun bore down on those gathered for a press conference in North Richmond. \u201c[An electric vehicle] is not going to tow your trailer.

Together the two events are indicative of the Coalition\u2019s approach to road emissions. All told there are 19.5m cars on Australian roads but the strategy for managing their CO2 emissions may be best described as \u201chands-off\u201d. The strategy has been to let other countries do the heavy lifting by relying on the passive transfer of technology as newer, more efficient cars are imported into Australia. On the face of it, the official stats lend credence to the idea, showing average CO2 emissions from the cars on Australian roads have been falling modestly over time. The catch, according to recent research by Robin Smit, adjunct professor at the University of Technology Sydney, is that those figures do not reflect lived reality. \u201cAustralia has no ongoing emissions testing program of its own,\u201d Smit says. \u201cIn fact it hasn\u2019t conducted vehicle testing since 2008, so we don\u2019t really know how our fleet performs in the real world.\u201d \u201cEmission figures are therefore increasingly based on those in Europe, where lots of real-world testing has resulted since the Volkswagen scandal.

Dirty diesel In fact, a separate study conducted by progressive thinktank the Australia Institute found vehicle emissions had risen 10% over the past decade as Australians had increasingly opted to purchase larger diesel vehicles. Report author Hugh Saddler, an energy expert and honorary associate professor with the Australian National University\u2019s Crawford School of Public Policy, found annual carbon dioxide emissions from burning diesel increased by 21.7m tonnes between 2011 and 2018.

Saddler said governments and industry had improved fuel efficiency of heavy road freight vehicles but done little to lift the efficiency of light vehicles such as the work ute or family car. One of the culprits for the uptick in purchases of these larger, dirtier vehicles may be what is known as the \u201cleakage effect\u201d. The effect was first seen in the US, where some states, led by California, introduced strict regulations governing fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions. Carmakers in the US responded to the regulatory changes by splitting their product range, sending cars with newer, more efficient engines to those highly regulated states, while the older and dirtier models in the product line went to those those without. The result was any beneficial CO2 emission reduction was cancelled out. Industry groups warn that Australia is at risk of similarly becoming a dumping ground for inefficient cars, if that hasn\u2019t already happened. As a means of reducing transport emissions, regulating the trifecta of fuel quality, vehicle emissions standards and fuel efficiency represents a tried and tested strategy. The interaction between the three creates incentives for technological development while transitioning fleets to lower or zero-carbon status, but Australia appears to be failing on all three counts. On fuel quality alone, Australia ranks 66th in the world and the worst among developed nations. Its record on fuel efficiency and emissions standards is worse. Standards may cover 80% of the global car market, with the US having first introduced regulations back in 1975, but Australia has never had regulations for mandatory fuel efficiency or CO2 emissions \u2013 despite multiple calls for action. In July, a Senate select committee recommended standards be introduced, along with a national electric vehicle strategy as a way to transition the fleet. Policy inertia An earlier edition of the Coalition government created a body called the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions to set standards on fuel-efficiency standards, fuel quality and CO2 emissions. Though the forum barely met in an official capacity, the research underpinning its work was performed in wide consultation with carmakers, industry bodies and a pantheon of relevant experts. As the 2019 federal election approached, however, its work stalled entirely, says Behyad Jafari of the Electric Vehicles Council. \u201cWe\u2019d spent a number of years proactively working with the government for a long time,\u201d Jafari says. \u201cThen the government dropped it. Today it\u2019s sitting there with no one working on it. It\u2019s sitting on the top shelf, untouched.\u201d Jafari says the international investors he regularly speaks to have been shocked by Australia\u2019s total lack of regulatory standards. While he says companies are continuing to invest in Australia, the country has fallen further down the priority list when it comes to deciding what cars get sent where. To date the federal government has been attempting to plug the policy vacuum by having a team within the environment department write a National Electric Vehicle Strategy. The strategy will help manage the uptake of electric cars ahead of 2027 when they are projected to reach a tipping point in the market \u2013 the same year Australia is now pegged to get better-quality fuels. It will help, says Tony Weber, the chief executive of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, but without critical investment in basic infrastructure, Australia won\u2019t catch up to the rest of the world. \u201cWe cannot run the most advanced engines in the world that are coming out of the latest R&amp;D because of the fuel quality,\u201d Weber says. \u201cEven in the transition to electric, people will buy plug-in hybrids first, which won\u2019t run properly on Australian fuel. \u201cWe can deliver the best-quality engines to Australian consumers, so long as we have the fuel to run them, but we don\u2019t have the fuel. The two are interrelated. Better CO2 emissions are driven by better-quality fuel, so it\u2019s high-school science. Rubbish in, rubbish out.\u201d Weber says the situation is \u201cenormously frustrating\u201d for car companies, especially as the government appears attuned to lobbying efforts run by the petrol refining industry which have \u201ckicked up a fuss\u201d. It is a situation Weber says doesn\u2019t need to exist, as the government could act any time, but so far it has simply decided not to. When asked why he thinks that is, Weber pauses for a moment before answering with a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re asking the wrong bloke,\u201d he says.",

      "bodyText": "In the wake of Labor\u2019s election defeat, strategists and commentators have called on the party to abandon \u201cidentity politics\u201d. Paradoxically, many of them simultaneously demand more identity politics, though perhaps without realising it. Take Nick Dyrenfurth, from the John Curtin Research Centre. He\u2019s issued a widely-publicised denunciation of Labor\u2019s embrace of identity politics, which he defines as \u201cthe idea that we are all essentially defined by our membership of an intersecting set of categories based on gender or race\u201d. Instead, he wants the ALP to reconnect with the working class. What does \u201cworking class\u201d mean? The early theorists of social democracy understood the term as referring to all those who sold their labour power to others. Class wasn\u2019t, in other words, a static identity so much as a relationship, an antagonism between employers and those reliant on a salary. It didn\u2019t necessarily involve particular activities or attitudes. Almost any skillset can be performed as wage labour. Workers can be blue-collar or white-collar. They can live in the city or the outback. They can be any race or any gender; they can be Muslim or atheist or Rastafarian; they can vote Greens or read the Australian. In the past, leftwingers emphasised the universalism of class as the basis for collectivity, enabling and motivating the \u201c99%\u201d to resolve differences and unite against the \u201c1%\u201d. Insofar as the process created a class \u201cidentity\u201d, it was a fluid and inclusive one, shaped by the struggle itself: think about how Malak Alaywe Herz became an icon of the protests in Lebanon after a photo of her karate-kicking a cop went viral. The early advocates for women\u2019s liberation, black liberation and gay liberation often embraced some notion of class unity, precisely because the working class seemed able to facilitate the structural change they saw as necessary to overcome oppression. By contrast, the identity politics of the late seventies and early eighties tended to rely on academics, writers or others from relatively privileged positions to advocate in the name of an oppressed bloc. Identity politics, in other words, focused more on the symbolic or cultural issues important to the intelligentsia than the material reforms crucial to combating the sexism and racism affecting the less well-off. Class can, then, provide a model of social change quite different from the preoccupations of \u201cidentity politics\u201d. But that\u2019s not Dyrenfurth\u2019s argument. Rather than discussing class as a social relationship, he treats it as a static category, defined primarily by educational levels, types of labour and geographical locations. In other words, he sketches out a class \u201cidentity\u201d: a set of traits, values and attitudes that he ascribes to workers as a bloc. For him \u2013 and the others making similar arguments \u2013 real workers have blue-collar jobs, live in outer suburbs or regional Australia, and harbour such socially conservative ideas that they\u2019re shocked \u2013 shocked! \u2013 at Labor\u2019s unpatriotic radicalism. Most of these descriptors are quite arbitrary. According to the 2016 census, some 56% of people aged 15 and over now have a post-school qualification. In other words, an awful lot of Australian workers have some experience of higher education \u2013 but when a pundit talks of the \u201cworking class\u201d they\u2019ll never discuss, say, the casual staff on an IT help desk. Similarly, the nostalgic invocations of \u201cLabor\u2019s traditional working class base\u201d inevitably focus on blue-collar Tories rather than the militants of the CFMEU. Whatever Dyrenfurth thinks he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s not posing class as an alternative to identity politics: he\u2019s offering class as identity politics. Rather than arguing that identity arises from politics, he\u2019s positing a politics that arises from identity, exactly like the people he claims to oppose. That\u2019s why he adopts the same strategies, arguing, for instance, that Labor should embrace a quota system to elect MPs from the particular identity he favours. Michael Thompson made the same argument in his 1999 book Labor Without Class, insisting that the ALP would only reconnect with blue-collar workers by moving further to the right. Similarly, Mark Latham has built an entire career out of performative identity claims. He might never have held down a normal job but, as he\u2019s cannoned crazily from one political party to another, he\u2019s anchored his reactionary ideas to his supposed lived experience in the western suburbs of Sydney. That being said, there\u2019s a reason why the identity politics of the right are enjoying something of a moment with the ALP still reeling from the electoral defeat. \u201cLabor lost support amongst its traditional base of lower-income working people,\u201d explains the just-released post-election review. \u201cEconomically vulnerable workers living in outer-metropolitan, regional and rural Australia have lost trust in politicians and political institutions. Indeed, they are often resentful of the attention progressive political parties give at their expense to minority groups and to what is nowadays called identity politics.\u201d Rightwing identity politics can seize hold of such passages to justify ever more conservative positions. By presenting class through identity politics \u2013 describing an essentialised identity based on scrabbled together clich\u00e9s about working class life and then deriving your policies to match \u2013 you can use the moral weight of inequality to legitimise anything you want. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning If, for instance, you present the \u201creal workers\u201d as white, socially conservative men living in small towns, then, almost by definition, you\u2019ll agree with Paul Kelly that \u201cLabor must get more like Morrison: it needs to listen \u2026 to the \u2018quiet Australians\u2019.\u201d Yet if you think of class in structural terms, it\u2019s immediately obvious that many of Australia\u2019s most vulnerable workers themselves belong to minority groups. Think of the revelations about systemic underpayment within the 7-Eleven franchise. That saga centred on members of the modern working class who just so happen to be young, urban and predominantly brown-skinned. Such people don\u2019t consider racism or Islamophobia or, for that matter, border policy \u201cirrelevant\u201d to their lives. The working-class queer kid driven out of home for his sexuality is not indifferent to homophobia, any more than Indigenous workers are indifferent to the history of colonialism. But precisely because they are vulnerable, they\u2019re only going to embrace a political party when it offers them real, material change rather than platitudes. In other words, bridging the gap between progressives and the modern working class requires a commitment to structural transformations that will genuinely affect the lives of ordinary people. Everyone knows that the wealthy will be able to minimise the worst aspects of climate change. Everyone knows that the poor won\u2019t. But it\u2019s crazy to expect working-class people to enthuse about an environmental strategy that\u2019s either symbolic or places the burden of change predominantly on the less fortunate. As counterintuitive as it may seem to most pundits, workers \u2013 even those who are currently apathetic or conservative \u2013 are far less likely to care about a Liberal-lite climate policy than one that promises economic change alongside environmental change, in the manner of a US-style Green New Deal. A fresh outbreak of class-based identity politics will only accentuate the distance between working-class people and those who claim to speak for them.

Let\u2019s begin with the organising idea of the week, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/11/dear-michael-mccormack-the-only-raving-lunatics-are-those-not-worrying-about-climate-change\">various politicians asserted</a>, both in measured ways and unhinged ways, that it was inappropriate to talk about climate change while bushfires ravaged the country.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear about what this line of argument is.</p> <p>It\u2019s self-serving crap.</p> <p>It is entirely possible to have a sensible discussion about climate change and the risks it poses, including the risks of longer and more intense fire seasons, and still do all the things that need to be done to protect lives and property.</p> <p>We have that bandwidth. In fact Australia demonstrated amply over the course of the past few days our collective capacity to walk and chew gum at the same time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/this-is-climate-changed-pray-for-rain-pray-harder-for-leadership\">This is climate changed - pray for rain, pray harder for leadership | Badja Sparks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite all the finger waggling from politicians, or perhaps because of it, the climate conversation happened in tandem with heroic efforts by emergency services workers to save lives and contain the damage. In fact, the most compelling part of the conversation about bushfires being a symptom of climate change was led by emergency service workers: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/former-australian-fire-chiefs-say-coalition-doesnt-like-talking-about-climate-change\">a coalition of former fire chiefs</a>, who point blank refused various invitations from politicians to shut up.</p> <p>Given there is no law that says bushfires preclude sensible, evidence-based policy conversations, it\u2019s reasonable to ask why this particular prohibition was asserted.</p> <p>The answer to that is simple. The Coalition does not want its record raked over at a time when Australians are deeply anxious, because it\u2019s hard to control the narrative in those conditions. The government does not want people who are not particularly engaged in politics, and who make a point of not following Canberra\u2019s periodically rancid policy debates (and climate is the most toxic of the lot), switching on to this issue at a time where they have a personal stake in the conversation.</p> <p>While Scott Morrison has acknowledged there is a link between climate change and natural disasters, and in attitudinal terms that acknowledgement is a positive development, it\u2019s not really in the prime minister\u2019s interests for anyone to press very assertively on that pressure point, particularly not at a time when the prolonged drought (another symptom of climate change) is already making the Coalition\u2019s supporters restive.</p> <p>Morrison doesn\u2019t invite the climate action interrogation, because the government\u2019s record is abysmal, and I don\u2019t invoke that word lightly.

      "bodyText": "In a dispiriting political week like the one we\u2019ve just had, it helps to keep things simple. Let\u2019s begin with the organising idea of the week, where various politicians asserted, both in measured ways and unhinged ways, that it was inappropriate to talk about climate change while bushfires ravaged the country. Let\u2019s be clear about what this line of argument is. It\u2019s self-serving crap. It is entirely possible to have a sensible discussion about climate change and the risks it poses, including the risks of longer and more intense fire seasons, and still do all the things that need to be done to protect lives and property. We have that bandwidth. In fact Australia demonstrated amply over the course of the past few days our collective capacity to walk and chew gum at the same time. Despite all the finger waggling from politicians, or perhaps because of it, the climate conversation happened in tandem with heroic efforts by emergency services workers to save lives and contain the damage. In fact, the most compelling part of the conversation about bushfires being a symptom of climate change was led by emergency service workers: a coalition of former fire chiefs, who point blank refused various invitations from politicians to shut up. Given there is no law that says bushfires preclude sensible, evidence-based policy conversations, it\u2019s reasonable to ask why this particular prohibition was asserted. The answer to that is simple. The Coalition does not want its record raked over at a time when Australians are deeply anxious, because it\u2019s hard to control the narrative in those conditions. The government does not want people who are not particularly engaged in politics, and who make a point of not following Canberra\u2019s periodically rancid policy debates (and climate is the most toxic of the lot), switching on to this issue at a time where they have a personal stake in the conversation. While Scott Morrison has acknowledged there is a link between climate change and natural disasters, and in attitudinal terms that acknowledgement is a positive development, it\u2019s not really in the prime minister\u2019s interests for anyone to press very assertively on that pressure point, particularly not at a time when the prolonged drought (another symptom of climate change) is already making the Coalition\u2019s supporters restive. Morrison doesn\u2019t invite the climate action interrogation, because the government\u2019s record is abysmal, and I don\u2019t invoke that word lightly. The Liberal and National parties have done everything within their collective power to frustrate climate action in Australia for more than a decade. The Coalition repealed the carbon price. They attempted to gut the renewable energy target. They imposed fig-leaf policies costing taxpayers billions that have failed to stop emissions rising every quarter. Lest this wrecking, self-interested, destructive behaviour seem a quirk of history \u2013 a quaint vestige of the Abbott era curtailed by the sensible man in the Lodge \u2013 be reminded that the Liberals blasted Malcolm Turnbull out of the prime ministership only last August in part for the thought crime of trying to impose a policy mechanism that would have reduced emissions in the electricity sector. Not content with that, the Coalition, Morrison and his ministers, also claimed during the May election that an emissions reduction target broadly consistent with climate science would be a wrecking ball in the Australian economy. Not content with that, Morrison and his ministers characterised a sensible policy by Labor to try and encourage the electrification of the car fleet to reduce emissions in transport as a \u201cwar on the weekend\u201d. What Australian voters needed after the election in May was a government of whatever stripe prepared to put the country on an orderly path towards decarbonisation. But what the Coalition needed was different. It wanted to remain in power, and one of the principle means to power it deemed necessary proved to be convincing voters in the outer suburbs and regions that Bill Shorten was crazy and shifty about climate change and would confiscate your ute. To put this point very starkly, there was a climate election in May, and the climate lost. I hope it\u2019s clear by now, as a consequence of this heart-warming romp through recent political history, that the arbitrary prohibition of the week \u2013 we can\u2019t talk about climate because the country is burning \u2013 is about politics, and about self-interest, and not about anything else. And rather than applying false balance and blaming everyone and declaring the whole business of politics and democracy a debacle, let\u2019s also acknowledge that everyone has certainly stuffed up at one point or another, but one political movement more than any other bears the responsibility for Australia\u2019s failure to get on with the necessary transition to low emissions. That\u2019s the Liberal and National parties. The only way the Coalition can make this right is if Morrison uses the coming parliamentary term to execute a significant pivot on climate change.

Acts of community or resilience or kindness have spread across the country. From free food and accommodation, to support for firefighters and inspiring messages from those battling the blaze to each other. Consoling notes In Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour, as it has been all around the country, notes have been springing up. There have been messages of thanks for firefighters, support for evacuees and general shared notes that these communities will see this through. In Nambucca Heads, the volunteers from the NSW Rural Fire Service left heartwarming notes of their own. \u2018Until our stock runs out\u2019 Many businesses around the country have opened their doors to evacuees, firefighters and the general community. The Hotel Motel 5 in South Grafton, for example, has been offering free food throughout the crisis. In Old Bar, local restaurant Sai Thai Table and Tea declared on Saturday that they would \u201copen for everyone who does not have anything to eat\u201d. The Thai restaurant fed those affected by the fires \u201cuntil our stock runs out\u201d \u2013 and did the same again the next day. \u2018I\u2019m not the first pregnant firefighter\u2019 On a fireground near Taree, firefighter Kat Robinson-Williams, who is 14 weeks pregnant, paid tribute to the hard work of volunteer firefighters, especially the hundreds of women who are sometimes overlooked. Robinson-Williams\u2019 mother and grandmother were also firefighters, and her mother fought fires in 1995 while pregnant with her. \u201cI\u2019m not the first pregnant firefighter and I\u2019m not going to be the last one,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cI\u2019m still in a position where I\u2019m able to help so I will.\u201d On social media, she posted another message of solidarity. \u201cFor all the females on the ground in NSW right now. We stand together we stand proud!\u201d \u201cYes I am a Firefighter. No I\u2019m not a man. Yes I am a female. Yes I am pregnant. Yes I am going to the fires.

      "body": "<p>As catastrophic fire gripped New South Wales, claiming four lives, injuring dozens and destroying hundreds of homes, there have been claims and counterclaims about whether the state was properly prepared and what more, if anything, could have been done.</p> <p>Some of the loudest accusations of mismanagement have come from within parties in government. The deputy premier, John Barilaro, claimed the fires showed a policy of what he called \u201clocking up\u201d national parks that had not worked. He said it was the legacy of former Labor premier Bob Carr, influenced by conservationists\u2019 ideological opposition to hazard-reduction burning, but did not explain how this influence had been exerted.</p> <p>Those criticisms were echoed by another leader National party figure, the former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, who claimed the policies of the Greens \u2013 a minor party not in government \u2013 had stopped proper fire preparation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a leading union said the number of national park rangers has been cut by a third over eight years.</p> <p>A political slanging match ensued, with each side throwing up different staffing numbers. The government says the number of firefighters has increased. Labor and the union say they have been cut.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/12/is-there-really-a-green-conspiracy-to-stop-bushfire-hazard-reduction\">Factcheck: Is there really a green conspiracy to stop bushfire hazard reduction?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What is really happening here. Have the number of rangers been significantly cut?</strong></h2> <p>If we restrict the debate to rangers \u2013 a specific role usually requiring a university degree \u2013 numbers are down over the life of the government. Back in 2011, when the Coalition came to power under Barry O\u2019Farrell, there were 261. Last year there were 193.</p> <p>That number increased this year, but there are different claims about the extent of the rise. The environment minister, Matthew Kean, says there are now 220 rangers. The union says its latest advice suggests there are 201.</p> <p>Statistics are, of course, relative measures. The opposition emphasises the cut over eight years; the government says numbers have increased since a restructure in 2017.</p> <p>The picture worsens for the government if you include senior rangers.

      "bodyText": "As catastrophic fire gripped New South Wales, claiming four lives, injuring dozens and destroying hundreds of homes, there have been claims and counterclaims about whether the state was properly prepared and what more, if anything, could have been done. Some of the loudest accusations of mismanagement have come from within parties in government. The deputy premier, John Barilaro, claimed the fires showed a policy of what he called \u201clocking up\u201d national parks that had not worked. He said it was the legacy of former Labor premier Bob Carr, influenced by conservationists\u2019 ideological opposition to hazard-reduction burning, but did not explain how this influence had been exerted. Those criticisms were echoed by another leader National party figure, the former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, who claimed the policies of the Greens \u2013 a minor party not in government \u2013 had stopped proper fire preparation. Meanwhile, a leading union said the number of national park rangers has been cut by a third over eight years. A political slanging match ensued, with each side throwing up different staffing numbers. The government says the number of firefighters has increased. Labor and the union say they have been cut. What is really happening here. Have the number of rangers been significantly cut? If we restrict the debate to rangers \u2013 a specific role usually requiring a university degree \u2013 numbers are down over the life of the government. Back in 2011, when the Coalition came to power under Barry O\u2019Farrell, there were 261. Last year there were 193. That number increased this year, but there are different claims about the extent of the rise. The environment minister, Matthew Kean, says there are now 220 rangers. The union says its latest advice suggests there are 201. Statistics are, of course, relative measures. The opposition emphasises the cut over eight years; the government says numbers have increased since a restructure in 2017. The picture worsens for the government if you include senior rangers. There were 28 people in this role, which had greater strategic responsibility for hazard reduction and pest management plans. But the job was abolished in a 2017 restructure and senior rangers were effectively replaced by office-based clerks. OK, that appears pretty clear cut then: numbers are down on the government\u2019s watch. Yes \u2013 and no. If we broaden the discussion beyond trained rangers, the government says the total number of qualified firefighters working in national parks has actually risen, by 144 since 2017. They reach this number by including what are known as field officers. The government says they play a critical role in on-ground work alongside rangers. The union and opposition concede more people have been hired in this role. But they say they are comparatively low-paid, low-skill positions that, while worthwhile, cannot replicate the more sophisticated work of rangers. Kim de Govrick, a former ranger who now works as an officer with the Public Service Association, became the public face of this argument. He told the Australian that rangers were being asked to do more with fewer resources. He says he left his job after being asked to take on responsibility for two areas, rather than one. The dispute took another turn on Friday when it was revealed, in response to a question from Labor\u2019s Kate Washington, that in July this year there were 1,044 national parks and wildlife service staff qualified to fight fires. On the surface, this appeared to contradict a claim by Kean in parliament that there were 1,226 qualified firefighters (though he added a caveat: that training and other requirements meant in late October the number available was in reality 1,067). Washington said it also showed there had been a significant cut in numbers since 2013, when there were 1,349. Kean said this was not a like-for-like comparison: that the 1,349 included not just trained firefighters but also incident response teams with other skills. That seems clear as smoke. Where does it leave us? The numbers back the union and Labor\u2019s claims that the firefighting force in national parks is less highly qualified than it was a few years ago. There are fewer rangers and more field officers. That is certainly an issue worthy of discussion. But we should be slow to assume the impact of the fires this week had been greater than it would have been if the full number of rangers had been retained. The government says it met its annual prescribed burning target of 135,000 hectares last year. It had not met this goal in the previous two years, when it burned 95,589 hectares and 88,136 hectares respectively. But experts say there are bigger factors at play than ranger numbers in deciding how much hazard-reduction burning happens. As Graham Readfearn reported, scientists and former emergency chiefs, such as former NSW fire and rescue commissioner Greg Mullins, said the main issue was that hotter and drier conditions, and the rising number of days on which there were higher fire danger ratings, had reduced the time in which agencies could carry out prescribed burning. Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, of the UNSW climate change research centre, said conditions in winter or early spring, when hazard-reduction burning had usually been carried out, were becoming less favourable for safely lighting fires. The drought was also a factor. \u201cThere\u2019s been little chance to do some of these prescribed burns because it\u2019s been really dry,\u201d she said. Responding to the Nationals\u2019 claims, Mullins rejected suggestions conservationists had prevented more widespread fuel-reduction burning as an attempt by the Nationals to deflect attention from the role of the climate crisis in worsening fire risk. David Bowman, a professor of environmental change biology specialising in fire at the University of Tasmania, agreed, describing claims environmental concerns have had an impact on fuel management as \u201cdisingenuous\u201d. He said planned burning had become increasingly difficult for a range of other reasons: the challenges of administering fire management programs across different areas; legal liability considerations; and the risks to crews and communities, including from smoke inhalation. He said fire management agencies were continually improving how they dealt with hazard-reduction issues. We have heard a lot about ranger and firefighter numbers in national parks. What about other firefighters? The number of firefighters in the NSW Rural Fire Service appears roughly static. An analysis of annual reports over the past decade found the number of salaried staff was roughly the same as in 2011. It also shows the number of bush and grass fires attended each year has increased over that time, though it does not break down how it defines a fire. The Fire Brigade Employees\u2019 Union said this sort of data, along with the increase in the state\u2019s population, illustrated that just maintaining the current number of firefighters would not be enough. It feeds into a rising conversation about whether the amount spent on both equipment and personnel needs to be significantly and rapidly increased, given the bushfire season is expected to continue to extend \u2013 in time and geography \u2013 as the climate emergency worsens.",

      "bodyText": "At a Rural Fire Service base in the village of Marlee on the New South Wales mid-north coast this week, a young firefighter named Kieron Gatehouse tried to describe what it looks like when a mountain catches fire. \u201cTuesday night was the craziest shit I have ever seen,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cThere\u2019s a big mountain you can normally see over there, you can\u2019t tell because of the smoke, but on Tuesday night it had flames licking 60 metres, 70 metres off the top of it. Easy. \u201cYou can\u2019t, you can\u2019t even describe. Like a giant ball of fire. There were 50-metre gum trees with flames just licking off the top. The biggest flames I have ever seen.\u201d As he spoke, his RFS captain, Mick Munns, slumped against a tanker and nodded along as he rolled a cigarette. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve ever seen in the 20-odd years I\u2019ve been doing this,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re exhausted. It\u2019s been 15-, 16-hour days since it started, but we\u2019ve going since mid-June on and off. There\u2019s some very, very tired crews around.\u201d Across the state, four people have died and more than 250 homes have been destroyed after a week in which hundreds of bushfires burned through more than 1m hectares. It has left communities like Marlee exhausted, anxious and fearful of what is still to come. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t stopped, and we don\u2019t know when it will,\u201d teacher Barb Cameron says as she prepares lunch for the firefighters inside the Marlee community hall on Thursday. When people first started evacuating from the usually lush green hills surrounding the village on Friday last week, Cameron and her sister-in-law, Jennie Cameron, walked outside and saw people wandering the street. So they turned the hall into an unofficial evacuation centre and started feeding people. A week later they haven\u2019t stopped. They speak in rapid-fire sentences running over the top of one another, afraid to sit down in case they can\u2019t get up again. Much of this district is still without power or phone service, and the hall has turned into both a hub of information and a reprieve from the scorched earth that surrounds it. \u201cWe came in thinking we would pack up today,\u201d Jennie says. \u201cBut people kept showing up.\u201d There is a temptation, in reporting, to place events within a linear arc. The fire, the devastation and the recovery. But one of the first things you notice when talking to people who have felt the fire\u2019s full force this week is the way they speak about time. Things seem to happen in non-sequential order. Events roll into one another. This smoke that hangs around them might as well have been here forever because there is only what happened, what is happening and what they fear is going to happen next. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me what day something happened because I don\u2019t know what day it is now,\u201d Cameron says. After relatively benign weather on Thursday, by Friday the high temperatures and gusty wind had returned. More than 60 fires continued to burn, and half remained uncontained. The RFS issued an emergency warning for a fire near Lithgow in the Blue Mountains, then another for the village of Ebor near Armidale, and then two more soon after for the Richmond valley and a fire near Kempsey. In Queensland there were more than 60 blazes still burning. Hundreds have been evacuated, and the drought-stricken Darling Downs and Granite Belt region, west of Brisbane, faces severe fire danger for at least the next three days. This question of when it will end is playing havoc with people\u2019s psyche. Further south in the NSW suburb of Rainbow Flat, outside the town of Tuncurry where a number of properties were destroyed on Friday last week, Col Meredith still struggles to sleep. Meredith is one of the few who stayed behind when the fires came through and despite helping protect his and a few neighbours\u2019 homes, he feels guilty he wasn\u2019t able to stop the fire tearing through a friend\u2019s property. A few days later he was still reliving Friday night. It was scary, he says, to watch the speed at which the fire moved up the ridge near his home. \u201cIt\u2019s an adrenaline rush, you know,\u201d he says. \u201cI slept four hours last night and that\u2019s the most I\u2019ve slept in days. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m aching but I was still up at 5am.\u201d As debate raged about hazard reduction and whether or not it is OK to talk about the link between bushfires and climate change, swirling winds and high temperatures continued to plague fire crews after Tuesday\u2019s \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fire danger warning. Guardian Australia watched on Wednesday as fire crews and residents in the rural suburb of Hillview, west of Taree, battled spotfires that broke out with terrifying frequency as the wind continued to change direction. Meanwhile at the Taree showgrounds, where more than 1,000 people evacuated to on Tuesday, one woman held back tears as she talked of not being able to get the sound of cracking tree branches out of her head. Another, Jane Davis, didn\u2019t know whether her house in Hillview was still standing. The president of the Mid North Coast Canine Club, she\u2019d kept busy looking after the dozens of dogs who\u2019d been brought to the showgrounds. \u201cIt\u2019s helped me keep my mind off of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a breakdown soon. I\u2019ve already had a few mini ones.\u201d A day later, as Bill Goddard cleared through rubble on his charred Hillview property with a friend, Aaron Swan, he gave a small cheer as his cat, named Cat, appeared for the first time since Monday. \u201cThe silly bugger took off up a tree,\u201d he says as he feeds him a slice of devon. Goddard had been clearing land as the fire approached on Monday and hadn\u2019t wanted to leave even as it licked at the boundaries of his property, but Swan had driven in and forced him to leave. \u201cI pretty much had to tie him to the lounge to stop him coming back on Tuesday,\u201d Swan says. \u201cHe got a bit quiet as we drove back here this morning, but he doesn\u2019t say much about it. He\u2019s a typical Australian bloke of his generation \u2013 too bloody tough for his own good.\u201d The small shed Goddard lives in was intact, but his neighbour a bit further up the hill had not been so lucky. The question of hazard-reduction burns raised its head often. \u201cThey\u2019re saying it\u2019s the Greenies stopping us from doing these hazard-reduction burns,\u201d one firefighter says. \u201cIt\u2019s the lack of fucking resources and people to do it. \u201cNo one joins up until the shit hits the fan.\u201d Munns, too, says it had simply been \u201ctoo dry\u201d to burn off during the winter. \u201cIt was a very, very tight window,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then in the small window we had we got a tiny, tiny bit of rain, which ruined us because then it was too wet to do any burning. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing that\u2019s going to stop all of this.

A veteran judge who for decades presided over some of New Zealand\u2019s highest-profile and most gruelling trials, she says the intellectual demands of the abuse inquiry\u2019s public hearings have been similar to those of a court case \u2013 but the subject matter \u201ctougher\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is all a bit more unremitting than before and the depth of the pain is deeper,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s because we are allowing them to be deeper.\u201d</p> <p>That morning, in a nondescript conference room at a hotel in Auckland, Calman takes her seat in front of a panel of lawyers, officials, members of the public, reporters, and a camera livestreaming the hearings. She is visibly nervous.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/new-zealands-most-shameful-secret-we-have-normalised-child-poverty\">New Zealand's most shameful secret: 'We have normalised child poverty'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDo you want to tell me about your family, Anna?\u201d asks her lawyer. Calman looks away and wipes her nose with a tissue.</p> <p>In a voice choked with effort she begins: \u201cMy real name at birth was Margaret Ross.\u201d</p> <p>The story Calman tells is the worst imaginable: beaten by her father, raped at home, she ate out of rubbish bins to survive. She felt betrayed that social workers who knew of her family\u2019s situation did not take her away.</p> <p>When they did, things did not improve. She suffered abuse and rape in foster homes and was sexually assaulted by a nun. The effects on her life were catastrophic.</p> <p>\u201cMy adulthood is actually starting now. I didn\u2019t remember my age. I do now,\u201d says Calman, 62. \u201cEverything was just taken. I don\u2019t know who I really am.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard when the records show how badly she was treated. It\u2019s important that people know about those.</p> <footer> <cite>Amanda Hill, lawyer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Amanda Hill, Calman\u2019s lawyer, is a small woman with a gentle voice, and Calman answers her questions quietly, every word seemingly drawn from her at great cost. It is an atmosphere so charged that no one in the room can avoid becoming part of it \u2013 from the court security guard at the door who sang along with the M\u0101ori hymn that opened the day\u2019s proceedings to the young sound engineer at a desk in the corner.</p> <p>At times Hill sees tears on the faces of some of the other lawyers. People in the public gallery sit calmly; many are survivors and stories like Calman\u2019s are familiar. One man had earlier told the hearing he had \u201clost the ability to love\u201d during his time in state care. Some had ended up in gangs or in jail.</p> <p>\u201cA court\u2019s normally a really formal place, and I think the commission has been a really good place for people to be a bit more themselves,\u201d says Hill, whose law firm represents thousands of state abuse survivors.</p> <p>\u201cMy job was to help Anna tell her story and not to intrude on it, and it\u2019s hard when the records show how badly she was treated. It\u2019s important that people know about those.\u201d</p> <p>Calman\u2019s plight underscores the challenge the inquiry faces in making its eventual recommendations. She is among thousands of survivors who have made claims for redress to government agencies to no avail \u2013 in her case, without even a response.</p> <p>Any successes later in her life \u2013 teaching herself to read and write at 30, meeting a \u201clovely\u201d second husband, making a career in caring for the elderly, choosing the name Annasophia for herself \u2013 were all her own efforts.</p> <p>\u201cYou practically ruined me,\u201d she says later of the state. But she had agreed to give public evidence because she believed things could change.</p> <p>Then it is over, and she is eager to fly home for dinner with her husband. \u201cScrambled eggs on toast again,\u201d she says, with some relief.</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s a turning point\u2019</h2> <p>The inquiry, which is due to deliver its report to New Zealand\u2019s government in 2023, will hear from thousands of survivors in private. The public sessions were intended to set the investigation\u2019s tone and direction, with a focus on survivors who had previously gone unheard \u2013 including disabled and Maori people.</p> <p>Racism by officials and forced estrangement from family and culture were common during the period covered by the inquiry, and Maori children are still removed from their families in disproportionate numbers. They make up 60% of those in state care.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab8483879a36d4f4cef6dcc294162c1bb0d8f0a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab8483879a36d4f4cef6dcc294162c1bb0d8f0a3/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Becroft, New Zealand\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Becroft, New Zealand\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: suppled</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is particularly hard knowing that abuse in state care continues today,\u201d says Andrew Becroft, New Zealand\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner, as he takes the witness seat after Calman vacates it.</p> <p>The royal commission is investigating abuses that occurred between 1950 and 1999 but he urges those on the panel to exercise their discretion \u201cliberally\u201d, adding that the commissioners could choose to gather evidence from the past two decades even though it would increase the scope of the investigation considerably.</p> <p>\u201cThere is often asserted that there is a bright line in the past where abuse has stopped,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one can tell me when that date is.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/01/new-zealand-just-11-of-sexual-violence-reports-lead-to-conviction\">New Zealand: just 11% of sexual violence reports lead to conviction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reverence in the room for the long-serving former youth court judge is evident. Some inquiry staff refer to him privately as \u201cSir A\u201d. One survivor says he had sentenced her to jail once, but it had been a fair decision and she still liked him.</p> <p>As well as hearing from experts such as Becroft, the New Zealand commission is the first in the world to appoint a survivors\u2019 group to advise the panel. That has been controversial too. A gang member with a domestic violence conviction was originally included in the group and another member\u2019s partner, who has a child sexual abuse offence conviction, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/25/new-zealand-royal-commission-victims-in-shock-at-paedophiles-access-to-inquiry\">inadvertently allowed to attend events</a>.</p> <p>But many in the hearing\u2019s public seating say the inquiry is finally moving in the right direction. Toni Jarvis is a member of the survivors\u2019 advisory group. He has a wide, white smile and faded tattoos on his fingers.</p> <p>Jarvis was locked in a psychiatric hospital at nine and has spent decades looking for answers. The inquiry, he says, was the first time people had listened.</p> <p>\u201cTo me it\u2019s a turning point,\u201d he says. But years of disappointment are never far from his mind and his trust is not easily won.</p> <p>\u201cI will say this with a bit of hesitancy,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m looking forward with hope and faith that indeed this will pan out and be a positive thing.\u201d</p>",

The fortnight of hearings was the first time the public had been given the chance to watch its progress since it was announced by Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, in 2018. \u2018I don\u2019t know who I really am\u2019 Coral Shaw is one of the commissioners hearing evidence, and will chair the inquiry to its conclusion after its previous head announced his retirement. A veteran judge who for decades presided over some of New Zealand\u2019s highest-profile and most gruelling trials, she says the intellectual demands of the abuse inquiry\u2019s public hearings have been similar to those of a court case \u2013 but the subject matter \u201ctougher\u201d. \u201cThis is all a bit more unremitting than before and the depth of the pain is deeper,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s because we are allowing them to be deeper.\u201d That morning, in a nondescript conference room at a hotel in Auckland, Calman takes her seat in front of a panel of lawyers, officials, members of the public, reporters, and a camera livestreaming the hearings. She is visibly nervous. \u201cDo you want to tell me about your family, Anna?\u201d asks her lawyer. Calman looks away and wipes her nose with a tissue. In a voice choked with effort she begins: \u201cMy real name at birth was Margaret Ross.\u201d The story Calman tells is the worst imaginable: beaten by her father, raped at home, she ate out of rubbish bins to survive. She felt betrayed that social workers who knew of her family\u2019s situation did not take her away. When they did, things did not improve. She suffered abuse and rape in foster homes and was sexually assaulted by a nun. The effects on her life were catastrophic. \u201cMy adulthood is actually starting now. I didn\u2019t remember my age. I do now,\u201d says Calman, 62. \u201cEverything was just taken. I don\u2019t know who I really am.\u201d Amanda Hill, Calman\u2019s lawyer, is a small woman with a gentle voice, and Calman answers her questions quietly, every word seemingly drawn from her at great cost. It is an atmosphere so charged that no one in the room can avoid becoming part of it \u2013 from the court security guard at the door who sang along with the M\u0101ori hymn that opened the day\u2019s proceedings to the young sound engineer at a desk in the corner. At times Hill sees tears on the faces of some of the other lawyers. People in the public gallery sit calmly; many are survivors and stories like Calman\u2019s are familiar. One man had earlier told the hearing he had \u201clost the ability to love\u201d during his time in state care. Some had ended up in gangs or in jail. \u201cA court\u2019s normally a really formal place, and I think the commission has been a really good place for people to be a bit more themselves,\u201d says Hill, whose law firm represents thousands of state abuse survivors. \u201cMy job was to help Anna tell her story and not to intrude on it, and it\u2019s hard when the records show how badly she was treated. It\u2019s important that people know about those.\u201d Calman\u2019s plight underscores the challenge the inquiry faces in making its eventual recommendations. She is among thousands of survivors who have made claims for redress to government agencies to no avail \u2013 in her case, without even a response. Any successes later in her life \u2013 teaching herself to read and write at 30, meeting a \u201clovely\u201d second husband, making a career in caring for the elderly, choosing the name Annasophia for herself \u2013 were all her own efforts. \u201cYou practically ruined me,\u201d she says later of the state. But she had agreed to give public evidence because she believed things could change. Then it is over, and she is eager to fly home for dinner with her husband. \u201cScrambled eggs on toast again,\u201d she says, with some relief. \u2018It\u2019s a turning point\u2019 The inquiry, which is due to deliver its report to New Zealand\u2019s government in 2023, will hear from thousands of survivors in private. The public sessions were intended to set the investigation\u2019s tone and direction, with a focus on survivors who had previously gone unheard \u2013 including disabled and Maori people. Racism by officials and forced estrangement from family and culture were common during the period covered by the inquiry, and Maori children are still removed from their families in disproportionate numbers. They make up 60% of those in state care. \u201cIt is particularly hard knowing that abuse in state care continues today,\u201d says Andrew Becroft, New Zealand\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner, as he takes the witness seat after Calman vacates it. The royal commission is investigating abuses that occurred between 1950 and 1999 but he urges those on the panel to exercise their discretion \u201cliberally\u201d, adding that the commissioners could choose to gather evidence from the past two decades even though it would increase the scope of the investigation considerably. \u201cThere is often asserted that there is a bright line in the past where abuse has stopped,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one can tell me when that date is.\u201d The reverence in the room for the long-serving former youth court judge is evident. Some inquiry staff refer to him privately as \u201cSir A\u201d. One survivor says he had sentenced her to jail once, but it had been a fair decision and she still liked him. As well as hearing from experts such as Becroft, the New Zealand commission is the first in the world to appoint a survivors\u2019 group to advise the panel. That has been controversial too. A gang member with a domestic violence conviction was originally included in the group and another member\u2019s partner, who has a child sexual abuse offence conviction, was inadvertently allowed to attend events. But many in the hearing\u2019s public seating say the inquiry is finally moving in the right direction. Toni Jarvis is a member of the survivors\u2019 advisory group. He has a wide, white smile and faded tattoos on his fingers. Jarvis was locked in a psychiatric hospital at nine and has spent decades looking for answers. The inquiry, he says, was the first time people had listened. \u201cTo me it\u2019s a turning point,\u201d he says. But years of disappointment are never far from his mind and his trust is not easily won. \u201cI will say this with a bit of hesitancy,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m looking forward with hope and faith that indeed this will pan out and be a positive thing.\u201d",

The million-dollar housing question Australians keep asking</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What has caused the turnaround?</h2> <p>The simple answer is credit. Just as the downturn was caused by Apra\u2019s 2017 decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/31/housing-pressure-prompts-regulator-to-tighten-rules-for-interest-only-mortgages\">to restrict credit amid alarm about poor lending standards</a>, the upturn has coincided with a loosening of credit restrictions. Scott Morrison\u2019s surprise election victory on 18 May seemed to change the regulatory landscape and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/21/house-prices-banks-eye-game-changing-move-that-would-let-buyers-borrow-more\">Apra abruptly signalled to banks they could relax lending standards again</a>. This combined with two successive interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank has transformed the housing market and buyers once again could leverage themselves to the hilt. The founder of SQM, Louis Christopher, says Apra\u2019s post-election U-turn was crucial. \u201cWith Apra, what they really did was, someone knocked on their door and said, \u2018Look, you\u2019ve gone too far, we\u2019ve got a downturn in the economy, you\u2019ve got to loosen the lending restrictions.\u2019 And they did.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Is credit the only factor?</strong></h2> <p>Christopher says another key factor, especially in Melbourne, is population growth. The Victorian capital has expanded from 4 million people in 2011 to 5 million in 2019. The availability since May of the cheapest mortgages in Australian history helped release the pressure built up during two years of tighter lending. \u201cThe city has expanded by one million, which creates a large underlying accommodation requirement for that many people,\u201d Christopher says. This is backed up by figures from CoreLogic this week showing strongest demand from owner-occupiers \u2013 up 17.3% from May to September \u2013 rather than investors, up just 8.4%.</p> <p>The chief economist at IFM Investors, Alex Joiner, also suggests there was a certain inevitability about the market reaction given Australia\u2019s love affair with home ownership. \u201cYou take the Australian psyche around the housing market and mortgage rates that are below 3%, and prices in Melbourne and Sydney are destined to rise,\u201d he says. Another factor was suggested in a report from Credit Suisse this week which said that the unrest in Hong Kong could be pushing wealthy people there to get their money out and into Australian property.</p> <h2>Does this mean we\u2019re in another housing boom?</h2> <p>UBS called the surge a \u201cmini boom\u201d but, like many commentators, the bank\u2019s economists were quick to caution that this was highly unlikely to be a repeat of the boom years between 2013 and 2017. \u201cCompared to prior cycles, we expect a much more muted multiplier effect for the \u2018real economy\u2019,\u201d UBS said this week, noting that Australia had the highest household debt in the world, the lowest savings rate for a decade and housebuilding and other construction work was heading off the cliff.</p> <h2>So it might not last?</h2> <p>Joiner says the rise in prices in recent months would encourage more sellers to put their properties up for sale, solving one problem in the market: lack of supply. \u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t be good for the economy,\u201d he says. \u201cHousehold debt will weigh on the economy and we\u2019re seeing that in retail sales. People are worried about job security, confidence in the future and wages growth.\u201d Despite his report\u2019s bullish-sounding forecasts, Christopher warns that prices are rising from an already overvalued position, so there is a \u201cserious question about the sustainability of the new upturn\u201d, with the market very susceptible to another change of heart by Apra, an economic downturn or any rate rises. \u201cThe loosening of credit was always likely to stimulate the market when you add that to population growth. But there will be a price to be paid.\u201d</p>",

They met when they were young \u2013 Reid was 20, Clare 18 \u2013 but they connected almost instantly. After a brief meeting at the church they both attended, they were reintroduced by a mutual friend \u2013 and three weeks later they were engaged. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we decided we had to get married,\u201d says Clare with a laugh, \u201cbut we just got on so well. We talked our heads off.\u201d They came from very different backgrounds: Clare\u2019s family were \u201cso English and so proper\u201d and she went to a private girls\u2019 school, while Reid was a surfer from Manly who\u2019d led \u201cquite a colourful teenage life\u201d. Despite this, they connected on many levels. They both had a strong Christian faith, they wanted to travel and \u201chave adventures\u201d and then do something substantial with their lives. \u201cWe thought we should do it together; we\u2019d be good together,\u201d Reid says. \u201cMost of my friends thought I was crazy getting married.\u201d Both sets of parents were supportive but many of their friends\u2019 parents tried to dissuade them. \u201cThey were like, \u2018You\u2019re too young. You should live together first. You should try it out first,\u2019\u201d Clare remembers. \u201c[We] were like, no, no. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d During their 14-month engagement, they discussed their commitment to each other. They weren\u2019t naive about the challenges ahead but they had the same pragmatic approach. Reid believes that life is fundamentally \u201cpretty tough\u201d. \u201cBut there\u2019s moments of joy sprinkled in there, you get some happiness every so often,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think we went in with rose-coloured glasses.

George and colleagues say that study was very small and flawed \u2013 not least because it looked only at the impact of a single vaping session.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.onlinejacc.org/lookup/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2019.09.067\">Writing in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology</a>, George and colleagues report that they looked at data from 114 adults, split into three groups, all of whom smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day for at least two years but had no signs of cardiovascular disease.</p> \n<p>One group contained 40 people who did not wish to quit traditional smoking, while the other two groups each contained 37 similar people who did, with one group given devices containing nicotine and the other given e-cigarettes without nicotine.</p> \n<p>The team measured blood vessel function at the outset of the study, and after one month, by comparing artery diameter before a tight cuff was applied to an arm with artery diameter just after the cuff was released. This percentage change is larger in healthier vessels. </p> \n<p>They found those who continued to smoke tobacco cigarettes showed little difference in their blood vessel function over the month.. However, those in the vaping groups had more than a 20% relative improvement in the measure and were halfway back to having blood vessel function on a par with non-smokers. Similar results were found for those switching to e-cigarettes with and without nicotine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"304befac-5766-49be-a73d-dd2f3bb060bf\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Is it true that e-cigarettes have caused deaths in the United States?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There have been six confirmed deaths connected to vaping across the US \u2013 in California, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota and Oregon \u2013 as well as more than 450 cases of reported lung problems.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What have the authorities found out so far?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The federal government\u2019s CDC (Centers for Disease Control) says no specific substance or single type of device has been linked to all cases. But in most cases \u2013 about 80% \u2013 people have said they were using liquids that contained cannabinoid products, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Most of those are said by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is investigating with the CDC, to also contain a substance called vitamin E acetate. It appears some people may have bought their e-cigarettes or other devices off the street.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the advice in the US?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The CDC&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/06/vaping-illness-breathing-us-health-officials\">is suggesting anyone who vapes should consider stopping</a>&nbsp;during its investigation. Young people and pregnant women should not use e-cigarettes at all, it says. It advises people who are using e-cigarettes to try to stop smoking to consider other methods, such as counselling or medication.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is vaping dangerous?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It depends who you talk to. Public Health England and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/07/health-experts-reassure-vapers-products-in--uk-are-safe\">most, but not all, of the public health community in the UK say it is not dangerous</a>. PHE is on record as saying it is 95% safer than smoking \u2013 which kills half of all of those who take up the habit.

      "bodyText": "Switching from tobacco cigarettes to vaping improves blood vessel function within one month, researchers have found, in a study they say supports the use of electronic cigarettes as a tool to quit smoking. E-cigarettes have becoming a booming business, with the number of people who vape growing rapidly. According to a 2017 report by Ernst and Young, 2.2 million Britons use e-cigarettes, an increase of 55% over three years. However, there has been much debate over the potential benefits or harm caused by the devices. The new study suggests switching from tobacco cigarettes to vaping could be a positive move for blood vessels, potentially reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. \u201cSwitching from tobacco cigarettes to electronic cigarettes improves your vascular function within the period of a month, significantly,\u201d said Prof Jacob George of the University of Dundee, first author of the study. The study pushes back against research published earlier this week that suggested e-cigarette use might impair blood vessel function. George and colleagues say that study was very small and flawed \u2013 not least because it looked only at the impact of a single vaping session. Writing in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, George and colleagues report that they looked at data from 114 adults, split into three groups, all of whom smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day for at least two years but had no signs of cardiovascular disease. One group contained 40 people who did not wish to quit traditional smoking, while the other two groups each contained 37 similar people who did, with one group given devices containing nicotine and the other given e-cigarettes without nicotine. The team measured blood vessel function at the outset of the study, and after one month, by comparing artery diameter before a tight cuff was applied to an arm with artery diameter just after the cuff was released. This percentage change is larger in healthier vessels. They found those who continued to smoke tobacco cigarettes showed little difference in their blood vessel function over the month.. However, those in the vaping groups had more than a 20% relative improvement in the measure and were halfway back to having blood vessel function on a par with non-smokers. Similar results were found for those switching to e-cigarettes with and without nicotine. Further analysis, taking into account factors such as sex, age and how heavily participants had previously smoked, showed that on average, participants who switched to vaping had a 1.5 percentage point improvement in their change in artery diameter, compared with the group that kept smoking. The team say if such an improvement was sustained over the long term, it could bring important health benefits: previous research has suggested a one percentage point improvement in blood vessel function is linked to a 13% lower risk of cardiovascular events. George noted that women seemed to improve more when switching to vaping than men, although it is not clear why. The benefits were greater the better participants stuck to the switch. However, the team stress that while the study suggests vaping might be less harmful than tobacco cigarettes, it does not prove the devices are safe. \u201cThis study doesn\u2019t show that vaping is safe; it shows that there are effects on the vascular system within a month, which mean that your vascular health improves if you are a smoker and switch to vaping\u201d said Prof Jeremy Pearson from the British Heart Foundation, which funded the study. \u201cWe would not advocate anybody taking up vaping if they don\u2019t smoke,\u201d he said, noting that the claim from Public Health England that vaping is 95% less harmful than smoking was based on a \u201csimplistic\u201d calculation. Tim Chico, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Sheffield, who was not involved in the study, said the research suggested vaping was less damaging than smoking when it came to blood vessels. But, he added, the results are preliminary and long-term studies were needed to investigate the impact of vaping on heart attack, stroke or cancer risk. \u201cIn addition, this study did not measure other possible ways that cigarettes and e-cigarettes can increase risk of heart disease, such as the tendency to form blood clots, which is an important part of why tobacco smokers are more likely to suffer heart attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile vaping isn\u2019t risk-free, it\u2019s much less risky than smoking, which kills over 250 people a day in the UK,\u201d said Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of the charity Action on Smoking and Health. \u201cVapers shouldn\u2019t be scared back to smoking \u2013 that really would cost lives.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Bolivia was plunged into a deepening political crisis this week after Evo Morales \u2013 the country\u2019s first indigenous president and its longest-serving leader \u2013 was forced to step down following pressure from the military, police and public protests over allegations that he stole an election on 20 October, which would have seen him remain in power until 2025. An interim administration led by Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez has assumed power with a mandate to call fresh elections but violent protests have claimed 10 lives and the South American country of 11 million people faces its most uncertain moment in several decades. How fair were the elections? Morales has long been accused of using the levers of state to boost his popular support through free advertising and handouts to voters. Bolivia\u2019s constitutional court \u2013 which is elected from candidates nominated by the government-controlled assembly \u2013 allowed Evo Morales to run for a fourth consecutive term, despite narrowly losing a referendum on the issue in 2016. Various parties and candidates competed in the elections on 20 October. After a preliminary vote count was interrupted \u2013 it resumed 24 hours later, indicating that Morales had narrowly surpassed a 10 percentage-point lead over his nearest rival needed to win outright \u2013 observers from the Organization of American States (OAS) sounded the alarm. Their subsequent audit found evidence of \u201cclear manipulation\u201d, including stuffed ballots, forged signatures and compromised servers. However, critics have questioned the impartiality of the OAS, noted that Morales\u2019s apparent victory was in line with previous polling and argued that his late-stage surge in votes reflected late-reporting rural areas. Was there a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat? Bolivians and international observers are divided. That Morales resigned amid a widespread police mutiny and shortly after Bolivia\u2019s armed forces suggested he do so suggests a classic coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. The haste with which the interim administration of Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez assumed power \u2013 lacking a quorum and failing to first formally accept Morales\u2019s resignation \u2013 along with subsequent military and police deployments confirms this impression. However, critics on the left and right argue that the terminology of a coup should not distract from Morales\u2019s own democratic failings, including his alleged electoral fraud, and that public pressure from the military only came after Morales had lost the support of his party, trade unionists and some indigenous groups, and faced spiralling protests. In practice, whether or not his departure is judged as an unconstitutional coup or not will depend on the avoidance of further repression and swift move to hold free and fair elections. What role have other countries played? Leftwing political leaders in Argentina, Cuba, Mexico, Uruguay and Venezuela have condemned Morales\u2019s removal as a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Conversely, Brazil\u2019s rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, refused to recognise Morales\u2019s apparent electoral victory and celebrated his removal \u2013 as has Donald Trump\u2019s White House, which praised the Bolivian military for \u201cabiding by its oath to protect not just a single person, but Bolivia\u2019s constitution\u201d. Russia \u2013 a key Morales ally \u2013 the UK and Germany are among those countries that have recognised \u00c1\u00f1ez as interim president and supported calls for another vote. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has dispatched a special envoy to Bolivia to work with the European Union and OAS to help resolve the crisis and guarantee transparent elections. What happens next? According to the constitution, the interim government of \u00c1\u00f1ez is required to hold fresh elections within 90 days. Negotiations with figures from Morales\u2019s Mas party are ongoing. The ousted president has indicated that he could return if asked to help pacify protests, but \u00c1\u00f1ez has insisted that Morales cannot be a candidate and will face investigation for alleged electoral fraud and corruption if he sets foot in Bolivia again.

McCluskey\u2019s chief of staff, Andrew Murray, who advises Corbyn, told the Guardian last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/30/labour-should-stay-neutral-in-brexit-culture-war-warns-corbyn-ally-andrew-murray\">he thought the party should not \u201crush ahead\u201d</a> of its 2017 manifesto.</p>",

It will reiterate a radical but little-discussed commitment made in 2017, to introduce \u201csector-wide collective bargaining\u201d across the economy. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said the change would represent \u201ca seismic shift in the world of work\u201d. \u201cFully rolling out collective bargaining coverage would mean that in the region of 20 million more employees would have their pay set by negotiations between bosses and unions,\u201d he said. Laura Pidcock, the shadow employment rights minister, told the TUC congress in September that \u201csector-wide collective bargaining will set minimum and legally binding pay, terms and conditions for every employer and every worker in the sector\u201d. She added: \u201cIn practice, it means that rather than the employer having all the power to determine what your conditions and pay are at work, they will be legally obliged to enter into negotiation with your trade union \u2013 a giant step forward in rebalancing the unequal power relations that exist between worker and employer.\u201d It is unclear whether the policy would be introduced gradually, as in New Zealand \u2013 where the government is trying to build a consensus for an increased role for trades unions \u2013 or more abruptly. Other labour market reforms will include John McDonnell\u2019s aspiration of reducing average working hours to 32 hours a week within a decade \u2013 announced at this year\u2019s Labour conference in Brighton. Labour would also ban zero-hours contracts, which affect 900,000 people, and give employees in companies with 250 or more staff the right to own shares under an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d \u2013 benefiting 10 million people. Union leaders regard this significant strengthening of workers\u2019 bargaining power as an essential prerequisite for any loosening of immigration controls. Unite\u2019s general secretary, Len McCluskey, told the Guardian earlier this week: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong in my view to have any greater free movement of labour unless you get stricter labour market regulation.\u201d Backers of a pro-migration motion passed at Labour\u2019s conference had hoped to see free movement rights extended to other groups aside from EU citizens, and were infuriated by McCluskey\u2019s intervention. But Labour strategists are concerned about the perceptions of working-class voters, in particular in Brexit-voting seats, with the Conservatives keen to weaponise the claim that Corbyn backs unlimited migration. The Guardian understands a compromise has been reached that will fall well short of the significant expansion in freedom of movement the grassroots campaigners had hoped for. One insider said there were a few \u201cglitches to be resolved\u201d but a position had essentially been agreed. Other radical policies passed at Labour conference, including achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2030, and incorporating private schools into the state system (#AbolishEton, as supporters put it), are expected to be watered down before they reach the pages of the manifesto. However, Labour\u2019s carefully-crafted Brexit policy, which committed a Corbyn government to negotiating a new deal with the EU and submitting it to a referendum within six months, is unlikely to change. Corbyn will chair the clause V meeting, which will be attended by members of the party\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC), as well as the shadow cabinet and representatives of the unions. The dramatic expansion in the role of trades unions in the economy is central to Corbyn\u2019s plans for transforming Britain \u2013 and his leadership has been underpinned by the backing of McCluskey\u2019s Unite in particular. McDonnell\u2019s headline-grabbing 32-hour week is intended to be negotiated by trades unions, as employers reap the benefits of automation and other productivity improvements. Labour advisers are conscious of the need to balance radicalism with the risk of alarming wary voters. McCluskey\u2019s chief of staff, Andrew Murray, who advises Corbyn, told the Guardian last month he thought the party should not \u201crush ahead\u201d of its 2017 manifesto.",

He said this showed how Labour would be using the power of the state to deliver an essential public service. He said: Labour believes that the British people deserve the very best. As a country we should be proud of our history of building treasured public institutions and services. In the 19th century it was the public waterworks. In the 20th century it was our fantastic National Health Service, freeing people from the fear of illness. British Broadband will be our treasured public institution for the 21st century, delivering fast and free broadband to every home. Only the government has the planning ability, economies of scale and ambition to take this on. This is a mission for everyone to get behind. My colleagues Mark Sweney and Patrick Collinson have a good analysis here of how feasible the plan is. Labour\u2019s plans has caused alarm in the City, where it was claimed that the party has massively underestimated the cost of its free full-fibre broadband offer and that the prospect of further nationalisation could halt further investment in the sector. The plan to nationalise Openreach, the broadband division of BT, caused particular shock because until last night Labour had claimed that it had no nationalisation plans beyond its existing commitments to bring rail, energy, water and the Royal Mail back in to public ownership.

But the Tories were also keen to stress their own plans to roll out improved broadband services, and there is likely to be some nervousness in CCHQ about how voters will react to the Labour giveaway.

The Tories claim a similar project in Australia has been a disaster. At this stage it is just too early to know how the electoral politics of this announcement will unfold. Meanwhile Johnson has faced questions about how \u201crelatable\u201d he is during a BBC Breakfast interview. In his encounter with the BBC\u2019s Naga Munchetty, and a subsequent hour-long phone-in on Radio 5 Live, there were also references to the fact that no one even knows for sure how many children he has. Johnson did not seem to enjoy the references to his private life, but he insisted \u2013 as he always \u2013 that he would not talk about his family, and got through both programmes without significant embarrassment. Johnson has escalated his attacks on Corbyn and Labour, claiming that that Corbyn\u2019s plans are \u201cabsolutely terrifying\u201d. In a short speech unveiling his battlebus, he sought to justify this charge with a serious of allegations about the opposition \u2013 many of which were partially or wholly untrue. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, has said his party would use regulation to make Britain \u201cthe gold standard of climate capitalism for the world\u201d. He also said that the Lib Dems were committed to a \u00a3100bn programme over five years to tackle climate change. Police are launching their biggest ever operation to keep election candidates safe from attacks and abuse amid rising concern from politicians about the dangers they face.

It was not the first time Donald Trump had tried to demean and disparage a woman and prompted Democrats to warn against \u201cwitness intimidation\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was the second public hearing of the impeachment inquiry into whether Trump sought to bribe Ukraine to boost his chance of re-election by investigating a political rival, former vice-president Joe Biden. Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled in May after coming under attack from Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, at a time when he was trying to persuade Ukraine to carry out the investigation.</p> \n<p>In a committee room as chilly as a winter\u2019s day in Kyiv, the bespectacled Yovanovitch, wearing black jacket and black trousers, sat at a long, curving desk with cans of Coca-Cola and ginger ale, bottles of water and disposable coffee cups. </p> \n<p>From her seat, she could see Democrats and Republicans at ornately carved oak desks against a backdrop of blue velvet curtains with gold trim, framed by classical columns, decorative alcoves, clocks with roman numerals and sculpted eagles.

She championed efforts against corruption in Ukraine \u2013 making her a target for some there who, astonishingly, found American accomplices.</p> \n<p>In a cool, clear tone that was a useful antidote to the rage and hysteria of the social media age, Yovanovitch described a \u201csmear campaign\u201d involving Giuliani, reinforced by cable news hosts and the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Eventually, she recalled, she was told in April 2019 to come back to Washington on the next plane because she no longer had the confidence of the president.</p> \n<p>Yovanovitch described how professional public servants serve US interests regardless of who occupies the White House. She cited the diplomats killed in the 2012 Benghazi attacks in Libya, tortured in captivity in Iran and injured in mysterious attacks in Cuba.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe honor these individuals,\u201d she told the hearing. \u201cThey represent each one of you here and every American.

A person who saw me reading the transcript said the color drained from my face.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added in a low voice: \u201cEven now words fail me.\u201d</p> \n<p>In that now infamous phone call, Trump had ominously said of Yovanovitch that \u201cshe was going to go through some things\u201d.</p> \n<p>Yovanovitch said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound good. It sounded like a threat.\u201d</p> \n<p>The effect of Trump\u2019s comments, she said, \u201cis very intimidating\u201d and both for her and others who might be inclined to publicly attack corruption.</p> \n<p>There was a surprise to come on a similar theme. As Yovanovitch was still testifying, Trump reached for his retaliatory weapon of choice, Twitter.</p> \n<p>\u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\u201d he tweeted, pointing to the time she spent in Somalia and in Ukraine, where Trump said \u201cthe new Ukrainian President spoke unfavourably about her\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7fd2ceb6080f8e6eb35c4bab8bde4b4a3be3c52\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7fd2ceb6080f8e6eb35c4bab8bde4b4a3be3c52/0_99_4480_2689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Schiff on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, on 15 November.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Schiff on Capitol Hill in Washington DC on Friday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Adam Schiff, the committee chairman, seized his moment. He told the former ambassador: \u201cThe president is attacking you in real time.\u201d He read the tweet aloud and asked Yovanovitch for her reaction. Maintaining her dignity throughout, she paused and said: \u201cI can\u2019t speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating.\u201d</p> \n<p>Schiff replied: \u201cWell, I want to let you know, ambassador, that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.\u201d</p> \n<p>And everyone in the room knew that, not only had Trump once again dug a hole for Republicans, but quite possibly just written a new article of impeachment against himself. It was also a sign of the times.</p> \n<p>Susan Glasser, a writer at the New Yorker, tweeted: \u201cFor those who wondered what an impeachment in the Twitter era will look like, the answer is here: the President attacking a witness and impugning her in real time, as she is testifying.

      "bodyText": "She sat ramrod straight with hands folded, soft-voiced yet resolute, vulnerable yet steely. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, he was irate, impulsive and menacing as always. Only one of them was unimpeachable. Marie Yovanovitch, an immigrant and a career diplomat, delivered on Friday the profound riposte to Donald Trump that many in America had been hoping for from an impeachment inquiry that could lead to his removal from office. The former US ambassador to Ukraine captured in one morning much of the gnawing anxiety of foreign service professionals about the ways in which the president is undermining trust in America and fracturing the world. But even as Yovanovitch testified about being smeared and ousted, the president went and smeared her again, live, via Twitter. It was not the first time Donald Trump had tried to demean and disparage a woman and prompted Democrats to warn against \u201cwitness intimidation\u201d. It was the second public hearing of the impeachment inquiry into whether Trump sought to bribe Ukraine to boost his chance of re-election by investigating a political rival, former vice-president Joe Biden. Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled in May after coming under attack from Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, at a time when he was trying to persuade Ukraine to carry out the investigation. In a committee room as chilly as a winter\u2019s day in Kyiv, the bespectacled Yovanovitch, wearing black jacket and black trousers, sat at a long, curving desk with cans of Coca-Cola and ginger ale, bottles of water and disposable coffee cups. From her seat, she could see Democrats and Republicans at ornately carved oak desks against a backdrop of blue velvet curtains with gold trim, framed by classical columns, decorative alcoves, clocks with roman numerals and sculpted eagles. Above her was a huge chandelier with two dozen lights. Behind her sat journalists at laptops and members of the public. The power of televised impeachment hearings \u2013 so evident during Watergate in the 1970s \u2013 was realized again as Yovanovitch, far from speaking like a dry bureaucrat like previous witnesses, told a deeply personal story about the country she loves. She delivered a 13-page opening statement, laying out her 33 years of government service under Democratic and Republican presidents, including 13 moves and spells in seven countries, five of them hardship posts, starting with Mogadishu in Somalia. She championed efforts against corruption in Ukraine \u2013 making her a target for some there who, astonishingly, found American accomplices. In a cool, clear tone that was a useful antidote to the rage and hysteria of the social media age, Yovanovitch described a \u201csmear campaign\u201d involving Giuliani, reinforced by cable news hosts and the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Eventually, she recalled, she was told in April 2019 to come back to Washington on the next plane because she no longer had the confidence of the president. Yovanovitch described how professional public servants serve US interests regardless of who occupies the White House. She cited the diplomats killed in the 2012 Benghazi attacks in Libya, tortured in captivity in Iran and injured in mysterious attacks in Cuba. \u201cWe honor these individuals,\u201d she told the hearing. \u201cThey represent each one of you here and every American. These courageous individuals were attacked because they symbolized America.\u201d Under questioning from Democrats, Yovanovitch said she was \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d when a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, revealed the American president was bad-mouthing her to a foreign leader behind her back. \u201cIt was a terrible moment. A person who saw me reading the transcript said the color drained from my face.\u201d She added in a low voice: \u201cEven now words fail me.\u201d In that now infamous phone call, Trump had ominously said of Yovanovitch that \u201cshe was going to go through some things\u201d. Yovanovitch said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound good. It sounded like a threat.\u201d The effect of Trump\u2019s comments, she said, \u201cis very intimidating\u201d and both for her and others who might be inclined to publicly attack corruption. There was a surprise to come on a similar theme. As Yovanovitch was still testifying, Trump reached for his retaliatory weapon of choice, Twitter. \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\u201d he tweeted, pointing to the time she spent in Somalia and in Ukraine, where Trump said \u201cthe new Ukrainian President spoke unfavourably about her\u201d. Adam Schiff, the committee chairman, seized his moment. He told the former ambassador: \u201cThe president is attacking you in real time.\u201d He read the tweet aloud and asked Yovanovitch for her reaction. Maintaining her dignity throughout, she paused and said: \u201cI can\u2019t speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating.\u201d Schiff replied: \u201cWell, I want to let you know, ambassador, that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.\u201d And everyone in the room knew that, not only had Trump once again dug a hole for Republicans, but quite possibly just written a new article of impeachment against himself. It was also a sign of the times. Susan Glasser, a writer at the New Yorker, tweeted: \u201cFor those who wondered what an impeachment in the Twitter era will look like, the answer is here: the President attacking a witness and impugning her in real time, as she is testifying. Imagine Nixon hate-tweeting John Dean live.\u201d",

Britain\u2019s departure from the EU would take with it a portion of the \u201ctariff rate quotas\u201d available to Australian companies, but the two sides cannot agree on how meat should be carved. Australia said that it could suffer a reduction in its $366m (\u00a3284m) of annual meat exports to the UK and EU as a result and claimed its industry had suffered disruption due to Britain\u2019s exit from the EU being delayed three times. \u201cCompensatory concessions should be provided to affected WTO members for loss of market access,\u201d an Australian official told a meeting of the WTO Council, according to the Australian Financial Review. \u201cAustralia cannot accept the assertion by both the EU and the UK that no compensation is required.\u201d \u201cIt is clear the proposed modification to TRQs will lead to significant economic loss, by not only removing flexibility in where product is sent year to year, but also by rendering some TRQ allocations too small to be commercially viable,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe onus is now on both members [the UK and EU] to move beyond their position of \u2018no compensation\u2019.\u201d The US called the EU and British proposals \u201cunjustifiable\u201d and New Zealand said it undermined the general principle that no change to existing WTO arrangements should leave WTO members worse off. Brazil also commented, saying that trade arrangements proposed for Northern Ireland could breach WTO rules. A spokesman for the UK\u2019s Department for International Trade said: \u201cWe have set out our goods schedule at the WTO to maintain the existing balance of rights and obligations between the UK and our trading partners. \u201cThe UK has entered into negotiations with affected countries under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Article XXVIII process to maintain the current balance of rights and obligations.\u201d Australia is in the midst of negotiating a free-trade agreement with the EU and has signed a \u201cmutual recognition agreement\u201d with the UK after a globe-hopping trade mission by Liam Fox, the former trade secretary.",

      "bodyText": "Disturbing video footage of a 15-year-old quadruple amputee being tackled, pinned to the ground and verbally abused by a sheriff\u2019s deputy is now the focus of an internal investigation by Arizona\u2019s Pima county sheriff\u2019s department. The footage shows the shirtless boy, who cannot move, screaming as a sheriff\u2019s deputy pins him to the ground while yelling at the teen to stop resisting. The boy is a ward of the state and resides in a group home in Tucson because he was abandoned by his parents, according to local media. The eight-minute cellphone video, first published by KOLD in Tucson, was filmed in September by another teenager in the Tucson home, who was also allegedly assaulted by deputies. On the morning of 26 September, an adult who works at the group home reportedly called police to report that the teen had knocked over a trash can and was yelling and screaming. A deputy from the Pima county sheriff\u2019s department who responded to the call reportedly determined that the teen was disturbing the peace, and decided to arrest him. In the footage, the deputy can be seen kneeling on the ground and holding the teenager in a headlock. When the teen tries to break free, the officer tackles him, wrestling him to the floor. \u201cI will raise my voice to you whenever the [expletive] I want, you understand?\u201d the officer shouts. After a third teen begins filming, the second teen is placed in handcuffs and the deputy smashes his head into the wall. Joel Feinman, a Pima county public defender, said the deputy\u2019s compassion-less, aggressive behavior speaks to larger failures in the US justice system. \u201cI\u2019d like to see this country treat 15-year-old boys with no limbs living in group homes like human beings, and I\u2019d like to see this country have compassion for the most vulnerable among us, and I\u2019d like to see this country and its legal system recognise that troubled children are not criminals,\u201d Feinman told the Guardian. Feinman, whose office is representing both boys, notes that a parent acting in the same way could be charged with child abuse. The criminal charges against the first teen have now been dropped, but it is up to civil lawyers to talk to the boys to see if they want to bring a lawsuit against the officer and the sheriff\u2019s department. \u201cThe boy needed to be treated with love and compassion, and not assault and arrest,\u201d Feinman said. \ufeffArizona prosecutors dropped disorderly conduct charges against the teenage boy being restrained on the floor in the video, the teen\u2019s attorney said on Friday. Samuel Jurgena, a Pima county public defender, said his client went public with the cellphone video in order to prompt changes in police treatment of youths in group homes. \u201cI think everyone feels in my office this cop should not be out here with a badge and a gun if this is how he\u2019s treating kids in group homes,\u201d Jurgena said.

He confirmed Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Sir Mo Farah and Laura Muir were among those who had signed a petition supporting the legal action.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation as it stands is completely unfair,\u201d Gemili said. \u201cFor most athletes the Olympics is that one chance every four years to be in the limelight \u2013 and we want to be able to recognise those sponsors that have helped us make it to the Games.</p> <p>\u201cThe legal advice we have got is that we have a very strong case. Despite attempts to engage the BOA, we\u2019ve had no indication from them that things will get better. We continue to get brushed aside.\u201d</p> <p>Under the International Olympic Committee\u2019s infamous rule 40, athletes have historically not been allowed to use their image, name or performance for any advert in or around an Olympics. Yet this year the IOC accepted that countries could decide to be more flexible after rule 40 was successfully challenged in German courts.</p> <p>However, British athletes have been left frustrated after the BOA only slightly softened its stance to allow them to issue a generic thank you message during the Games period \u201cprovided it doesn\u2019t contain any Olympic branding, such as a medal or Team GB kit or references\u201d.</p> <p>That, say the British athletes, adds zero value to potential sponsors. In a letter delivered to the BOA on Friday they asked for eight changes to the current rules, including permitting athletes to use terms like \u201cmedal, gold, silver, bronze, winter or summer games\u201d in advertising during Tokyo 2020, along with being able to thank more widely non-Olympic brands who support them.</p> <p>Another bone of contention among the athletes is that, while the BOA generates tens of millions of pounds from sponsors, many athletes hoping to represent Team GB have to take out jobs. In response the BOA pointed out that it was an entirely independently funded organisation whose main purpose was to take athletes to the Olympic Games and Youth Olympic events.</p> <p>\u201cRule 40 is an IOC rule which we apply in our territory and is the protection that allows us to fund such activities for all athletes, regardless of their sport, status or personal sponsors,\u201d a spokesperson said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Twenty high-profile British athletes led by the sprinter Adam Gemili have taken the extraordinary step of launching legal action against the British Olympic Association to force it to relax its \u201cunjust and unlawful\u201d sponsorship rules for Team GB stars. The landmark challenge comes after the BOA refused to follow the lead of the German and US Olympic federations, who have allowed athletes more freedom to market themselves during the Tokyo 2020 Games. Gemili, who is a BOA athlete representative, said the unprecedented action had come after the athletes were brushed aside by the BOA. He confirmed Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Sir Mo Farah and Laura Muir were among those who had signed a petition supporting the legal action. \u201cThe situation as it stands is completely unfair,\u201d Gemili said. \u201cFor most athletes the Olympics is that one chance every four years to be in the limelight \u2013 and we want to be able to recognise those sponsors that have helped us make it to the Games. \u201cThe legal advice we have got is that we have a very strong case. Despite attempts to engage the BOA, we\u2019ve had no indication from them that things will get better. We continue to get brushed aside.\u201d Under the International Olympic Committee\u2019s infamous rule 40, athletes have historically not been allowed to use their image, name or performance for any advert in or around an Olympics. Yet this year the IOC accepted that countries could decide to be more flexible after rule 40 was successfully challenged in German courts. However, British athletes have been left frustrated after the BOA only slightly softened its stance to allow them to issue a generic thank you message during the Games period \u201cprovided it doesn\u2019t contain any Olympic branding, such as a medal or Team GB kit or references\u201d. That, say the British athletes, adds zero value to potential sponsors. In a letter delivered to the BOA on Friday they asked for eight changes to the current rules, including permitting athletes to use terms like \u201cmedal, gold, silver, bronze, winter or summer games\u201d in advertising during Tokyo 2020, along with being able to thank more widely non-Olympic brands who support them. Another bone of contention among the athletes is that, while the BOA generates tens of millions of pounds from sponsors, many athletes hoping to represent Team GB have to take out jobs. In response the BOA pointed out that it was an entirely independently funded organisation whose main purpose was to take athletes to the Olympic Games and Youth Olympic events. \u201cRule 40 is an IOC rule which we apply in our territory and is the protection that allows us to fund such activities for all athletes, regardless of their sport, status or personal sponsors,\u201d a spokesperson said.",

The first challenge, as with all proposed nationalisations, is establishing the price to be paid for the assets. It will be done \u201cin the usual way, with parliament setting the price\u201d, said the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, as if the definition of fair compensation is obvious. It\u2019s not.</p> <p>Openreach has a regulated asset base \u2013 one form of official valuation \u2013 of \u00a313.5bn but its market value might be closer to \u00a320bn, reckons the City. Pension funds are almost honour-bound to fight to protect savers\u2019 interests. BT\u2019s biggest shareholder, Deutsche Telekom, which owns 12%, also won\u2019t want a few billion pounds of assumed value to slip between the nationalisation cracks.</p> <p>The City thinks shareholders\u2019 rights are strong. \u201cThe UK has bilateral investment treaties with countries in which overseas BT shareholders are located, and these are intended to protect against asset expropriation,\u201d said the investment bank Jefferies. \u201cUK-based shareholders might expect to receive equal treatment.\u201d</p> <p>That legal scrap would be resolved eventually, but the next problem would be how to compensate Virgin Media, the broadband parts of Sky and TalkTalk, and broadband-only specialists such as CityFibre. Those companies have been incentivised by Ofcom for years to lay their own fibre cables to compete with BT, but their businesses would implode if a new state-owned British Broadband were to give away the product for free.</p> <p>McDonnell suggested British Broadband could negotiate access rights, or that the smaller rivals could be brought within the \u201cambit\u201d of the publicly owned operator. If the latter means follow-on nationalisations, the upfront bill would clearly be bigger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there\u2019s the actual cost of building the new fibre network. McDonnell talked about \u00a320bn but the BT chief executive, Philip Jansen, thinks the bill would be \u00a330bn to \u00a340bn, one of several disputes over the back-of-the-envelope arithmetic. While Labour referred to \u00a3230m of annual \u201crunning costs\u201d for the new network, BT\u2019s last accounts show operating costs of \u00a32.6bn for Openreach. Estimates of maintenance costs for the current broadband network are put at close to \u00a31bn a year.</p> <p>If the higher figures are correct, how do you get the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Google to part-fund the policy via a digital tax, as Labour intends. One can see the moral case: the tech giants\u2019 current UK tax contributions are disgracefully small. But extracting fair digital taxes from multinationals is not straightforward, as governments everywhere know. Discussions at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on this subject grind on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=109m%20miles&amp;title=length%20of%20cable%20managed%20by%20Openreach\" data-alt=\"Broadband graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=109m%20miles&title=length%20of%20cable%20managed%20by%20Openreach\">Broadband graph</a> </figure>  <p>Then there\u2019s the deficit in BT\u2019s pension fund \u2013 \u00a36bn at the last count. That complication was one reason why Ofcom opted not to break up BT in 2017, but nationalisation of Openreach would bring the issue to the fore again. Someone has to fund the scheme and Openreach\u2019s current \u00a35bn of annual revenues won\u2019t survive if broadband becomes free.</p> <p>At the ballot box, financial details may count for little. Labour\u2019s nationalisation policies for water, the energy networks, and Royal Mail are said to be popular. Free broadband might enjoy even better reviews \u2013 the idea will certainly stir more debate than the right ownership structure for electricity pylons, one suspects.</p> <p>And McDonnell is clearly correct when he says the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/15/labour-full-fibre-broadband-is-the-uk-lagging-behind-other-countries\">UK lags behind</a> many other major economies on access to ultra-fast broadband.

It will be done \u201cin the usual way, with parliament setting the price\u201d, said the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, as if the definition of fair compensation is obvious. It\u2019s not. Openreach has a regulated asset base \u2013 one form of official valuation \u2013 of \u00a313.5bn but its market value might be closer to \u00a320bn, reckons the City. Pension funds are almost honour-bound to fight to protect savers\u2019 interests. BT\u2019s biggest shareholder, Deutsche Telekom, which owns 12%, also won\u2019t want a few billion pounds of assumed value to slip between the nationalisation cracks. The City thinks shareholders\u2019 rights are strong. \u201cThe UK has bilateral investment treaties with countries in which overseas BT shareholders are located, and these are intended to protect against asset expropriation,\u201d said the investment bank Jefferies. \u201cUK-based shareholders might expect to receive equal treatment.\u201d That legal scrap would be resolved eventually, but the next problem would be how to compensate Virgin Media, the broadband parts of Sky and TalkTalk, and broadband-only specialists such as CityFibre. Those companies have been incentivised by Ofcom for years to lay their own fibre cables to compete with BT, but their businesses would implode if a new state-owned British Broadband were to give away the product for free. McDonnell suggested British Broadband could negotiate access rights, or that the smaller rivals could be brought within the \u201cambit\u201d of the publicly owned operator. If the latter means follow-on nationalisations, the upfront bill would clearly be bigger. Then there\u2019s the actual cost of building the new fibre network. McDonnell talked about \u00a320bn but the BT chief executive, Philip Jansen, thinks the bill would be \u00a330bn to \u00a340bn, one of several disputes over the back-of-the-envelope arithmetic. While Labour referred to \u00a3230m of annual \u201crunning costs\u201d for the new network, BT\u2019s last accounts show operating costs of \u00a32.6bn for Openreach. Estimates of maintenance costs for the current broadband network are put at close to \u00a31bn a year. If the higher figures are correct, how do you get the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Google to part-fund the policy via a digital tax, as Labour intends. One can see the moral case: the tech giants\u2019 current UK tax contributions are disgracefully small. But extracting fair digital taxes from multinationals is not straightforward, as governments everywhere know. Discussions at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on this subject grind on. Then there\u2019s the deficit in BT\u2019s pension fund \u2013 \u00a36bn at the last count. That complication was one reason why Ofcom opted not to break up BT in 2017, but nationalisation of Openreach would bring the issue to the fore again. Someone has to fund the scheme and Openreach\u2019s current \u00a35bn of annual revenues won\u2019t survive if broadband becomes free. At the ballot box, financial details may count for little. Labour\u2019s nationalisation policies for water, the energy networks, and Royal Mail are said to be popular. Free broadband might enjoy even better reviews \u2013 the idea will certainly stir more debate than the right ownership structure for electricity pylons, one suspects. And McDonnell is clearly correct when he says the UK lags behind many other major economies on access to ultra-fast broadband. It would be hard, though, to describe his plan as detailed. There are a lot of unanswered practical questions.",

(He even added to the charge sheet on Friday, intimidating a witness via tweet, at the very moment she was testifying that she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/15/trump-impeachment-inquiry-marie-yovanovitch\" title=\"\">felt threatened</a> by him.)And, just like Watergate, there was a cover-up, as Trump aides hastily hid away that \u201ctranscript\u201d on a top-secret server, where it would have lain undiscovered had it not been for a whistleblower.</p> <p>In the Nixon case, impeachment never even got to a vote of the full House let alone a trial in the senate: a delegation of senior Republicans told Nixon the game was up, and he preferred to resign than be removed. It\u2019s conceivable the Trump story will end the same way, and yet few expect it. The settled view in Washington \u2013 which has been wrong before \u2013 is that this will break on partisan lines: the Democratic-led House will vote to impeach Trump, but two-thirds of the Republican-dominated Senate will not be ready to convict him, as the rules demand, and he\u2019ll be acquitted.</p> <p>Why? It\u2019s not because of the quality of the arguments Republicans are marshalling in the president\u2019s defence.

To which the obvious reply is: fine, let Trump\u2019s closest aides testify instead of barring them from appearing, as the White House has done.</p> <p>Others say that there\u2019s no crime because eventually the US aid to Ukraine was unblocked and Kyiv never did produce any dirt on Biden. Memo to those Republicans: if you set a barn on fire and the barn survives, it\u2019s still arson. Besides, the aid to Ukraine was released only once that unnamed government employee blew the whistle. It\u2019s not much of a defence to say that you halted your criminal scheming the second you got caught.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has spat out so many insults and broken so many taboos that it\u2019s hard for any single remark to linger long in the memory. Nevertheless one line from his 2016 election campaign has endured, partly because it was a jaw-dropper and partly because it offered an early glimpse of what would later be revealed as a deep truth about both his candidacy and his presidency \u2013 and even our current world. It came when Trump was praising his early supporters as \u201cso smart\u201d and so loyal that \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters\u201d. The imagery was gross, the vanity egregious but, as so often with Trump, his reptilian intelligence had landed on something that was, though ugly, true: namely, that he enjoys a rare form of impunity. The first proof was victory itself, won despite scandals and revelations that would have felled more mortal candidates. There was his voice on tape, clear and unmistakable, bragging about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d \u2013 and he won anyway. Now, three years on, Trump\u2019s impunity is being tested again, with the launch this week of the public phase of the House intelligence committee\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Even before the first witness had opened his mouth, Democrats had laid out what should be a slam-dunk case for the removal of a president. Americans have known since September that Trump withheld foreign aid from Ukraine as he pressured its president to reveal, or make up, dirt on Trump\u2019s would-be 2020 opponent, Joe Biden. You can call that soliciting the interference of a foreign power in a US election. You can call it subordinating the US national interest for personal, political gain. Either way, it qualifies as a \u201chigh crime or misdemeanour\u201d defined as an impeachable offence under the constitution. Or, simpler still, as the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, now suggests, you might call it plain old \u201cbribery\u201d, which the constitution explicitly lists alongside treason as grounds for a president\u2019s removal from office. However you slice it, the White House\u2019s own account \u2013 not quite a transcript \u2013 of Trump\u2019s phone call on 25 July reveals an abuse of power, one every bit as clear-cut as the abuses which saw Richard Nixon forced out in 1974.

Nikita Parris chased Arsenal\u2019s Vivianne Miedema right to the close, finishing three behind the latter\u2019s 22 league goals. With Parris swapping Manchester City for the Champions League holders Lyon, Miedema needs a new challenger and there are plenty of options.

      "bodyText": "Debutants on fire The Women\u2019s Super League debutants Manchester United and Tottenham have shaken things up. Both have an extremely respectable three wins in five games going into the FA\u2019s Women\u2019s Football Weekend. Each recruited players with top-tier experience in the summer but key has been their ability to get the best out of the players who were retained and made the leap up. That has been down to the managers. The Spurs duo Karen Hills and Juan Amoros picked up the manager of the month award for September, and Casey Stoney was shortlisted for the October award. Golden boot battle The race for the WSL golden boot last season went to the wire. Nikita Parris chased Arsenal\u2019s Vivianne Miedema right to the close, finishing three behind the latter\u2019s 22 league goals. With Parris swapping Manchester City for the Champions League holders Lyon, Miedema needs a new challenger and there are plenty of options. Ellen White\u2019s first Manchester City start on her return from injury was marked by a goal against her former side Birmingham. Arsenal\u2019s Dani\u00eblle van de Donk and Everton\u2019s Chloe Kelly lead the scoring chart with three apiece but it is the arrival of Australia\u2019s Sam Kerr that really excites. She joins Chelsea in January, having finished as the NWSL\u2019s top scorer for a second season in a row despite missing part of the season at the World Cup. In the Championship the Sheffield United trio Katie Wilkinson, Olivia Fergusson and Jade Pennock have scored six, five and four respectively, but they sit behind Aston Villa\u2019s Melissa Johnson, who has scored 10 goals in six starts. Mixture on Merseyside Manchester United and Tottenham have surprised with how they have hit the ground running but the bigger surprise is the turnaround of Everton. They benefited from the crisis at Yeovil Town last season, which kept them safe from the drop, but three wins and three draws across a 20-game season left many predicting Everton would be candidates for relegation. How wrong we were. The former Bristol City manager Willie Kirk, who joined Everton after six months as Stoney\u2019s No 2 at United, has transformed the team.

Something that now takes three to four minutes would take 40 minutes or longer.\u201d After Labour set out plans to give free full-fibre broadband to every home and business in the UK, Michaelston-y-Fedw has come back into focus as an example of the costs that not having fast internet entails \u2013 and the benefits that it brings with it when it comes.

Village residents were enthusiastic enough to back the project financially, raising \u00a3150,000 by buying shares in a not-for-profit Community Interest Company.

The former New York mayor, who serves as a personal lawyer to Donald Trump, faced justice department scrutiny last year for remarks he made in October 2016 that strongly suggested he had insider knowledge about a secret FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information. James Comey, the then FBI director, publicly disclosed that investigators were looking into new material in the Clinton matter shortly after Giuliani\u2019s public comments, in what proved to be one of the most contentious and controversial decisions in the weeks before the 2016 vote, which Trump won. In an interview with the Guardian this week, in response to questions about a 2018 leak investigation into the matter by the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office, Giuliani acknowledged that he told the FBI that he had \u201cprobably misled\u201d people when he suggested he had spoken to \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cactive\u201d FBI agents about the \u201csurprise\u201d Clinton was facing. But far from acknowledging that he had simply made misleading remarks, Giuliani offered the Guardian a seemingly bizarre explanation for why he had used the words \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cactive agents\u201d. In short, he suggested that when he used the word \u201ccurrent\u201d agent he meant that the FBI agents were retired but still in the broader US workforce, and that when he said they were \u201cactive\u201d agents, he meant they were retired but still physically youthful and able-bodied. \u201cSometimes I described them as active agents, and I probably misled people when I said active agents, because what I meant by that one\u2026 was that they were people that I work with.

Giuliani added that he had welcomed the chance to clarify his remarks, because he did not want the inspector general\u2019s office to be \u201crunning around\u201d searching for \u201csome poor person that didn\u2019t exist\u201d. \u201cI have no reason not to tell you if I spoke to an FBI agent.

Giuliani said the two FBI agents who interviewed him seemed satisfied by his remarks and that he has not heard anything else about the matter. The inspector general\u2019s office declined to comment.

      "body": "<p>Record numbers of young adults in their 20s and 30s are living with their parents, according to official figures, with critics blaming soaring house prices and rents.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/bulletins/familiesandhouseholds/2019\"> Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS) said that over the last two decades, there has been a 46% increase in the number of young people aged 20-34 living with their parents. Over the same period, average house prices have tripled from about \u00a397,000 to \u00a3288,000.</p> <p>In total, 1.1 million more young men and women are now living at home, with the number increasing from 2.4 million in 1999 to 3.5 million in 2019.</p> <p>Men are far more likely to be staying with their mum and dad into their 30s. The ONS said 32% of all males aged 20-34 are now living with their parents, compared with 26% in 1999, with most of the increase occurring since the financial crisis in 2007-08.</p> <p>One in five women (21%) aged 20-34 live with their parents, although this is also a substantial increase from the 14% level of two decades ago.</p> <p>Georgie Laming of campaign group <a href=\"https://www.generationrent.org/\">Generation Rent</a> said: \u201cYoung people are facing an impossible choice: either stay, if you\u2019re lucky, living in your childhood bedroom in the hope you can save a deposit \u2013 or rent and face a struggle to put money aside. Two thirds of private renters have no savings whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>In its review of trends in British households in 2019, the ONS noted that the other major change is the number of people living alone. Single person households have increased by a fifth over the last 20 years, largely driven by men aged 45-64.</p> <p>A total of 8.2 million people now live alone, up from 6.8 million in 1999.

      "bodyText": "Record numbers of young adults in their 20s and 30s are living with their parents, according to official figures, with critics blaming soaring house prices and rents. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that over the last two decades, there has been a 46% increase in the number of young people aged 20-34 living with their parents. Over the same period, average house prices have tripled from about \u00a397,000 to \u00a3288,000. In total, 1.1 million more young men and women are now living at home, with the number increasing from 2.4 million in 1999 to 3.5 million in 2019. Men are far more likely to be staying with their mum and dad into their 30s. The ONS said 32% of all males aged 20-34 are now living with their parents, compared with 26% in 1999, with most of the increase occurring since the financial crisis in 2007-08. One in five women (21%) aged 20-34 live with their parents, although this is also a substantial increase from the 14% level of two decades ago. Georgie Laming of campaign group Generation Rent said: \u201cYoung people are facing an impossible choice: either stay, if you\u2019re lucky, living in your childhood bedroom in the hope you can save a deposit \u2013 or rent and face a struggle to put money aside. Two thirds of private renters have no savings whatsoever.\u201d In its review of trends in British households in 2019, the ONS noted that the other major change is the number of people living alone. Single person households have increased by a fifth over the last 20 years, largely driven by men aged 45-64. A total of 8.2 million people now live alone, up from 6.8 million in 1999. The ONS said higher proportions of men than women never marry and that after partnership dissolution, men are more likely to live alone while women may live with any children from the relationship. One of the key reasons why young adults stay at home for longer is to save for the much higher downpayments needed on their first home purchase. In the mid 1990s, young adults typically put down a deposit of just 10%, and house prices in real terms were much lower. Now, the typical first-time buyer struggles to find the \u00a325,000 deposit typically needed, with the average figure \u2013 heavily skewed by London prices \u2013 at nearly \u00a345,000. Liz Emerson, cofounder of the Intergenerational Foundation, said: \u201cThese figures provide yet further evidence that intergenerational unfairness is worsening. We should all be ashamed that our young people cannot strike out on their own like previous generations have been able to do.\u201d Quite why so many more men than women stay at home in their 20s and 30s is not entirely clear. When the ONS issued a report earlier this year on the \u201cJourney into adulthood\u201d, it said: \u201cThere are a few possible reasons for this: women have traditionally moved in with a partner at younger ages than men; women are also more likely to go to university; and there is some evidence that, early in their careers at least, women have been known to earn more than men.\u201d For many parents, the \u201cboomerang generation\u201d of offspring returning from university presents its own challenges. Research by Loughborough University and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in January found that the average young adult in their 20s living at home saves \u00a391 a week in rent, \u00a316.50 in council tax and \u00a312.80 in fuel bills. But parents have to spend extra on food and heating, with the researchers suggesting that young adults should pay \u00a3100 a month for bed and board while at home. The millions of young adults forced to stay at home or pay high rents could emerge as a key electoral battleground, with campaign groups demanding rent controls and targeting key marginal constituencies where renters could sway the result. Generation Rent, working with other rental action groups, has identified 47 constituencies where the local MP\u2019s majority is under 5,000 but where private tenants make up a higher than average proportion of voters. Top of the demands in the campaigners\u2019 national rental manifesto are new rent controls which would ban landlords from charging more than 30% of the local median income. The tenants\u2019 manifesto also demands an end to discrimination against tenants on housing benefit and the abolition of so-called \u201crevenge\u201d section 21 evictions (a section 21 notice is the form a landlord must give to a renter to start the process to end an assured shorthold tenancy).",

It is always impressive how good many players are at public speaking in a non-native language:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First of all, thanks Chris for everything. It\u2019s a real honour receive this trophy from you so many thanks for all the things that you did well for our sport.</p> <p>Honestly, what can I say? I am super happy. Honestly, after all the things that I went through in my career in terms of injuries, I never thought at the age of 33 and a half that I will have this trophy in my hands again. So, it\u2019s something really, really emotional for me. A lot of work on the shadows to be where we are today and without all my team and family that is here with me, this thing would be impossible. So I can just say thank you very much everybody for the support. </p> <p>Have been some bad moments and you have been always there, so\u2026 Honestly, like this year for example, after Monte Carlo [note: Nadal considered momentarily stepping away from competition after the constant injuries broke his confidence], after the support of all these people who are here to my left, things will be much different for me this year. They encouraged me to keep going and I can\u2019t thank them enough. Thank you very much.</p> <p>Well, to all the fans and all the ATP staff\u2026 I\u2019m gonna start with the ATP staff. We have a great tour. All the workers make us feel great every single week all around the world. So many thanks to all the people who work on the ATP and make the players and the fans enjoy a great tour so many thanks everybody in the ATP tour. Thank you.</p> <p>It\u2019s a little bit heavy! [Nadal had been carrying the huge trophy, then he put it down.]</p> <p>Last thing, this trophy is an achievement all around for the whole year. So personally today I can\u2019t thank enough to all of you for the support on this personal match and all the time that I have been playing here in London. But at the same time I have to say, because it\u2019s something that I really feel from the bottom of my heart, to all the fans all around the world that give me their support every single week that I am playing, no? It\u2019s very difficult to describe the feeling when you are on court. When you walk on and you feel the support and the love from that many people. So just thank you very much everybody from all around.</p> <p>Of course, all the sponsors, all the people who believe in our sport. Thank you very much. We try to make the things the best way possible and I hope all the sponsors are happy with our sport. Thank you very much for supporting our sport.</p> <p>And, well, guys, I don\u2019t know if I see you tomorrow because it depends on the match in the afternoon! But I did all the things I could today. I fighted until the end: Two days ago, today. So, if I am able to play in front of you against Roger, it will be a huge honor. If not, I really hope to see you next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-15T17:35:54.510Z\">at 5.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dcedced8f08aab51e1bfe65\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-15T17:15:08.618Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A reminder: Rafael Nadal arrived at this tournament after withdrawing from Paris with a small abdominal tear.</strong> The abs may have been fine in the end, but his preparation was affected. It seems like he has been able to play himself into form across these three matches and he finally produced his best tennis in the second and third sets. </p> <p>By the end, Nadal was flitting across the court, crushing forehands down the line, returning brilliantly and serving so well. With all the talk about the court speed and how it favours aggressive players, just look at how the Spaniard moved to the net many more times than net lover Tsitsipas (22/28 to 15/21). In the final two sets, Nadal hit 28 winners and 15 unforced errors.</p> <p>A lot of credit goes to Tsitsipas, already through to the semis, who lost his way in the middle of the second set but found it just as Nadal was laying waste to his serve.

Tsitsipas couldn\u2019t believe it, but hawkeye says that it landed right on the line.</p> <p>Tsitsipas saved the break point, but Nadal continued to stand atop of the baseline and crush the ball off both wings until he finally forced an error.

And in my opinion, the example is not the comeback, because the comeback is -- of course you need to be there and you need to keep fighting, but the example, in my opinion, is not break a racquet when you are 5-1 in the third or not be out of your self-control when the things are not going the right way.</p> <p>Just staying positive, staying on court, accepting that the opponent is playing a little bit better than you and accepting that you are not that good. That\u2019s the only example, no? Because sometimes the frustration comes when you believe and you consider yourself too good and you don\u2019t accept the mistakes that you are doing.</p> <p>So something that not happen to me very often, and I know I can have mistakes and I normally accept it. That\u2019s the only thing.</p> <p>And for me that\u2019s the only example that I can try to tell the guys. Don\u2019t consider themself too good.

It felt like a different dimension of tennis completely.</p> <p>He gives you no rhythm. He plays just a different game style than the rest of the players. He has this, I don\u2019t know, talent that no other player has. I\u2019ve never seen a player have this. He makes you play bad. I don\u2019t know. I would call that a talent.<br></p> <p>---</p> <p> I just couldn\u2019t today. The angles that he was using, my brain was used to a certain rhythm of the game with all the righty players that I played this week. Him, it felt like I was always, when he was playing, on the wrong foot. Didn\u2019t check properly. Felt very slow today. I feel pretty fast when I\u2019m on the court. I mean, I\u2019ve improved a lot in that part of my game. Today I felt like a 2-meter-10 guy that can\u2019t move on the court. That\u2019s definitely not me.

Stefanos Tsitsipas and Rafael Nadal will begin first, resuming one of the most interesting top 10 match-ups around. Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev will follow them in the evening.</p> <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas had his first huge moment at the beginning of the year when he defeated Roger Federer at the Australian Open before reaching his first slam semi-final there. But in that semi-final, he was absolutely obliterated 6-2 6-4 6-0 by Nadal and the Greek left the court shattered. It marked a third consecutive defeat for Tsitsipas against Nadal and he began to wonder if he would ever be able to win.<br></p> <p>Well, he did. In their very next meeting, on clay and in Madrid of all place, Tsitsipas finally registered his first win over Nadal. With that settled, the 21 year-old should come into the match full of confidence after a brilliant 6-3 6-2 win over Zverev two days ago. Despite being the youngest player in the event, he is the only player with a perfect record. These conditions clearly suit the Greek well as the fast, low bouncing courts aid his net game and should diminish the effect of Nadal\u2019s heavy topspin forehand on his vulnerable single-handed backhand.<br></p> <p>Across the net, Nadal produced an astonishing comeback against Daniil Medvedev on Wednesday, recovering from match point down and 1-5 in the third set. It was another reflection of his heart and mental stability as the Russian choked badly, but we should not mistake that mental triumph as a reflection of his level. The big question is whether he will use that victory to spur him onto new heights or if he will continue to struggle with his forehand, defence and serve. If he doesn\u2019t improve, he will lose today. This much is clear. Let\u2019s see what the Spaniard has to offer.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "The full text of Rafael Nadal\u2019s speech after lifting the year end number one trophy. It is always impressive how good many players are at public speaking in a non-native language: First of all, thanks Chris for everything. It\u2019s a real honour receive this trophy from you so many thanks for all the things that you did well for our sport. Honestly, what can I say? I am super happy. Honestly, after all the things that I went through in my career in terms of injuries, I never thought at the age of 33 and a half that I will have this trophy in my hands again. So, it\u2019s something really, really emotional for me. A lot of work on the shadows to be where we are today and without all my team and family that is here with me, this thing would be impossible. So I can just say thank you very much everybody for the support. Have been some bad moments and you have been always there, so\u2026 Honestly, like this year for example, after Monte Carlo [note: Nadal considered momentarily stepping away from competition after the constant injuries broke his confidence], after the support of all these people who are here to my left, things will be much different for me this year. They encouraged me to keep going and I can\u2019t thank them enough. Thank you very much. Well, to all the fans and all the ATP staff\u2026 I\u2019m gonna start with the ATP staff. We have a great tour. All the workers make us feel great every single week all around the world. So many thanks to all the people who work on the ATP and make the players and the fans enjoy a great tour so many thanks everybody in the ATP tour. Thank you. It\u2019s a little bit heavy! [Nadal had been carrying the huge trophy, then he put it down.] Last thing, this trophy is an achievement all around for the whole year. So personally today I can\u2019t thank enough to all of you for the support on this personal match and all the time that I have been playing here in London. But at the same time I have to say, because it\u2019s something that I really feel from the bottom of my heart, to all the fans all around the world that give me their support every single week that I am playing, no? It\u2019s very difficult to describe the feeling when you are on court. When you walk on and you feel the support and the love from that many people. So just thank you very much everybody from all around. Of course, all the sponsors, all the people who believe in our sport. Thank you very much. We try to make the things the best way possible and I hope all the sponsors are happy with our sport. Thank you very much for supporting our sport. And, well, guys, I don\u2019t know if I see you tomorrow because it depends on the match in the afternoon! But I did all the things I could today. I fighted until the end: Two days ago, today. So, if I am able to play in front of you against Roger, it will be a huge honor. If not, I really hope to see you next year. A reminder: Rafael Nadal arrived at this tournament after withdrawing from Paris with a small abdominal tear. The abs may have been fine in the end, but his preparation was affected. It seems like he has been able to play himself into form across these three matches and he finally produced his best tennis in the second and third sets. By the end, Nadal was flitting across the court, crushing forehands down the line, returning brilliantly and serving so well. With all the talk about the court speed and how it favours aggressive players, just look at how the Spaniard moved to the net many more times than net lover Tsitsipas (22/28 to 15/21). In the final two sets, Nadal hit 28 winners and 15 unforced errors. A lot of credit goes to Tsitsipas, already through to the semis, who lost his way in the middle of the second set but found it just as Nadal was laying waste to his serve. That was a brilliant second set from both. Nadal is now collecting his year-end number one trophy. The crazy thing is that although he has won two matches, he only advances if Medvedev wins. Rafael Nadal finishes things off with another sublime service game, holding to 15 and sealing the win with an incredible forehand down the line. It took a while, but he finally played his best tennis. A brilliant set of tennis from both players. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 *6-5 Stefanos Tsitsipas. Oh my goodness. Rafael Nadal breaks! With the level this high, it was going to take something incredible for Nadal to break and it came at 30-30 when he blasted a screaming forehand down the line clean on the run. Tsitsipas couldn\u2019t believe it, but hawkeye says that it landed right on the line. Tsitsipas saved the break point, but Nadal continued to stand atop of the baseline and crush the ball off both wings until he finally forced an error. On break point, Nadal came up with a perfect running angled forehand passing shot, forcing a volley error from Tsitsipas. An incredible, incredible return game. We are finally seeing the best of Rafael Nadal this week and we are all better for it. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 5-5* Stefanos Tsitsipas: Nadal refuses to blink and pieces together a great hold to 15. Some more incredible work from the Spaniard, including a brilliant bullet of a defensive forehand at 15-15 to force a Tsitsipas error just as he thought he was about to win the point. Then he came forward and executed a beautiful backhand volley at 30-15. He held with another big ser. Nadal has now come to the net 22 times in 27 points. He is one of the best players in the world at the net and it is so impressive to see him using it more and more as he grows older. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 *4-5 Stefanos Tsitsipas: A love hold for Tsitsipas. After struggling on his serve throughout the past hour, that was exactly what he needed. Tsitsipas is serving huge and crushing forehands, but he\u2019s also showing his typical variety. A really nice forehand dropshot at 15-0 caught Nadal by complete suprirse. He held with a big serve down the T. One game away. This is so impressive from both. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 4-4* Stefanos Tsitsipas: Nadal holds. This match is on fire and there\u2019s not much else to say. The Spaniard opened the game with an incredible stretch, angled volley that nobody in the entire stadium saw coming. Tsitsipas continued to pound forehands himself, but Nadal\u2019s favourite stroke is on fire right now and creating so much damage. Indeed, at 30-30, he crushed three consecutive forehands and then moved forward to produce a second perfect volley, this time a dropper, to keep himself ahead. He sealed the hold with a forehand down the line winner after a brilliant wide serve. The quality is so high right now. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 *3-4 Stefanos Tsitsipas: My word, another otherworldly hold from Stefanos Tsitsipas, saving another break point. Tsitsipas led 40-15, only for Nadal to respond with three brilliant points in a row: he swept into the net and executed a perfect lunging volley at full stretch, then he crushed an inside out forehand to bring the game to Deuce. He brought up break point on Tsitsipas with a brilliant angled return winner. But Tsitsipas is also dialled in now. and he saved the break point with a huge serve. After Nadal shanked a wayward forehand, the Greek clinched the game with a brilliant inside out forehand of his own. Wonderful. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 3-3* Stefanos Tsitsipas: Nadal digs out his first difficult hold of the match, recovering from 0-30 down with aplomb. From 0-30 down, Nadal worked his way back into the game with a fizzling forehand down the line, then a great backhand to force a Tsitsipas error. At 30-30, with the pressure resting heavily on his shoulders, Nadal crushed a forehand down the line and dispatched an easy volley behind it. He held with a sliding service winner out wide and a cry of \u201cvamos\u201d. Aggressive, fearless play from the Spaniard. This is heating up. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 *2-3 Stefanos Tsitsipas: A truly majestic hold form Tsitsipas. The clearest measuring stick for Nadal is his forehand down-the-line and it is finally starting to purr. After dominating all the opening rallies, at 15-30 Nadal connected with a brilliant forehand down the line and then swept to the net to finish off the point. What did Tsitsipas do from 15-40 down? He hit an ace down the T, a brilliant drop volley winner, a huge forehand de-facto winner and then a big inside out forehand winner to hold. Gutsy as heck. The youngster keeps himself on serve and in the match. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 2-2* Stefanos Tsitsipas: Nadal is still rolling through his service games and he seals another love hold with a 127mph ace down the T. All of the pressure and the action is on the Greek\u2019s serve. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 *1-2 Stefanos Tsitsipas: Tsitsipas holds again with some great serving, including an ace to bring up 40-15. When Nadal pegged him back to deuce, he found a good service winner and then he slipped in a serve and volley to hold. The Greek needs to move to the net more and throw in more serve and volleys, as he did in the first set. Now is not the time for being tentative and cautious. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 1-1* Stefanos Tsitsipas: Nadal continues to serve well in the third set and he is still yet to face a break point. His body serve is particularly purring and he holds with one such 124mph bullet. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 *0-1 Stefanos Tsitsipas: Tsitsipas had to immediately defend a 15-30 deficit, but he responded with a great combination of forehands to win two successive points and bring up game point. He held with a good 129mph ace out wide. It has taken a while, but there was some evidence that Nadal is playing himself into form here in London. That was easily the best set of Nadal\u2019s week so far. He is taking his return earlier and was stepping into the court, dominating the exchanges and moving forward. He is now 13/17 for net points won compared to Tsitsipas with 8/10. Across the net, Tsitsipas has been far from horrible but under that sustained pressure from Nadal, he just crept into his shell. The Greek needs to get back to playing on the front foot and moving forward to the net. He also needs to return much better. After 23 games, Tsitsipas hasn\u2019t even been close to generating a break point. That is pretty unacceptable for him. We are going to three! There was little doubt from Nadal, who moved to 40-0 with an ace out wide. It took a couple of attempts, but he found a great wide slice serve on his third set point to seal a brilliant set. He will love his chances heading into the final set. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) *5-4 Stefanos Tsitsipas: Nadal breaks! Nadal had been putting on immense pressure for a while, and after some brave resistance Tsitsipas finally crumbled under it. It took an incredible point from Nadal at 30-30, who piled on the pressure with wicked forehands to the Tsitsipas backhand before slipping into the net and slamming an overhead home. Down break point, a rattled Tsitsipas misfired a routine forehand well wide. Nadal will serve for the set and he is playing great right now. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 4-4* Stefanos Tsitsipas: Nadal still looks really sharp right now. He is the player taking the rallies on and moving forward to the net. After a nice improvised volley at 15-15, he forced a Tsitsipas backhand error with a heavy forehand and then held with an unreturned serve. Tsitsipas\u2019 returning has been quite dire and he hasn\u2019t been close to breaking Nadal today. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) *3-4 Stefanos Tsitsipas: A truly sublime hold from Stefanos Tsitsipas. Nadal is piling on the pressure now, taking control of the points and returning well. He opened with an inch-perfect angled backhand passing shot, then a majestic forehand down the line to lead 0-30. After Tsitsipas pegged him back with some big serving, Nadal battled again to force a break point. But from break point down, Tsitsipas found three big serves in succession to scupper the danger and keep his nose ahead. Can he keep Nadal at bay? Two games away. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 3-3* Stefanos Tsitsipas: After the disappointment of the previous game, a nice recovery from Nadal there. He held to 15 with a big unreturned serve and the pressure is immediately back on Tsitsipas\u2019 broad shoulders. Here\u2019s that brutal return on the first point of the previous game. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) *2-3 Stefanos Tsitsipas: A brilliant hold from Tsitsipas from double break point down! Nadal burst into the game with a brutal forehand down the line return winner at 15-0, then he crushed a forehand inside out winner after another amazing forehand return. A double fault from Tsitsipas brought up Nadal\u2019s first break point. How did the 21 year-old respond? From 15-40, he struck an incredible half-volley forehand winner that fizzed down the line, then he broke down the Nadal forehand with deep, penetrating backhands to save the second. Tsitsipas closed it out with great serve and volley. So aggressive and so gutsy. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 2-2* Stefanos Tsitsipas: Tsitsipas opened with a really nice backhand return as Nadal stormed into the net behind his first serve, but 0-15 is as close as the Greek got to a break point this time. With more brilliant serving from Nadal, he won 4 points in a row and closed with an ace out wide. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) *1-2 Stefanos Tsitsipas: Another dominant hold from Tsitsipas, who continues to take the ball early and move forward. He sealed the game with an ace down the T. We are 16 games in yet no player has generated a single break point today. Here are the scenarios again. As you can see, Tsitsipas winning the first set doesn\u2019t change anything. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) 1-1* Stefanos Tsitsipas: Nadal responds with a good love hold of his own, sealed with an easy unreturned second serve. A big \u201cvenga!\u201d from the Spaniard in the middle of it. He\u2019s not going anywhere, but anyone watching this should already know that. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-7(4) *0-1 Stefanos Tsitsipas: That was a quick and businesslike service game from Tsitsipas to open the second set. As he continues to fire booming forehands, an absolutely gorgeous angled backhand dropshot at 30-15. He held with a big ace down the T. That was another strange set from Nadal. Once again, he served pretty well and he was extremely successful at the net, winning 8 of 10 net points. But his groundstrokes are still far too insecure and he can\u2019t count on them under pressure: 4 unforced errors in the tiebreak and 15 overall. However, he\u2019s clearly still in this. Tsitsipas has been good but he will probably need to return better in set two. Stefanos Tsitsipas slams down an ace down the T to take the first set! 5-0 in sets this week, no problem. First set: Rafael Nadal 6-6 (4-6*) Stefanos Tsitsipas: This is just too inconsistent off the ground from Nadal. After moving back to 4-4 with bullet forehand down the line, he netted a routine backhand. Great work from Tsitsipas, who buried an accurate forehand down the line at 5-4 to bring up set point. Will he do it? First set: Rafael Nadal 6-6 (2-4*) Stefanos Tsitsipas: After so few points going against the serve in the opening set, the opening three went the way of the returner. Tsitsipas leads after bad forehand into the net by Nadal at 2-2, followed by a routine backhand long. That may hurt. First set: Rafael Nadal 6-6 Stefanos Tsitsipas: We\u2019re heading to a tiebreak! It was Nadal who left his mark on the highlights reel there with a breathtaking down-the-line rocket of a forehand winner at 15-0, but another solid hold from Tsitsipas. There were some tense exchanges, particularly at 15-15 where Tsitsipas hesitated instead of moving forward before Nadal dumped a meek backhand into the net, but some big serving from the Greek to hold. First set: Rafael Nadal 6-5* Stefanos Tsitsipas: Nadal\u2019s forehand is winning many of the battles against Tsitsipas\u2019 backhand at the moment. At 15-15 he hooked a forehand high to the Tsitsipas backhand and elicited an error, then Tsitsipas responded by stepping in and overcooking a backhand into the net. A big second out wide and he holds with ease. Nadal has still only lost two points behind his first serve. First set: Rafael Nadal *5-5 Stefanos Tsitsipas: Plenty of scoreboard pressure for Tsitsipas at 4-5, but he responds by producing one of his best service games of the match so far. After some big serving, he crushes a squeaky clean forehand inside out winner to hold. That forehand was so good that it elicited a yell of appreciation of Nadal. First set: Rafael Nadal 5-4* Stefanos Tsitsipas: This is starting to heat up nicely. At 0-15, some absolutely insane defense from Nadal at the net. Tsitsipas crushed an enormous forehand straight to Nadal at the net, but Nadal\u2019s reflexes saved him and he did just enough with the following volley to force the net. Nadal is starting to find some joy by outmanoeuvring Tsitsipas with his forehand, and an accurate forehand down the line from the deuce court forces Tsitsipas to scramble and shank a backhand far out. Honestly, Nadal looks better than he has so far this week. First set: Rafael Nadal *4-4 Stefanos Tsitsipas: A very big hold from Tsitsipas, who dug it out from 15-30. Tsitsipas calmly applied pressure with his forehand, crushing a forehand down the line just good enough to force an error. At 30-30, he serve and volleyed, producing a gorgeous lunging backhand drop volley to bring up game point. Tsitsipas failed to convert it, but he moved forward again and picked a nice backhand volley so well. He sealed the game with a couple of big, accurate forehands. Attack, attack, attack. First set: Rafael Nadal 4-3* Stefanos Tsitsipas: Some more very good serving from Nadal, who holds to love quickly and easily. One notable event in the previous game: Tsitsipas\u2019s final ace in the was called out and then overruled by the chair umpire. Nadal checked the mark and happily gave it a thumbs up. Nadal didn\u2019t challenge but hawk-eye showed the ball out by two millimetres in the TV studio. Hawk-eye\u2019s margin of error is 3 millimetres - it\u2019s far from perfect. First set: Rafael Nadal *3-3 Stefanos Tsitsipas: While Nadal is serving at 75% first serves with 92% of points won behind it, Tsitsipas did not serve well in the opening game. But he is now and he holds to love, closing with 2 aces in a row. First set: Rafael Nadal 3-2* Stefanos Tsitsipas: It\u2019s early days, but already an interesting stat: Both Nadal and Tsitsipas are \u00be for net points won. Like Tsitsipas, Nadal is already coming forward whenever possible and he played a beautiful low backhand volley at 15-0 to wrong foot the Greek. Nice 126mph service winner out wide from Nadal to hold to 15. First set: Rafael Nadal *2-2 Stefanos Tsitsipas: A much stronger hold from Tsitsipas there, easily levelling the match to love. He crushed a really nice angled forehand at 15-0, then Nadal badly dumped a backhand slice attempt into the net. Tsitsipas closed it out with a big unreturned serve. The joys of round robin tennis. First set: Rafael Nadal 2-1* Stefanos Tsitsipas: Another good hold for Nadal, this time to 30, but Tsitsipas is being so aggressive with his backhand early on. At 30-15, the Greek once again wrestled with Nadal\u2019s forehand and won the battle, moving forward on a big backhand down the line. But it was too central and Nadal easily slipped a backhand passing shot beyond him. Nice serve and volley from Nadal to hold. First set: Rafael Nadal *1-1 Stefanos Tsitsipas: That was a good hold for Tsitsipas from deuce. The Greek led 40-15 before firing a couple of loose forehands, but he responded with a great serve and volley at deuce. He is already thinking fast. We also saw one of the essential mini battles early on as Nadal attempted to break down the Tsitsipas backhand with his forehand at 30-15 and also at advantage Tsitsipas. Both times, the 21 year old stepped into the court and crushed his single-hander on the rise, forcing a forehand error. Very interesting. First set: Rafael Nadal 1-0* Stefanos Tsitsipas: A good start for Nadal, who speeds through his opening service game and holds to 15 without having to hit a groundstroke. Four big serves and a double fault. Not bad. The players are on-court. Rafael Nadal won the toss and chose to serve first. Let\u2019s go. Here are the group scenarios. The big Nadal quote after his great comeback to Daniil Medvedev. Q. Is this a game that could be easily shown to young academies, like yours and any other in the world, and pass the message to the young guys that they should never quit, they should fight until the last point? Is it one of those games? RAFAEL NADAL: No, examples are not for one day. Examples are every day. And in my opinion, the example is not the comeback, because the comeback is -- of course you need to be there and you need to keep fighting, but the example, in my opinion, is not break a racquet when you are 5-1 in the third or not be out of your self-control when the things are not going the right way. Just staying positive, staying on court, accepting that the opponent is playing a little bit better than you and accepting that you are not that good. That\u2019s the only example, no? Because sometimes the frustration comes when you believe and you consider yourself too good and you don\u2019t accept the mistakes that you are doing. So something that not happen to me very often, and I know I can have mistakes and I normally accept it. That\u2019s the only thing. And for me that\u2019s the only example that I can try to tell the guys. Don\u2019t consider themself too good. Accept the mistakes, because everybody have mistakes and you need to keep going after the mistakes. That\u2019s the only way. And here is video of Tsitsipas\u2019 press conference in Australia, just to see how demoralised he was after the defeat. As he has improved and matured throughout the year, I think one of his greatest assets is that he has learnt to take both his defeats and victories slightly more calmly. When he fell in the first round of the US Open, he was much more positive, and it set him up for a great final stretch. This season has been a massive learning curve for the Greek and it is impressive to see how well he is ending it. We need to talk more about that Australian Open semi-final. Here are some quotes from Tsitsipas after losing 6-2 6-4 6-0 to Nadal: I really can\u2019t think of something positive on that match. Probably the second set, which was the one that I got closer to. The rest, it kind of felt like in a way it wasn\u2019t tennis so much like the other matches that I played. It felt like a different dimension of tennis completely. He gives you no rhythm. He plays just a different game style than the rest of the players. He has this, I don\u2019t know, talent that no other player has. I\u2019ve never seen a player have this. He makes you play bad. I don\u2019t know. I would call that a talent. --- I just couldn\u2019t today. The angles that he was using, my brain was used to a certain rhythm of the game with all the righty players that I played this week. Him, it felt like I was always, when he was playing, on the wrong foot. Didn\u2019t check properly. Felt very slow today. I feel pretty fast when I\u2019m on the court. I mean, I\u2019ve improved a lot in that part of my game. Today I felt like a 2-meter-10 guy that can\u2019t move on the court. That\u2019s definitely not me. I don\u2019t know. Hello! Welcome to our coverage on day 6 of the ATP Finals in London, the final day of round robin group action, where all four players in Group Andre Agassi are still in with a chance of reaching the semi-finals. Stefanos Tsitsipas and Rafael Nadal will begin first, resuming one of the most interesting top 10 match-ups around. Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev will follow them in the evening. Stefanos Tsitsipas had his first huge moment at the beginning of the year when he defeated Roger Federer at the Australian Open before reaching his first slam semi-final there. But in that semi-final, he was absolutely obliterated 6-2 6-4 6-0 by Nadal and the Greek left the court shattered. It marked a third consecutive defeat for Tsitsipas against Nadal and he began to wonder if he would ever be able to win. Well, he did. In their very next meeting, on clay and in Madrid of all place, Tsitsipas finally registered his first win over Nadal. With that settled, the 21 year-old should come into the match full of confidence after a brilliant 6-3 6-2 win over Zverev two days ago. Despite being the youngest player in the event, he is the only player with a perfect record. These conditions clearly suit the Greek well as the fast, low bouncing courts aid his net game and should diminish the effect of Nadal\u2019s heavy topspin forehand on his vulnerable single-handed backhand. Across the net, Nadal produced an astonishing comeback against Daniil Medvedev on Wednesday, recovering from match point down and 1-5 in the third set. It was another reflection of his heart and mental stability as the Russian choked badly, but we should not mistake that mental triumph as a reflection of his level. The big question is whether he will use that victory to spur him onto new heights or if he will continue to struggle with his forehand, defence and serve. If he doesn\u2019t improve, he will lose today. This much is clear. Let\u2019s see what the Spaniard has to offer.",

      "bodyText": "The meteoric political journey of Evo Morales came to an end \u2013 for now, at least \u2013 right where it started: in a steamy jungle region of central Bolivia. It was in El Chapare that Morales cut his teeth in the 1980s, helping organise his fellow coca farmers against US-backed efforts to eradicate the raw ingredient of cocaine. And it was here that he fled to last weekend, after resigning the presidency \u2013 at the prompting of Bolivia\u2019s top general \u2013 as deadly protests convulsed the country amid allegations of electoral fraud. Pictured lying atop a blanket on a safehouse floor, Morales fondly recalled his time as a local leader on Twitter. He had often promised to return and retire here. But late on Monday, Bolivia\u2019s longest-serving president instead boarded a Mexican government jet bound for exile. The intervening four decades form one of the more remarkable biographies of the modern era. It is a story that is idiosyncratically Bolivian, but reflects very Latin American currents of boom, bust and revolution \u2013 and speaks to a universal theme of power and its corrosive effects. Morales was born to a poor family of llama herders in 1959, at a time when indigenous people were doused with pesticides when entering government buildings. Twenty years later, he moved to Chapare where his activities as a trade unionist (and keen amateur footballer) saw Morales grow in stature and shrewdness. He overcame beatings, arrests, racist abuse and factional infighting to assume the leadership of the Movement for Socialism (Mas) \u2013 a broad bloc of miners, farmers and leftwing urbanites \u2013 and entered congress. He soon gained prominence at the head of a popular rebellion against moves to sell Bolivia\u2019s natural gas cheaply via neighbouring Chile \u2013 a historical enemy \u2013 to the United States. The so-called Gas War (2003-05) \u2013 in which the armed forces killed more than 60 people \u2013 fatally discredited the authorities, drawn from the same European-descended elites that had ruled Bolivia for centuries. Following the flight of one president and the resignation of another, Carlos Mesa, Morales swept to power in 2005 elections with over half of the national vote. Morales promised nothing less than a cosmic rebalancing. \u201cWe will end the colonial state and the neoliberal model,\u201d he vowed. \u201cFive hundred years of resistance by the indigenous peoples of America are over.\u201d Helped by a global boom in commodity prices, a partial nationalisation of oil and gas paid for generous social programmes that slashed poverty rates from 59% to 35%. South America\u2019s poorest country became its fastest-growing, averaging a 5% expansion every year for well over a decade. A reformed constitution made Bolivia a plurinational state, with official status given to 36 indigenous peoples and languages, and an Andean emblem of Technicolor pixels \u2013 the Wiphala \u2013 flown henceforth alongside the national tricolour. Coca cultivation was legalised and respect for Pachamama \u2013 the Andean earth mother \u2013 enshrined in the constitution. Morales \u201cushered in a new, more modern Bolivia that is more egalitarian, less racist, and more economically vibrant\u201d, said Diego von Vacano, a political scientist, likening the leader\u2019s early achievements to those of Nelson Mandela. Half of the national assembly were women, many of them indigenous, who wore jaguar skins and flowing pollera skirts with newfound pride. Morales quelled a separatist revolt by wealthier, lowland provinces. Every year he remained in power \u2013 returning with greater majorities in 2009 and 2014 \u2013 was an achievement of sorts, in a country famous for putsches, assassinations and revolutions. Abroad, Morales appeared with fellow \u201cpink tide\u201d leaders like Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil, lambasted North American imperialism and (unsuccessfully) sued Chile for access to the Pacific Ocean. At home, he incessantly toured in his presidential plane, pressing the flesh and cutting ribbons. His party trick, one Mas legislator recalled, was to identify individual hamlets from the air and recite from memory how his government had helped: a school here, a sports ground there. But this personalised element was, perhaps, the fatal weakness of his revolution. Morales disdained to groom a successor. A vast museum dedicated to Morales in his home town, and a towering government skyscraper in Bolivia\u2019s administrative capital of La Paz \u2013 complete with helipad and luxury presidential apartment \u2013 were criticised as expensive vanity projects. Morales backtracked on promises, seeking to drive a highway through the Tipnis indigenous reserve. He loosened environmental protections, contributing to manmade wildfires that scorched some 4 million hectares(15,500 sq miles) in 2019. Government inaction contributed to the disappearance of Lake Poop\u00f3, a vast inland sea. \u201cThe government of Evo Morales has been a profoundly rhetorical one, where he says things but doesn\u2019t do them,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Galindo, founder of the feminist collective Mujeres Creando, citing a failure to address domestic violence and femicide. \u201cIt\u2019s the same story with the rights of indigenous people and Mother Earth.\u201d A new constitution allowed Morales to run for a third term in 2014. For his fourth attempt, he first sought approval in a 2016 referendum, which was narrowly rejected. A year later, the constitutional court \u2013 its judges elected from a shortlist drawn up by the Mas-dominated legislature \u2013 ruled that term limits violated the president\u2019s human rights. The spark to this deeply combustible scenario came on election day, when a preliminary vote count was abruptly paused after its electricity, internet and phone access were cut. When the tallying resumed 24 hours later, Morales had surpassed the 10 percentage-point lead needed to defeat his rival, Mesa, in the first round. Election monitors from the Organization of American States (OAS) cried foul, citing \u201cclear manipulation\u201d of voting data, a hidden server, forged scrutineers\u2019 signatures and phantom votes. Sympathetic observers pointed to traditionally late-returning rural votes to explain the incongruities. Protests by traditional opponents in the eastern city of Santa Cruz were gradually joined by young, indigenous city dwellers. Violent clashes claimed at least 10 lives. Cornered, Morales made the biggest concessions of his career \u2013 first accepting a full OAS audit of the vote, then agreeing to fresh elections.

      "bodyText": "The phone calls began two months ago from an unknown number. Hilmy Ahmed, the vice-president of the Sri Lanka Muslim Council, did not recognise the voice but there was no mistaking the threats: throw your support behind Gotabaya Rajapaksa for president or we will set fire to your house, rape your wife and then kill your family. \u201cThis election campaign has the whole Muslim community of Sri Lanka very scared,\u201d said Ahmed, who fled abroad after the calls and direct harassment of his staff. \u201cAlmost all the nationalist extremists have banded together behind Gotabaya Rajapaksa and should he win, we fear they will come out in full force with their racist, anti-Muslim agenda and attacks.\u201d On Saturday, voters in Sri Lanka\u2019s general election will choose between Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the brother of the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, running for theSLPP, the Sinhalese-Buddhist nationalist party, and Sajith Premadasa, a minister in the current United National party (UNP) government, to be their next president. The election, happening against a backdrop of some of the worst violence and political instability the country has faced since the end of the civil war a decade ago, could prove a decisive moment, with everything from human rights to sectarian harmony hanging in the balance. Most precarious of all is the place of Muslims in Sri Lankan society. On Easter Sunday this year, self-radicalised Islamist extremists carried out multiple bombings, killing 269 people in churches and hotels and shaking the foundations of the country, pitting communities who had lived harmoniously against each other. Since then, the lives of many Muslims have been thrown into turmoil. Some were attacked and shops and homes were destroyed by Sinhala Buddhist mobs, and some were arbitrarily arrested. Women were banned from wearing headscarves in public, and in July newspaper front pages carried the unsubstantiated story of a Muslim doctor who had allegedly sterilised 8,000 Sinhala Buddhist women without their knowledge. For many people who lost family in the Easter attacks, reconciliation with their Muslim neighbours seems impossible. Sitting in a starkly lit fast-food restaurant in Colombo, Gloriya George, 19, clutched her hands tightly as she recalled sitting in the pews of St Anthony\u2019s shrine as a bomb went off.

      "bodyText": "An American ambassador recalled by Donald Trump from Ukraine has told impeachment investigators she felt \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d by Trump\u2019s personal attacks on her, and that she was \u201camazed\u201d corrupt elements in Ukraine had found willing American partners to take her down. With Trump tweeting attacks on her even as she spoke, Marie Yovanovitch became the third witness in public impeachment hearings investigating whether Trump abused the powers of his office to serve his personal ends. After a relatively hushed outing by two career foreign service officers on Wednesday, the chilly, ornate and cavernous hearing room vibrated on Friday with dramatic and personal testimony by Yovanovitch, a widely respected anti-corruption advocate who has served six US administrations including four Republican presidents. A month and a half after the state department asked her to extend her three-year ambassadorship to Kiev for an additional year, Yovanovitch testified that she took a call from her superior at the state department that abruptly terminated her overseas careerin May. \u201cUltimately, he said the words that every foreign service officer understands: \u2018The president has lost confidence in you\u2019,\u201d Yovanovitch said, \u201cThat was a terrible thing to hear. After 33 years of service to our country, it was terrible.\u201d She was the first woman to deliver public testimony critical of the president in the impeachment hearings. As she spoke, Trump unloaded on Twitter, writing \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad\u201d and \u201cIt is the US president\u2019s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\u201d One of the most impassioned responses of the day came from Congressman Jim Himes, who said: \u201cI\u2019m angry that a woman like you would not just be dismissed but humiliated and attacked by a president of the United States \u2026 in language that would embarrass a mob boss.\u201d In a highly unusual scene for the halls of Congress, as the hearing ended, the public gallery, which had been mostly quiet all day, suddenly erupted in enthusiastic cheers and a standing ovation that lasted several seconds as she walked from the room. Just as the hearing began, Trump released a short transcript, in a seeming distraction stunt, of a congratulatory phone call from April that he had with the Ukrainian president. But the House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff methodically returned the spotlight \u2013 and the microphone \u2013 to Yovanovitch, who described a smear campaign against her that began in Ukraine and was aggressively taken up by Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal emissary; by Donald Trump Jr; and ultimately by the president himself. She explained how her removal as ambassador was the top priority of a former Ukrainian prosecutor general known for corrupt practices, Yuri Lutsenko, who happened to be in position to do a political favor for Trump. \u201cThe question before us is not whether Donald Trump could recall an American ambassador with a stellar reputation for fighting corruption in Ukraine, but why would he want to?\u201d Schiff said. \u201cGetting rid of Ambassador Yovanovitch helped set stage for an irregular channel that could pursue the two investigations that mattered so much to the president, the 2016 conspiracy theory, and most important, an investigation into the 2020 political opponent he apparently feared most, Joe Biden.\u201d Trump has denied wrongdoing. Lutsenko played a key role, in Ukraine and in the American media, in advancing damaging and baseless narratives about Biden, while promoting a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukrainians colluded against Trump in the 2016 election. Yovanovitch said that the United States had helped Ukraine make headway against corruption in recent years, but under Trump, the corrupt elements in Ukraine suddenly were empowered to the extent that they succeeded in removing a most inconvenient figure: her. \u201cWhen our anti-corruption efforts got in the way of a desire for profit or power, Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old, corrupt rules sought to remove me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them and, working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of a US Ambassador. \u201cHow could our system fail like this? How is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government?\u201d Yovanovitch was \u201cabsolutely shocked, and devastated, frankly\u201d to discover that Trump had singled her out in a July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, calling her \u201cbad news\u2019\u201d. Yovanovitch briefly told the committee about her family\u2019s refugee experience, fleeing the Soviet Union and then Nazi Germany to land in Canada, where Yovanovitch was born and lived till the age of three. Trump\u2019s defenders have pointed out that ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the president and he may recall whom he pleases. Ranking member Devin Nunes dismissed Yovanovitch\u2019s story as a mundane personnel matter. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what the ambassador is doing here today,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cThis seems more appropriate for the subcommittee for human resources of the foreign affairs committee if there\u2019s issues with employment.\u201d But the circumstances of the recall of Yovanovitch have undercut Republican claims that Trump\u2019s differences with state department officials could be put down to policy. On Twitter, Trump accused Yovanovitch of incompetence. \u201cShe started off in Somalia, how did that go?\u201d he wrote. In an astonishing moment of political theater, Schiff read the tweets to Yovanovitch in real time and asked her to reply. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have such powers,\u201d she said. \u201cNot in Mogadishu, Somalia, and other places.\u201d Asked how it felt to be personally attacked by the president, Yovanovitch said, \u201cthe effect is intimidating.\u201d Schiff replied: \u201cI want to let you know that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.\u201d The campaign against Yovanovitch was plainly visible to state department officials abroad and in Washington. Multiple officials, including deputy assistant secretary of state George Kent and Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to the secretary of state Mike Pompeo, urged the state department to issue a statement of support for Yovanovitch, but were rebuffed, the men have testified. Yovanovitch herself sought support from multiple state department figures, including one of the impeachment inquiry witnesses, undersecretary of state David Hale, who is schedule to testify next week. The campaign against her, and the failure of the state department to issue a statement backing her, damaged her ability to carry out her work, Yovanovitch testified.",

      "bodyText": "It is depressing to see Len McCluskey regurgitating the false notion that free movement across Europe has ushered in a regime of cheap labour and the undercutting of wages (Backlash as union chief calls for Labour to curb free movement, 14 November). This is factually incorrect as consistently demonstrated by researchers such as Jonathan Portes, and deeply insulting to all those European workers who have been contributing massively to our society \u2013 doctors, nurses, teachers, university researchers, social care staff, drivers, workers in the food, hospitality and building industries \u2013 people who have been paying more in taxes than they receive in benefits, hence contributing to the economy and in fact creating jobs and growth. I cannot believe that all the staff at McCluskey\u2019s disposal have not informed him of the objective facts about the impact of free movement. Hence his intervention is a wilful distortion of the situation, pandering to anti-immigrant ideology going back generations. The Labour party\u2019s manifesto team must honour the excellent conference motion on free movement and not give in to McCluskey\u2019s retrogade, populist rhetoric. Gideon Ben-Tovim Emeritus reader in sociology, University of Liverpool \u2022 Any Labour supporter drawing too simple a pragmatic message from Len McCluskey\u2019s remarks on immigration policy, conceding ground to working-class \u201ccommonsense concerns\u201d over migrants, should reflect on the recent experience of other European social-democratic parties following this path.

      "bodyText": "One of the biggest payday-style lenders to emerge in the wake of Wonga\u2019s demise has itself run into trouble, warning the stock market of tumbling profits and the risks to the business of a potential recession. Shares in Non-Standard Finance, which operates under the George Banco, Everyday Loans and Loans at Home brands \u2013 and charges interest of up to 732% \u2013 fell by 18% after the profit warning. NSF added that its finance chief, Nick Teunon, will stand down early next year. NSF was a former pick of the beleaguered fund manager Neil Woodford, who at one point had a 25% stake. The profit warning comes eight months after NSF made an audacious bid, backed by Woodford, for its much larger rival, Provident Financial. The bid was abandoned in June after a revolt by other shareholders, with the failed transaction reported to have cost NSF about \u00a310m in fees. NSF said the rate of \u201cdelinquency\u201d in its loan book \u2013 the number of borrowers who have fallen behind with payments \u2013 has remained broadly stable, but it was preparing for many more defaults, warning the economic outlook was worse than at any other time in the last decade. It has decided to dramatically raise its provisioning for loans potentially going sour. In a statement to the stock market, it said: \u201cDue to the increasingly uncertain macroeconomic outlook [and] the negative impact of previous downturns on performance, the board expects to increase the probability weighting of a stressed, or downside scenario. \u201cHaving increased the probability weighting earlier in the year from a rate of 10% in 2018, the board now expects to increase the rate to 50%.\u201d It also revised downwards the prospects for future growth. It warned that volumes at its Loans at Home doorstep lending business could contract by up to 5%, compared with previous forecasts of growth of 2% to 5% a year. In total, it said profits for 2019 will be 10-13% lower than the current consensus of analyst forecasts. NSF\u2019s profit warning comes just weeks after the collapse of QuickQuid, the UK\u2019s biggest payday lender, which left more than a million customers facing financial uncertainty. CashEuroNet UK, which operated the QuickQuid and On Stride brands, stopped lending in October after Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, was appointed as its administrator. The business failed a year after Wonga collapsed following a surge in customer compensation claims. Enova, the Chicago-based owner of CashEuroNet UK, decided to quit the UK after failing to reach agreement with the UK\u2019s financial ombudsman over how many customers it should compensate over past loans. In early November, CashEuroNet agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority to provide redress to almost 4,000 customers to the value of \u00a31.7m.",

Did he return with more determination to make the most of his talent?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tough one to answer. But I think I was driven by the idea of not letting anybody down. I can still let people down on the cricket field when it comes to skills and mistakes. There might be a point where you\u2019re not good enough anymore, or you go through a bad run of form.

Stokes showed astonishingly varied skills in two different formats \u2013 but his commitment was even more impressive than his imperious batting. Desire and grit, those very human feelings, were evident in almost every shot Stokes played. They were such authentic innings, rather than storybook miracles, because it did not look as if Stokes enjoyed the ferocious intensity with so much depending on him.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t enjoy it until it\u2019s over. Both the World Cup final and Headingley would\u2019ve been soul-destroying if we hadn\u2019t won them. It would\u2019ve been a dagger in the heart regardless of what I did. I could have walked off having scored 84 in the final. People would\u2019ve said: \u2018Oh, great knock,\u2019 but I wouldn\u2019t have cared. At Headingley, if I\u2019d got out for 120, people would\u2019ve again said: \u2018Unbelievable effort.\u2019 But it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if we\u2019d lost. People have asked me which means more \u2013 the final or Headingley. It\u2019s like choosing between two threes and a six. You can\u2019t. The only difference is that after the World Cup there was something to show for the efforts.\u201d</p> <p>Headingley was one of two England victories in a drawn series which meant Australia retained the Ashes. Stokes scored 135 not out and he and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/26/jack-leach-cult-hero-ashes-cricket\" title=\"\">Jack Leach, who was not out on 1 </a>, shared an unbroken 73-run partnership for the last wicket as England chased down 359. It was an incredible achievement. \u201cI might be able to say more clearly, in 20 years\u2019 time,\u201d Stokes says, \u201cbut right here, right now, I can\u2019t choose between the two.\u201d</p> <p>Stokes is <a href=\"https://www.headline.co.uk/titles/ben-stokes/on-fire/9781472271266/\" title=\"\">doing this interview to publicise a new book </a>about his role in \u201cEngland\u2019s summer to remember\u201d, which is at its most interesting when it reveals snippets of the vulnerability beneath the miracle-man persona. After England lost World Cup games to Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia, they had to beat India and New Zealand in their last two group matches to reach the semi-finals. Stokes admits that, \u201cI was certainly feeling the strain and I told David Young, our team psychologist, as much as after he invited me for a coffee. He said, \u2018How are things, Ben?\u2019 I told him, \u2018I\u2019m nervous\u2019 and opened up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a722cb2a070f01ef335e3d31346e3af711ce335f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a722cb2a070f01ef335e3d31346e3af711ce335f/0_0_3819_2292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Root and Ben Stokes celebrate winning the World Cup final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Root and Ben Stokes celebrate winning the World Cup final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Young was so struck by Stokes\u2019s honesty he asked him to share his doubts and fears with the squad. Stokes stood up and rather than adopt the usual line about being ready for battle he told his teammates: \u201cI am nervous, I am anxious, I am worrying about what happens if we don\u2019t win. Believe me, I am worried.\u201d In showing his apprehension Stokes was able to normalise these emotions for everyone else.</p> <p>\u201cAs professional sportsmen at the top of the game we do have worries,\u201d he says. \u201cWe do think of the worst and that\u2019s absolutely fine. There\u2019s no weakness in feeling like that. That was such a crucial thing \u2013 for us all to sit down as a team and discuss. People started to open up. Once they vented their feelings it made everyone feel a lot better because, sometimes, you can feel as if you\u2019re the only person thinking that way. But if you don\u2019t get nervous you\u2019re probably telling a little white lie.\u201d</p> <p>Stokes had suffered doubts before, on a tour of the West Indies when, as he says: \u201cI was scared of getting out. After I eventually spoke about it to Alastair Cook I went out and played the best I had in a long time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence.\u201d</p> <p>This summer, before the fourth Ashes Test, Jos Buttler confided his own insecurities about his Test match batting to Stokes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for it really,\u201d Stokes admits. \u201cBut he just asked me straight out and we discussed my experiences in the West Indies. Once Jos addressed it, he then showed in that Manchester game and the last match what he\u2019s capable of as a Test batsman. Again, it\u2019s no coincidence that it followed letting out those emotions to someone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he was a teenager making his debut for Cumbria, Stokes vomited with nerves the day before. Confronting those fears, and then harnessing his emotions more positively, seems central to his game. \u201cEmbracing it as well. Embracing the fact that fear is natural. I haven\u2019t come close to spewing up the day before a game since then. Sometimes you feel fine. You might have a day when you feel awful about what\u2019s going to happen in the game. It ebbs and flows. Just embrace it.\u201d</p> <p>Over the last year, in both one-day and Test cricket, Stokes has resolved to turn an eye-catching 30 or 40 into an innings of greater substance. He has curbed some of his fiery instincts to ensure he is still there at the death. At Headingley he came out to bat when England were still 218 runs short and three wickets down. Stokes, the IPL masterblaster, played with Boycott-esque caution. It took him 67 balls to score three runs and his half-century, when it finally came the following morning, was the slowest he had scored. Stokes\u2019s discipline and restraint were both agonising and moving. Was it also framed by guilt \u2013 sparked less by Bristol than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/23/josh-hazlewood-australia-england-ashes-psychological-scars-headingley\" title=\"\">the poor shot he had played in the first innings when England were bowled out for 67 </a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the worst shot of my career,\u201d Stokes exclaims with a grimacing laugh. \u201cThere you go.\u201d</p> <p>Is that why he pummelled himself so hard in the Australian second innings, bowling an unbroken spell of 16 overs? \u201cI\u2019ve bowled long spells before in Test matches. Those moments when you are behind in the game like we were \u2013 moments where you want to be seen to be working hard and not just letting them cruise to a total. Someone said it\u2019s a sign to the opposition that, \u2018We ain\u2019t giving in here even though you\u2019re miles ahead.\u2019 I got into a rhythm where Joe [Root] just kept asking me \u2018One more?\u2019 I was like: \u2018Yeah.\u2019 One more? Yeah. I was about to stop but Jofra [Archer] got cramp and I said: \u2018I\u2019m good to go. Just gimme the ball.\u2019 The first five overs are generally the hardest. But you get to a point and everything just feels fresh, and you can bowl all day. Still, at the end of the day you feel like \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Stokes imitates a decrepit old man. \u201cI was thinking clearly again when I went out to bat. I finished the third day on two not out after 50-odd balls. If I was going to get out it needed a good ball to dismiss me. Time wasn\u2019t an issue so I was ready to defend everything Australia threw at me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b549f5ca95f24e2e74938569b47f05af7d68e569\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b549f5ca95f24e2e74938569b47f05af7d68e569/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Stokes and Jack Leach celebrate after their last-wicket stand led to victory at Headingley against Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Stokes and Jack Leach celebrate after their last-wicket stand led to victory at Headingley against Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/27/troubled-ben-stokes-summer-ashes-headingley-hero-england\" title=\"\">still required a mammoth individual effort </a>to win the match and he and Leach produced one of the most famous last-wicket partnerships in Test history.

I said: \u2018I\u2019m going to take all the deliveries here and you keep \u2019em out for one ball of the over if you have to.\u2019 He knew exactly what he had to do, which was just to survive.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t watch when Jack was facing \u2013 and that wasn\u2019t through not trusting him. It was because when I wasn\u2019t on strike I couldn\u2019t do anything. I was helpless. That\u2019s probably the most emotion you\u2019d see from me. When I\u2019m on strike I\u2019m just [Stokes makes a deadpan face]. But when Leachy is on strike I\u2019m just head down. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever forget sharing those moments on the field together. We bought the painting of it at the PCA [Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association] dinner because that\u2019s one of the most special things you can ever share with a teammate.\u201d</p> <p>Even more than the glory it seems as if Stokes<strong> </strong>was motivated by a quest to win back the vice-captaincy. In his book he reveals how he sent a text to Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, in which he pleaded to be allowed to become vice-captain again. Stokes is clearly a leader in the England camp but it\u2019s significant he craved the legitimacy of a formal role being given back to him. Perhaps it is one more way of closing the chapter on the Bristol case.</p> <p>\u201cI never voiced anything of importance at the ECB before,\u201d Stokes, who was reappointed in July, says. \u201cBut this mattered to me and so I just did it. When Joe got appointed captain I got appointed vice-captain. Being in a role like that is [he puffs out his cheeks to convey the magnitude to him]. You never imagine when you start playing you\u2019re going to be in such a high role. Vice-captain can sound like it doesn\u2019t mean anything. But honestly, I was so proud to be vice-captain of this team. When it got taken away from me, which was completely understandable, I was like: \u2018I really want this back.\u2019 I felt like Joe needed me too. I\u2019m not being arrogant \u2013 we work so well together. We\u2019re such good friends.\u2019</p> <p>In the book, it sounds as if Root had also been campaigning for Stokes to return as his deputy. \u201cYeah, he had been.\u201d</p> <p>Stokes believes he can lighten the load on Root \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/09/captaincy-robbing-england-of-joe-root-greatest-asset\" title=\"\">who sometimes seemed weighed down by the burdens of captaincy during the Ashes </a>. \u201cYeah. Massively. If everything goes smoothly, and you win everything, it\u2019s only going to last for a certain amount of time before things start going against you. And Joe is a young captain. He\u2019s still got so many years ahead of him. He\u2019s going to learn from everything this summer. That\u2019s only going to help him become a better captain.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe whole redemption thing?\u201dBen Stokes says as he raises an eyebrow on a quiet morning at Lord\u2019s. He does not look convinced as all the intensity and the glory of the summer has long since drained away. Stokes helped England win the World Cup amid wild drama in July and then produced the most extraordinary comeback win in the history of the Ashes at Headingley six weeks later. Less than a year earlier he had been cleared of affray in Bristol\u2019s crown court after an altercation outside a nightclub in September 2017 cost him the England vice-captaincy, his place on the last Ashes tour and threatened his freedom and career. He shrugs and smiles in a way which shows that his pride is still streaked with hurt. \u201cPeople have tried to label this as Ben\u2019s redemption summer,\u201d he suggests, slipping into the third person for the only time in our hour together. \u201cI don\u2019t see it like that at all. I see it as me going out and trying to do as well as I possibly can to help England win games.\u201d He relaxes a little and unfolds his arms when I tell him about a conversation I had with Alastair Cook , his close friend and former England captain. Cook, who rarely makes any outrageous claims, stressed that Stokes was the most selfless teammate he had played alongside. He also suggested that, once he was acquitted, Stokes worked harder than ever as a cricketer. \u201cI think when you know what might happen,\u201d Stokes says with a nod, before pausing as memories of Bristol return. \u201cObviously there were points throughout that whole thing when we weren\u2019t sure what was going to happen.\u201d His voice trails away. Did he return with more determination to make the most of his talent? \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one to answer. But I think I was driven by the idea of not letting anybody down. I can still let people down on the cricket field when it comes to skills and mistakes. There might be a point where you\u2019re not good enough anymore, or you go through a bad run of form. But if something happened in the game which affected the result and it was down to my fitness or concentration? That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to avoid.\u201d The World Cup final and Headingley were excruciatingly tense. Stokes showed astonishingly varied skills in two different formats \u2013 but his commitment was even more impressive than his imperious batting. Desire and grit, those very human feelings, were evident in almost every shot Stokes played. They were such authentic innings, rather than storybook miracles, because it did not look as if Stokes enjoyed the ferocious intensity with so much depending on him. \u201cYou can\u2019t enjoy it until it\u2019s over. Both the World Cup final and Headingley would\u2019ve been soul-destroying if we hadn\u2019t won them. It would\u2019ve been a dagger in the heart regardless of what I did. I could have walked off having scored 84 in the final. People would\u2019ve said: \u2018Oh, great knock,\u2019 but I wouldn\u2019t have cared. At Headingley, if I\u2019d got out for 120, people would\u2019ve again said: \u2018Unbelievable effort.\u2019 But it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if we\u2019d lost. People have asked me which means more \u2013 the final or Headingley. It\u2019s like choosing between two threes and a six. You can\u2019t. The only difference is that after the World Cup there was something to show for the efforts.\u201d Headingley was one of two England victories in a drawn series which meant Australia retained the Ashes. Stokes scored 135 not out and he and Jack Leach, who was not out on 1 , shared an unbroken 73-run partnership for the last wicket as England chased down 359. It was an incredible achievement. \u201cI might be able to say more clearly, in 20 years\u2019 time,\u201d Stokes says, \u201cbut right here, right now, I can\u2019t choose between the two.\u201d Stokes is doing this interview to publicise a new book about his role in \u201cEngland\u2019s summer to remember\u201d, which is at its most interesting when it reveals snippets of the vulnerability beneath the miracle-man persona. After England lost World Cup games to Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia, they had to beat India and New Zealand in their last two group matches to reach the semi-finals. Stokes admits that, \u201cI was certainly feeling the strain and I told David Young, our team psychologist, as much as after he invited me for a coffee. He said, \u2018How are things, Ben?\u2019 I told him, \u2018I\u2019m nervous\u2019 and opened up.\u201d Young was so struck by Stokes\u2019s honesty he asked him to share his doubts and fears with the squad. Stokes stood up and rather than adopt the usual line about being ready for battle he told his teammates: \u201cI am nervous, I am anxious, I am worrying about what happens if we don\u2019t win. Believe me, I am worried.\u201d In showing his apprehension Stokes was able to normalise these emotions for everyone else. \u201cAs professional sportsmen at the top of the game we do have worries,\u201d he says. \u201cWe do think of the worst and that\u2019s absolutely fine.

It <em>is</em> big.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/14/spanish-state-tv-shuns-super-cup-in-saudi-arabia-over-human-rights-fears\">Spanish state TV shuns Super Cup in Saudi Arabia over human rights fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNo, never,\u201d Vega says.</p> <p>Vega is a Chilean footballer who was once approached by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid but is now a freestyler in Cirque du Soleil\u2019s show dedicated to Leo Messi. Born in Catalonia, Losada \u2013 like Messi \u2013 is captain of FC Barcelona, the club where she began and to which she returned three times, having played in the US and at Arsenal. She\u2019ll be sitting in these seats again soon, a spectator. Vega will be down there, a performer with ball at her feet. At her feet, head, thigh, shoulder, chest. Ear, too. The lights will be on her, pressure too.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first contract I\u2019ve had out of university. So, it was \u2026 \u201d Vega blows out her cheeks. \u201cThe first three shows, I felt nerves, here,\u201d she says, pointing at her stomach. \u201cBut I\u2019m lucky: because it\u2019s a football theme, you can jump and shout, which gets it all out. I don\u2019t hold back, then I\u2019m better. Now, 12 shows in, I feel more in control, more empowered.\u201d</p> <p>Empowered. Maybe that\u2019s the word, somewhere to start a football conversation between these two women who have lived for it and made a living from it. The excuse is Messi, who has inspired them both, although Losada had posters of Pep Guardiola as a kid and Vega, a full-back before, watched Dani Alves \u2013 a \u201cfighter\u201d she admired and \u201caspired to be like\u201d \u2013 and talks of the impact <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/07/womens-world-cup-final-report-usa-netherlands\" title=\"\">of the USA women\u2019s team</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"738331e813f4f969fd8834d2ea09d5eb4ae8be28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/738331e813f4f969fd8834d2ea09d5eb4ae8be28/0_338_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catalina Vega\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catalina Vega is on her first contract since leaving university and is starring for the Cirque du Soleil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Messi10 by Cirque du Soleil</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Losada\u2019s first coach in the first team, Xavi Llorens, was Messi\u2019s first too, aged 13. And Vega notes that when she visited the Camp Nou, Losada\u2019s picture was there alongside the Argentinian\u2019s. \u201cAnd that changes things,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Vega\u2019s aim in Barcelona, where the show runs until 4 January, is to express Messi\u2019s career through performance. \u201cIn fact,\u201d she says, \u201cthere are things we can\u2019t do because we have to project his values: you can\u2019t be boasting.\u201d Losada grins, and names another player for whom it might be different. \u201cThe show\u2019s called Messi, so we\u2019re careful,\u201d Vega says. \u201cTo do a show about him, a portrait, was hard. We wanted to project our art and his art, what he means to people. At the end, his name\u2019s chanted, the audience join in. It\u2019s powerful.\u201d</p> <p>It goes beyond Messi, of course. If it\u2019s about inspiration, it shouldn\u2019t be about imitation, they argue. \u201cFootball\u2019s a way of life,\u201d Losada says. \u201cAll the more so now I\u2019m a professional, which I never thought possible.\u201d Vega takes up the theme: \u201cWhen I started, it was enjoyment, not an income. I also knew any opportunities would be outside Chile. There, even now, only one or two teams pay salaries. But we women do it for love, passion, because we love football.\u201d</p> <p>On the way in, Losada hears that Spain\u2019s female footballers have voted to strike over salaries. Now she adds: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so different in Spain until a few years ago. When I went to the US and England, then came back here, I realised things had changed. It was \u2018just\u2019 a passion before, now it\u2019s a profession too. But there are still many teams where girls don\u2019t earn salaries proportionate to their work. It\u2019s still <em>sobrevivir, no vivir</em>: a salary to survive on, not to live on.\u201d</p> <p>Is it still fun, being professional? \u201cIt\u2019s very different, but yes,\u201d Losada says. \u201c<em>Very</em> different,\u201d Vega laughs. \u201cI\u2019m the only Chilean to have the chance to get where I am [financially]. And this is different to football itself: more visual, more artistic.\u201d More circus than football? \u201cNo, more football. That someone pays you for [freestyling], when many players pay their own way and clubs can\u2019t generate money, makes me feel fortunate. But women\u2019s football is growing. We\u2019re fighters, warriors, so of course it is \u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c7f24ee576aaed25868361fa8862933c95c9cea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c7f24ee576aaed25868361fa8862933c95c9cea/0_89_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Messi10 runs until 4 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Messi10 runs until 4 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Llu\u00eds Gen\u00e9/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou have to be,\u201d Losada says. \u201cBut people are supporting us now. If you put a game on the telly and no one watches it, they won\u2019t put it on again, but now people are watching. In Spain, we have so many female sportswomen who are the best \u2013 water polo, gymnastics, basketball \u2013 who\u2019ve been world champions and no one knows them, they\u2019re not making half the money we are, because we\u2019re a country that\u2019s football, football, football \u2026 we\u2019re lucky. So, we have to be grateful.\u201d</p> <p>Not that it reaches the levels of the men\u2019s game. \u201cUltimately, that\u2019s an aspiration, but honestly: [in the men\u2019s game], anyone costs \u20ac100m and no one\u2019s looking at their real quality; very few are worth that, but that\u2019s the market,\u201d Vega says. Losada adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a business and you see amounts that are embarrassing, almost shocking. The market is what it is, though. I wouldn\u2019t like to compare myself with them; of course, we\u2019d like to earn more but I\u2019d like sportswomen [from other sports] to earn a quarter what we do. They deserve it, probably more than us, given their history.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c[Male] idols get projected on to kids,\u201d Vega says. \u201cBut it\u2019s better to take the values that inspire Messi [than Messi himself] to inspire the kid to be <em>their</em> best version. They can\u2019t be a Michael Phelps, a Usain Bolt. No, be the person you are, fight for your own dreams. Of course, inspiration is there, motivation, but it doesn\u2019t need to carry a player\u2019s name. Simone Biles said it: people put other gymnasts\u2019 names on her but it\u2019s her, Simone Biles, who does it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFans look to project a Messi on to a [female] player,\u201d Vega continues. \u201cThere\u2019s a desire to project male qualities on to women players too, instead of identifying them with their own playing style. People talk about physique but we have as much fight. My dad never projected on to me, he just watched me play. My brother\u2019s terrible; he can barely kick it. I swear. He went in goal because he was bad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c399ca3a45b8cf1fbb773a98d1a28ac7a2a63573\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c399ca3a45b8cf1fbb773a98d1a28ac7a2a63573/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vicky Losada and Catalina Vega sense change is happening in women\u2019s football and sport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vicky Losada and Catalina Vega sense change is happening in women\u2019s football and sport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xavi Torrent/Getty Images for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Slowly, things change.

We have to change education, culture, and sport is the best way. Last year, it was mostly girls again. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have, but I called the parents and warned them. This time, they said, \u2018no problem, the boys know.\u2019 And the boys had the same relationship with girls as I saw in the US. A few years ago, that was unthinkable here.

      "bodyText": "The South Yorkshire police officer who commanded the 1989 FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough had \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d for safety and the \u201cterrible mistakes\u201d and failures that led to 96 people being killed in a crush, the jury at his manslaughter trial has been told. David Duckenfield was a recently appointed chief superintendent, the senior officer in charge of safety at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough ground, and it was not \u201cunfair\u201d to single him out to be charged, said Richard Matthews QC, prosecuting. Setting out the case against Duckenfield in his closing speech at Preston crown court, Matthews alleged the multiple breaches of his duty of care to spectators, as the police match commander, satisfied the legal definition of \u201cgross\u201d negligence explained to the jury by the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw. \u201cSo truly and exceptionally bad, so blameworthy, so reprehensible, and so deserving of punishment, that it deserves to be marked by conviction of the serious crime of manslaughter,\u201d he said. Matthews referred the jury to evidence Duckenfield gave in 2015 at the new inquests into the 96 deaths, in response to questioning by Paul Greaney QC, who represented the Police Federation. Duckenfield accepted that after he ordered an exit gate, C, to be opened, to alleviate crushing at the Leppings Lane turnstiles by allowing a large number of people quickly into that end of the football ground, he failed to recognise the need to direct people away from a tunnel leading to the crowded central \u201cpens\u201d of the terrace. \u201cThat failure was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 persons in the Hillsborough tragedy?\u201d Greaney asked him. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Duckenfield replied. Matthews also told the jury that a \u201clie\u201d that he said Duckenfield had admitted telling at 3.15pm on the day of the disaster, 15 April 1989, showed he already realised then that he bore \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d for what had happened. When the Football Association\u2019s chief executive, Graham Kelly, went to the police control box to ask what had happened, Duckenfield did not tell him that he had ordered the exit gate to be opened, and told him that Liverpool supporters had \u201cforced\u201d a gate open and there had been an \u201cinrush\u201d. Matthews said: \u201cWhat the prosecution invite you to consider is the inference \u2026 that Mr Duckenfield had realised his personal responsibility for what had happened and that\u2019s why he did not volunteer that he had ordered the opening of the gates.\u201d The indictment of Duckenfield, who is charged with gross negligence manslaughter relating to 95 of the people killed by the crush in the central pens, accuses him of failing to exercise reasonable care at five different stages leading to the disaster. He failed to identify \u201cconfining points and hazards\u201d on the approach to the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end allocated for all 24,000 people with tickets to support Liverpool, the indictment alleges; to monitor the number of people yet to enter through the turnstiles as the crowd built up outside; to take action to relieve those crowding pressures; to monitor the numbers of people in the central pens, and \u201cin good time, to prevent crushing to persons in pens 3 and 4 by the flow of spectators through the central tunnel\u201d. Matthews said that if it had been unfair in law for Duckenfield to be prosecuted, the case would not have been allowed to go ahead. \u201cThere is no unfairness in accepting others were at fault by singling Mr Duckenfield out in respect of his failures and mistakes,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cWhy? Because those failures and mistakes were in breach of his personal responsibility.\u201d Benjamin Myers QC, defending Duckenfield, began his closing speech by describing the prosecution as \u201cshamefully, bitterly and deeply unfair\u201d.

      "body": "<p>A bestselling author\u2019s decision to respond to a recent graduate who criticised her books in a local newspaper has seen the graduate bombarded with online abuse and her university apologise for her comments.</p> <p>YA author Sarah Dessen retweeted a story <a href=\"https://www.aberdeennews.com/news/common-read-hits-years-at-northern/article_058790e6-00ab-11ea-9449-5bac5966e4b6.html\">from South Dakota\u2019s Aberdeen News</a> to her 268,700 Twitter followers in which the graduate, Brooke Nelson, spoke about joining a committee at Northern State University to help choose a book that new students would be required to read on its Common Read course. Nelson said she had joined specifically to speak out against Dessen\u2019s novels being included.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine for teen girls,\u201d Nelson was quoted as saying. \u201cBut definitely not up to the level of Common Read. So I became involved simply so I could stop them from ever choosing Sarah Dessen.\u201d</p> <p>Dessen shared a screenshot of the comments with Nelson\u2019s name obscured. \u201cAuthors are real people,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe put our heart and soul into the stories we write often because it is literally how we survive in this world. I\u2019m having a really hard time right now and this is just mean and cruel. I hope it made you feel good.\u201d</p> <p>Dessen quickly drew the support of other authors including Angie Thomas, Roxane Gay, Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Weiner, who all shared their responses on Twitter.</p> <p>Picoult wrote: \u201cNot only does it suck because Sarah Dessen is one of the loveliest women you\u2019ll ever meet [but also because] this suggests stories about young women matter less. That they are not as worthy or literary as those about anything but young women.\u201d Weiner called the comment \u201ccatty and cruel \u2026 [it] carries on the proud tradition of denigrating any and all things that give young women pleasure\u201d.</p> <p>The Northern State University apologised to Dessen, saying that Nelson\u2019s views \u201cdo not reflect the views of the university\u201d, and that \u201cwe love young adult novels, and we appreciate [their] broad-ranging impact\u201d. The journalist behind the original story, Katherine Grandstrand, also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kgrandstrandAAN/status/1194307799385300998?s=20\">tweeted an apology</a>: \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t mean to be cruel by including this quote. I am so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>But Nelson, whose name was soon found by those who searched for the story, told the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/15/sarah-dessen-south-dakota-college-student-ya-novel-backlash-twitter/\">Washington Post</a> that her quote was taken out of context and that after sustained attacks on social media she had deactivated her Facebook and Twitter accounts.</p> <p>Nelson, who graduated in 2017, had one vote on the committee choosing the next title for students. She said she had argued instead for Bryan Stevenson\u2019s memoir about being a black man wrongly sentenced to death, Just Mercy, as well as Edwidge Danticat\u2019s Breath, Eyes, Memory, and Paul Kalanithi\u2019s When Breath Becomes Air. Stevenson\u2019s book was eventually chosen.</p> <p>\u201cThese three books are beautifully written and push readers to stand against the racial inequality that the judicial system perpetuates, to consider the heritability and influence of tradition and trauma, and to contemplate what brings meaning to one\u2019s life,\u201d she told the Post, adding: \u201cIf anything comes out of this larger conversation, I hope it is that others will make it a point to read books like [Just Mercy] that push them beyond their usual perspective and challenge their assumptions of society.\u201d</p> <p>Dessen\u2019s response sparked a backlash from readers and journalists, who criticised all the authors involved for using large platforms to complain about one reader\u2019s opinion without seeming to consider the abuse she would receive from their fans.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryKelly/status/1194737527556583425?s=20\">Journalist Hillary Kelly</a> tweeted: \u201cVery strange to watch a host of female authors pile on to show love to Sarah Dessen after Dessen threw a public hissy fit b/c [Nelson] offered some tepid criticism of her work. You are novelists. Facing (valid) criticism is part of the job.\u201d</p> <p>Gay, who had supported Dessen, denounced the harassment Nelson received. \u201cI thought she was anonymous,\u201d she told the Post. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be harassing her. That\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d</p>",

Picoult wrote: \u201cNot only does it suck because Sarah Dessen is one of the loveliest women you\u2019ll ever meet [but also because] this suggests stories about young women matter less. That they are not as worthy or literary as those about anything but young women.\u201d Weiner called the comment \u201ccatty and cruel \u2026 [it] carries on the proud tradition of denigrating any and all things that give young women pleasure\u201d. The Northern State University apologised to Dessen, saying that Nelson\u2019s views \u201cdo not reflect the views of the university\u201d, and that \u201cwe love young adult novels, and we appreciate [their] broad-ranging impact\u201d. The journalist behind the original story, Katherine Grandstrand, also tweeted an apology: \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t mean to be cruel by including this quote. I am so sorry.\u201d But Nelson, whose name was soon found by those who searched for the story, told the Washington Post that her quote was taken out of context and that after sustained attacks on social media she had deactivated her Facebook and Twitter accounts. Nelson, who graduated in 2017, had one vote on the committee choosing the next title for students. She said she had argued instead for Bryan Stevenson\u2019s memoir about being a black man wrongly sentenced to death, Just Mercy, as well as Edwidge Danticat\u2019s Breath, Eyes, Memory, and Paul Kalanithi\u2019s When Breath Becomes Air. Stevenson\u2019s book was eventually chosen. \u201cThese three books are beautifully written and push readers to stand against the racial inequality that the judicial system perpetuates, to consider the heritability and influence of tradition and trauma, and to contemplate what brings meaning to one\u2019s life,\u201d she told the Post, adding: \u201cIf anything comes out of this larger conversation, I hope it is that others will make it a point to read books like [Just Mercy] that push them beyond their usual perspective and challenge their assumptions of society.\u201d Dessen\u2019s response sparked a backlash from readers and journalists, who criticised all the authors involved for using large platforms to complain about one reader\u2019s opinion without seeming to consider the abuse she would receive from their fans. Journalist Hillary Kelly tweeted: \u201cVery strange to watch a host of female authors pile on to show love to Sarah Dessen after Dessen threw a public hissy fit b/c [Nelson] offered some tepid criticism of her work. You are novelists. Facing (valid) criticism is part of the job.\u201d Gay, who had supported Dessen, denounced the harassment Nelson received. \u201cI thought she was anonymous,\u201d she told the Post. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be harassing her. That\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d",

Unlike the western Weald, sliced by the A23, gouged by Gatwick and carpeted with commuters\u2019 suburbia, its other half south of Tunbridge Wells is somehow under the radar, spurned by today\u2019s escapees for more fashionable spots such as Hastings. What a treat they\u2019re missing, this area of outstanding natural beauty, without any big moves but instead gazillion square miles of deeply English landscape: wooded hills, duck ponds, oast houses and tile-hung villages, as if art-directed for Country Life. Kipling country. The case against Conservative with a small c, though you can find edgier spots deep in its folds. Not cheap, though mildly cheaper than many other places hereabouts. Well connected? Trains: just over an hour to London Charing Cross from Wadhurst or Stonegate; 1hr 20 mins from Robertsbridge; 35 mins the other way to Hastings; Crowborough to the west is an hour and nine mins to London Bridge. Driving: the A21 can get cloggy at weekends and holidays, but generally it\u2019s 25 mins to Tunbridge Wells, 35 mins to Hastings, 45 mins to the M25. Schools Primaries: pretty much all \u201cgood\u201d, Ofsted says, with Burwash CE, Maynards Green, Parkside, Netherfield and Goudhurst &amp; Kilndown CofE \u201coutstanding\u201d. Secondaries: Heathfield, Uplands and Robertsbridge are all \u201cgood\u201d and Cranbrook \u201coutstanding\u201d. Hang out at\u2026 You won\u2019t want for idyllic country pubs, such as the Bell at Ticehurst, the Salehurst Halt, or the George in Robertsbridge. The Small Holding, at Kilndown, is the local gastronauts\u2019 darling. Where to buy Pick a magical old village or market town: Ticehurst, Burwash, Mayfield, Northiam, Rolvenden, Goudhurst, Cranbrook. They\u2019re all studded with historic cottages and townhouses, with huge piles, farms, barns and oast houses out in the country. A smattering of Victorian, Edwardian and 20th century. Fabulous stuff. A slight rise in prices towards the railway and A21. Large detacheds and townhouses, \u00a3600,000-\u00a31.5m, and up to \u00a34m for vast piles. Detacheds and smaller townhouses, \u00a3375,000-\u00a3600,000. Semis, \u00a3250,000-\u00a3900,000. Terraces and cottages, \u00a3175,000-\u00a3450,000. Flats, \u00a3100,000-\u00a3700,000. Rentals: not much. A one-bed flat, \u00a3500-\u00a3800pcm; a three-bed house, \u00a3800-\u00a32,000pcm. Bargain of the week Want a project? A huge four-bed detached near Burwash, with three acres, barn and outbuildings, in need of refurbishment, \u00a3750,000, with freemanforman.co.uk. From the streets Richard Sutton-Smith \u201cEven its dyed-in-the-wool blueness can\u2019t detract from the area\u2019s beauty.\u201d Philippa King \u201cTicehurst is a buzzing village: you won\u2019t find any empty shops, charity shops or estate agents here.\u201d \u2022 Live in eastern High Weald?

The boundless tangle of nature has no chance against the iron edge of human violence.</p> <p>This menacing tool materialises repeatedly in a series of new paintings called Der Gordische Knoten, the Gordian knot in ancient legend, whose unpickable entanglement Alexander the Great simply cut through. That word \u201cpainting\u201d may conjure up an image of something flat and framed. But the axes in these artworks are real \u2013 and so are the sticks and twigs that poke out of matted, cracked surfaces. In the biggest of the Gordian Knot cycle, golden waves of wheat, blown in the breeze, are arrayed like a flowing frieze of abundance.

Kiefer uses perspective, the Renaissance technique of showing the real world shrinking towards a single vanishing point, to define his landscapes \u2013 but the perspective view is a transparency on top of a muddy tumult of colour and texture, with real, 3D stuff stuck over that in turn.

The work, which has been at venues including Salisbury Cathedral and the British Museum, is expected to be popular. Without a barrier between the public and the figures, anything could happen. But Shaw is optimistic. \u201cApparently kids behave the best,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the time they come up close and just lie down and look across them. Kids are great \u2026 it\u2019s the adults.\u201d \u2022 Antony Gormley: Field for the British Isles, is at Firstsite in Colchester, 15 November-8 March",

      "body": "<p>The first week of campaigning is behind us and the shape of the election is emerging. The critical questions for the next four weeks and beyond are becoming clearer. Among these is whether this election will accelerate a realignment of British politics based on where voters stand on Brexit. The idea that <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lets-welcome-the-death-of-the-political-tribe-53vn2656c\" title=\"\">old political tribes are dying</a> has taken hold and increasingly commentators look to the cultural polarisation seen in the US as the trajectory we are following. But, as we\u2019ve learned over the past five years, things are rarely that simple in British politics. The general election <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/11/07/which-issues-will-decide-general-election\" title=\"\">is about much more</a> than just Brexit: a winter election brings different factors to the front, not least the potential for disruptive weather events, such as the devastating flooding experienced by parts of Yorkshire and Derbyshire last weekend, and the additional strains on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/14/ae-waiting-times-in-england-hit-worst-ever-level\" title=\"\">stretched NHS</a>.</p> <p>Despite the apparent strength of newly forged Brexit identities, they are of little use in understanding how people might react politically to other factors; they simply do not allow us to read off a person\u2019s political views across a range of issues.</p> <p>The 2017 election saw the highest two-party share of the vote for three decades. The electorate in England was largely sorted between the Conservatives and Labour, but there are important groups within each cohort who are not aligned with their parties\u2019 respective positions on Brexit.

Among Labour party voters in 2017, about three in 10 voted leave. We have heard a lot about them over the past three years. They are left-leaning voters who are socially conservative and who had been <a href=\"http://www.renewal.org.uk/articles/the-fragmentation-of-the-electoral-left-since-2010\" title=\"\">falling out of love</a> with Labour for some time. More will be written about them in the weeks to come. But there is another group of voters who are also \u201ccross-pressured\u201d in the same way and are perhaps even more cast adrift by their party in recent months: among those who voted Conservative in 2017 a similar three in 10 voted to remain in the European Union. We have heard less about this group, but they could also be key to the parties\u2019 fortunes.</p> <p>Who are they, and will they still vote for a Conservative party that has moved further away from their position over the past three months?

Here, those intending to vote Conservative among this group outnumber those intending to vote Liberal Democrat by more than two to one.

Polling this week <a href=\"https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2019/11/election-priorities-best-pm-preferred-government-trust-on-the-economy-best-party-on-brexit-introducing-my-general-election-dashboard/\" title=\"\">suggests</a> that Tory remainers are also less certain in their intention to vote Conservative than Conservative leave voters are, or than Labour remain voters are to vote Labour.</p> <p>Two things stand out about the identities and values of this group.

They are also the most \u201crightwing\u201d or economically liberal group of voters in terms of their views on nationalisation, trade union power and taxation. These economic values make this group especially hostile to the Labour party, and \u201cfearful\u201d of a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government.

But what the Conservatives are banking on to ensure they hold on to seats such as Putney, south-west London, where the estimated remain vote was more than 70%, is that these voters will be too concerned about a Corbyn-led government, even a minority one, to \u201crisk\u201d a vote for the Liberal Democrats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/tory-scaremongering-immigration-liberal-policy\">The Tories\u2019 \u2018fake\u2019 Labour migration numbers are hiding the demise of their own foolish policy | Jonathan Portes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Might this change during the campaign? Critical to this will be the expectations people have about what the outcome of the election will be. If Tory remainers expect the result to be close, or if there is even a hint of a hung parliament in the polling, they are likely to be spooked back to the Conservatives at the prospect of Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. But if the polling settles somewhere close to the current levels and a Conservative majority seems more likely, they may feel they are more able to move to the Liberal Democrats to send a message to their erstwhile party that they do not like the direction in which it is moving.</p> <p>There may be a paradox in this. The more the media narrative focuses on how unpredictable the election is, the less likely these Conservative remain voters are to feel they can safely switch their vote, in the end making the election rather more predictable than it first appears, and forestalling the Brexit realignment.</p> <p>\u2022 Paula Surridge is a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol\u2019s school of sociology, politics and international studies</p>",

Recent polling by Lord Ashcroft found that seven in 10 of this group thought a Corbyn-led government would be worse for Britain than leaving the European Union. Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to stand down Brexit party candidates in Conservative-held seats, and the signal this sends about the positioning of the Conservative party after the election, may give these voters pause for thought. But what the Conservatives are banking on to ensure they hold on to seats such as Putney, south-west London, where the estimated remain vote was more than 70%, is that these voters will be too concerned about a Corbyn-led government, even a minority one, to \u201crisk\u201d a vote for the Liberal Democrats. Might this change during the campaign? Critical to this will be the expectations people have about what the outcome of the election will be. If Tory remainers expect the result to be close, or if there is even a hint of a hung parliament in the polling, they are likely to be spooked back to the Conservatives at the prospect of Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. But if the polling settles somewhere close to the current levels and a Conservative majority seems more likely, they may feel they are more able to move to the Liberal Democrats to send a message to their erstwhile party that they do not like the direction in which it is moving. There may be a paradox in this. The more the media narrative focuses on how unpredictable the election is, the less likely these Conservative remain voters are to feel they can safely switch their vote, in the end making the election rather more predictable than it first appears, and forestalling the Brexit realignment. \u2022 Paula Surridge is a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol\u2019s school of sociology, politics and international studies",

The US has been accused of taking little interest in the eight months of fighting on the outskirts of Tripoli that began when Haftar\u2019s Libyan National Army mounted an assault on Tripoli, provoking a fierce counter-offensive by militia forces supporting the Government of National Accord (GNA). Recent clashes have left more than 1,000 people dead, but divisions in the international community have allowed the carnage to continue with little effective UN intervention. Reports that Russian mercenaries employed by the Wagner group are tipping the balance in favour of Haftar has raised fears in Washington that Libya could be lost to Russia in the same way as Syria.

There are US special forces in Libya, but they are dedicated to fighting Islamic State rather than siding with the government. The warning to Haftar came after US Department of State officials in Washington met the Libyan interior minister, Fathi Bashagha, from the UN-backed, Tripoli-based GNA.

SFive thousand 800 shareholders, ranging from private citizens to large asset managers such as Goldman Sachs and Nomura, had brought the action under a group litigation order, claiming damages of as much as \u00a3650m. By October 2008, Lloyds was on the brink, in part because of problems at HBOS, and was bailed out by the government, which bought a 43% stake at the cost of \u00a320bn to the British taxpayer.The bank was privatised again, but shareholders were left with large losses. The claimants had argued they were \u201cmugged\u201d by Lloyds and five former directors, including the former Lloyds chairman Sir Victor Blank and ex-chief executive Eric Daniels, both of whom testified in court. The judge found that there were failures by Lloyds to provide information ahead of the takeover, but that these were not \u201ccausative of any loss\u201d, in a judgment published on Friday. Wayne Kitcat, a member of the clients\u2019 committee bringing the action and a former Lloyds executive, said: \u201cThe decision of the judge is a bitter disappointment to thousands of Lloyds shareholders, many of whom have been left destitute by the acquisition of HBOS by Lloyds. He said: \u201cIt makes no sense to us that the judge acknowledges that material information ought to have been disclosed, but does not believe that the Lloyds board deliberately concealed it, or that it made any difference.\u201d For Lloyds the victory removes one of the largest legal risks inherited by the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, alongside the payment protection insurance scandal. A Lloyds spokeswoman said: \u201cThe group welcomes the court\u2019s decision. Throughout this process, the group has sought to act in the interests of our shareholders as a whole.\u201d The judge, Sir Alastair Norris, found that shareholders \u201cknew that the board assessed the chance of advantage as outweighing the risk inherent in the transaction\u201d before 96% of investors voted in favour of the merger on the board\u2019s recommendation. The judge also found that the disclosure to shareholders of secret emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) worth more than \u00a325bn from the Bank of England \u201cwould not have caused a sufficient part of the 96% majority to alter their vote (nor was there any real prospect of that occurring)\u201d. The dismissal of the case also represents a blow to Therium, an investment company specialising in funding legal action. A spokeswoman for Therium declined to comment on how much it had spent on fees.",

      "bodyText": "Striking contrasts in the choices of male and female awards contenders \u2013 and their potential impact on gender parity in Hollywood \u2013 have been uncovered by the Guardian. The three youngest men likely to be in the race for next year\u2019s best actor Oscar have never worked on a film directed by a woman, while the category\u2019s frontrunner, Joaquin Phoenix, has worked with a female director only once during his 34-film career. The picture is flipped for the female actors, with the youngest of the possible nominees working with female directors up to 75% of the time. Meanwhile, Phoenix\u2019s director on Joker, Todd Phillips \u2013 one of the youngest up for this year\u2019s best director award \u2013 was found to be the only filmmaker likely to win an Oscar nomination who has never made a film with a female lead or co-lead. The findings arrive as this year\u2019s awards season prepares to begin, with the fight for the best picture Oscar in particular shaping up to be a battle of the sexes. Proudly post-#MeToo female ensemble films Bombshell (about the sexual harassment of news anchors Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson by Fox boss Roger Ailes) and Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of Little Women are expected to vie for the top prize with two male-dominated frontrunners: Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Critical backlash to both films has centred on their lack of exposure for women. \u2013 in the case of The Irishman, around the six words spoken in less than 10 minutes on screen by supporting actress Anna Paquin. Tarantino angrily defended his film after some queried the lack of dialogue given to Margot Robbie, particularly in comparison to the airtime afforded to shots of her feet. Yet Tarantino, 56, performed well in the Guardian\u2019s analysis of directors: 45% of his films feature a female lead or co-lead, compared with 20% for Scorsese. Both directors have made five films featuring women in leading roles, but Scorsese, now 76, has been more prolific and working for longer. The runaway leader among directors was Pedro Almod\u00f3var, 70. Eighty-two per cent of his films feature a female lead or co-lead, while 50-year-old Noah Baumbach, 55-year-old James Mangold, 50-year-old Bong Joon-ho and 64-year-old Fernando Meirelles all bucked expectations, having respectively made films with female leads or co-leads 55%, 45%, 43% and 33% of the time. Among the youngest three directors, Lulu Wang has made one film with a female lead or co-lead, as has Jojo Rabbit director Taika Waititi. However, Wang has only made two films while Waititi has completed seven. As mentioned, 48-year-old Todd Phillips\u2019s 10 films feature only male leads. This counterintuitive demographic trend was mirrored among the actors. One of the oldest \u2013 Jonathan Pryce, 72 \u2013 has worked with the highest percentage of female directors (14%), while Antonio Banderas, 59, and Eddie Murphy, 58, both scored moderately with 8%. This is the same proportion of mainstream films found to have been directed by women in 2018, according to a report issued by San Diego State University earlier this year. Robert De Niro, 76, and Leonardo DiCaprio, 45, both scored below that average with 6%. However, their track records still beat those of the youngest actors \u2013 Taron Egerton, 30, Michael B Jordan, 32, and Adam Driver, 35, who have never worked with a female director. Jordan was one of the first actors to commit to an \u201cinclusion rider\u201d \u2013 which involves a contractual clause demanding cast and crew diversity \u2013 after the concept was championed by Frances McDormand in her 2018 Oscars acceptance speech. Driver broke through in 2012 with his role in Lena Dunham\u2019s HBO show Girls. He stars in two films opening in the UK this weekend: Scott Z Burns\u2019 The Report and Baumbach\u2019s Marriage Story. The latter has won acclaim for its even-handed portrait of a crumbling marriage, as well as the equal billing afforded to Driver and co-star Scarlett Johansson, from the position of their names on the poster to companion trailers. The careers of Driver, Jordan and Egerton combine dramas with franchise films, a genre traditionally slower to hire women in key backstage roles. Repeating our analysis with the highest-earning actors of 2019 produces similar findings: both the Forbes highest-grossing male stars \u2013 blockbuster staples Dwayne Johnson and Chris Hemsworth \u2013 have never made a film directed by a woman. Joker, an origins story for Batman\u2019s nemesis, is Phoenix\u2019s first venture into superhero movies. His track record \u2013 just one film out of 34 made with a woman (Lynne Ramsay\u2019s 2018 drama You Were Never Really Here) \u2013 was one of the Guardian\u2019s more surprising findings. More positive action by actors in committing to female-directed films is crucial for change, says Dr Stacy L Smith, founder of the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative: \u201cNot only will more women have a chance to work behind the camera, and more male actors to work with them, [but] it should have ripple effects for who is working in the crew, the roles female actors can access, the critics pool and how films are evaluated and, ultimately, the accolades and awards women compete to win.\u201d The youngest female actors analysed by the Guardian appear to be doing just this. At 26, Beanie Feldstein has made just one film directed by a man. Her 75% running total would rise to 80% with the inclusion of her next film, How to Build a Girl, Coky Giedroyc\u2019s adaptation of the Caitlin Moran memoir, which premiered in September but is set for release next year. Similarly, the percentage totals of 23-year-old Florence Pugh (29%) and 34-year-old Johansson (14%) would rise with the inclusion of next year\u2019s Marvel prequel Black Widow, directed by Cate Shortland. Feldstein\u2019s Booksmart co-star, Kaitlyn Dever, 22, has made eight films directed by men and six by women.

      "bodyText": "INTERNATIONAL BREAK, PATIENCE SNAP The way former Fiver favourites England have been going recently, you\u2019d have to say they\u2019ve got a fair chance of winning Euro 2020. They\u2019re scoring plenty of goals, their captain is now officially better than Tom Finney and Alan Shearer, and next summer the final will be played at Wembley, where they\u2019ll be (SATIRE ALERT) boosted by a loyal fanbase unaffected by (SATIRE ALERT) petty club loyalties offering unstinting support to (HAM-FISTED SATIRE ALERT) every single player in the squad. But other countries are available. For a start there\u2019s Finland, who kick off just as the Fiver is diverted to your spam folder, but we\u2019ve already dealt with them, on Wednesday, when much like today there was the square root of eff all to write about, in an edition that registered a resounding meh out of 10 on our patented Will-This-Do-o-meter. Elsewhere there\u2019s Sweden, who will be pretty much assured of qualification if they can avoid defeat in Romania, but may blow it if they can\u2019t. Though Norway are still technically in with a shout in Group F and they\u2019re only playing the Faroe Islands, a mere seven days away from the return of the Premier League, so let\u2019s just grit our teeth and get on with it, it\u2019ll soon be over. The most fascinating matches this fine eve will be held in Group D, which is currently somehow topped by the Republic O\u2019Ireland. Eh? Well that happened while The Fiver was looking the other way. Sadly, despite their memorable efforts, Mick McCarthy\u2019s entertainers are far from a shoo-in for qualification, having played a game more than Denmark and Switzerland, who are expected to leapfrog them with wins over Gibraltar and Georgia respectively. Should that occur, everything comes down to the visit of the Danes on Monday evening. The Fiver\u2019s already looking forward to that big Dublin showdown, if only because it\u2019ll give us something to fill this space with on Monday afternoon. Yes we are that desperate, and we\u2019re not afraid to admit it.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Legal bods at Cas have thrown out Manchester City\u2019s appeal against alleged breaches of Uefa\u2019s financial fair play regulations.

BT Sport have kept their mitts on Big Cup TV rights for the 2021-24 period. It will pay \u00a31.2bn of its not-yet-nationalised coin to hang on to them, however.

The Premier League has irked fans needing to catch a swift train home by siding with referees over how VAR is deployed, though they will at least be given a bit more information before they ring home with the bad news. Graphics that now read \u201cchecking penalty\u201d, will be expanded to say, for example, \u201cchecking penalty \u2013 possible handball\u201d. Which changes everything. EFL suits, meanwhile, have charged Sheffield Wednesday with misconduct over the sale of Hillsborough and how it related to their spending rules.

      "bodyText": "Veneto\u2019s regional council rejected a plan to combat climate change minutes before its offices on the Grand Canal, in Venice, were flooded, it has emerged as the city continues to battle high water levels. Venice has been hit by recurrent flooding since Tuesday, with 70% of the lagoon city engulfed on Friday morning as the acqua alta, or high water, level reached 1.54 metres amid heavy downpours. On Tuesday night, as Veneto councillors were debating the climate emergency in Ferro Fini Palace, Venice experienced its worst flooding since 1966. Politicians from the regional council\u2019s majority rightwing parties: the League, Brothers of Italy and Forza Italia, rejected amendments to fight the climate crisis in the 2020 budget that were proposed by the centre-left Democratic party. Sharing pictures of the room as water entered, Andrea Zanoni, the Democratic party\u2019s deputy chairman of the council\u2019s environment committee, wrote on Facebook: \u201cIronically, the chamber was flooded two minutes after the majority parties rejected our proposals to tackle climate change.\u201d Zanoni, a green campaigner, said the proposals included measures to fund renewable energy sources, replace diesel buses with less polluting vehicles, scrap polluting stoves and reduce plastic use. \u201cThere is no more meaningful image than a chamber being flooded, causing the representatives of the Venetian people to flee, to illustrate all the inconsistency and political nullity of a current miserable administrative led by the League, Brothers of Italy and Forza Italia,\u201d he added. Zanoni took particular aim at Luca Zaia, the Veneto president and League politician, for presenting a budget that contained \u201cno concrete plan to tackle climate change\u201d. Zaia has described the Venice flooding, which has killed two people, as \u201can apocalyptic disaster\u201d. \u201cVenice has been tortured, but there are also other parts of the Veneto region besides Venice,\u201d he said on Wednesday. In a statement to CNN, Roberto Ciambetti, the council\u2019s president and League member, rebuffed the criticism. \u201cBeyond propaganda and deceptive reading, we are voting [for] a regional budget that spent \u20ac965m over the past three years in the fight against air pollution, smog, which is a determining factor in climate change,\u201d he said. Venice\u2019s mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, blamed the floods on the climate crisis and promised that the long-delayed Mose flood barrier project would be finished. Brugnaro closed St Mark\u2019s Square as the tide started to rise again on Friday morning, engulfing shops, restaurants and homes. \u201cI\u2019m forced to close the square to avoid health risks for citizens \u2026 a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve destroyed Venice, we\u2019re talking about \u20ac1bn in damage and that\u2019s just from the other day, not today.\u201d The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, declared a state of emergency on Thursday night, paving the way for the government to assist people whose businesses and homes had been damaged. Conte said the flooding was \u201ca blow to the heart of our country\u201d. Residents whose homes have been flooded will receive \u20ac5,000 immediately while restaurant and shop owners will get up to \u20ac20,000. Brugnaro said a bank account would be opened to allow people from around the world to contribute towards repairing the city.

      "body": "<p>A wave of panic rippled through Conservative campaign headquarters as Labour announced plans to deliver free full-fibre broadband throughout the UK by 2030. It was hard enough already preventing some of its dimmer cabinet ministers from posting idiotic election videos on social media. Just imagine the damage they could do if they had access to a superfast 5G network anywhere in the country. The Tories would never get elected again.</p> <p>The worst offender had been Matt Hancock, the neediest man in politics, who would literally do anything for a Facebook like from a teenager. First he had managed to leave the camera operator behind when being filmed getting into his SUV en route to watching a wheel get reattached to a hospital trolley. \u201cPart of our ambitious plan to update every hospital in Yorkshire,\u201d he had squeaked. Days later he had looked earnestly into his iPhone \u2013 he looks about 12 but has a mental age far younger \u2013 and declared that the Conservatives\u2019 commitment to not meeting any of its A&amp;E targets proved why Labour could not be trusted with the NHS.</p> <p>Then there had been Stephen Barclay. CCHQ had fondly imagined that the Brexit secretary (motto: \u201cHe says it best when he says nothing at all\u201d) would use the election to catch up with The Apprentice, so it hadn\u2019t been paying much attention to him. So it was sod\u2019s law that Barclay had woken from his Mandrax-induced coma to release a video that showed he understood neither Premier League football <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveBarclay/status/1194966699621208064?s=20\">nor the immigration system</a>.</p> <p>Just as well, then, that Priti Patel\u2019s film of herself calling for the deportation of her own parents had buffered \u2013 thank you, thank you, Virgin Media \u2013 and that Dominic Raab had forgotten to press record on his unique take on Michael Portillo\u2019s Great PsychoTrain Journeys. It wasn\u2019t the best idea for the foreign secretary to pootle around the country revisiting the scenes of unsolved murders that he definitely had not committed.</p> <p>There was only one thing for it. To send the prime minister out in front of the media again so the public weren\u2019t given even half a chance to remember how useless the rest of his team were. OK, so Boris Johnson hadn\u2019t proved a great hit on his restricted public outings \u2013 he\u2019d managed to piss off people wherever he\u2019d gone \u2013 but at least he was a known liability. Sure, he was no leader, kept getting caught lying, was not trusted by any of his family and was only in politics for his own career advancement, but everyone already accepted that. Boris always had a free pass to be as hopeless as he liked without it affecting his poll ratings.</p> <p>So just after 10am, Johnson wandered in to the Radio 5 Live studios to take a series of questions from the public. As so often, it was far easier to keep track of the truths than the lies. Mainly because there weren\u2019t any of the former. Over the years Johnson has learned to instinctively mistrust the truth. The truth can only cause trouble and difficult explanations, so it must be avoided at all costs. Just tell everyone he would be getting Brexit done and that negotiating a free-trade agreement with the EU by the end of next year would be a piece of cake, and deal with the fallout later. Tomorrow may never come.</p> <p>Boris warmed up with a series of go-to lies. Five Easy Pieces. And counting. All fish sold in the UK would be British fish with British passports. The garden bridge proved he was committed to major infrastructure projects. He definitely hadn\u2019t made an entirely unnecessary visit to Afghanistan to avoid the Heathrow vote. He had apologised to the family of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a> even though they couldn\u2019t remember any such apology and he didn\u2019t have anything to apologise for. He was a trained neurosurgeon who had devoted his life to the NHS. He had won the VC for his gallantry in killing Osama bin Laden. With Boris, literally any old shit will do. </p> <p>The presenter Rachel Burden, whom Johnson had initially mistaken for the show\u2019s producer, tried to keep him honest but it was a pointless task. When she pressed him on immigration statistics and VAT \u2013 subjects on which there are huge gaps in his knowledge \u2013 he just invented something. One listener was ecstatic. He was fed up with politicians pretending to know things. He wanted a clown prime minister who was happy to know nothing.</p> <p>Just at the end, though, Burden slipped in the killer question. How many children did he have? Here Boris fell silent. Because even a narcissist like him could see that this was a question that demanded a straight answer. And he really wasn\u2019t sure. As with Donald Rumsfeld, there were the known knowns, the known unknowns and unknown unknowns. Across the country dozens of overweight children with bright blond hair fell to their knees and prayed that a paternity test wouldn\u2019t reveal Johnson to be their dad.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>John Crace\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/decline-and-fail-9781783351930.html\">Decline and Fail: Read in Case of Political Apocalypse</a>, is published by Guardian Faber.

Days later he had looked earnestly into his iPhone \u2013 he looks about 12 but has a mental age far younger \u2013 and declared that the Conservatives\u2019 commitment to not meeting any of its A&amp;E targets proved why Labour could not be trusted with the NHS. Then there had been Stephen Barclay. CCHQ had fondly imagined that the Brexit secretary (motto: \u201cHe says it best when he says nothing at all\u201d) would use the election to catch up with The Apprentice, so it hadn\u2019t been paying much attention to him. So it was sod\u2019s law that Barclay had woken from his Mandrax-induced coma to release a video that showed he understood neither Premier League football nor the immigration system. Just as well, then, that Priti Patel\u2019s film of herself calling for the deportation of her own parents had buffered \u2013 thank you, thank you, Virgin Media \u2013 and that Dominic Raab had forgotten to press record on his unique take on Michael Portillo\u2019s Great PsychoTrain Journeys. It wasn\u2019t the best idea for the foreign secretary to pootle around the country revisiting the scenes of unsolved murders that he definitely had not committed. There was only one thing for it. To send the prime minister out in front of the media again so the public weren\u2019t given even half a chance to remember how useless the rest of his team were. OK, so Boris Johnson hadn\u2019t proved a great hit on his restricted public outings \u2013 he\u2019d managed to piss off people wherever he\u2019d gone \u2013 but at least he was a known liability. Sure, he was no leader, kept getting caught lying, was not trusted by any of his family and was only in politics for his own career advancement, but everyone already accepted that. Boris always had a free pass to be as hopeless as he liked without it affecting his poll ratings. So just after 10am, Johnson wandered in to the Radio 5 Live studios to take a series of questions from the public. As so often, it was far easier to keep track of the truths than the lies. Mainly because there weren\u2019t any of the former. Over the years Johnson has learned to instinctively mistrust the truth. The truth can only cause trouble and difficult explanations, so it must be avoided at all costs. Just tell everyone he would be getting Brexit done and that negotiating a free-trade agreement with the EU by the end of next year would be a piece of cake, and deal with the fallout later. Tomorrow may never come. Boris warmed up with a series of go-to lies. Five Easy Pieces. And counting. All fish sold in the UK would be British fish with British passports. The garden bridge proved he was committed to major infrastructure projects. He definitely hadn\u2019t made an entirely unnecessary visit to Afghanistan to avoid the Heathrow vote. He had apologised to the family of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe even though they couldn\u2019t remember any such apology and he didn\u2019t have anything to apologise for. He was a trained neurosurgeon who had devoted his life to the NHS. He had won the VC for his gallantry in killing Osama bin Laden. With Boris, literally any old shit will do. The presenter Rachel Burden, whom Johnson had initially mistaken for the show\u2019s producer, tried to keep him honest but it was a pointless task. When she pressed him on immigration statistics and VAT \u2013 subjects on which there are huge gaps in his knowledge \u2013 he just invented something. One listener was ecstatic. He was fed up with politicians pretending to know things. He wanted a clown prime minister who was happy to know nothing. Just at the end, though, Burden slipped in the killer question. How many children did he have? Here Boris fell silent. Because even a narcissist like him could see that this was a question that demanded a straight answer. And he really wasn\u2019t sure. As with Donald Rumsfeld, there were the known knowns, the known unknowns and unknown unknowns. Across the country dozens of overweight children with bright blond hair fell to their knees and prayed that a paternity test wouldn\u2019t reveal Johnson to be their dad.

      "bodyText": "Two women married to Isis fighters were expected to land in Germany on Friday as Turkey continued to deport individuals with alleged affiliations to the terrorist group to their European countries of origin. The women are the eighth and ninth individuals to be repatriated to Germany this week, after the Turkish government unexpectedly announced on Monday it would no longer act as a \u201chotel\u201d for foreign nationals who fought alongside terrorists. A German-Iraqi family landed in Berlin on Thursday evening. The family of seven, who are believed to have links to the Salafist scene in Hildesheim, in Lower Saxony, were questioned by authorities, and the 55-year-old father was detained over a series of minor, non-terrorist offences. German authorities have reluctantly conceded they are obliged by international law to allow all German nationals into the country and will only be able to detain or bring to justice the returnees if Turkey or Syria cooperate in supplying evidence against them. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, has appealed for Ankara to quickly pass on information \u201cthat would stand in a court of law to detain someone and bring them to justice\u201d. Germany\u2019s public prosecutor general is investigating the two women due to arrive on Friday but they were not expected to be arrested upon touching German soil. One of the women is believed to be a 27-year-old Hanover-born woman of south Asian descent who first travelled to Syria in 2014. According to Hayat, a German deradicalisation scheme that has been in touch with the woman since December 2017, she spent at least the last two years in a secure annexe at the Ain Issa camp in Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria following the death of her husband in combat. The woman escaped after Kurdish troops opened the camp\u2019s gates in anticipation of the arrival of Turkish forces last month, and was then captured by the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army, leading to her detention in Gaziantep. Interviewed by Fox News in 2018, the woman said she was writing a book in the hope of protecting other women from making the same \u201cmistake\u201d she had. \u201cWe believe that the woman mainly travelled to Syria out of love for her partner and not because she is deeply immersed in Islamist ideology\u201d, said Claudia Dantschke, a project director for Hayat, a programme that seeks to deradicalise young jihadis by counselling their next of kin. The second woman is believed to have been born in 1998 and recently escaped from the Kurdish-run al-Hol camp in northern Syria. Two more women who travelled to Syria after their husbands joined Isis are expected to be deported to Germany in the next three weeks, after German authorities have verified the identity of the children who are expected to accompany them. A tenth individual whose deportation was originally expected this week is believed still to be a prison in Turkey. Benjamin Xu, 29, a German-Chinese jihadi from Berlin, is serving a life sentence over the death of two Turkish policemen in March 2014. In total, 95 German nationals with affiliations to Isis are believed to be in prisons in Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Twenty-six have already been made subject to arrest warrants in Germany, and there are a further 33 investigations that are designed to result in an arrest.",

That separation would make the nationalisation of Openreach much simpler but taking the business into state ownership would be a daunting proposition.</p> <p>Openreach employs about 32,000 staff \u2013 almost a third of BT\u2019s global workforce \u2013 and has a turnover of about \u00a35bn.</p> <p>It is responsible for the rollout of full fibre across the UK, which at an estimated cost of \u00a335bn is the biggest infrastructure project after the HS2 rail project.</p> <p><strong>Is BT\u2019s pension deficit an issue?</strong></p> <p>Ofcom, the communications industry regulator, examined the possibility of breaking up BT in 2016 and cited BT\u2019s \u00a34.5bn pension deficit as one of the reasons why it would not be a good idea. Steve Unger, Ofcom\u2019s director of strategy, said at the time a full-blown separation would trigger \u201cvery significant costs\u201d related to the deficit.</p> <p><strong>You can read the full piece here:</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/15/how-feasible-is-labour-free-broadband-plan-and-part-nationalisation-of-bt\">How feasible is Labour's free broadband plan and part-nationalisation of BT?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-15T13:20:56.621Z\">at 1.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dce95d08f08aab51e1bfaa0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-15T12:52:10.159Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>BT\u2019s share price has been shifting all morning, but its stock is no longer the worst performer on the FTSE 100. </strong></p> <p>Its shares fell as much as 3% in early trading, hitting lows of about 189p but have slightly recovered. </p> <p>The telecom giant\u2019s shares are now down 1.7% and hovering around 191p per share.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cde9e4adb7d88a2210f591bffa08bd9249f25b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cde9e4adb7d88a2210f591bffa08bd9249f25b9/0_0_1407_654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT\u2019s share price has been on a rollercoaster ride this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"465\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BT\u2019s share price has been shifting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-15T13:06:17.743Z\">at 1.06pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dce98078f08aab51e1bfac0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-15T12:29:11.406Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson has said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The group welcomes the Court\u2019s decision.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap of the reaction to Labour\u2019s divisive broadband pledge: BT chief executive Philip Jansen said the \u201cambitious\u201d plan would cost nearly \u00a3100bn Shadow chancellor John McDonnell did the media rounds this morning to explain how the part nationalisation of BT would be funded: including swapping shares for UK government bonds, and taxing tech giants Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn later hailed the plans during a speech in Lancaster, saying \u201cBritish Broadband will be our treasured public institution for the 21st century\u201d Britain\u2019s leading business lobby group, the CBI, said it was \u201cnot the way\u201d to improve the UK\u2019s broadband network BT rival TalkTalk said it was holding off on a decision to sell its own infrastructure arm to see how this whole Labour plan pans out Unsurprisingly, prime minister Boris Johnson criticised what he said was Labour\u2019s \u201ccrackpot scheme\u201d BT, meanwhile, announced it had won exclusive UEFA broadcasting rights to 2024 And in other news...Lloyds Banking Group shareholders lost a court case over what they say was a lack of transparency around the lender\u2019s 2008 acquisition of HBOS That\u2019s all from us. Thanks for reading and have a great weekend. We\u2019ll be back on Monday. The main US markets have opened and all three have hit new record highs: S&amp;P 500 +0.41% at 3,109 points Nasdaq +0.53% at 8,524 points Dow +0.36% at 27,881 points DATA ALERT: US industrial output contracted -0.8% in October. That\u2019s a larger contraction than was forecasted by analysts, who were expecting a -0.4% drop. It is also worse than September\u2019s -0.3% fall. NEWSFLASH: Engineering firm Babcock have been awarded the contract to build to the next fleet of warships for the UK defence ministry. It will be working on a fleet of five ships for the Royal Navy at its Rosyth facility, at an average cost of \u00a3250m each. Babcock was named the preferred bidder back in September. Analysts from investment bank Jefferies say BT could launch a legal challenge if Labour attempts to nationalise part of the business. The note, written by Jerry Dellis, Ulrich Rathe and Martin Hammerschmidt, explains: In a nationalisation scenario, we understand that BT\u2019s most effective legal recourse might be to defend shareholder value, not attempt to block government policy. The UK has bilateral investment treaties with countries in which overseas BT shareholders are located, and these are intended to protect against asset expropriation. UK-based shareholders might expect to receive equal treatment. NEWSFLASH: US retail sales rose +0.3% in October. That is higher than consensus forecasts for a +0.2% rise and an improvement on the -0.3% fall in September. Excluding car sales, the numbers were slightly disappointing, up just +0.2% compared to expectations for a +0.4% increase. But it\u2019s still better than September when retail sales contracted by -0.1%. My colleagues Mark Sweney and Patrick Collinson have put together a comprehensive Q&amp;A on the feasibility of the Labour broadband policy, covering key issues including whether the policy would breach state aid rules: Could the policy fall foul of policies on state aid? The EU has strict rules against state aid \u2013 or government subsidies that benefit one EU company at the expense of others \u2013 but according to some commentators, there are no regulations against businesses becoming entirely state-owned. How easy would it be to nationalise BT? Labour\u2019s plans do not involve nationalising all of BT, just Openreach, which operates the UK\u2019s broadband network, and other parts that relate to broadband provision, such as the retail arm BT Consumer. Openreach was set up as a subsidiary of BT in 2006 but two years ago was legally separated from its parent company by the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to counter complaints from rivals that its lack of independence was limiting competition in the market. That separation would make the nationalisation of Openreach much simpler but taking the business into state ownership would be a daunting proposition. Openreach employs about 32,000 staff \u2013 almost a third of BT\u2019s global workforce \u2013 and has a turnover of about \u00a35bn. It is responsible for the rollout of full fibre across the UK, which at an estimated cost of \u00a335bn is the biggest infrastructure project after the HS2 rail project. Is BT\u2019s pension deficit an issue? Ofcom, the communications industry regulator, examined the possibility of breaking up BT in 2016 and cited BT\u2019s \u00a34.5bn pension deficit as one of the reasons why it would not be a good idea. Steve Unger, Ofcom\u2019s director of strategy, said at the time a full-blown separation would trigger \u201cvery significant costs\u201d related to the deficit. You can read the full piece here: BT\u2019s share price has been shifting all morning, but its stock is no longer the worst performer on the FTSE 100. Its shares fell as much as 3% in early trading, hitting lows of about 189p but have slightly recovered. The telecom giant\u2019s shares are now down 1.7% and hovering around 191p per share. A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson has said: The group welcomes the Court\u2019s decision. Throughout this process, the group has sought to act in the interests of our shareholders as a whole. To refresh your memories, Lloyds announced the takeover of HBOS on 18 September 2008. Claimants said they suffered substantial financial losses as a result of the deal, Their lawyers claimed Lloyds had been bullied into the takeover by Gordon Brown\u2019s government, which hoped to save struggling HBOS The government eventually took a 43% stake in the enlarged Lloyds Banking Group but no longer owns any shares after selling its final tranche in May 2017. The Press Association is reporting that shareholders have lost a high court battle over the 2008 takeover of HBOS. The case was brought by almost 6,000 private investors who claimed they were not provided with the full details about the financial health of HBOS before the deal went through. While the big tech giants will be taxed to help fund the broadband scheme, McDonnell says the cash will actually be funding the infrastructure that their businesses run on: Yes, tech giants like Google and Facebook will have to pay a bit more for internet connectivity that they all benefit from. Labour\u2019s John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is back on the telly, giving the next speech at the party\u2019s event in Lancaster. He said the broadband plan would benefit businesses which are both using and developing 5G technologies. Let\u2019s be clear, it\u2019s not a return to the 1970s ... This is public ownership of the future. If you prefer to take a listen, ITV have some clips from Corbyn\u2019s speech: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has hailed the party\u2019s broadband pledge during a speech in Lancaster. He said it would just be the next in a string of successful nationalisation of essential services in the UK: In the 19th century, it was the public water supply and water works...in the 20th century it was our fantastic National Health Service...British Broadband will be our treasured public institution for the 21st century. Britain\u2019s leading business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry believes Labour\u2019s plan is not the the way to improve broadband across the UK. Matthew Fell, CBI\u2019s Chief UK Policy Director, says: Fast reliable broadband is an absolute priority for people and firms and does need improving. But Labour\u2019s plan is not the way to do it. The roll out of full fibre broadband across the country is underway, and all renationalisation will achieve is to slow down a process that needs speeding up. It is private sector investment that has driven connectivity, massively widened internet access and put faster speeds within reach for most UK households. This progress will be stopped in its tracks and the bill passed to pensioners and savers. Fell adds: With so many challenges facing the UK, blinkered ideologies must be left behind and replaced by forward-looking public-private partnerships that deliver rather than delay. As the scope of Labour\u2019s radical re-nationalisation plans expands almost daily, firms around the world lose confidence in the UK as a place to invest safely. Some will be asking if they are next. This threat damages the livelihoods of communities across the country. It\u2019s time for all parties to work with business, not against it. My colleague Rajeev Syal has rounded up key comments from shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s media tour this morning. Labour\u2019s view on the benefits: It doesn\u2019t just have economic benefits. It has environmental benefits in terms of basically people locating in their local towns and not commuting, some people moving into rural and coastal areas as well so they\u2019re properly connected, and it has social implications as well. On whether staff would be paid at the same rate as BT: We will always ensure that we attract the talent that we need. On Labour\u2019s intention to tax big technology companies to fund the policy, McDonnell said: We\u2019re not being unfair to anyone, we\u2019re simply saying you make your profits here, on the percentage of the profits you make here, you pay your taxes properly. On rival companies: McDonnell said he hoped to come to an agreement with rival broadband companies such as Sky and TalkTalk over ensuring access, and if necessary they could \u201ccome within the ambit of British Broadband\u201d. We\u2019ll come to an agreement with them, either an agreement of access arrangements or working alongside us, or, yes, if necessary they can then come within the ambit of British Broadband itself. BT competitor Virgin Media has weighed in. It\u2019s taken a subtle swipe at nationalisation proposals, saying that private \u2013 not public \u2013 investment is to thank for its own growth and success. A Virgin Media spokesperson said: Virgin Media has the fastest scaled network in the UK and has pledged to bring next-generation Gigabit broadband to half of the UK, by the end of 2021. As this commitment shows, private investment is essential to delivering improved broadband infrastructure. With billions of pounds worth of private money invested in the UK, Virgin Media continues to expand its network, providing competition and choice to consumers. Government policy has a role to play and can help to accelerate broadband deployment in a way that minimises the level of public subsidy needed and provides the UK and consumers with incredible connectivity within a competitive market. Amidst the flurry of reaction and commentary to Labour\u2019s BT pledge, we\u2019ve had the final reading of eurozone inflation released this morning. The 19-country bloc\u2019s headline inflation slowed to 0.7% year-on-year in October, from 0.8% in September. That\u2019s line with preliminary estimates by Eurostat. The drop was caused by a fall in energy prices, which offset higher prices for services, food, alcohol and tobacco. NEWSFLASH: In other BT news, the telecoms giant has won the exclusive rights to broadcast all 420 games of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and the new UEFA Europa Conference League fora further three seasons. BT will pay \u00a3400m each year for the privilege, but says its financial outlook for 2019/2020 remains unchanged. Unsurprisingly, the prime minister has strongly criticised Labour\u2019s pre-election pledge, and made it clear there will be no similar efforts by the Tories. Boris told BBC radio: What we won\u2019t be doing is some crackpot scheme that would involve many, many tens of billions of taxpayers\u2019 money nationalising a British business Labour plans to fund the nationalisation by swapping investor shares for UK government bonds. So who are the lucky shareholders in the running for those gilts? Here\u2019s a quick look at the top 10 shareholders in BT: Deutsche Telekom 12.1% BlackRock 5.73% Vanguard 2.73% Orange 2.69% Columbia Threadneedle Investments 2.38% Legal &amp; General Investment Management 1.81% Norges Bank Investment Management 1.68% Invesco Asset Management 1.63% M&amp;G Investment Management 1.33% Schroder Investment Management 1% Labour has said web companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google, would foot the bill for the nationalised British broadband company\u2019s annual maintenance costs. The party estimates those operating costs are about \u00a3230m a year. McDonnell told Sky News: These companies now have to pay their fair share...no more sweetheart deals. My colleague Rowena Mason has further details here: Investors are considering which other UK firms could be candidates for nationalisation. Some of the names being bandied around include Royal Mail (privatised fully by 2015) and Royal Bank of Scotland (which is still 62% owned by the government following its bailout in 2008). Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says: BT expressed surprise at last night\u2019s announcement having been assured by Labour fairly recently that they weren\u2019t being considered as a nationalisation candidate. With other companies also being told the same thing by the Labour Party, investors will no doubt be looking very carefully at other possible candidates for nationalisation, and whether they need to be concerned. Companies like Royal Bank of Scotland, National Grid, Centrica, Severn Trent, Royal Mail as well as the rail company franchisees, like Go Ahead Group and National Express to name but a few, are already trading at a nationalisation discount. For now, given Labour\u2019s current polling numbers the concern is fairly minimal, and investors will be hoping it stays that way, which helps explain the fairly muted share price reaction. BT rival TalkTalk is holding off on a decision to sell its own infrastructure arm to see how this whole Labour plan pans out. TalkTalk chief executive Tristia Harrison told Reuters: Our discussions are very advanced, and yes, the news overnight of course is making everybody in the sector pause and consider. We were really close, really close, but I think something of this sort that is in the news, obviously everybody is pausing, considering, digesting and working out what it means. Sky News, which first reported the strategic delay, said CityFibre Holdings nearly signed a deal to acquire TalkTalk\u2019s FibreNation on Thursday before Labour\u2019s pledge was announced. More comments from Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, who is now speaking to Sky News. He says the Labour pledge to establish a company called British Broadband from nationalising BT\u2019s Openreach, follows similar models in countries like South Korea. John McDonnell confirms that the nationalisation will be done by swapping investors\u2019 BT shares for UK government bonds. He adds that parliament will determine the value and ensure it is \u201cdone with a proper price\u201d and that government bonds will offer shareholders a\u201cstable, long-term investment.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what pension funds and other shareholders are saying they need at the moment. It will be a good deal. We can\u2019t afford not to do it...we\u2019ve fallen behind global competitors. He adds: I\u2019ve been touring around the country and you know even in some of our city areas they\u2019re not connected up...this is good for the economy. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme, McDonnell has been clarifying Labour\u2019s proposals, including that the part nationalisation would only apply to BT\u2019s broadband network operator Openreach. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll has some of the details: The reaction trickling out from analysts hasn\u2019t been glowing so far. There are concerns that ongoing efforts by the government and sector regulator Ofcom to incentivise fibre installation by rival operators could all be for naught. Matthew Howett, Founder &amp; Principal Analyst at Assembly comments: This is a spectacularly bad take by the Labour Party. The almost cut throat competition between broadband rivals has meant faster speeds, improved coverage and lower prices for consumers up and down the country. The current government, and independent regulator Ofcom, have spent the last three years incentivising alternative operators to BT to deploy faster fibre technologies. Companies such as Virgin, CityFibre and others have committed billions to rival Openreach. Those plans risk being shelved overnight. Only one other country in the world to come close to going down this route, and for a good reason \u2013 it\u2019s hard, expensive and fraught with difficulty. Australia\u2019s NBN is years late, massively over budget and offering speeds and technology a fraction of the original political intention. BT shares have slipped at the UK market open, dropping more than 2% It makes the telecoms firm one of biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 alongside Berkeley group down 1.7%. Fresnillo down 1.6% and Standard Chartered down 0.6%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Overnight, UK businesses have been digesting Labour\u2019s latest election pledge that would result in the part-nationalisation of telecoms giant BT. It is part of a plan to bring free full-fibre broadband to every home and business across the UK \u2013 but there\u2019s clearly a question on costs. The Labour party said the estimated capital cost of rolling out full-fibre broadband was \u00a315bn, on top of the government\u2019s existing \u00a35bn earmarked for broadband expansion. This would be funded from its green transformation fund \u2013 paid for by borrowing. But BT boss Philip Jansen has now weighed in and said the scheme would cost up to \u00a3100bn. Speaking to the BBC, Jansen said: These are very, very ambitious ideas and the Conservative Party have their own ambitious idea for full fibre for everyone by 2025 and how we do it is not straight forward. It needs funding, it is very big numbers, so we are talking 30 to 40 billion pounds.. and if you are giving it away over an eight year time frame it is a another 30 or 40 billion pounds. You are not short of 100 billion pounds. We\u2019ll continue to bring you the latest business reaction as we get it. Also coming up...

Not much at the moment.</p> <p>There was also something quite provocative in your longer letter: you went into some detail about you and your partner in bed together \u2013 it was very in-your-face and almost adolescent in its retelling. I wonder if that\u2019s how you talk about this new man with your daughter? If so, that would be unsettling for her.

Maybe it\u2019s time to put some locks on the door?</p> <p>You must have had your daughter when you yourself were still a teenager, which would have been really tough. At a time in life when you were meant to be going out and having fun, you had a young baby (btw: where is her father in all of this?). You must have missed out on a lot. You are, of course, entitled to your adult life, and while you don\u2019t need to act apologetically or secretively around her, you do need to act appropriately and sensitively.</p> <p>I wondered if you are slightly resentful at having given up a part of your life so young. You may need to explore that in order to better work through your feelings because, while you\u2019re presenting this as your daughter\u2019s problem, I think there may, possibly, be more going on than you realise.</p> <p>Don\u2019t forget your daughter is becoming a sexual being herself. She may be worried about relationships and sex, and she may have the normal adolescent preoccupations, such as, \u201cWill I ever meet anyone?\u201d She may be in the middle of important exams, or worried about another baby coming along and replacing her.</p> <p>It sounds as if your relationship with her was strong before, which is great.

There was also something quite provocative in your longer letter: you went into some detail about you and your partner in bed together \u2013 it was very in-your-face and almost adolescent in its retelling. I wonder if that\u2019s how you talk about this new man with your daughter? If so, that would be unsettling for her. I think this news must be hard enough for her to take in \u2013 and that\u2019s without catching her mother in bed with him. Maybe it\u2019s time to put some locks on the door? You must have had your daughter when you yourself were still a teenager, which would have been really tough. At a time in life when you were meant to be going out and having fun, you had a young baby (btw: where is her father in all of this?). You must have missed out on a lot. You are, of course, entitled to your adult life, and while you don\u2019t need to act apologetically or secretively around her, you do need to act appropriately and sensitively. I wondered if you are slightly resentful at having given up a part of your life so young. You may need to explore that in order to better work through your feelings because, while you\u2019re presenting this as your daughter\u2019s problem, I think there may, possibly, be more going on than you realise. Don\u2019t forget your daughter is becoming a sexual being herself. She may be worried about relationships and sex, and she may have the normal adolescent preoccupations, such as, \u201cWill I ever meet anyone?\u201d She may be in the middle of important exams, or worried about another baby coming along and replacing her. It sounds as if your relationship with her was strong before, which is great. Remember teenagers are like giant toddlers and need more love and attention than they can sometimes admit. You both have fears and worries and these need to be talked through. Do this calmly, not in the middle of a row. Don\u2019t wait to be in flagrante before addressing this again. See beyond the snarky texts to what she\u2019s communicating: fear. You may need to talk it through with a good friend first, so that when you do talk to her, she is not your confidante but your daughter and you are fully there for her. Take her out for the day or an afternoon, even if she seems to hate you. Let her know you want to spend time with her \u2013 this will give both of you a chance to talk. Don\u2019t take anything she says too personally; try to look beyond what she says to what she may be feeling. Let her know that, no matter what is happening you are still, and always will be, her mum. \u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

I mean, how many children do you have to have had to never forget how that nursery classic goes? Wait, sorry \u2013 I forgot. Don\u2019t answer that, prime minister.</p> \n<p>Actually, do answer that. Can you answer that? Because \u2013 instructive as it was to learn from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/boris-johnson-internet-voters-prime-minister-vogue-video\" title=\"\">Conservative video</a> this week that Johnson prefers fish and chips to a Sunday roast \u2013 it does feel slightly as if we\u2019re engaged in an extremely extended take on some parlour game like Just A Minute. Can the prime minister make it through an entire general election campaign without someone asking him that simple icebreaker: \u201cAnd how many children do you have?\u201d</p> \n<p>He\u2019s certainly managed it so far. It does help to only take press questions about once a week, and spend the rest of the time making videos in No 10, in the corridors of Conservative campaign HQ or in the back of your limo. But, you know, kids say the darnedest things, even if you only let a single pool camera capture the magic. So don\u2019t rule out the deadliest interviewer of this campaign being a four-year-old who enlivens a Johnson visit to her nursery by randomly going: \u201cHow many children do you have?\u201d</p> \n<p>Two months ago, the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7439103/Society-writer-William-Cash-reveals-Prime-Minister-agreed-let-raise-love-child.html\" title=\"\">Mail on Sunday serialised</a> the memoir of William Cash (son of the paleosceptic Tory Bill Cash), in which this somewhat pathetic figure offered a version of his doomed efforts to bring up the secret daughter Johnson fathered with an art consultant named Helen Macintyre. If you haven\u2019t read it, it is a deeply WTF-riven example of a particular type of upper middle class fecklessness \u2013 what Scott Fitzgerald once characterised as \u201ctheir vast carelessness\u201d. Anyway, Boris originally goes along with Cash\u2019s plan, but it doesn\u2019t work out. The piece ends with Cash chancing to bump into the future prime minister after some lunch speech in Davos (naturally). \u201cListen, it\u2019s about Helen,\u201d begins Cash, who inevitably feels moved to semi-apologise to Johnson for failing to help him clear up his mess. \u201cI wanted to marry Helen and bring up your daughter as my own. It was that simple.\u201d Johnson\u2019s reply? \u201cRight ... er ... got it. Thanks for letting me know.\u201d As Cash concludes: \u201cAnd then we walked off in different directions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Walking away is, of course, quite the speciality for Johnson, whose <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson\" title=\"\">Wikipedia entry</a> famously lists his progeny as \u201c5 or 6\u201d. Very normal. If you mention this online, people \u2013 without exception, male people \u2013 always rock up to ask why it matters. Yes, so what if the prime minister is a deadbeat who can\u2019t face his responsibilities and leaves other people to deal with them/cover up for them/raise them? Well, I don\u2019t know, guys?! Because it feels like it could turn out to be an important clue as to how he might handle other things? Oddly, you don\u2019t get any mothers turning up to say: ooh, why does it matter, I\u2019m a woman of the world here, so what if he just fucks off and shirks the day-to-day and breaks tiny hearts? And, to be super clear: you don\u2019t get any decent fathers saying it either. Not all men. Not all prime ministers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcc61626d69a4b81d9ef2c2dc566de6093b3a152\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcc61626d69a4b81d9ef2c2dc566de6093b3a152/0_0_4991_3424/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Rees Mogg, aged 12.

Except you don\u2019t see men from Johnson\u2019s background on The Jeremy Kyle Show (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/31/mps-lambast-itv-over-treatment-of-jeremy-kyle-show-participants\" title=\"\">now axed</a> after being accused of exploiting one of its guests to death). What is regarded as good-for-nothing and disgraceful and evidence of unforgivable moral turpitude in working-class people is regarded as winsome and excusable and even glamorously rakish in chaps like Boris Johnson. It\u2019s why media proxies such as the MP Johnny Mercer not only took Johnson\u2019s flak for him during the leadership campaign, but effectively thanked him for his service.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s the same kind of beaten deference exhibited by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-50314112\" title=\"\">Andrew Bridgen MP</a>, who couldn\u2019t even listen to Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s moronically vile comments about Grenfell last week without reflexively tugging his forelock. \u201cBut we want very clever people running the country, don\u2019t we?\u201d Bridgen gibbered of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/jacob-rees-mogg-billionaires-labour-values\" title=\"\">Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion</a> that he was too smart to have followed the fire brigade\u2019s advice, and therefore wouldn\u2019t have been burnt to death. \u201cThat\u2019s a by-product of what Jacob is, and that\u2019s why he is in a position of authority.\u201d In fact, Jacob isn\u2019t \u201cvery clever\u201d at all. A friend who had to sit through Rees-Mogg\u2019s debating society contributions at school once described him to me as \u201clike a posh Karl Pilkington\u201d, which now feels libellously unfair to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/sep/25/karl-pilkington-seven-wonders\" title=\"\">Karl Pilkington</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"99015fcf-c355-46ff-bcb7-4abc40a9f1df\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3zUu8Fs5Ta8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Both Rees-Mogg and Johnson have been wildly overpromoted by their party on grounds of some mystical \u201cauthenticity\u201d, yet both have been excruciatingly exposed during this campaign. All populists secretly hate their people, but most are able to fake it well enough to be adored. Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/boris-johnson-flooding-flood-victims-yorkshire\" title=\"\">eventual visit to flood-hit</a> Yorkshire hinted at a potential Tory misapprehension: the notion that being a selfie magnet in London seven years ago will translate nationally. As for the sensationally belated nature of this visit, one doesn\u2019t expect the Conservative strategists to be truly altruistic, but one does bank on at least competent cynicism. If they don\u2019t get the huge majority result they want next month, I\u2019ll enjoy the chinstroking postmortem as to why these geniuses didn\u2019t send the prime minister out immediately to meet flooded people IN THEIR OWN TARGET SEATS. It\u2019s not hard, is it? Have a Cobra meeting! Look like you give a shit!</p> \n<p>Instead, they have occupied the prime minister today with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/15/general-election-corbyn-talks-free-broadband-as-johnson-launches-campaign-bus-live-news\" title=\"\">launch of his campaign bus</a> \u2013 long-established as his truth-delivery vehicle of choice.

Can the prime minister make it through an entire general election campaign without someone asking him that simple icebreaker: \u201cAnd how many children do you have?\u201d He\u2019s certainly managed it so far. It does help to only take press questions about once a week, and spend the rest of the time making videos in No 10, in the corridors of Conservative campaign HQ or in the back of your limo. But, you know, kids say the darnedest things, even if you only let a single pool camera capture the magic. So don\u2019t rule out the deadliest interviewer of this campaign being a four-year-old who enlivens a Johnson visit to her nursery by randomly going: \u201cHow many children do you have?\u201d Two months ago, the Mail on Sunday serialised the memoir of William Cash (son of the paleosceptic Tory Bill Cash), in which this somewhat pathetic figure offered a version of his doomed efforts to bring up the secret daughter Johnson fathered with an art consultant named Helen Macintyre. If you haven\u2019t read it, it is a deeply WTF-riven example of a particular type of upper middle class fecklessness \u2013 what Scott Fitzgerald once characterised as \u201ctheir vast carelessness\u201d. Anyway, Boris originally goes along with Cash\u2019s plan, but it doesn\u2019t work out. The piece ends with Cash chancing to bump into the future prime minister after some lunch speech in Davos (naturally). \u201cListen, it\u2019s about Helen,\u201d begins Cash, who inevitably feels moved to semi-apologise to Johnson for failing to help him clear up his mess. \u201cI wanted to marry Helen and bring up your daughter as my own. It was that simple.\u201d Johnson\u2019s reply? \u201cRight ... er ... got it. Thanks for letting me know.\u201d As Cash concludes: \u201cAnd then we walked off in different directions.\u201d Walking away is, of course, quite the speciality for Johnson, whose Wikipedia entry famously lists his progeny as \u201c5 or 6\u201d. Very normal. If you mention this online, people \u2013 without exception, male people \u2013 always rock up to ask why it matters. Yes, so what if the prime minister is a deadbeat who can\u2019t face his responsibilities and leaves other people to deal with them/cover up for them/raise them? Well, I don\u2019t know, guys?! Because it feels like it could turn out to be an important clue as to how he might handle other things? Oddly, you don\u2019t get any mothers turning up to say: ooh, why does it matter, I\u2019m a woman of the world here, so what if he just fucks off and shirks the day-to-day and breaks tiny hearts? And, to be super clear: you don\u2019t get any decent fathers saying it either. Not all men. Not all prime ministers. The only political interview I truly want to see this campaign is one in which Johnson is submitting to questions \u2013 and a polygraph \u2013 from Jeremy Kyle. Except you don\u2019t see men from Johnson\u2019s background on The Jeremy Kyle Show (now axed after being accused of exploiting one of its guests to death). What is regarded as good-for-nothing and disgraceful and evidence of unforgivable moral turpitude in working-class people is regarded as winsome and excusable and even glamorously rakish in chaps like Boris Johnson. It\u2019s why media proxies such as the MP Johnny Mercer not only took Johnson\u2019s flak for him during the leadership campaign, but effectively thanked him for his service. It\u2019s the same kind of beaten deference exhibited by Andrew Bridgen MP, who couldn\u2019t even listen to Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s moronically vile comments about Grenfell last week without reflexively tugging his forelock. \u201cBut we want very clever people running the country, don\u2019t we?\u201d Bridgen gibbered of Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion that he was too smart to have followed the fire brigade\u2019s advice, and therefore wouldn\u2019t have been burnt to death. \u201cThat\u2019s a by-product of what Jacob is, and that\u2019s why he is in a position of authority.\u201d In fact, Jacob isn\u2019t \u201cvery clever\u201d at all. A friend who had to sit through Rees-Mogg\u2019s debating society contributions at school once described him to me as \u201clike a posh Karl Pilkington\u201d, which now feels libellously unfair to Karl Pilkington. Both Rees-Mogg and Johnson have been wildly overpromoted by their party on grounds of some mystical \u201cauthenticity\u201d, yet both have been excruciatingly exposed during this campaign. All populists secretly hate their people, but most are able to fake it well enough to be adored. Johnson\u2019s eventual visit to flood-hit Yorkshire hinted at a potential Tory misapprehension: the notion that being a selfie magnet in London seven years ago will translate nationally. As for the sensationally belated nature of this visit, one doesn\u2019t expect the Conservative strategists to be truly altruistic, but one does bank on at least competent cynicism. If they don\u2019t get the huge majority result they want next month, I\u2019ll enjoy the chinstroking postmortem as to why these geniuses didn\u2019t send the prime minister out immediately to meet flooded people IN THEIR OWN TARGET SEATS. It\u2019s not hard, is it? Have a Cobra meeting! Look like you give a shit! Instead, they have occupied the prime minister today with the launch of his campaign bus \u2013 long-established as his truth-delivery vehicle of choice. We know what the Johnsons on the bus do, and we know they do it all day long. We just have to wait and see if it matters. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

Its slight disorderliness \u2013 books stacked on the floor, wedged in too-small gaps on shelves, rested in the rungs of ladders \u2013 is undeniably attractive in a world where the majority of our novels are bought on the recommendation of an algorithm on a clean, white website. And its location is perfect too, allowing it to claim some of the long-dissipated bohemian charm left over by the artists and intellectuals of the old Rive Gauche, while being a quick walk from tourist favourites. And there is the much vaunted novelty that aspiring writers can stay in the shop for free; <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/dp5w7v/what-its-like-to-live-at-legendary-bookstore-shakespeare-co-622\">called \u201cTumbleweeds\u201d, the travellers must help out</a> with a few hours\u2019 work, read a book a day and write a short autobiography.</p> <p>But much of Shakespeare and Company\u2019s tourist-drawing power comes from its glamorous history. The original shop was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/31/letters-sylvia-beach-james-joyce\">founded by Sylvia Beach</a>, one of many American expats after the first world war drawn by the lure of Parisian life and the declining value of the franc. Beach\u2019s life story is inextricable from that of Shakespeare and Company. She and her long-term partner, bookshop owner Adrienne Monnier, opened the shop in Paris in 1919. It was immediately frequented by the stars of the French literary scene, such as Valery Larbaud and Jules Romains. Ezra Pound soon followed. Then TS Eliot, Djuna Barnes, Fitzgerald (\u201cone of our great pals\u201d, Beach called him, musing on his \u201cblue eyes and good looks\u201d), Joyce, Hemingway.</p> <p>The shop barely made a profit but no matter; this was a <em>social movement, </em>not merely a bookshop. Maybe it helps that the 1920s are the definitive time for literary salons in the public imagination: we see the names of modernists, we think of Gertrude Stein and Alice B Toklas, the Bloomsbury Group. Even their conversations are the stuff of legend; see Toklas calling Beach \u201cflagstaff\u201d, a chummy reference to the latter\u2019s dedication to flying the flag of American literature.</p> <p>In Beach\u2019s salon-cum-shop, writers met editors met publishers, the young and the old, the esteemed and the low, all swirling in that dimly lit room by the Seine. There are pictures from around this time, black and white and heavy with shadow, where Beach stands outside the shop with Hemingway, the man who she\u2019d introduced to the work of Turgenev, and DH Lawrence, an image of puff-chested masculinity. It\u2019s at this point that the legend of Shakespeare and Company gains life; the residue of its patrons\u2019 most brilliant ideas settling on the books like dust motes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ah, yes, it was Hemingway, more a giant than ever</p> <footer> <cite>Adrienne Monnier</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> Hemingway and Joyce are the stars of this fabled milieu. In addition to bookselling, Beach was a publisher. In 1922, she published Ulysses<em> </em>in English for the first time, printing 1,000 numbered copies on handmade paper. (Joyce sold Ulysses to a different publisher soon after, nearly bankrupting Beach, which only adds to the drama.) It was supposedly Beach\u2019s refusal to sell her last copy of Finnegans Wake to a German soldier in Vichy France that led to her closing the shop \u2013 the soldier threatened to confiscate her books, which were hidden on the fourth floor. She comforted American soldiers being sheltered by the French resistance, hid Arthur Koestler in her attic from the Nazis, and was interned in a camp for her anti-fascist sentiments.</p> <p>At the end of the war, Hemingway came back to Paris to see Beach. Monnier\u2019s description of the scene reinforces the strange, fairytale quality of his association: \u201cI saw little Sylvia down below, leaping into and lifted up by two Michelangelesque arms, her legs beating the air. Ah, yes, it was Hemingway, more a giant than ever.\u201d There\u2019s also the story, possibly apocryphal but impossible to resist, that Hemingway turned up to symbolically liberate the shop, before heading to the Ritz to drink to freedom.</p> <p>Shakespeare and Company\u2019s allure has been further gilded by the culture that grew around it. There\u2019s Richard Linklater\u2019s Before Sunset, set in<em> </em>a golden, swooningly romantic City of Light where the lovers find each other again during a reading at the shop. There\u2019s also Woody Allen\u2019s Midnight in Paris,<em> </em> a fan-fiction version of the 1920s literary scene where everyone is handsome and forever smoking. Beach\u2019s own 1956 memoir \u2013 of course <a href=\"https://www.baumanrarebooks.com/rare-books/beach-sylvia/shakespeare-and-company/106399.aspx\">titled Shakespeare and Company</a> \u2013 furthered the legend, with all the details about the readings, the authors and the champagne. The book is full of pictures, with slim, witty anecdotes about Beach\u2019s litany of stars, their eccentric little ways, their gin-soaked extravagances. Chapters have titles such as \u201cFitzgerald, Chamson, and Pr\u00e9vost\u201d and \u201cMr and Mrs Pound\u201d. It\u2019s an exercise in self-mythologisation, a door opened to a crowd eager to be invited in.</p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the Shakespeare and Company legend is that the bookshop at 12 Rue de l\u2019Od\u00e9on never reopened after the war. The lure of treading on floorboards where Eliot once read his work is gone once you realise that he never stepped foot in the Shakespeare and Company that exists now \u2013 nor did Hemingway, Fitzgerald or Joyce. Today\u2019s Shakespeare and Company was opened in 1951 by George Whitman, who was gifted the name by Beach. It\u2019s not as if the new premises didn\u2019t also attract famous clientele \u2013 James Baldwin, Allen Ginsberg, Ana\u00efs Nin and Bertolt Brecht all walked through its doors \u2013 but this period lacks the interwar romance of the first store. The tourists who flock to Shakespeare and Company still speak of the modernist giants of literature, if they speak of literature at all. But it seems to have transcended even these figures: more than a shop, Shakespeare and Company is a legend.</p>",

Its slight disorderliness \u2013 books stacked on the floor, wedged in too-small gaps on shelves, rested in the rungs of ladders \u2013 is undeniably attractive in a world where the majority of our novels are bought on the recommendation of an algorithm on a clean, white website. And its location is perfect too, allowing it to claim some of the long-dissipated bohemian charm left over by the artists and intellectuals of the old Rive Gauche, while being a quick walk from tourist favourites. And there is the much vaunted novelty that aspiring writers can stay in the shop for free; called \u201cTumbleweeds\u201d, the travellers must help out with a few hours\u2019 work, read a book a day and write a short autobiography. But much of Shakespeare and Company\u2019s tourist-drawing power comes from its glamorous history. The original shop was founded by Sylvia Beach, one of many American expats after the first world war drawn by the lure of Parisian life and the declining value of the franc. Beach\u2019s life story is inextricable from that of Shakespeare and Company. She and her long-term partner, bookshop owner Adrienne Monnier, opened the shop in Paris in 1919. It was immediately frequented by the stars of the French literary scene, such as Valery Larbaud and Jules Romains. Ezra Pound soon followed. Then TS Eliot, Djuna Barnes, Fitzgerald (\u201cone of our great pals\u201d, Beach called him, musing on his \u201cblue eyes and good looks\u201d), Joyce, Hemingway. The shop barely made a profit but no matter; this was a social movement, not merely a bookshop. Maybe it helps that the 1920s are the definitive time for literary salons in the public imagination: we see the names of modernists, we think of Gertrude Stein and Alice B Toklas, the Bloomsbury Group. Even their conversations are the stuff of legend; see Toklas calling Beach \u201cflagstaff\u201d, a chummy reference to the latter\u2019s dedication to flying the flag of American literature. In Beach\u2019s salon-cum-shop, writers met editors met publishers, the young and the old, the esteemed and the low, all swirling in that dimly lit room by the Seine. There are pictures from around this time, black and white and heavy with shadow, where Beach stands outside the shop with Hemingway, the man who she\u2019d introduced to the work of Turgenev, and DH Lawrence, an image of puff-chested masculinity. It\u2019s at this point that the legend of Shakespeare and Company gains life; the residue of its patrons\u2019 most brilliant ideas settling on the books like dust motes. Hemingway and Joyce are the stars of this fabled milieu. In addition to bookselling, Beach was a publisher. In 1922, she published Ulysses in English for the first time, printing 1,000 numbered copies on handmade paper. (Joyce sold Ulysses to a different publisher soon after, nearly bankrupting Beach, which only adds to the drama.) It was supposedly Beach\u2019s refusal to sell her last copy of Finnegans Wake to a German soldier in Vichy France that led to her closing the shop \u2013 the soldier threatened to confiscate her books, which were hidden on the fourth floor. She comforted American soldiers being sheltered by the French resistance, hid Arthur Koestler in her attic from the Nazis, and was interned in a camp for her anti-fascist sentiments. At the end of the war, Hemingway came back to Paris to see Beach. Monnier\u2019s description of the scene reinforces the strange, fairytale quality of his association: \u201cI saw little Sylvia down below, leaping into and lifted up by two Michelangelesque arms, her legs beating the air. Ah, yes, it was Hemingway, more a giant than ever.\u201d There\u2019s also the story, possibly apocryphal but impossible to resist, that Hemingway turned up to symbolically liberate the shop, before heading to the Ritz to drink to freedom. Shakespeare and Company\u2019s allure has been further gilded by the culture that grew around it. There\u2019s Richard Linklater\u2019s Before Sunset, set in a golden, swooningly romantic City of Light where the lovers find each other again during a reading at the shop. There\u2019s also Woody Allen\u2019s Midnight in Paris, a fan-fiction version of the 1920s literary scene where everyone is handsome and forever smoking. Beach\u2019s own 1956 memoir \u2013 of course titled Shakespeare and Company \u2013 furthered the legend, with all the details about the readings, the authors and the champagne. The book is full of pictures, with slim, witty anecdotes about Beach\u2019s litany of stars, their eccentric little ways, their gin-soaked extravagances. Chapters have titles such as \u201cFitzgerald, Chamson, and Pr\u00e9vost\u201d and \u201cMr and Mrs Pound\u201d. It\u2019s an exercise in self-mythologisation, a door opened to a crowd eager to be invited in. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the Shakespeare and Company legend is that the bookshop at 12 Rue de l\u2019Od\u00e9on never reopened after the war. The lure of treading on floorboards where Eliot once read his work is gone once you realise that he never stepped foot in the Shakespeare and Company that exists now \u2013 nor did Hemingway, Fitzgerald or Joyce. Today\u2019s Shakespeare and Company was opened in 1951 by George Whitman, who was gifted the name by Beach. It\u2019s not as if the new premises didn\u2019t also attract famous clientele \u2013 James Baldwin, Allen Ginsberg, Ana\u00efs Nin and Bertolt Brecht all walked through its doors \u2013 but this period lacks the interwar romance of the first store. The tourists who flock to Shakespeare and Company still speak of the modernist giants of literature, if they speak of literature at all. But it seems to have transcended even these figures: more than a shop, Shakespeare and Company is a legend.",

Alexander Grischuk is almost sure to qualify for the 2020 candidates in Ekaterinburg after the Russian won a filigree B v N ending to defeat Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the Grand Prix semi-final in Hamburg. Grischuk joins Caruana (2018 challenger), Ding Liren and Teimour Radjabov (World Cup), Wang Hao (Isle of Man) and Anish Giri (rating). One more Grand Prix place will be decided by the final leg in Jerusalem next month, while the organisers have announced that the wildcard will be a Russian. Levon Aronian was in danger of becoming the forgotten man of the elite when the Armenian failed to qualify for the candidates, but he bounced back at the Bucharest leg of the Grand Tour, defeating Sergey Karjakin in a blitz tie-break. Aronian thus boosted his chances of qualifying for the Grand Tour semi-final and final at London Olympia, for which tickets are available online. Carlsen is already qualified, but the other three places will go down to the wire at Kolkata in India on 22-26 November. Earlier, Karjakin got lucky in a frenetic time scramble with Anton Korobov where the Ukrainian missed a forced win in this week\u2019s puzzle diagram. David Howell played the longest game ever by an Englishman, and the fourth longest in chess history, when he drew in 236 moves with India\u2019s No 2, Pentala Harikrishna, at the European Club Cup in Montenegro. The top UK clubs did not enter, but three of England\u2019s world team silver medallists are there. Michael Adams and Gawain Jones play for the No 4 seeds, Padova of Italy, and Howell for the No 8 seeds, Valerenga of Norway. There was success in the opening round of the over-50 world seniors in Bucharest for two English amateurs against GMs rated hundreds of points higher. Dorset\u2019s Kevin Goater won in fine style against Semen Dvoirys while Yorkshire\u2019s Peter Gayson beat the No 2 seed, Darcy Lima. In 2002 Karjakin became the youngest ever GM at 12 years 7 months, and his record has become an Everest for outstanding pre-teen talents, the equivalent of the world crown for elite GMs. Until now it has survived all attempts, the latest from the Indian prodigies Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and Dommaraju Gukesh, who both got within a game or two of breaking it. Abhimanyu Mishra, 10, of New Jersey, US, has just become the youngest ever international master, beating the record set by Praggnanandhaa in 2016. In October 2018, Fide ratings for players born in 2009 showed Mishra as No 1 at 2149 and England\u2019s Shreyas Royal close behind as No 2 at 2114, but the American\u2019s rating has since surged 250 points in just over a year. Mishra still has almost two years to break Karjakin\u2019s grandmaster age record. Whereas the Indian pair often had to travel to Europe for GM norm tournaments, Mishra will have ample opportunities at home, together with support from the Kasparov Chess Foundation and its boss. There are free live games to watch online this weekend at the World Seniors, the Euro Club Cup, and the Grischuk v Jan-Krzysztof Duda Grand Prix final in Hamburg. 3645 1...Rh1+!

The vehicle was stopped for speeding in Nottinghamshire on Sunday night by police, who found it packed with bin bags containing 25 mature cannabis plants with a total street value of more than \u00a320,000. Two men fled the vehicle and ran into nearby fields but the driver, a 26-year-old man, was detained nearby and arrested on suspicion of the production and supply of cannabis. Plant and production equipment was seized during a subsequent search of a house in Worksop, where scores of residents were evacuated and more than 200 homes and businesses were flooded last Friday after a month\u2019s worth of rain fell in 24 hours. The cellar of the house in Market Street had flooded, and an illegally diverted electricity supply to an upstairs cannabis growing facility had become more dangerous. One remaining cannabis plant and growing equipment in the attic were seized.

      "body": "<p>Even the most curmudgeonly and Scrooge-like among you has probably started to give some thought to the necessity of ordering food for Christmas, especially if it\u2019s something in limited supply such as a rare-breed turkey or a goose. While you may normally shop in the supermarket, it may be a time of year when you feel you want to patronise your local butcher or buy direct from the producer. But do you feel the same about wine?</p> <p>If not, and if you care about the continuing presence of independent wine shops on the high street, you should. In fact, you should give them some of your custom year-round, not least because they have far more interesting wines than the supermarkets, as well as staff who can help match them to your personal taste. I\u2019m not saying buy everything from an independent \u2013 well, not unless you\u2019ve got deep enough pockets to \u2013 but rather to use them to source your most interesting bottles. I\u2019ve yet to find a worthwhile supermarket barolo, for example, and top-end, own-label bordeaux is generally underwhelming, but supermarkets absolutely deliver on party wines such as cheap prosecco and cut-price sauvignon blanc.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/oct/13/alsatian-wines-with-real-bite-to-drink-now-or-lay-down\">Alsatian wines with real bite | David Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where the indies shine is in stocking wines that are under the radar, such as those that are just over the border from a more prestigious appellation such as the unclassified vin de France from Domaine Vallet in today\u2019s panel, which is just next door to <a href=\"https://www.wine-searcher.com/regions-saint-joseph\" title=\"\">Saint-Joseph</a>, one of the best appellations in the northern Rh\u00f4ne. Apart from chablis, I\u2019d generally rather buy white burgundy from an indie than from the big <em>n\u00e9gociants</em> on which the supermarkets generally rely. And if you can set aside your preference for grande marque or big-name champagnes such as Bollinger or Mo\u00ebt et Chandon, you\u2019ll find the growers\u2019 champagnes that the indies stock much more interesting, and possibly cheaper, too. (Side note: don\u2019t be taken in by the apparent size of supermarket discounts on big-name champagnes \u2013 always check online to see if there\u2019s a better deal elsewhere.)</p> <p>One thing you <em>should</em> go to a supermarket for, or, more specifically, Waitrose for, however, is sherry.

      "bodyText": "Even the most curmudgeonly and Scrooge-like among you has probably started to give some thought to the necessity of ordering food for Christmas, especially if it\u2019s something in limited supply such as a rare-breed turkey or a goose. While you may normally shop in the supermarket, it may be a time of year when you feel you want to patronise your local butcher or buy direct from the producer. But do you feel the same about wine? If not, and if you care about the continuing presence of independent wine shops on the high street, you should. In fact, you should give them some of your custom year-round, not least because they have far more interesting wines than the supermarkets, as well as staff who can help match them to your personal taste. I\u2019m not saying buy everything from an independent \u2013 well, not unless you\u2019ve got deep enough pockets to \u2013 but rather to use them to source your most interesting bottles. I\u2019ve yet to find a worthwhile supermarket barolo, for example, and top-end, own-label bordeaux is generally underwhelming, but supermarkets absolutely deliver on party wines such as cheap prosecco and cut-price sauvignon blanc. Where the indies shine is in stocking wines that are under the radar, such as those that are just over the border from a more prestigious appellation such as the unclassified vin de France from Domaine Vallet in today\u2019s panel, which is just next door to Saint-Joseph, one of the best appellations in the northern Rh\u00f4ne. Apart from chablis, I\u2019d generally rather buy white burgundy from an indie than from the big n\u00e9gociants on which the supermarkets generally rely. And if you can set aside your preference for grande marque or big-name champagnes such as Bollinger or Mo\u00ebt et Chandon, you\u2019ll find the growers\u2019 champagnes that the indies stock much more interesting, and possibly cheaper, too. (Side note: don\u2019t be taken in by the apparent size of supermarket discounts on big-name champagnes \u2013 always check online to see if there\u2019s a better deal elsewhere.) One thing you should go to a supermarket for, or, more specifically, Waitrose for, however, is sherry. They currently have an incredible buy in their \u201con the QT\u201d range, which refers to limited-edition wines that are not generally on offer but sold on the quiet.

      "body": "<p>In England we are at saturation point. Premier League football across the weekend, Monday and Friday night football, European football, coverage of the lower leagues and European leagues. On any day, of any week, your chances of being able to watch live football are high.</p> <p>It makes finding a space for women\u2019s football extremely difficult and that has been a problem facing the Football Association since the women\u2019s season switched from summer to winter for the 2017-18 season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/14/phil-neville-stays-on-england-womens-manager-bold\">If Phil Neville stays on as England manager then he has to be bold | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The importance of finding space in a crowded marketplace is shown in Mexico. When the Liga MX Femenil launched in July 2017 the Mexican Football Federation saw a gap on Monday nights, so Mondays became the night for women\u2019s football. As a result the league exploded on to the scene. With 16 teams in its maiden year, 307,202 fans attended across 112 matches, an average of 2,743 per match. A further 104,804 then watched the six play-off games, with 28,995 and 32,466 going to the two-leg final. By contrast, across the 110-game WSL season in 2018-19, the league\u2019s first fully professional term, around 108,000 fans attended.</p> <p>With no room for women\u2019s football in the weekly sporting diary the FA has had to think outside the box.</p> <p>First there was the decision to broadcast the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/07/manchester-city-manchester-united-wsl-match-report\" title=\"\">opening-day Manchester derby</a> at the Etihad at 3pm on a Saturday, busting the broadcast blackout that exists between 2.45pm and 5.15pm to protect lower-league attendances.</p> <p>Now we have the inaugural Women\u2019s Football Weekend. Like Non-League Day it takes advantage of a weekend clear of Premier League football during a men\u2019s international break.</p> <p>To add to the occasion there has been careful scheduling: a north London derby, a Merseyside derby and Manchester United v Chelsea are the highlights. Four games will be played at the clubs\u2019 main stadiums.</p> <p>With Tottenham having faced criticism for not hosting the women\u2019s team for one of their stadium test events, a closer relationship between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams and the decision to hold the first north London derby of the WSL era <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/11/inaugural-womens-football-weekend-november-wsl\" title=\"\">at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium</a> are welcome.</p> <p>Spurs are keeping their cards close to their chests on ticket sales, but the added pull of the new stadium experience, a half-time talk from the back-to-back World Cup-winning coach Jill Ellis and the visit of Arsenal could easily see the game at the 62,000-capacity ground (a significant upgrade on Tottenham\u2019s usual home at Barnet) break the 31,213 attendance record set by Manchester City at the Etihad in September. Before that the record was 5,265 at the Amex when Arsenal clinched the league title last season.</p> <p>The Guardian understands Liverpool are hoping to welcome 15-20,000 fans to Anfield, where a struggling Liverpool play this season\u2019s surprise package, Everton.</p> <p>Brighton will host Birmingham at the Amex and Reading play Bristol City at the Madejski to complete the big-ground quartet. Manchester City play West Ham at home and there are fixtures across the Championship and below preparing to play their part in attracting new fans.</p> <p>At the top the ambition will likely be to break the 62,921 total attendance set in week one.</p> <p>These showpiece fixtures are not for kicks.

      "bodyText": "In England we are at saturation point. Premier League football across the weekend, Monday and Friday night football, European football, coverage of the lower leagues and European leagues. On any day, of any week, your chances of being able to watch live football are high. It makes finding a space for women\u2019s football extremely difficult and that has been a problem facing the Football Association since the women\u2019s season switched from summer to winter for the 2017-18 season. The importance of finding space in a crowded marketplace is shown in Mexico. When the Liga MX Femenil launched in July 2017 the Mexican Football Federation saw a gap on Monday nights, so Mondays became the night for women\u2019s football. As a result the league exploded on to the scene. With 16 teams in its maiden year, 307,202 fans attended across 112 matches, an average of 2,743 per match. A further 104,804 then watched the six play-off games, with 28,995 and 32,466 going to the two-leg final. By contrast, across the 110-game WSL season in 2018-19, the league\u2019s first fully professional term, around 108,000 fans attended. With no room for women\u2019s football in the weekly sporting diary the FA has had to think outside the box. First there was the decision to broadcast the opening-day Manchester derby at the Etihad at 3pm on a Saturday, busting the broadcast blackout that exists between 2.45pm and 5.15pm to protect lower-league attendances. Now we have the inaugural Women\u2019s Football Weekend. Like Non-League Day it takes advantage of a weekend clear of Premier League football during a men\u2019s international break. To add to the occasion there has been careful scheduling: a north London derby, a Merseyside derby and Manchester United v Chelsea are the highlights. Four games will be played at the clubs\u2019 main stadiums. With Tottenham having faced criticism for not hosting the women\u2019s team for one of their stadium test events, a closer relationship between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams and the decision to hold the first north London derby of the WSL era at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium are welcome. Spurs are keeping their cards close to their chests on ticket sales, but the added pull of the new stadium experience, a half-time talk from the back-to-back World Cup-winning coach Jill Ellis and the visit of Arsenal could easily see the game at the 62,000-capacity ground (a significant upgrade on Tottenham\u2019s usual home at Barnet) break the 31,213 attendance record set by Manchester City at the Etihad in September. Before that the record was 5,265 at the Amex when Arsenal clinched the league title last season. The Guardian understands Liverpool are hoping to welcome 15-20,000 fans to Anfield, where a struggling Liverpool play this season\u2019s surprise package, Everton. Brighton will host Birmingham at the Amex and Reading play Bristol City at the Madejski to complete the big-ground quartet. Manchester City play West Ham at home and there are fixtures across the Championship and below preparing to play their part in attracting new fans. At the top the ambition will likely be to break the 62,921 total attendance set in week one. These showpiece fixtures are not for kicks. They have a purpose: to drive a new audience towards the game, and it is working. Coupled with the effects of England\u2019s run to a World Cup semi-final and concerted efforts to drive international attendances (the record England home crowd of 77,768 at Wembley followed an impressive 29,238 at the Riverside) domestic attendances have risen. There has been a 313% increase on last season\u2019s match average. If you exclude the outlier games at men\u2019s stadiums there has still been a 45% increase. The starting point may have been low \u2013 an average of 996 per game in 2018-19 \u2013 but the growth is still significant. In the Championship attendances have dipped to an average of 440, but with the promotion of Manchester United and Tottenham, the league\u2019s biggest crowd-pullers, this was somewhat expected. That 20% dip is still a 41% increase on the 2017-18 season. Maintaining and improving this growth will be crucial to the continuing investment in the game and it is welcome that people are buying in.",

      "bodyText": "America\u2019s government-backed national recycling awareness day is being used as cover by large corporations that are churning out enormous volumes of plastic that end up strewn across landscapes, rivers and in the ocean, critics have said. The America Recycles Day event on Friday is being vigorously promoted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a way to encourage Americans to recycle more. But critics point out that the initiative is the brainchild of Keep America Beautiful, a not-for-profit founded and backed by large companies that produce vast quantities of plastic products that end up as pollution. Current backers include Coca-Cola, Nestl\u00e9, Pepsico, and Altria, the tobacco giant formerly known as Phillip Morris. Decades of campaigns by the group have emphasized individual responsibility for plastic recycling, which data reveals to be a largely broken system. \u201cJust like the fossil fuel industry, corporate polluters have been using recycling to justify ever-increasing production of single-use packaging, while taxpayers and cities are left to foot the bill,\u201d said Denise Patel, the US and Canada program director of Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. \u201cLower-income communities and communities of color, who are the hardest hit and the least responsible, bear the brunt of a model that has brought us to the brink of the waste and climate crisis.\u201d A huge global expansion in plastic production is under way, threatening to sweep aside any effort to increase the current recycling rate of about 9% of all plastics. A 2017 analysis found that fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil and Shell have poured more than $180bn into new facilities that form the raw material for everyday plastics from packaging to bottles, trays and cartons. This boom is set to fuel a 40% rise in plastic production over the next decade, according to experts, exacerbating the plastic pollution crisis that scientists warn already risks \u201cnear permanent pollution of the Earth\u201d. The Trump administration is simultaneously supporting that expansion and promoting a flawed recycling system. The EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler, this week toured a recycling facility in Virginia and the agency is hosting an \u201cinnovation fair,\u201d in addition to the summit on Friday. Wheeler said the agency is \u201cworking diligently to identify market-based strategies and innovative ideas to create a more sustainable recycling system in America\u201d. An EPA spokesperson, asked to point to specific policies the agency is developing to bolster recycling, referred to a voluntary pledge that 45 corporations and government associations have signed. The signatories \u2013 which include the biggest plastic producers \u2013 have been divided into work groups that have each established a \u201cvision statement, as well as challenges, opportunities and potential actions\u201d. The Trump administration is simultaneously supporting plastics growth and promoting a flawed recycling system, without enacting changes to fix it. The problems that poses for consumers is on full display at one Washington DC organic grocery store that runs a program for customers to drop off hard-to-recycle waste. Shaymah Ansari is in charge of environmental restoration efforts at the Mom\u2019s Organic Market just off a busy highway headed out of the city. She spends hours each week sorting the waste people bring in to make sure it isn\u2019t contaminated before sending it to recycling facilities. She sees it all \u2013 the Amazon bubble envelopes, the bread bags, the used toothbrushes \u2013 all the things local residents can\u2019t recycle at home. She also sees optimistic recycling, or \u201cwishcycling\u201d of things that typically can\u2019t be repurposed into new products. One day she found a Kenmore coffee maker. \u201cI think we\u2019ve taken convenience and just turned it into a monster,\u201d Ansari said. Ansari sees people trying harder to responsibly dispose of their waste, only to find they often can\u2019t. Many of the plastics they drop off \u2013 including bags for frozen food, coffee and lunch meat \u2013 end up in the trash. Even when difficult-to-recycle plastics are repurposed, they are often downcycled into things like plastic benches and fuel and are rarely used to make the same products they came from. Even if people properly sort and prepare their waste, most plastic never has a chance at getting recycled anyway. About 91% of plastic does not ultimately get recycled. Billions of tons still remain on the planet \u2013 from the oceans to the snow in the Arctic and the Alps. Most of the plastic Americans try to recycle is sent overseas, where it is often landfilled or incinerated. And increasingly, plastics are burned in the US, polluting the air in mostly minority communities. Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency official who has launched the Beyond Plastics project at Bennington College, said that means plastics \u201cfundamentally are not recyclable\u201d. She says companies making plastic are pushing personal responsibility instead of supporting new laws and taking accountability for a worldwide plastic crisis. \u201cMany of us go to the supermarket and try not to buy plastic,\u201d Enck said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible, and it\u2019s not our fault.\u201d Even if the broader global recycling system was functioning well, the US has another problem: Americans are terrible at sorting and recycling their waste. The country\u2019s municipal recycling rate is 35%, according to a recent analysis \u2013 far lower than most developed nations. Germany, the most efficient country, attempts to recycle 68% of its waste. Plastics producers in Germany are forced to take back the single-use bottles they make, collecting them in reverse vending machines at grocery stores. And communities are required to have extensive sorting systems. People in the US say they care deeply about the planet, with 74% agreeing \u201cthe country should do whatever it takes to protect the environment\u201d, according to a Pew Research Center poll. But only 32% say it bothers them \u201ca lot\u201d when people throw away things that could be recycled. Jessica Nolan, the director of the conservation psychology lab at the University of Scranton, said the US lags behind other countries because it lacks government policies that signal recycling is important. \u201cBy putting laws in place that mandate recycling or incentivize recycling, what that tends to do psychologically is it increases peoples\u2019 expectations that other people are going to participate,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cNo one wants to be a sucker \u2013 nobody wants to be spending all this time and energy doing something if no one else is doing it.\u201d San Francisco, for example, instituted strong recycling policies more than a decade ago and reached an 80% recycling rate, Nolan said. But some localities are scaling back their recycling programs, as China has begun to refuse recycling shipments from the US that are contaminated with food or the wrong kinds of plastics. In New Orleans, Louisiana, for example, the parish government will no longer accept plastic containers labeled 3 through 7, meaning they will go to a landfill. Many activists argue that plastics recycling is so broken that humanity should return to a zero-waste economy, starting with food and beverage packaging. Metal, glass and paper should still be reused and recycled, they say, but single-use plastic should be largely phased out. Even compostable plates and cups have raised alarms, both because some of them don\u2019t actually biodegrade and because some include harmful chemicals. Miriam Gordon, who works with companies to limit their waste at Upstream Solutions, said activists are up against \u201cconvenience culture\u201d. Just decades ago, many households didn\u2019t need their trash collected because they didn\u2019t produce trash beyond food scraps, she said. Berkeley, California, is piloting a program for reusable stainless steel cups at cafes, partnering with the company Vessel, which distributes, collects and cleans the cups \u201cIf we are going to go back to reusables and refillables, we have to have a culture-changing strategy,\u201d Gordon said.

We\u2019ve created a new sense of solidarity in France and that won\u2019t go away.\u201d</p> <p>Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters are expected to blockade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/07/macrons-arrogance-unites-us-on-the-barricades-with-frances-gilets-jaunes\">rural roundabouts</a> and march through cities this weekend to mark the first anniversary of one of the most unusual and long-lasting protest movements in French history \u2013 and the government is on alert.</p> <p>Christine spent many days this year standing with a thermos flask and flyers on a suburban roundabout north of the western city, demonstrating against what she sees as the injustices of French society. An out-of-work single mother of two who struggles to meet housing costs, she said: \u201cThe yellow high-visibility jacket is a great leveller \u2013 once you put it on, you\u2019re all the same. It brought people together.\u201d</p> <p>One year after hundreds of thousands of angry French protesters first put on fluorescent jackets and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/french-protester-killed-accident-anti-fuel-tax-blockade\">took to the streets</a> over rising fuel taxes, what became a wider movement has left a mark on French politics.</p> <p>The protests forced the government to announce billions of euros of tax breaks that demonstrators still insist are not enough. The centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, although vowing to continue his pro-business reforms, said he learned from the protests that he must put more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/25/emmanuel-macron-significant-tax-cut-gilets-jaunes-speech\">humanity</a> into what he called his \u201cimpatient\u201d style of governance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef8bc542916e33933e85a0e93e13bd71c4a553d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef8bc542916e33933e85a0e93e13bd71c4a553d3/0_273_4239_2543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators call for an \u2018emergency plan\u2019 for public hospitals on 14 November 2019 in Bordeaux.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators call for an \u2018emergency plan\u2019 for public hospitals on 14 November 2019 in Bordeaux.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/30/french-police-tactics-scrutiny-gilets-jaunes-injuries-paris\">Policing tactics</a> towards demonstrators have come under scrutiny. Official figures state 2,500 demonstrators were wounded during the protests, which have continued each Saturday for a year. About 1,800 police officers have suffered injuries. Activists say 24 protesters lost an eye and five lost a hand because of police weapons. Two police officers will soon stand trial over alleged violence against protesters.</p> <p>After being caught unaware by the protests 12 months ago, Macron and his government are now trying to anticipate and contain other growing protest movements, including an unprecedented revolt among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/french-medics-health-service-collapse-doctors-nurses-protest-outside-french-health-ministry-strikes\">striking hospital staff</a> as well as students.</p> <p>Unions are planning a nationwide strike against Macron\u2019s pension reforms from 5 December that could severely hit transport, and many gilets jaunes intend to join forces with it. A <a href=\"https://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/gilets-jaunes-un-an-apres-deux-francais-sur-trois-trouvent-le-mouvement-justifie-20191114\">poll for Le Figaro</a> this week found 69% of French people felt the ongoing yellow vest movement was justified.</p> <p>Bordeaux was one of the biggest centres of the protests. It is seen as an example of the \u201ctwo Frances\u201d that Macron is still struggling to reconcile \u2013 a vibrant city with soaring house prices and an Airbnb boom, but beyond it an increasingly poor rural area with low-paid agricultural workers, significant unemployment and a feeling of being forgotten.</p> <p>Geographers talk of a \u201ccorridor of poverty\u201d outside Bordeaux. Most of the gilets jaunes protesters congregating here travelled in from the poor, rural hinterlands outside.</p> <p>A 53-year-old former teacher, also called Christine, came from a small village 37 miles (60km) north of Bordeaux, where the only job options were the nuclear plant or the vineyards. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a cafe in the village,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "In a kebab shop on the outskirts of Bordeaux, Christine, 48, was planning the next steps of the local gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protest movement. \u201cWe might seem less visible, but we\u2019re still out here,\u201d said the cardiac nurse who left her job after a \u201cburn out\u201d \u2013 like \u201cso many\u201d healthcare staff. \u201cSome don\u2019t want to wear a yellow vest anymore because of being targeted by police, but we\u2019re organising meetings, mobilising citizens and we\u2019ve still got public support. We\u2019ve created a new sense of solidarity in France and that won\u2019t go away.\u201d Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters are expected to blockade rural roundabouts and march through cities this weekend to mark the first anniversary of one of the most unusual and long-lasting protest movements in French history \u2013 and the government is on alert. Christine spent many days this year standing with a thermos flask and flyers on a suburban roundabout north of the western city, demonstrating against what she sees as the injustices of French society. An out-of-work single mother of two who struggles to meet housing costs, she said: \u201cThe yellow high-visibility jacket is a great leveller \u2013 once you put it on, you\u2019re all the same. It brought people together.\u201d One year after hundreds of thousands of angry French protesters first put on fluorescent jackets and took to the streets over rising fuel taxes, what became a wider movement has left a mark on French politics. The protests forced the government to announce billions of euros of tax breaks that demonstrators still insist are not enough. The centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, although vowing to continue his pro-business reforms, said he learned from the protests that he must put more humanity into what he called his \u201cimpatient\u201d style of governance. Policing tactics towards demonstrators have come under scrutiny. Official figures state 2,500 demonstrators were wounded during the protests, which have continued each Saturday for a year. About 1,800 police officers have suffered injuries. Activists say 24 protesters lost an eye and five lost a hand because of police weapons. Two police officers will soon stand trial over alleged violence against protesters. After being caught unaware by the protests 12 months ago, Macron and his government are now trying to anticipate and contain other growing protest movements, including an unprecedented revolt among striking hospital staff as well as students. Unions are planning a nationwide strike against Macron\u2019s pension reforms from 5 December that could severely hit transport, and many gilets jaunes intend to join forces with it. A poll for Le Figaro this week found 69% of French people felt the ongoing yellow vest movement was justified. Bordeaux was one of the biggest centres of the protests. It is seen as an example of the \u201ctwo Frances\u201d that Macron is still struggling to reconcile \u2013 a vibrant city with soaring house prices and an Airbnb boom, but beyond it an increasingly poor rural area with low-paid agricultural workers, significant unemployment and a feeling of being forgotten. Geographers talk of a \u201ccorridor of poverty\u201d outside Bordeaux. Most of the gilets jaunes protesters congregating here travelled in from the poor, rural hinterlands outside. A 53-year-old former teacher, also called Christine, came from a small village 37 miles (60km) north of Bordeaux, where the only job options were the nuclear plant or the vineyards. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a cafe in the village,\u201d she said. Having spent her whole teaching career in deprived areas before falling into poverty herself, she said when the protests started, \u201cI was ready, I already felt we had to build a better society.\u201d Despite witnessing what she called \u201cwar scenes\u201d during police clashes in protests in Bordeaux, she would continue protesting. \u201cEvery week for a year, we have keep a presence on our local roundabout,\u201d she said. \u201cAn 85-year-old woman with her dog is committed to sit there, and one in two cars always beep their support.\u201d Pascal Chauvet, 61, a travelling wine salesman, is now coordinating a gilets jaunes list for local elections in Bordeaux in March, under the label D\u00e9mocratie Bordelaise (Bordeaux Democracy).

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>My father died more than 20 years ago and I increasingly find that I think of him most on Remembrance Day rather than on his birthday or the anniversary of his death in January. He was 18 when the second world war started and 24 \u2013 the same age as my son is now \u2013 when it ended and he served in the Navy throughout, first in the north Atlantic, then in the Malta convoys and the Sicily landings and finally in the far east. And yet I have almost no details of his time in the war, because he would never discuss it. He would talk about the war in general, but whenever it became too personal he would close the conversation down. It was a part of him that was unreachable, a place he could not bear to revisit because it was still too painful, even 50 years later. It was only just before he died that he told my mother of his recurring nightmare of the time he had been ordered to sail through a sea of men who had been sunk, because to have stopped would have meant getting torpedoed as well. The closest thing I have to a record of his service career is a napkin ring on which he had engraved a list of all the ships in which he had sailed. I\u2019ve started going through the archives in an attempt to piece together his war, but this gives little indication of the personal cost. The fear, the guilt and, yes, the moments of boredom. The records show that he was on HMS Quentin when it was sunk by German fighter planes after sinking a U-Boat and I assume it was for his actions in this engagement that he was awarded the DSC. But I don\u2019t know for sure, as he never properly told me. All he would say was that he continued to man the guns as the boat was sinking. But as he was sunk twice, maybe it was another battle entirely. Remembrance Day is about more than just those who lost their lives in war. It\u2019s also about those who spent a lifetime trying to recover from surviving a war.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/09/german-leaders-mark-fall-of-berlin-wall-with-warning-about-democracy\">30 years since the Berlin Wall came down </a>and I can still vividly remember watching it happen on the TV with tears running down my cheeks. People chipping away at the wall with hammers. People climbing over the wall. Complete strangers embracing each other. Families being reunited after nearly three decades apart. It was more than the liberation of a country, it was the liberation of a spirit. I had travelled to East Germany with my parents the previous year as my mother wanted to see where some of her family were buried. Her father was German and had escaped to the UK in the early 1930s. Nothing we experienced had given me the slightest hint that the Soviet block was within 12 months of collapse. We flew into West Berlin, had a meal and then walked through Checkpoint Charlie, one of the most genuinely disturbing moments of my life. You could almost physically feel yourself being watched throughout and I was conscious that one wrong move \u2013 no matter how innocent \u2013 could result in us being arrested and detained. Once in the East, it was like entering another world. Everything felt colourless. There were few shops, no advertising hoardings, little street lighting and only a handful of old Trabants pottering along the almost empty roads. During our three-day stay in East Berlin and Magdeburg, we spoke to almost no one. People sensed that we were an alien other and instinctively shied away from us. Anything beyond basic civilities was fraught with danger. Never have I been so happy to leave a country. The end of the wall felt like a moment of renewal, a symbol of hope. Thirty years on, it feels as if barriers are being rebuilt.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Harry and Meghan have been getting it in the neck yet again from Piers Morgan and the tabloid press. This time their crime against humanity is that they are apparently snubbing the Queen by not choosing to spend Christmas with her at Sandringham. As if this was anyone\u2019s business but theirs. I\u2019m sure the Queen\u2019s not that put out, so why should others be so on her behalf. There\u2019s no great matter of state at stake. Just think this through. Since when did it become a national emergency not to stay with your granny at Xmas? Most young people, assuming they are going to stay with anyone \u2013 I can still remember the sense of liberation my wife and I felt when we finally realised we didn\u2019t have to go anywhere and were allowed to slob around in our own home \u2013 choose to stay with their parents. So if they have upset anyone it is Prince Charles. And in any case, shouldn\u2019t the normal rules long since have been reversed with Charles having his 90-something-year-old-parents to stay at Highgrove rather than making them do all the entertaining in Norfolk? There\u2019s also another convention with young couples that they take it in turns to stay with each other\u2019s parents. Last year they went to Sandringham, so it\u2019s only fair that this time round they stay with Meghan\u2019s mum. Which is what they are doing. Things change when you have children. Things change again when you and they get older. This year will be the first Christmas ever without our daughter who will be staying with her in-laws at her new home in the US. We will miss her terribly. But being a parent means learning to live with loss. It\u2019s the way things are. The way they are meant to be. So we\u2019re just going to have to suck it up. As are the Queen and Prince Charles.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>The election continues to take its toll on my mental health. And, I suspect, that of the country. So far this week I have been out in London with the Lib Dems, in Blackpool with Labour, in Coventry with the Tories and in Hull with the Brexit party, and my over-riding impression is that the voters don\u2019t really want any of the parties on offer. No one really believes Jo Swinson when she says she is going to be prime minister, hardcore Brexiters feel sold out by Nigel Farage, Jeremy Corbyn isn\u2019t trusted, and even Conservative supporters admit that Boris Johnson is a liar. Six years ago, membership of the EU just wasn\u2019t an issue apart from for a tiny minority of the country. Now Brexit has split the entire UK with no signs of anyone being able to heal the divisions. Politics has never felt so toxic or binary. I\u2019ve always taken the view that the political sketch should be an equal opportunities column. A chance to satirise \u2013 and, on rare occasions, praise \u2013 politicians on all sides and to call out hypocrisy, lies and incompetence wherever I find it. Increasingly, though, I find that some readers expect me to be a cheerleader and to ignore anything that might be slightly problematic for the Labour party. This week, I observed that Corbyn seemed to have lost some of his campaigning edge of 2017 and that it wasn\u2019t enough to be just remembered as the plucky underdog who did better than expected. Having great policies is pointless if you never get to implement them. Corbyn may have seen off three prime ministers, but the Tories would be more than happy for him to see off three more if it meant Labour staying out of office for another 10 years. But no one gets to take my vote or sketch for granted.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>Spare a thought for Tory candidate Mims Davies. A while ago she wrote to her constituents in the marginal seat of Eastleigh, telling them that it was with deep sadness that she was standing down as their MP in order to spend more time with her children. Just this week, she has re-emerged from her family to win the nomination for the safe Conservative seat of Mid Sussex. Davies professed herself \u201cprofoundly shocked\u201d to have been selected. Presumably her letter putting herself forward wrote itself. Eastleigh must be so proud of her. Many other constituencies have also had candidates forced on them by both the Tory and Labour high commands despite the local associations having wanted someone else. So against all the general shabbiness and backroom stitch-ups, it\u2019s good to be able to honour one of the election\u2019s unsung heroes. Step forward, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/02/10-downing-street-gets-new-resident-a-jack-russell-cross-puppy\">Dilyn</a> the Downing Street dog. Poor Dilyn has been taken out several times by Carrie Symonds on the campaign trail and each time he has looked thoroughly miserable. Photographed in Richmond with Zac Goldsmith, Dilyn couldn\u2019t have appeared more desperate. \u201cHow could you take me out with a man who ran such a racist campaign for London mayor?\u201d he barked. Out with Theodora Clarke, Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s niece, in Stafford, Dilyn had to be restrained from running off, and on the train to Bristol he was pictured looking longingly out the window, begging someone to call the RSPCA and have him rehoused. Dilyn alone speaks truth to power.</p> <p><strong>Digested week digested: </strong>Onan the Barbarian</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4f09a2280f559350fba81eb70e6fb545a3a7374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4f09a2280f559350fba81eb70e6fb545a3a7374/0_209_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris with rabbit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rabbit: \u2018You may not look that much, but you sure as hell breed like me.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>John Crace\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/decline-and-fail-9781783351930.html\">Decline and Fail: Read in Case of Political Apocalypse</a>, is published by Guardian Faber.

No one really believes Jo Swinson when she says she is going to be prime minister, hardcore Brexiters feel sold out by Nigel Farage, Jeremy Corbyn isn\u2019t trusted, and even Conservative supporters admit that Boris Johnson is a liar. Six years ago, membership of the EU just wasn\u2019t an issue apart from for a tiny minority of the country. Now Brexit has split the entire UK with no signs of anyone being able to heal the divisions. Politics has never felt so toxic or binary. I\u2019ve always taken the view that the political sketch should be an equal opportunities column. A chance to satirise \u2013 and, on rare occasions, praise \u2013 politicians on all sides and to call out hypocrisy, lies and incompetence wherever I find it. Increasingly, though, I find that some readers expect me to be a cheerleader and to ignore anything that might be slightly problematic for the Labour party. This week, I observed that Corbyn seemed to have lost some of his campaigning edge of 2017 and that it wasn\u2019t enough to be just remembered as the plucky underdog who did better than expected. Having great policies is pointless if you never get to implement them. Corbyn may have seen off three prime ministers, but the Tories would be more than happy for him to see off three more if it meant Labour staying out of office for another 10 years. But no one gets to take my vote or sketch for granted. Friday Spare a thought for Tory candidate Mims Davies. A while ago she wrote to her constituents in the marginal seat of Eastleigh, telling them that it was with deep sadness that she was standing down as their MP in order to spend more time with her children. Just this week, she has re-emerged from her family to win the nomination for the safe Conservative seat of Mid Sussex. Davies professed herself \u201cprofoundly shocked\u201d to have been selected. Presumably her letter putting herself forward wrote itself. Eastleigh must be so proud of her. Many other constituencies have also had candidates forced on them by both the Tory and Labour high commands despite the local associations having wanted someone else. So against all the general shabbiness and backroom stitch-ups, it\u2019s good to be able to honour one of the election\u2019s unsung heroes. Step forward, Dilyn the Downing Street dog. Poor Dilyn has been taken out several times by Carrie Symonds on the campaign trail and each time he has looked thoroughly miserable. Photographed in Richmond with Zac Goldsmith, Dilyn couldn\u2019t have appeared more desperate. \u201cHow could you take me out with a man who ran such a racist campaign for London mayor?\u201d he barked. Out with Theodora Clarke, Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s niece, in Stafford, Dilyn had to be restrained from running off, and on the train to Bristol he was pictured looking longingly out the window, begging someone to call the RSPCA and have him rehoused. Dilyn alone speaks truth to power. Digested week digested: Onan the Barbarian John Crace\u2019s new book, Decline and Fail: Read in Case of Political Apocalypse, is published by Guardian Faber.

I\u2019ve worked with warehouse packers and pickers, meat-processing workers, cleaners, baggage handlers, cabin crew, waiters and drivers, in the north-west, south-east and London. My parents were immigrants from Poland - my dad trained with the RAF after spending years incarcerated in a gulag in Siberia, and my mum came in the early 1970s to marry my father and see life on the other side of the iron curtain. Friends and family followed suit over the years, every time for \u201cbread\u201d, working on construction sites, in hospitality, tailoring, whatever they could find.</p> <p>My job, as a trade union organiser, was to organise with workers. All workers. One class: the working class. They had different languages, different religions, different beliefs, but one common experience of exploitation by a system that treats them all as labour, giving some more status than others, but all under the same boot when it comes to the needs of capital. Workplaces where three agencies functioned simultaneously, playing workers off against one another. Workplaces where cleaners were registered at Companies House as directors and had to pay \u00a330 a week to an agency just to have their wages processed. Workers who weren\u2019t paid at all. Workers on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/23/number-of-zero-hours-contracts-in-uk-rose-by-100000-in-2017-ons\" title=\"\">zero-hours contracts</a> who were \u201cswitched off\u201d and sent home as per the needs of warehouse orders.</p> <p>How did the UK become such a perfect arena for a race to the bottom? Over the past few decades, Labour and Tory reluctance to change anti-union legislation, and their failure to amend the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/31/agency-workers-rights-pay\" title=\"\">Agency Workers Regulations</a> to ensure parity between agency (mostly migrant) and contract (mostly British) workers, crushed the conditions under which the poorest workers could organise and fight back. The legal, structural barriers to organising \u2013 try to fight back as a group of agency workers and suddenly you have no shifts any more \u2013 meant workers who rose as leaders, British or migrant, were shot down. But this isn\u2019t the only factor in undermining solidarity: mainstream trade union bureaucracy also plays a significant and enduring role.</p> <p>From the late 1980s to the mid-2000s, most trade unions in this country have pursued a \u201cservicing\u201d approach to members rather than an \u201corganising\u201d one. Servicing treats a member as a service user \u2013 they\u2019ll get representation when the proverbial hits the fan in the form of advice and casework, with cheap car insurance thrown in. Organising hails the member as a potential activist and organiser in the union: they <em>are</em> the union, capable of taking collective action to change their terms and conditions. Servicing focuses on casework and individuals; organising focuses on collective change.</p> <p>Both approaches are needed in a trade union. Not everyone will want to step forward and confront the boss, but, as hyper-individualising neoliberalism has risen over the past 30 years, so has the focus on servicing in unions. As injunctions and lawsuits have become more accessible for companies to use to prohibit strikes and silence workers (see the Communication Workers Union\u2019s recent treatment at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/13/royal-mail-wins-high-court-injunction-to-stop-postal-strike\" title=\"\">high court</a>), mainstream union establishment culture has, unsurprisingly, become risk-averse: workers representing themselves and publicly speaking out have been replaced by men in suits sharing pre-prepared statements to national media.</p> <p>Limiting the presence and supply of human beings for capital in this country because you think it will help you organise in workplaces better is not a trade union approach \u2013 it\u2019s a boss one. You never punch down. You never collude with the state to stop poor people seeking bread, and you never collude with a classification of people as lesser. You wouldn\u2019t accept a two- or three-tier employment contract system in a workplace, which is rampant today, any more than you should collude with that in immigration status. These concepts of class, underclass, a black-market workers\u2019 class, serve neoliberal states, which continue to pursue policies of atomisation, authoritarianism and poverty class-reproduction. Why would you follow this model?</p> <p>Unions need to do their organising and invest in it, properly. To empower rank-and-file workers. They should never let bureaucracy direct workers\u2019 struggles, or allow officials to give away deals in the name of \u201cgood industrial relations\u201d when workers would be better served by calling for strike action.</p> <p>The dynamics that prevent workers organising are as much about the \u201cexternal\u201d world of capital \u2013 laws, use of police and military, professional union busters, HR \u2013 as they are the internal ones within some mainstream trade unions. These include factional networks that know how and who should gain positions of power, which can be exclusive; a kind of Fordism that leads to bureaucratised and sectional piecework when a campaign process could be handled from start to finish by one group of workers; a deference to position by hierarchy rather than capability; and a prioritisation of the political capital of the institution, rather than its redistribution to grassroots organising and initiatives. All of this plays out in a social framework of institutionalised racism, gendered and gendering power relations and the hostile environment that hits migrant workers the hardest, all of which unions should be working to undo at every level.</p> <p>Established industrial relations theory talks about three different approaches. The first is a pluralist approach: workers and bosses exist; unions and capital can work together. An example was the post-second world war strategy of planning and supposed power sharing between largely nationalised industries and trade unions. The second is the unitary approach (the dominant one today, otherwise known as HR in a tin), which says that we don\u2019t need unions, as businesses and workers have the same interests. And then there is the conflict approach: our interests are in conflict, yours are extracting as much profit out of us as possible whereas we are for dignity, justice and a shared bakery, not just a bigger slice of the pie. It\u2019s the last approach that carries most hope for an end to the humiliation and exploitation people are being made to put up with generation after generation.</p> <p>There are unions in the UK that actually practise united class organising; the two most strident and grassroots today are <a href=\"https://www.uvwunion.org.uk/\" title=\"\">United Voices of the World</a> (UVW) and the <a href=\"https://iwgb.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Independent Workers of Great Britain</a> (IWGB). Both were dismissed by some in mainstream unions as \u201cpressure groups\u201d or protest organisations, totally overlooking the fact that they launch and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/01/union-beating-gig-economy-giants-iwgb-zero-hours-workers\" title=\"\">win disputes</a> and also employ legal and casework staff as well as organisers. What they have in common is that they allow for a necessary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/31/the-new-resistance-how-gig-economy-workers-are-fighting-back\" title=\"\">\u201cconflict\u201d approach</a>. </p> <p>United Voices and IWGB, on shoestring budgets, are uniting all their members to strike for their collective interests, without classification or reservation. They\u2019re a model for what united unions can look like. The older unions, by contrast, remain stuck in an industrial past.

The second is the unitary approach (the dominant one today, otherwise known as HR in a tin), which says that we don\u2019t need unions, as businesses and workers have the same interests. And then there is the conflict approach: our interests are in conflict, yours are extracting as much profit out of us as possible whereas we are for dignity, justice and a shared bakery, not just a bigger slice of the pie. It\u2019s the last approach that carries most hope for an end to the humiliation and exploitation people are being made to put up with generation after generation. There are unions in the UK that actually practise united class organising; the two most strident and grassroots today are United Voices of the World (UVW) and the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB). Both were dismissed by some in mainstream unions as \u201cpressure groups\u201d or protest organisations, totally overlooking the fact that they launch and win disputes and also employ legal and casework staff as well as organisers. What they have in common is that they allow for a necessary \u201cconflict\u201d approach. United Voices and IWGB, on shoestring budgets, are uniting all their members to strike for their collective interests, without classification or reservation. They\u2019re a model for what united unions can look like. The older unions, by contrast, remain stuck in an industrial past. When will Unite live up to its name? \u2022 Ewa Jasiewicz is a trade union organiser based in Manchester",

They aim to view the climate debate from the forest rather than the city, and to put people and nature at its heart. This is a deliberate contrast to the top-down approach of official UN COP meetings, where the emphasis is more on economics, technology and urbanisation. Although the Amazon event has far fewer participants, the logistics and risks are arguably greater.</p> <p>After a briefing about threats posed by snakes, stingrays, spiders, malaria and yellow fever, the group set out along the Trans-Amazonian highway through several of Brazil\u2019s worst areas of deforestation and violence.

      "bodyText": "The search for solutions to the climate crisis does not get any more radical, far-reaching or deeper into nature than the alternative climate conference currently taking place in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. In the past few days, European climate strikers and Extinction Rebellion youth activists have travelled by motor canoe deep into a region known as Terra do Meio to share ideas with indigenous leaders, forest dwellers, environmental activists and Brazil\u2019s leading climate scientists, anthropologists and archaeologists. The Russian punk anarchist Nadya Tolokonnikova, of Pussy Riot, was also set to join the gathering along with local artists and Catholic bishops. Their goal is to move the Amazon from the periphery to the centre of the global debate about the breakdown of the climate and other natural life support systems. They also want to demonstrate that Brazil can continue to play a positive role despite the country\u2019s decision not to host this year\u2019s official United Nations climate talks in the wake of ultra-nationalist Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s presidential election victory. The event, which has been dubbed the Forest COP and takes place a few weeks before the official COP 25 climate conference in Madrid. It has been organised by Brazil\u2019s biggest environmental organisation, the Instituto Socioambiental (ISA), with the Ibirapitanga Institute and the Iriri extractivist association. The rainforest is essential for Brazilian agriculture and the global climate. While nature-based solutions and environmental justice have risen rapidly up the climate agenda in the past year and scientific research has shown the huge carbon-sequestration potential of tree-planting campaigns, protecting and restoring old forests is more effective, particularly in the tropics. The earth scientist Antonio Nobre said he dropped everything to attend the intergenerational, international, interdisciplinary gathering. His research has demonstrated how healthy rainforests create \u201cflying rivers\u201d, cool the surface of the Earth and efficiently sequester carbon. He said the super-biome has survived for 50 million years despite volcanic eruptions, glacial eras, meteors and continental drift, but has been threatened like never before by the last 50 years of human activity. \u201cThe Amazon is the centre of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cGreta [Thunberg] says we should listen to the scientists. But what scientists need to do is listen to the wise people of the forest.\u201d For many in Brazilian civil society, the meeting is a chance to regroup and find new inspiration during a dismal period in which the new government has weakened environmental protections, undermined funding for NGOs and encouraged forest fires and illegal land seizures. \u201cWe were feeling very down. We felt paralysed. Then we heard about this new movement of the youth, which had been started by Greta Thunberg, and taken on by Extinction Rebellion. It was a huge inspiration. We wanted to connect this generation in Europe with indigenous and riverine communities, who want more people to come and see what is happening in their land,\u201d said Marcelo Salazar, regional head of ISA. Several of the European participants, including Belgian climate youth activists Anuna De Wever and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Charlier, spent weeks crossing the Atlantic by sailboat to avoid the high carbon emissions of flying. Others offset their journeys on their first day of the trip by planting a variety of native seeds in a forest restoration project. The small Forest COP will be followed by a bigger gathering in Altamira from Sunday. They aim to view the climate debate from the forest rather than the city, and to put people and nature at its heart. This is a deliberate contrast to the top-down approach of official UN COP meetings, where the emphasis is more on economics, technology and urbanisation. Although the Amazon event has far fewer participants, the logistics and risks are arguably greater. After a briefing about threats posed by snakes, stingrays, spiders, malaria and yellow fever, the group set out along the Trans-Amazonian highway through several of Brazil\u2019s worst areas of deforestation and violence. This included the Arara do Cachoeira Seca indigenous territory, which has been invaded by illegal loggers, farmers, miners and land grabbers. They then travelled along the Iriri River into the forests of Terra do Meio, which is an area of indigenous territories, conservation units and extractive reserves \u2013 all of which are under increasing pressure. Tasso Azevedo, who is one of Brazil\u2019s leading experts on satellite monitoring of deforestation, stressed the importance of shifting perspective from a technological view from space to face-to-face meetings on the ground. \u201cThere are not enough opportunities in the world today for different generations to talk to one another, especially in a place like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to explore new ideas. When I was born in 1972, 99% of the Amazon rainforest was intact. Since then we have lost 20%.\u201d This August, the scale of devastation hit its highest level in a decade.

      "bodyText": "Abby Dow is on a mission. Make that two. By this time next year she hopes to have qualified as a mechanical engineer and earned a playing contract from the Rugby Football Union. She can give a boost to the latter ambition by performing as well against France in Exeter on Saturday as she did against the same opposition during last week\u2019s victory in Clermont-Ferrand. Dow is one of only three players \u2013 along with Heather Kerr and Ellena Perry \u2013 in the England squad for the autumn internationals not to have a full-time contract with the RFU, who signed up 28 players in January. Instead the wing has forced her way in by excelling for Wasps, for whom she ran in seven tries in the first six matches of this season. She did well from the start in last week\u2019s 20-10 win in France, which ended an 18-match unbeaten home record for the French going back to 2012. Keep this up and she will have a fair chance of gaining a full-time deal next year, by which time she should also have graduated from Imperial College London. \u201cI\u2019ve got my last year to go to get my master\u2019s,\u201d says the 22-year-old. \u201cThen everything is on the table: whether to try to aim for a [full-time] spot on the team or go for a career in engineering. I\u2019ve got a very open field to play with.\u201d That \u201copen field\u201d outlook reflects a woman with the confidence to pursue her goals. Just as she has not been put off by being a part-timer in a squad packed with professionals, she is not discouraged by the statistic that says only about 12% of engineers working in Britain are women. \u201cIt\u2019s a similar proportion at my university but I think it\u2019s slowly changing,\u201d she says. \u201cI loved physics and maths at A-level and I\u2019ve always been interested in making things.

Perhaps he had already seen Johnson mopping up earlier in the week. , 2:A - They both chose to campaign in boxing clubs on the same day. You can insert your own \"The gloves are off now\" punchline here if you like., 3:C - Scotland's first minister was pictured looking like a potential new 1st-class stamp during a campaigning visit to a Climate Challenge community project at North Edinburgh Arts, Edinburgh., 4:B - The \u00a3500 fee is refunded if you get over 5% of the vote. It is intended to discourage frivolous candidates. Are you going to tell them, or shall we?, 5:D - A Lord Buckethead is also standing in the constituency for the Official Monster Raving Loony party. Count Binface is, of course, an independent. It feels like a bigger and more significant party split than when The Changing Independent Group For Independent Change formed., 6:D - Asked about what politicians were doing to be 'kinder', Cleverly cited making a cup of coffee for his wife, much to the bemusement of the audience, who were possibly expecting some answer along the lines of policy initiatives to relieve the effects of austerity. , 7:A - Shaban is reprising the character he played in two Doctor Who stories during the 1980s. Corbyn is a fan, say insiders. And that picture hasn't been edited \u2013 Corbyn did give a speech at the National Coal Mining Museum while clutching the DVD., 8:B - As yet \u2013 unlike when Johnny Marr told David Cameron that he wasn't allowed to like the Smiths \u2013 none of the surviving members of the band appear to have responded., 9:A - The journalist Tim Walker would have been standing to be an MP for the first time. Duffield's majority is only 187 and it is thought that the split Labour/Liberal Democrat vote will enable the Tories to gain the seat., 10:D - The Labour party in Wales said it hadn't realised the production company had used an actor for the video. The rules on election broadcasts say the \u201cuse of reconstructions or actors in a broadcast must be made clear to the audience\u201d., 11:D - As well as wanting to roll back women's rights to the Middle Ages, they appeared to be trying to roll back the spelling of the north-east London district to the Middle Ages too. Wilcumstowe is how the town appeared in the Domesday book. Walfamstow is, of course, how it is pronounced., 12:A - As you imagine, absolutely nobody on social media immediately made a joke about it having \u00a3350m emblazoned on the side. It could have been worse, it could have been London (Garden) Bridge Is Falling Down.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"4\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Excellent job.

And those who chose the ethical fund have made the best returns.</p> <p>Figures provided exclusively to Guardian Money by <a href=\"https://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/nest.html\" title=\"\">Nest</a> (National Employment Savings Trust) \u2013 which boasts 8.5 million members \u2013 are good news for those putting aside money for their future.</p> <p>But they also reveal that a decent chunk of Britons\u2019 retirement cash is riding on the fortunes of Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/nest.html\" title=\"\">Nest </a>is a publicly owned scheme set up by the government as part of the so-called \u201cautomatic enrolment\u201d retirement saving initiative designed to get millions more people paying into a pension.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jul/13/pensions-automatic-enrolment-pay\" title=\"\">This kicked off in October 2012</a> and requires all employers to automatically put eligible workers into a workplace pension where both the worker and employer pay some money in. So what have we learned so far?</p> <h2><strong>Nest is big and getting bigger</strong></h2> <p>The 8.5 million members make up roughly a quarter of UK workers. By the late 2020s, one-third of the working population is expected to have a Nest pension pot.</p> <p>As of the end of September this year, it had \u00a38.3bn of assets under management \u2013 but with about \u00a3450m in new contributions flooding in every month, forecasts suggest this will swell to \u00a320bn by 2022.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"247bee3be78d14c510e685247c70fe1f29b7f451\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/247bee3be78d14c510e685247c70fe1f29b7f451/0_46_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nest workplace pensions booklet and documents\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nest scheme has helped get millions more people saving.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Avpics/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>It has turned \u00a32,000 into \u00a36,000 (sort of)</strong></h2> <p>Nest says that in just seven years, some of its savers have tripled their money, once you factor in employer contributions and investment returns. That far outstrips what you could have got from other savings products such as Isas, it adds.</p> <p>We had asked Nest to provide performance data, plus figures for how much people who joined the scheme at the start might have in their pots now.</p> <p>It based its calculations on someone on an average annual full-time income of \u00a329,588 who made pension contributions each month at the minimum level. It says that, assuming this person started paying in at the start of October 2012, and was put into its default \u201c2040 retirement date fund\u201d, they would have a pot worth just under \u00a36,000 as at the end of September. </p> <p>The individual would have paid in \u00a32,070, their employer, \u00a32,097. They then get \u00a3517 of tax relief on top, and benefited from \u00a31,368 of investment growth. But then you need to lop off Nest\u2019s charges, amounting to \u00a3127 in this case.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s often said that paying into a workplace pension is a no-brainer, and maybe here\u2019s the proof: early investors into Britain\u2019s biggest auto-enrolment scheme have tripled their money in seven years. And those who chose the ethical fund have made the best returns. Figures provided exclusively to Guardian Money by Nest (National Employment Savings Trust) \u2013 which boasts 8.5 million members \u2013 are good news for those putting aside money for their future. But they also reveal that a decent chunk of Britons\u2019 retirement cash is riding on the fortunes of Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon. Nest is a publicly owned scheme set up by the government as part of the so-called \u201cautomatic enrolment\u201d retirement saving initiative designed to get millions more people paying into a pension. This kicked off in October 2012 and requires all employers to automatically put eligible workers into a workplace pension where both the worker and employer pay some money in. So what have we learned so far? Nest is big and getting bigger The 8.5 million members make up roughly a quarter of UK workers. By the late 2020s, one-third of the working population is expected to have a Nest pension pot. As of the end of September this year, it had \u00a38.3bn of assets under management \u2013 but with about \u00a3450m in new contributions flooding in every month, forecasts suggest this will swell to \u00a320bn by 2022. It has turned \u00a32,000 into \u00a36,000 (sort of) Nest says that in just seven years, some of its savers have tripled their money, once you factor in employer contributions and investment returns. That far outstrips what you could have got from other savings products such as Isas, it adds. We had asked Nest to provide performance data, plus figures for how much people who joined the scheme at the start might have in their pots now. It based its calculations on someone on an average annual full-time income of \u00a329,588 who made pension contributions each month at the minimum level. It says that, assuming this person started paying in at the start of October 2012, and was put into its default \u201c2040 retirement date fund\u201d, they would have a pot worth just under \u00a36,000 as at the end of September. The individual would have paid in \u00a32,070, their employer, \u00a32,097. They then get \u00a3517 of tax relief on top, and benefited from \u00a31,368 of investment growth. But then you need to lop off Nest\u2019s charges, amounting to \u00a3127 in this case. That gives you \u00a35,924. However, the figure for its \u201chigher risk\u201d fund is \u00a36,241. And for its ethical fund \u00a36,258. Ethical investments deliver the best returns Or at least they have in this case, as can be seen from the above. Nest members who have opted to \u201cgo green\u201d will be cheering their decision, because the ethical fund has delivered a cumulative return of 116% over seven years. Its higher risk fund, for those happy to take a bit more risk, delivered 115%. Meanwhile, the 2040 retirement date fund produced 90%. While people are initially put into the appropriate retirement date fund for their age (there are 49), they are free to switch into a fund that better matches their priorities. Nest can\u2019t be accused of ignoring the climate emergency and other issues around sustainable investing. In February 2017 it announced it would be shifting a chunk of its retirement date fund investment cash into a new climate change fund designed to move people\u2019s money out of fossil fuels and into renewable energy. This so-called \u201cclimate aware\u201d fund had about \u00a3750m in it in March this year, but the figure now stands at more than \u00a31.1bn. And in June this year Nest announced it would be going tobacco-free across all its investments, though it estimated this would take up to two years. There are other funds that have provided a better return A typical global investment fund has delivered about 110% to 120% over the seven years in question, so Nest has largely matched that. But some funds have done a lot better: the \u00a318bn Fundsmith Equity Fund has achieved more than 250% return over the same period. But most experts say you can\u2019t really beat a workplace pension, because it comes not only with tax relief, but also with a valuable employer contribution. Nest seems to really, really like US tech companies As of September, the top five shareholdings for both the 2040 retirement date fund and the higher risk fund were, in order, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (aka Google), Amazon and Facebook. Meanwhile, in the case of its ethical fund, more than 9% of all the money going into shares was invested in Microsoft and Apple. Nest has a sharia fund And it\u2019s open to anyone. The investments \u2013 entirely in equities \u2013 are screened by Islamic scholars to meet sharia standards. Again, you had better like big tech firms: as of September, a chunky 22% was invested in Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook.",

But officers are telling candidates that comments that are rude, distasteful or shocking are likely to be considered as freedom of expression and not a potential crime. Candidates have been urged not to go knocking on doors while canvassing alone and not to dismiss abuse or threats without reporting them to police. Since the murder of Jo Cox in 2016 there has been heightened anxiety about the threats MPs and politicians receive, and tensions have been inflamed by Brexit. Reports of threats and harassment from around the country will be analysed by a national police unit to identify any emerging trends, such as threats being organised or directed against a specific type of candidate. Assessment will be carried out daily and 43 forces will brief every candidate on danger signs and how to keep safe. The Guardian understands that counter-terrorism investigators are stepping up work to spot threats from Islamist or far-right extremists.

      "body": "<p>The film-maker and television producer Peter Adam, who has died aged 90, was described by David Attenborough as \u201cone of the key figures who helped to establish the character of BBC Two during its golden age\u201d. He joined the BBC in 1968 and as a director and producer during the next 22 years made more than 100 documentaries on art and culture.</p> <p>He had started his career working in the BBC\u2019s current affairs division with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview12\" title=\"\">James Mossman</a>, the star reporter of Panorama, but when Jim became disenchanted with the sight of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/aug/08/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Robin Day</a> in his bow tie, Peter followed him to the music and arts department, producing first for Review, the weekly arts magazine programme. At music and arts, Peter walked the corridors of Kensington House in his bottle-green three-piece suits, flamboyant ties and general air of having just stepped off the catwalk of a fashion parade: this endeared him to just about everybody he met.</p> <p>In spite of the fact that the BBC had marked his security file with a note accusing him of being a communist from East Berlin, Peter worked at the corporation happily and productively until compulsory retirement at the age of 60. His programmes included profiles of Jorge Luis Borges, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Herbert von Karajan, Andy Warhol, Richard Strauss and \u2013 my personal favourite \u2013 the surrealist Man Ray.</p> <p>In 1987 he wrote a biography of the architect and designer Eileen Gray (revised in 2000), and his two-part documentary film Art in the Third Reich for the Omnibus series won the Bafta for best arts programme in 1990, with a book of the same title following in 1992. His documentaries Spirit of Place: Lawrence Durrell\u2019s Greece (1976) and George Gershwin Remembered (1987) were both nominated for Bafta awards.</p> <p>Nazi art was a subject Peter was well qualified to discuss. He was born Klaus-Peter in Berlin, of a Jewish father, Walter, and a Protestant mother, Luise (nee Gurke), which meant he was classified as a \u201c<em>Mischling</em>\u201d or \u201chalf-Jew\u201d under Nazi racial laws. His father, who was forced to leave his job and then died of lung cancer in 1935, had his children baptised into the Catholic church, which, according to Peter, was better at defending its own than the Protestant version.</p> <p>He grew up with his twin sister, Renate, in 1930s Berlin, overshadowed by the constant fear of persecution, attending a school where his mother was forced to make small talk with Magda, the wife of Joseph Goebbels. As a <em>Mischling</em> he was not allowed to stay in school beyond 14.</p> <p>During the second world war he lived between Berlin and Austria, and after it went to the <a href=\"https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html\" title=\"\">Free University in Berlin</a>, where he performed as an actor in front of Helene Weigel and Bertolt Brecht, who advised him not to look at the audience when acting. From there, via a career as a \u201csmalltime diplomat\u201d, as he described it, and a spell in the US with an advertising agency, he came to Britain in 1959, where he finally felt at home, joining the BBC in the late 1960s.</p> <p>How could Peter possibly not look at the audience? He spent his life looking at the interesting people in the world and he was on first-name terms with a lot of them: Jean Cocteau, the composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/27/hans-werner-henze\" title=\"\">Hans Werner Henze</a>, David Hockney \u2013 these were all people he knew, not just celebrities about whom he made films. </p> <p>In 1995 he published an autobiography, Not Drowning But Waving.

      "bodyText": "The film-maker and television producer Peter Adam, who has died aged 90, was described by David Attenborough as \u201cone of the key figures who helped to establish the character of BBC Two during its golden age\u201d. He joined the BBC in 1968 and as a director and producer during the next 22 years made more than 100 documentaries on art and culture. He had started his career working in the BBC\u2019s current affairs division with James Mossman, the star reporter of Panorama, but when Jim became disenchanted with the sight of Robin Day in his bow tie, Peter followed him to the music and arts department, producing first for Review, the weekly arts magazine programme. At music and arts, Peter walked the corridors of Kensington House in his bottle-green three-piece suits, flamboyant ties and general air of having just stepped off the catwalk of a fashion parade: this endeared him to just about everybody he met. In spite of the fact that the BBC had marked his security file with a note accusing him of being a communist from East Berlin, Peter worked at the corporation happily and productively until compulsory retirement at the age of 60. His programmes included profiles of Jorge Luis Borges, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Herbert von Karajan, Andy Warhol, Richard Strauss and \u2013 my personal favourite \u2013 the surrealist Man Ray. In 1987 he wrote a biography of the architect and designer Eileen Gray (revised in 2000), and his two-part documentary film Art in the Third Reich for the Omnibus series won the Bafta for best arts programme in 1990, with a book of the same title following in 1992. His documentaries Spirit of Place: Lawrence Durrell\u2019s Greece (1976) and George Gershwin Remembered (1987) were both nominated for Bafta awards. Nazi art was a subject Peter was well qualified to discuss. He was born Klaus-Peter in Berlin, of a Jewish father, Walter, and a Protestant mother, Luise (nee Gurke), which meant he was classified as a \u201cMischling\u201d or \u201chalf-Jew\u201d under Nazi racial laws. His father, who was forced to leave his job and then died of lung cancer in 1935, had his children baptised into the Catholic church, which, according to Peter, was better at defending its own than the Protestant version. He grew up with his twin sister, Renate, in 1930s Berlin, overshadowed by the constant fear of persecution, attending a school where his mother was forced to make small talk with Magda, the wife of Joseph Goebbels. As a Mischling he was not allowed to stay in school beyond 14. During the second world war he lived between Berlin and Austria, and after it went to the Free University in Berlin, where he performed as an actor in front of Helene Weigel and Bertolt Brecht, who advised him not to look at the audience when acting. From there, via a career as a \u201csmalltime diplomat\u201d, as he described it, and a spell in the US with an advertising agency, he came to Britain in 1959, where he finally felt at home, joining the BBC in the late 1960s. How could Peter possibly not look at the audience? He spent his life looking at the interesting people in the world and he was on first-name terms with a lot of them: Jean Cocteau, the composer Hans Werner Henze, David Hockney \u2013 these were all people he knew, not just celebrities about whom he made films. In 1995 he published an autobiography, Not Drowning But Waving. It is a book worth reading, not only for his graphic account of life under Hitler, but also for its unfailing generosity and humour about what Peter really loved \u2013 other people. He was gifted with unfailing optimism and an incurable sense of fun. There was a story current in the department many years ago that Peter had once spent a night with Rock Hudson. Rochelle, as Hudson was called by some, turned up on his doorstep, unannounced. \u201cI have no idea how he got my number,\u201d Peter told a breathless audience of young BBC employees. \u201cI felt like Doris Day.\u201d In his retirement he divided his time between Britain and France, where in 2013 he married his long-term partner, the actor Facundo Bo. Facundo died in 2016. \u2022 Peter Adam, film-maker and producer, born 3 August 1929; died 28 September 2019",

Roast for 35-40 minutes, until the pumpkin is soft and golden around the edges.</p> <p>For the gremolata, roughly chop the parsley, chilli and pistachios, and put in a bowl with the remaining gremolata ingredients.

Return the tray to the oven and roast for a further five to 10 minutes, until the pumpkin is soft and the breadcrumbs are golden.</p> <p>When cool enough to handle, squeeze out the soft garlic flesh from the bulb and either mix into the natural yoghurt, or simply squeeze straight on to the plate, so you have sweet, soft garlic alongside the pumpkin.</p> <p>Serve with the yoghurt and a lemon-dressed salad, and top with a final drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.</p> <h2>Winter panzanella</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e1637c04490dbce6aa513011befccf6e19125c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e1637c04490dbce6aa513011befccf6e19125c1/0_0_4000_4264/938.jpg\" alt=\"Packed full of energy: Anna Jones\u2019 winter panzanella.\" width=\"938\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Packed full of energy: Anna Jones\u2019 winter panzanella.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Russell/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A winter version of my all-time favourite salad.

      "bodyText": "For me, it\u2019s OK to eat a salad in winter if it has carbs in it. Namely, bread: torn craggy pieces or golden crumbs with soft, roast winter roots and herbs. Today\u2019s recipes are a great way to make the most of any stale or leftover bread, and are halfway between a salad and a traybake \u2013 equally good eaten piping hot from the oven or at room temperature a little later. Winter means carbs in my house \u2013 even in a salad. Roast pumpkin and pistachio gremolata (pictured above) These honeyed breadcrumbs are my new favourite topping. Here, they are baked with the squash for extra crispness, and this recipe works with almost any root veg. Prep 30 min Cook 50 min Serves 4-6 1 medium pumpkin (approx 1kg), deseeded, skin on and cut into 2cm wedges 1 garlic bulb, unpeeled 3 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp red-wine vinegar Salt and black pepper For the breadcrumb gremolata 1 small bunch parsley 1 fresh red chilli, deseeded 30g shelled pistachios 75g breadcrumbs Zest of 1 unwaxed lemon 1 tbsp runny honey 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for serving Salt and black pepper To serve 250g natural yoghurt Heat the oven to 190C (170C)/gas 5. Put the pumpkin wedges into a large baking tray, add the garlic bulb, olive oil, vinegar and salt and pepper, then toss until evenly coated. If the baking tray is overcrowded, split the pumpkin between two trays so it sits in a single layer. Roast for 35-40 minutes, until the pumpkin is soft and golden around the edges. For the gremolata, roughly chop the parsley, chilli and pistachios, and put in a bowl with the remaining gremolata ingredients. Mix so everything is coated in the oil and honey. Remove the tray from the oven and sprinkle the gremolata evenly over the pumpkin. Return the tray to the oven and roast for a further five to 10 minutes, until the pumpkin is soft and the breadcrumbs are golden. When cool enough to handle, squeeze out the soft garlic flesh from the bulb and either mix into the natural yoghurt, or simply squeeze straight on to the plate, so you have sweet, soft garlic alongside the pumpkin. Serve with the yoghurt and a lemon-dressed salad, and top with a final drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Winter panzanella A winter version of my all-time favourite salad. While there\u2019s no beating the traditional tomato one, swapping in winter roots and roast shallots brings a welcome juiciness. Prep 25 min Cook 35 min Serves 4-6 4 banana shallots, peeled and halved 4 garlic cloves, unpeeled 200g red grapes 400g root vegetables, chopped into rough 2cm chunks Olive oil Salt and black pepper 150g sourdough bread, torn into 2cm chunks 2 sprigs sage, leaves picked 1 small bunch parsley, leaves picked and stalks finely chopped 2 tbsp baby capers 350g winter greens (kale, sprout tops or purple sprouting broccoli) For the dressing 1 tsp dijon mustard \u00bd unwaxed lemon: juice and zest 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil Heat the oven to 190C (170C)/gas 5. Put the shallots, garlic cloves, grapes and root vegetables into a large baking tray, then add two tablespoons of olive oil and some salt and pepper. Roast for 25 minutes, until the root veg is starting to soften. Remove the tray from the oven and add the sourdough, sage, parsley stalks and capers, and toss. Add two more tablespoons of oil and bake for a further 10 minutes, until everything is tender and golden, adding the greens for the last five minutes. In a jar or small bowl, shake or whisk together the dressing ingredients, then pour over the tray, scatter with the parsley leaves, toss and serve.",

      "bodyText": "The Crown With Olivia Colman as the now \u201csettled monarch\u201d, this third series of The Crown follows the 13 years from 1964 to the Silver Jubilee \u2013 and there is much ground to cover. Helena Bonham Carter is on excellent form as Princess Margaret, while Colman gives the Queen some much-needed emotionality amid continuing power-grabbing crises. From Sunday 17 November, Netflix Making Beyonc\u00e9 From Destiny\u2019s Child to Queen B, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles has been a fixture of pop stardom ever since her golden-voiced debut in the early 1990s. This three-part pod from the makers of Serial talks to key figures, such as her father and childhood friends, about her rapid rise to fame and now massive fortune. Podcast Rick and Morty Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland\u2019s chaotic animation about a deranged genius scientist and his shy grandson\u2019s missions around the universe returns for its much-anticipated fourth series. Expect the usual dose of nihilism, crude gags and intergalactic violence. Wednesday 20 November, 10pm, E4 Boom, Bust &amp; Bankers Built in 1985 as a shining new testament to Margaret Thatcher\u2019s mass market deregulation, London\u2019s Broadgate complex now houses 28 international banks and has weathered multiple recessions as well as the looming uncertainty of Brexit. This documentary takes an in-depth look at the staff who keep Broadgate running, as well as the changing face of our economy. Tuesday 19 November, 9pm, Channel 4 Reggie in China Reggie Yates is in one of China\u2019s fastest growing cities, Shenzhen, for the start of his new series travelling around the country. Home to hundreds of startup-founding expats, he explores the city\u2019s tech novelties \u2013 including an instant translation earpiece and a sci-fi flying motorcycle. Sunday 17 November, 9pm, BBC Two The War of the Worlds HG Wells\u2019s dystopian tale of 19th-century Martian invasion gets an ornate visual update in this BBC adaptation, starring a stoic Rafe Spall as journalist George and bright-eyed Eleanor Tomlinson as his lover Amy. Packed with cinematic special effects, this unfolding sinister drama is sure to be a crowdpleaser for the darkening nights to come. Sunday 17 November, 9pm, BBC One Dolly Parton\u2019s Heartstrings A must-see for Dolly fans, this anthology series pairs Parton\u2019s classic country tearjerkers with episodic stories inspired by her music.

From Friday 22 November, Netflix Vienna Blood Freudian psychology and Sherlock Holmes-style murder mystery combine in this involved take on Frank Tallis\u2019s Liebermann novels. The titular Liebermann is a trainee doctor roped into helping stern detective Oskar Rheinhardt solve the city\u2019s more cerebral murders. With a 90-minute opening episode, it\u2019s a long, wordy ride through the unconscious. Monday 18 November, BBC Two, 9pm I\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! Ready the insects as Ant and Dec return to the Aussie jungle for another year of public-voted celebrity trauma. Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright, Nadine Coyle and Jacqueline Jossa are now confirmed among the lineup; expect all present in the jungle to be facing their fears and dining on some questionable meal choices. 45 Years There is no escaping the past in Andrew Haigh\u2019s riveting domestic drama. Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay are bleakly brilliant as Kate and Geoff Mercer, living in rural Norfolk and planning a big 45th-anniversary party; but a letter from Switzerland raises the ghost of Geoff\u2019s long-lost love in a searchingly intelligent, sad and truthful tale. Wednesday 20 November, 1.55am, Channel 4",

A question about his family life at the end put Johnson into a visibly uncomfortable spot and caused a few moments of stammering as the PM struggled to tell Munchetty how people could relate to him as a family man. Johnson said he wanted every child in the country to have \u201cthe most amazing opportunities\u201d, and in order to achieve that, Brexit needed to get done. Munchetty said she would like to get a \u201cfeel\u201d for who he was, and played a clip of him awkwardly prodding a mop at a puddle somewhere, prompting her to question whether the PM had ever used a mop before.",

      "body": "<p>As I sit at the dinner table with my kids, I reminisce about the time I was in a French restaurant in the early noughties. I remember looking at the menu and without hesitation ordering steak. Horse steak.</p> <p>I was a daredevil in my 20s and my palate was a force to be reckoned with. My gut was gutsy; I didn\u2019t think twice about ordering the most adventurous (or in some people\u2019s minds, obnoxious) thing on the menu. \u201cI\u2019m having snails to start and horse for main. Where\u2019s the frog legs?\u201d My dining out motto was: you have to try things at least once.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure what happened in my early 30s, but all of a sudden the idea of stepping out of my comfort zone and entering uncharted territories filled me with a deeply unpleasant emotion. I became <em>that</em> person who orders the same dish at every restaurant (burger and chips), always drinks the same alcoholic beverage (beer), and only ever listens to one genre of music (indie) \u2013 no compromise. I was officially stuck in my ways.</p> <p>Now in my 40s, I\u2019m married with three kids who my wife and I have spent 10 years raising to be inquisitive people and adventurous eaters. Against this backdrop of intrepid enthusiasm, my extremely dull peculiarity seems pathetic. How can I encourage my children to become open-minded adults if I continue to morph ever deeper into the role of \u201cuncompromising dad\u201d?</p> <p>Back at the dinner table, I\u2019ve decided that strength in numbers is the way forward, so I recruit my wife and two eldest kids to join me in a foodie experiment (the smallest gets a pass \u2013 he\u2019s still experiencing daily \u201cfirsts\u201d as it is).</p> <p>So, what culinary first should we try? A cruffin (the delectable-sounding love child of a croissant and muffin)? A wacky flavour of imported crisps from the corner shop? No, of course not \u2013 that would be too easy, and almost definitely delicious. Instead, my girls have decided they\u2019d like to try jackfruit after hearing about it in a school assembly about living a more eco-friendly life.</p> <p>Jackfruit? What on earth is jackfruit and where do I buy it? After carrying out some thorough research (used extensively in south and south-east Asian cooking for main meals and desserts \u2013 love Wikipedia), the fear set in. It\u2019s going to be horrible. Why would anyone eat a fruit from the fig family for dinner? What\u2019s wrong with chicken nuggets and chips for tea? This culinary first is going to be a disgusting disaster.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-power-of-firsts/2019/nov/15/getting-naked-in-public-for-the-first-time-was-an-important-rite-of-passage\">Getting naked in public for the first time was an important rite of passage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite my initial reservations (read: deep unease), it turns out jackfruit is pretty easy to find these days, and even easier to cook. Following the instructions on the back of the tin (small steps, people), I serve \u201cpulled\u201d jackfruit in tacos with all the trimmings and watch in anticipation of the \u201cdelight\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d faces from my girls. As they dig in, I brace myself for my first bite, anxiously reminding myself that the horse steak was actually wonderful. The snails were pretty tasty too.</p> <p>The thrill of tasting something new for the first time in years was only bettered by the magic of seeing my children eagerly devour their experimental dinner. It reminded me of all those foodie \u201cfirsts\u201d I watched them experience as babies \u2013 it was awesome to witness it again, and the sense of parental relief was exhilarating. One day, my kids will remember the first time they tried jackfruit, and hopefully it will spark the memory of trying it with me.</p> <p>With dinner proving a huge success, we\u2019ve decided we\u2019re going to try a new vegan dish every month.

      "bodyText": "As I sit at the dinner table with my kids, I reminisce about the time I was in a French restaurant in the early noughties. I remember looking at the menu and without hesitation ordering steak. Horse steak. I was a daredevil in my 20s and my palate was a force to be reckoned with. My gut was gutsy; I didn\u2019t think twice about ordering the most adventurous (or in some people\u2019s minds, obnoxious) thing on the menu. \u201cI\u2019m having snails to start and horse for main. Where\u2019s the frog legs?\u201d My dining out motto was: you have to try things at least once. I\u2019m not sure what happened in my early 30s, but all of a sudden the idea of stepping out of my comfort zone and entering uncharted territories filled me with a deeply unpleasant emotion. I became that person who orders the same dish at every restaurant (burger and chips), always drinks the same alcoholic beverage (beer), and only ever listens to one genre of music (indie) \u2013 no compromise. I was officially stuck in my ways. Now in my 40s, I\u2019m married with three kids who my wife and I have spent 10 years raising to be inquisitive people and adventurous eaters. Against this backdrop of intrepid enthusiasm, my extremely dull peculiarity seems pathetic. How can I encourage my children to become open-minded adults if I continue to morph ever deeper into the role of \u201cuncompromising dad\u201d? Back at the dinner table, I\u2019ve decided that strength in numbers is the way forward, so I recruit my wife and two eldest kids to join me in a foodie experiment (the smallest gets a pass \u2013 he\u2019s still experiencing daily \u201cfirsts\u201d as it is). So, what culinary first should we try? A cruffin (the delectable-sounding love child of a croissant and muffin)? A wacky flavour of imported crisps from the corner shop? No, of course not \u2013 that would be too easy, and almost definitely delicious. Instead, my girls have decided they\u2019d like to try jackfruit after hearing about it in a school assembly about living a more eco-friendly life. Jackfruit? What on earth is jackfruit and where do I buy it? After carrying out some thorough research (used extensively in south and south-east Asian cooking for main meals and desserts \u2013 love Wikipedia), the fear set in. It\u2019s going to be horrible. Why would anyone eat a fruit from the fig family for dinner? What\u2019s wrong with chicken nuggets and chips for tea? This culinary first is going to be a disgusting disaster. Despite my initial reservations (read: deep unease), it turns out jackfruit is pretty easy to find these days, and even easier to cook. Following the instructions on the back of the tin (small steps, people), I serve \u201cpulled\u201d jackfruit in tacos with all the trimmings and watch in anticipation of the \u201cdelight\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d faces from my girls. As they dig in, I brace myself for my first bite, anxiously reminding myself that the horse steak was actually wonderful. The snails were pretty tasty too. The thrill of tasting something new for the first time in years was only bettered by the magic of seeing my children eagerly devour their experimental dinner. It reminded me of all those foodie \u201cfirsts\u201d I watched them experience as babies \u2013 it was awesome to witness it again, and the sense of parental relief was exhilarating. One day, my kids will remember the first time they tried jackfruit, and hopefully it will spark the memory of trying it with me. With dinner proving a huge success, we\u2019ve decided we\u2019re going to try a new vegan dish every month. Next up, seitan burgers (small steps, people).

Daniel Krause, a full-time \u201ccruiser\u201d, helps to run the Sailboat Hitchhikers and Crew Connection Facebook group, which has sharply increased to nearly 21,000 members since Thunberg\u2019s voyage. \u201cIn the past couple of weeks it has skyrocketed,\u201d he said. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5947407-4f95-41fe-849d-e7d9248ebcb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

Hitchhikers need to be aware that there are forces way bigger than the will of the people on the boat; it might be that the weather decides for you where you go.\u201d</p> \n<p>There are dozens of Facebook groups and sites offering similar services. <a href=\"https://www.sailingnetworks.com/\">SailingNetworks</a> was set up in 2004, originally branded as Crew Reunited to help boat crews stay in touch after a voyage. Now budding crew members set up profiles on the site to find captains willing to take them on.</p> \n<p>According to company director Jeremy Pocock, \u201cyounger people are seeing the opportunities to explore by getting on a boat as much more realistic than they might have done in the past\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Hitching a ride on a sailing boat across the Atlantic might sound like a far-fetched endeavour reserved for the famous and well-connected. But Greta Thunberg has now managed it twice in three months \u2013 and her antics appear to be inspiring a growing, if nascent, movement in sail-hitching. Maritime hitchhiking has hitherto been reserved for sailors looking for experience on different routes and vessels. But after Thunberg\u2019s transatlantic adventures, numbers have boomed. Daniel Krause, a full-time \u201ccruiser\u201d, helps to run the Sailboat Hitchhikers and Crew Connection Facebook group, which has sharply increased to nearly 21,000 members since Thunberg\u2019s voyage. \u201cIn the past couple of weeks it has skyrocketed,\u201d he said. People use the site to find crew members for their boat, or to find a vessel to hitchhike on. \u201cIt\u2019s mutually beneficial,\u201d says Krause. \u201cYou get a mostly free ride and the owner gets someone who can do nightshifts or who can help out with docking, anchoring and boat manoeuvres.\u201d In most instances, hitchhikers just pay for transport to and from the boat, any visas they might need, and contribute to boat running costs like food. However, Krause has found many of the group newbies don\u2019t have previous sailing experience. \u201cMany people don\u2019t understand about the movement of a boat on the ocean which can overwhelm people with seasickness and make them feel trapped because it\u2019s a very small space and you could be out there for days if not weeks - and once you\u2019re out, it\u2019s almost always too late to turn back,\u201d he says. \u201cSailboats can only go with weather and wind. Hitchhikers need to be aware that there are forces way bigger than the will of the people on the boat; it might be that the weather decides for you where you go.\u201d There are dozens of Facebook groups and sites offering similar services. SailingNetworks was set up in 2004, originally branded as Crew Reunited to help boat crews stay in touch after a voyage. Now budding crew members set up profiles on the site to find captains willing to take them on. According to company director Jeremy Pocock, \u201cyounger people are seeing the opportunities to explore by getting on a boat as much more realistic than they might have done in the past\u201d. He advises that anyone considering boat hitchhiking goes for a test run first, and then goes for a drink with the captain and crew afterwards, to ensure compatibility with both the vessel itself and the other personalities on board. Lawrence Herbert, a 22-year-old psychology graduate, is currently hitching rides on boats around the world to build up his already quite extensive sailing experience. He\u2019s had some scary incidents over the years, which he says beginners might not be prepared for. \u201cI\u2019ve had a big sail stuck at the top of the mast with too much wind which was pretty terrifying. Someone had to go up to the top of the mast in pretty bad weather and cut the sail down, which is about as bad as it gets.\u201d He\u2019s currently en route to Southampton, where he\u2019s got a place on a boat heading across the Atlantic to Saint Martin in the Caribbean, and has noticed a huge increase in aspiring boat travellers this year. \u201cI do think the Greta Thunberg effect is huge.

After giving up on trying to take the lion\u2019s share of the prime Premier League rights from Sky, after several rounds of auctions that resulted in eye-watering inflation, BT relies on the Champions League rights as the crown jewel sports offering for its pay-TV service.</p> <p>Philip Jansen, BT\u2019s chief executive, who took over from Gavin Patterson in February, has highlighted the importance of Champions League football to the company\u2019s TV strategy. BT\u2019s call centres, he said, had seen an \u201castounding\u201d amount of traffic from fans seeking to sign up as Liverpool and Tottenham prepared to play the first all-English final since 2008.

      "bodyText": "BT Sport has retained the rights to the Champions League until 2024 but has been unable to cut its \u00a31.2bn bill after having to see off offers from Sky and ITV. BT, which has aired Champions League football since 2015 after beating the then joint holders Sky and ITV with a blockbuster bid, has secured the exclusive UK rights to the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League, which is due to start in 2021. Following a dip in the value of the last Premier League rights auction \u2013 Sky shaved \u00a3200m a year off its previous deal \u2013 BT was hoping to please investors by potentially reducing its current \u00a31.2bn deal by \u00a350m to \u00a3100m a season. BT is paying \u00a3400m a year in its new three-season deal, a little more than the \u00a3394m a year paid under its current deal to exclusively air live matches and highlights. However, BT has secured more value from its latest deal. It will air 420 games from the Champions League, Europa League and the Europa Conference League, an increase of 77 matches. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to remain the home of Uefa Champion\u2019s League in the UK,\u201d said Marc Allera, chief executive of BT\u2019s consumer division. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited to continue to bring our world-class coverage to one of the most exciting global football competitions in the world.\u201d Renewed interest from Sky and ITV, which was looking to bring some matches back to free-to-air TV, meant that BT could not afford to put in a lower offer and risk losing the rights. After giving up on trying to take the lion\u2019s share of the prime Premier League rights from Sky, after several rounds of auctions that resulted in eye-watering inflation, BT relies on the Champions League rights as the crown jewel sports offering for its pay-TV service. Philip Jansen, BT\u2019s chief executive, who took over from Gavin Patterson in February, has highlighted the importance of Champions League football to the company\u2019s TV strategy. BT\u2019s call centres, he said, had seen an \u201castounding\u201d amount of traffic from fans seeking to sign up as Liverpool and Tottenham prepared to play the first all-English final since 2008. BT Sport says that it saw a 26% increase in Champions League viewer hours last season. \u201cAll matches will be available across the BT Sport channels and digital services,\u201d said Guy Laurent Epstein, Uefa\u2019s marketing director. \u201cIn addition, UK football fans will be able to enjoy club competition highlights for free on social media each match week, as well as the finals of the Champions League, Europa League and newly formed Europa Conference League.\u201d",

Yovanovitch to testify on state department\u2019s fear of Trump The Democrats are clarifying their case against Donald Trump, after Nancy Pelosi described the president\u2019s demand for dirt on Joe Biden from Ukraine, in return for military aid, as \u201cbribery\u201d: a specific, impeachable offence. \u201cThe cover-up makes what Nixon did look almost small,\u201d the House speaker said. On Friday, the second day of impeachment hearings, the former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch is expected to testify about how she was undermined by the state department\u2019s fear of crossing Trump. Giuliani jokes. The president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, a central figure in the unfolding Ukraine scandal, has joked in an interview with the Guardian that he has \u201cvery good [health] insurance\u201d, in case Trump \u201cthrows him under a bus\u201d. Tax returns. Trump has turned to the supreme court in his battle to prevent his tax returns going public, asking justices to block a subpoena for the documents from the Manhattan district attorney. At least two dead in shooting at Santa Clarita high school At least two students were killed and three injured after a 16-year-old boy opened fire at Saugus high school in Santa Clarita, southern California, on Thursday morning. The victims were a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy. Officials said three other injured teenagers remain in hospital, while the student suspect, who ended the attack by turning the gun on himself, was said to be in grave condition. Walmart reopens. The Walmart in El Paso, Texas, where a gunman targeting Mexicans killed 22 people in August, reopened on Thursday as the city continues to come to terms with one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern US history. Recycling awareness day is cover for polluters, say critics The EPA is vigorously promoting Friday\u2019s second annual America Recycles Day as an opportunity to encourage Americans to recycle more. But critics say the event, backed by the likes of Coca-Cola and Nestl\u00e9, is really just a cover for corporations that produce a vast amount of single-use plastic waste that ends up as pollution. Just 9% of plastics are recycled, while worldwide production is expected to rise by 40% over the next decade. Toxic Indonesia. A study has found the human food chain in Indonesia is being contaminated by extreme levels of toxins, which it blames in part on the high levels of hazardous chemicals produced by plastic waste imports to the country. Hong Kong protesters reopen highway after violent week After one of the most violent weeks of protest since the unrest in Hong Kong began in June, pro-democracy demonstrators have reopened a blocked highway on condition that local elections proceed as planned on 24 November. A 70-year-old man was killed in clashes between protesters and pro-China residents on Thursday, as foreign universities urged exchange students in Hong Kong to return home, and two large companies with interests in the territory reported lower profits as a result of the crisis. London protest. Hong Kong\u2019s justice minister, Teresa Cheng, fell to the ground after being surrounded by demonstrators shouting \u201cshame on you\u201d during a visit to London on Thursday. \u2018Mini stonehenges\u2019. Demonstrators have dotted Hong Kong\u2019s streets with tiny brick formations designed to slow the progress of charging police, as Verna Yu explains. Cheat sheet The executors of the estate of the late Jeffrey Epstein have asked a judge to approve the creation of a fund to compensate about a dozen women who filed lawsuits accusing the financier of sexually abusing them before his death in August. A 25-year-old US-born woman who left Alabama to join Islamic State in 2014 will remain in limbo in Syria with her young son, after a federal judge sided with the Trump administration in ruling that she is not a US citizen. Facebook is under fire again after being listed as a \u201cgold circle sponsor\u201d for the annual gala dinner of a rightwing legal group, the Federalist Society, which featured Brett Kavanaugh as its keynote speaker on Thursday. Taylor Swift has claimed \u201ctyrannical\u201d music managers Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta, who own the rights to her early albums, are blocking her from performing her old hits at the AMAs, where she is to receive the artist of the decade award. Must-reads Torture report author warns of CIA backsliding In the new film, The Report, Adam Driver plays Daniel Jones, the investigator behind the Senate report on CIA torture during the so-called war on terror. Jones tells Julian Borger the failure to find accountable any of the officials responsible for the torture or the coverup leaves the agency at risk of resorting to illegal methods again in future. Meet the meat industry\u2019s \u2018weapon of mass destruction\u2019 The Washington lobbyist Richard Berman has worked to shield some of the US\u2019s most powerful industries from criticism, earning himself the nickname Dr Evil, among others. Now he\u2019s trying to convince the country that plant-based burgers are no healthier than beef. Jessica Glenza reports. Where are Biden\u2019s millennial supporters? Joe Biden may still be the Democratic frontrunner but, unlike his main rivals, the former vice-president\u2019s supporters are at the older end of the electorate.

      "body": "<p>When Dora Maar died on 16 July 1997 at the age of 89, few people seemed to notice. It took the French newspaper Le Monde \u2013 in her home country \u2013 10 days to publish anything. And when journalists did cotton on, they didn\u2019t seem to think Maar was the story. The New York Times called her <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/26/arts/dora-maar-a-muse-of-picasso-is-dead-at-89.html\">\u201ca muse of Picasso\u201d</a> and the \u201cprincipal model for many of his so-called weeping women portraits in the late 30s and early 40s\u201d. The Independent, while admitting that Maar had been an artist in her own right, suggested that she would nonetheless be <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/obituary-dora-maar-1243324.html\">\u201cremembered as the most poignant of Pablo</a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/obituary-dora-maar-1243324.html\"> Picasso\u2019s mistresses\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Forget that she\u2019d also been a major surrealist photographer, one of the few women in that circle, and that she was still painting into her 80s. <a href=\"https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/essay/a-witness-to-guernica-picassos-weeping-woman/\">For critics, she was Picasso\u2019s Weeping Woman</a> \u2013 the eternally spurned mistress and muse. Maar herself bitterly resented being regarded as a sort of art-world Miss Havisham, the subject of someone else\u2019s picture. \u201cAll [Picasso\u2019s] portraits of me are lies,\u201d she once said. \u201cNot one is Dora Maar.\u201d</p> <p>Not before time, the Weeping Woman is having the last laugh. After a spell at the Pompidou in Paris, <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/dora-maar\">a major retrospective is heading to London\u2019s Tate Modern</a> then Los Angeles. The largest exhibition of its kind yet staged, it features nearly 300 objects: photographs, photomontages, advertising mock-ups, self-portraits, watercolours, oil landscapes and still lives. Few of these objects have been exhibited before, and certainly not on this scale. The sense is of a curtain being pulled back. Forget those Picasso portraits: here is how Dora Maar actually wanted to be seen.</p> <p>Born Henriette Th\u00e9odora Markovitch in Paris in 1907, to a French mother who owned a fashion boutique and a father who was a Croatian architect, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dora-Maar\">her upbringing was multicultural</a>. The family relocated to Buenos Aires when she was three, and she spent her childhood shuttling between Europe and South America, taking her first photographs on the sea journeys between. She trained as a painter in Paris, but found herself drawn to photography in the 1920s, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-surrealist-photographer-picassos-muse\">becoming friendly with Henri Cartier-Bresson and Brassa\u00ef</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6fc20d97ac0e4c5e1ff67f3b7f9ef482263e97a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fc20d97ac0e4c5e1ff67f3b7f9ef482263e97a9/0_0_4101_5552/739.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled (1935) by Dora Maar.\" width=\"739\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled (1935) by Dora Maar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe was very ambitious,\u201d says her biographer, Victoria Combalia. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t sure which direction she was going in, but she had such energy.\u201d</p> <p>In 1931, she took the bold step of opening a professional studio. To celebrate this artistic reinvention, Th\u00e9odora Markovitch renamed herself Dora Maar: catchier, more chic.</p> <p>The work the studio did was commercial, but Maar let her imagination roam. One advert from 1934 shows a shampoo bottle on its side, dollops of liquid hair pouring out. In a fashion photograph from the same period, Maar jazzes up a portrait of a female model by covering her skin with yakuza-style tattoos, each painstakingly drawn and coloured by hand.</p> <p>Her sense of playful subversion shines through. Another study for a fashion advert depicts a pearl nestling in a velvet holder in a way that bears more than a passing resemblance to a clitoris (you wonder if male editors noticed).</p> <p>As well as posing for Man Ray and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2018/nov/17/observer-archive-jean-cocteau-november-1950\">Jean Cocteau</a>, Maar was also shooting nude models for so-called <em>revues de charme</em>, erotic magazines. In addition, she showed skill as a documentary photographer, travelling to London and Barcelona and catching droll street images that make some Cartier-Bressons look bland.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s prolific in so many registers,\u201d says Emma Lewis, who has co-curated the exhibition at Tate. \u201cShe knows how to use the camera to make the everyday extraordinary.\u201d </p> <p>By 1935, Maar was entrenched in the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/surrealism\">group of Parisian artists calling themselves surrealists</a>. She had a brief fling with the writer Georges Bataille and became drawn into leftwing circles. Her art became more fantastical and gothic in tone, pushing her techniques to the expressive limit.</p> <p>Some of Maar\u2019s photographs are straightforwardly unsettling, such as her picture of what must be an armadillo foetus, <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/286239\">photographed looking like a monk huddled in his cowl</a>. (Maar refused to be drawn on how she had made the image.) It became one of the most famous surrealist pictures of the period. Others play with the limits of visual impossibility. Particularly vertiginous are a series of photomontages based on architectural photographs. Maar manipulated them in her studio then placed her own photos on top \u2013 the contorted bodies of people she\u2019d seen on the street, bizarre not-quite-human sculptures. Still in her mid-20s, Maar was one of the few photographers Andr\u00e9 Breton and his notoriously sexist acolytes deemed worthy of inclusion in their exhibitions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95d9f2a9fde98f5bb2e0a243c95712d5ecfcbb66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d9f2a9fde98f5bb2e0a243c95712d5ecfcbb66/0_7_2226_2781/800.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Ubu (1936) by Dora Maar.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portrait of Ubu (1936) by Dora Maar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maar had little doubt about her talent, says Combalia. \u201cShe always considered herself a very good artist, and a very good photographer especially. She once told [the gallerist] Marcel Fleiss, \u2018I am as good as Man Ray!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In 1936 she met Picasso, and seems to have decided that the painter, nearly 30 years older, was her next project. The story of the encounter that turned them into lovers has been much mythologised. Legend has it that Maar sat in the famous literary watering hole, the Cafe les Deux Magots, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/8d48a39832557fb9c5e18c32d9fd3587\">playing a game where she stabbed a knife between her fingers to excite Picasso\u2019s attention</a>.</p> <p>Whatever the truth, Combalia suggests that the striking thing is the way it suggests that she, not he, was in charge. \u201cShe wanted to seduce him, I\u2019m sure. The whole scene with the knife is like a sadistic joke, almost a performance.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the balance soon tipped the other way. Picasso was also having <a href=\"https://www.johnszoke.com/essays/marie-thrse-walter\">a long-running affair with Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter</a>, which he refused to break off. He seems to have taken a perverse thrill in making Walter and Maar compete for his affections, describing a story where they came to blows in his studio as \u201cone of my choicest memories\u201d. Having initially painted Maar as a nymph or a bird, his portraits begin to show her in tears, notably <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/picasso-weeping-woman-t05010\">the excruciating</a><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/picasso-weeping-woman-t05010\"> Weeping Woman (1937), now in Tate\u2019s permanent collection</a>, in which she seems to dissolve before our eyes.</p> <p>Maar\u2019s own artistic response is similarly hard to look at, though in quite different ways. A <a href=\"http://figurationfeminine.blogspot.com/2009/02/dora-maar-1907-1997.html\">painting of hers from the same year, The Conversation</a>, shows her and Walter sitting next to each other, almost in mirror image. Walter looks out, passive and inscrutable; Maar has her back to us, face hidden.</p> <p>Yet while the relationship was emotionally punishing, it was productive. 1937 was also the year that Picasso painted Guernica, and Maar \u2013 as well as teaching him darkroom techniques \u2013 agreed to photograph the process of its creation. Indeed, it seems likely that his decision to depict that particular atrocity came from Maar, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-surrealist-photographer-picassos-muse\">who was far more politically engaged</a>. Not only does its style \u2013 severe black-and-white, almost photographic in its pitiless detail \u2013 borrow from her work, she actually painted a small section of it.</p> <p>\u201cHe trusted her,\u201d says Tate Modern director Frances Morris, who interviewed Maar when the latter was in her 80s. \u201cAs much as being a sexual or emotional relationship, it was a collaborative one.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c260490db1a7c750c404863d57bc213c452d7d20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c260490db1a7c750c404863d57bc213c452d7d20/0_0_5002_6213/805.jpg\" alt=\"The Conversation (1937) by Dora Maar.\" width=\"805\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emotionally punishing \u2026 The Conversation (1937) by Dora Maar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When their relationship finally fell apart in 1945, Maar was devastated and suffered a brief breakdown, intensified by the death of her mother. The guilt-stricken Picasso helped her buy a house in Provence, where she spent an increasing amount of her time.

She also travelled, and continued to exhibit through the 50s and 60s. It\u2019s also not true that she abandoned photography, as some claim. Though she made fewer photographs after the break with Picasso, she continued to experiment, crafting <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/dora-maar-15766/seven-things-know-dora-maar\">a late series of photograms</a> (photographic prints made without a camera) in the 80s, as if reconnecting with her younger artistic self.</p> <p>Maar never regained the profile she had experienced in her 20s, yet it\u2019s wrong to say she disappeared. It was a slow withdrawal, and came about largely because Maar wanted to focus on her art. \u201cIn letters she writes, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t want to be social, I want to do my own thing. I have to paint,\u2019\u201d says Combalia</p> <p>Morris, who visited Maar at her apartment in Paris in 1990, agrees. \u201cIt was an artist\u2019s home. Every surface, every wall, spoke of that. There were easels and lots of canvases in her studio, covered in polythene. She was still working.\u201d</p> <p>What was Maar like to meet? Morris laughs: \u201cWhen she answered the door, I thought at first it was the maid, this little old woman.\u201d But she was soon struck by Maar\u2019s forcefulness. \u201cShe was terrifically strong, you could see that.

She loved gossip.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Maar\u2019s talents being overlooked during her lifetime, Combalia believes we should be grateful that we can see so much work, and that so much of it is so good. \u201cShe really deserves to be known.

      "body": "<p>Mary Gaitskill\u2019s fiction is often called cold, or even brutal, but I have always loved it for nearly opposite reasons: its tender attention to the complexities of human emotion, and the compassion it coaxes from clear-eyed perception. Ever since the publication of <em>Bad Behaviour</em>, her 1988 debut collection of stories, which has become a cult classic and inspired the 2002 film <em>Secretary</em>, her writing has been associated with extremity, cruelty and self-destruction. But framing her work in terms of its more sensational subjects, its masochistic women and arrogant men, threatens to overshadow its soulful explorations of the inextricable relationship between intimacy and pain, just as calling her work cold misunderstands the grace at its core. </p> <p>At 65, Gaitskill\u2019s body of work spans three story collections, a book of essays and three novels, including <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\" title=\"\">Veronica</a></em> \u2013 about the improbable friendship between a former model and a proofreader dying of Aids in 1980s Manhattan \u2013 and, most recently, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/the-mare-mary-gaitskill-review\" title=\"\">The Mare</a></em>, about a Dominican teenager and her bond with the white couple she stays with for several summers. Ever since Gaitskill first exploded on the literary scene \u2013 a teenage runaway from Michigan whose backstory immediately became part of her mystique \u2013 a generation of younger writers has been worshipping and wrestling with her authorial voice.</p> <p>Gaitskill has earned a reputation for being intimidating in person, but when she picks me up at the train station near her home in the Hudson Valley, just north of New York city, I am struck by her graciousness. It\u2019s not the kind of graciousness that involves agreeing with everything I say \u2013 the false solidarity of hollow nods \u2013 but rather a precision of presence that sometimes manifests in clarification or resistance. We stop to buy pastries, and then head back to her home, where she worries about making the coffee too strong for my liking.</p> <p>I am here to talk about her new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/07/this-is-pleasure-mary-gaitskill-review\" title=\"\">This Is Pleasure</a></em>, a story about a scandal that I make the mistake of calling a novella. \u201cI don\u2019t consider this a novella,\u201d she tells me. \u201cNovella sounds like a cigarillo or something.\u201d It is told from the alternating perspectives of Margot, an editor whose \u201cprofessional reputation \u2026 was made [by] a book of charming stories about masochistic women\u201d (sound familiar?), and her longtime friend Quin, a book editor forced to resign after a sexual harassment lawsuit is filed against him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The bigger story\u00a0has been splattered all over the media ...\u00a0It is a very private story, from the inside point of view</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is a book that will inevitably be discussed as a commentary on the #MeToo movement it is clearly responding to, but the exacting rigour of its craft deflects attempts to extract a hot take of its gender politics. The very structure of the story \u2013 its dual voices and surprising vantage points, its forensic attention to fraught scenes rife with ambiguity \u2013 constitutes a formal rejoinder to the sweeping generalisations about \u201csexual harassment\u201d that Gaitskill understands herself to be resisting. Even the phrase itself constitutes, for her, a blanket category that risks occluding the subtleties of particular encounters: \u201cI don\u2019t like the word \u2018harassment\u2019 any more,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t always seem to be the right word.\u201d</p> <p>With this book, Gaitskill explains, she wanted to approach the familiar narratives of the #MeToo movement \u2013 \u201cthe bigger story that has been splattered all over the media and social media\u201d \u2013 from a more intimate, nuanced perspective: \u201cThe subject, the way I\u2019ve told it, is a very private story, from the inside point of view,\u201d she says. \u201c[Having] two people was a way to contain it [and] there was a beauty in containment, because the thing about the bigger story \u2026 is that you see the currents, but you often don\u2019t see people really <em>feeling</em> it.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask if Gaitskill ever considered structuring the book from the perspectives of accuser and accused she says no: \u201cIt didn\u2019t strike me as very interesting. I felt like it would have been very difficult not to make [her] sound like a hundred other voices that have already been represented.\u201d</p> <p>In a way, Margot does offer the voice of a victim, except that her experience complicates everything that word implies. One early scene in <em>This Is Pleasure</em> describes a moment near the beginning of Quin and Margot\u2019s friendship, when they are having lunch at a restaurant: \u201c\u2018You are so much stronger now! You speak straight from the clit!\u2019\u201d he tells Margot, and then, as she remembers years later: \u201cas if it were the most natural thing in the world \u2013 he reached between my legs. \u2018No!\u2019 I said, and shoved my hand in his face, palm out, like a traffic cop. I knew it would stop him \u2026 Looking mildly astonished, Quin sat back and said, \u2018I like the strength and clarity of your \u201cno\u201d.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 I replied.\u201d </p> <p>Recollecting this meeting years later, Margot thinks: \u201cThe main thing I remember from that night was the expression on his face as he retreated from my upraised palm, the surprised obedience that was somehow grounded and more genuine than his reaching hand had been.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1d6d30595703fe3749b83243fcb39cbb6f597450\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d6d30595703fe3749b83243fcb39cbb6f597450/0_118_3025_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bad behaviour: Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary (2002).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bad behaviour: Maggie Gyllenhaal in <em>Secretary </em>(2002).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/LIONS GATE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask Gaitskill what she wanted to illuminate about Quin in that scene, whether his \u201cgenuine\u201d expression came from a sense of encountering an authentic response, even if it was a refusal. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly it,\u201d Gaitskill says. \u201cI\u2019ve had that experience where a man \u2026 It\u2019s almost like they are glad [to have] a genuine connection coming back to them.\u201d In a 1994 Harper\u2019s essay called \u201cThe Trouble With Following the Rules\u201d, Gaitskill describes one of these experiences: making out with a casual friend after dinner one night, both of them drunk, as he became more and more aggressive. \u201cI do remember taking one of his hands in both of mine, looking him in the eyes and saying, \u2018If this comes to a fight, you would win, but it would be very ugly for both of us. Is that really want you want?\u2019\u201d His expression changes; and then he leaves.</p> <p>Gaitskill doesn\u2019t deploy the anecdote as a call for resistance so much as a call for more complexity in our stories. Immediately after the scene ends, she confesses that in the \u201coriginal version of this essay \u2026 I didn\u2019t mention that we became lovers for the next two years\u201d and admits that \u201cin omitting the aftermath of that \u2018responsible\u2019 decision, I was making the messy situation far too clear-cut, actually undermining my own argument by making it about propriety rather than the kind of fluid emotional negotiation that I see as necessary for personal responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>That resistance to simplifying the \u201cmessy situation\u201d is part of what animates <em>This Is Pleasure, </em>though she tells me that fiction allowed her to write more directly about feelings:<em> </em>\u201cThat essay was more rational, talking about my mind more than my emotions,\u201d while in the story, \u201cwhat I\u2019m writing about \u2026 is [the] women\u2019s ambiguity about some of the things that have happened.\u201d She refers to a scene in which Quin playfully spanks a younger co-worker, a woman who becomes one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against him. \u201cIn my mind,\u201d Gaitskill says, \u201cthat girl in the story, she\u2019s flirting, she\u2019s joking \u2013 she doesn\u2019t really expect him to do it. They go to lunch, they have a good time; she doesn\u2019t really know how she feels until later.\u201d</p> <p>Gaitskill is quick to point out that she\u2019s not trying to excuse Quin\u2019s behaviour \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s blameless\u201d \u2013 but rather making room for shifting layers of feeling. She wants to make it clear she hasn\u2019t written a book that blames women for acts of aggression committed against them, or excuses the men who have committed them \u2013 rather she\u2019s insisting on a level of nuance that she believes is often elided from these narratives. At the core of <em>This Is Pleasure</em> is a complicated friendship, after all, rather than a lawsuit. Margot holds a lot of anger toward Quin, and a lot of gratitude for the support he has offered her, the playfulness of his spirit, the singularity of his mind. This anger and that gratitude exist at once, in uneasy relation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>She wants to make it clear she hasn\u2019t written a book that\u2019s blames women for acts of aggression committed against them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gaitskill tells me she understands the need driving Quin as \u201ca need for love, [a] very strong need to have women look at him, smile at him, be dependent on him, want him for something, want him to touch them. I could be wrong, but I would interpret that as a need for love. Maybe there would be men [for whom] it would purely be a need for power, but not in the character I\u2019ve created.\u201d And after a pause: \u201cI\u2019m sure some people would think that is too soft.\u201d </p> <p>In her Harper\u2019s essay, Gaitskill describes her evolving emotions around an unwanted sexual encounter with a young man in Detroit: \u201cFor some time after, I described this event as \u2018the time I was raped\u2019 \u2026 At times I even elaborately lied about what had happened, grossly exaggerating the threatening words, adding violence \u2013 not out of shame or guilt, but because the pumped-up version was more congruent with my feelings of violation than the confusing facts.\u201d The great intellectual and ethical feat of the essay that follows \u2013 a project continued by <em>This Is Pleasure </em>\u2013 is its insistence on giving space to both the feelings of violation and the confusing facts. </p> <p>When I ask Gaitskill about the moment in <em>This Is Pleasure</em> when Margot reflects on the \u201cbook of charming stories about masochistic women\u201d that forged her reputation \u2013 \u201cI have never quite separated myself from that titillating yet tiresome aura\u201d\u2013 she just laughs: \u201cWho could that be?\u201d She explains that it was a slight exaggeration of her own feelings about <em>Bad Behaviour</em>, which has become a touchstone for a younger generation of writers, including Kristen Roupenian, whose short story \u201cCat Person\u201d went viral in 2017 and is now a text Gaitskill herself teaches. She doesn\u2019t find the enduring fascination with that first book \u201ctiresome,\u201d exactly, but sometimes bewildering: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best book I\u2019ve written,\u201d she says, though she tells me that <em>This Is Pleasure</em> \u201ccould be a more mature story in <em>Bad Behaviour</em>. It\u2019s definitely on that continuum.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/28/mary-gaitskill-this-is-pleasure-review\">This Is Pleasure by Mary Gaitskill review \u2013 pitch perfect response to #MeToo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And what about her critical reception \u2013 the way her work has often been read as cruel and unsentimental? \u201cI find it painful and also confusing,\u201d she tells me, paraphrasing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/12/reading-group-flannery-o-connor-wise-blood\" title=\"\">Flannery O\u2019Connor</a>\u2019s quip that readers who found her work grotesque had never been to the south.

I can believe that someone might find Gaitskill\u2019s narrative terrain exotic \u2013 a reader who has never been spanked, or been to a strip club \u2013 but I can\u2019t believe there are readers who haven\u2019t encountered the ways love inevitably holds pain.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This Is Pleasure</em> by Mary Gaitskill is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a37.99).

I am here to talk about her new book, This Is Pleasure, a story about a scandal that I make the mistake of calling a novella. \u201cI don\u2019t consider this a novella,\u201d she tells me. \u201cNovella sounds like a cigarillo or something.\u201d It is told from the alternating perspectives of Margot, an editor whose \u201cprofessional reputation \u2026 was made [by] a book of charming stories about masochistic women\u201d (sound familiar?), and her longtime friend Quin, a book editor forced to resign after a sexual harassment lawsuit is filed against him. It is a book that will inevitably be discussed as a commentary on the #MeToo movement it is clearly responding to, but the exacting rigour of its craft deflects attempts to extract a hot take of its gender politics. The very structure of the story \u2013 its dual voices and surprising vantage points, its forensic attention to fraught scenes rife with ambiguity \u2013 constitutes a formal rejoinder to the sweeping generalisations about \u201csexual harassment\u201d that Gaitskill understands herself to be resisting. Even the phrase itself constitutes, for her, a blanket category that risks occluding the subtleties of particular encounters: \u201cI don\u2019t like the word \u2018harassment\u2019 any more,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t always seem to be the right word.\u201d With this book, Gaitskill explains, she wanted to approach the familiar narratives of the #MeToo movement \u2013 \u201cthe bigger story that has been splattered all over the media and social media\u201d \u2013 from a more intimate, nuanced perspective: \u201cThe subject, the way I\u2019ve told it, is a very private story, from the inside point of view,\u201d she says. \u201c[Having] two people was a way to contain it [and] there was a beauty in containment, because the thing about the bigger story \u2026 is that you see the currents, but you often don\u2019t see people really feeling it.\u201d When I ask if Gaitskill ever considered structuring the book from the perspectives of accuser and accused she says no: \u201cIt didn\u2019t strike me as very interesting. I felt like it would have been very difficult not to make [her] sound like a hundred other voices that have already been represented.\u201d In a way, Margot does offer the voice of a victim, except that her experience complicates everything that word implies. One early scene in This Is Pleasure describes a moment near the beginning of Quin and Margot\u2019s friendship, when they are having lunch at a restaurant: \u201c\u2018You are so much stronger now! You speak straight from the clit!\u2019\u201d he tells Margot, and then, as she remembers years later: \u201cas if it were the most natural thing in the world \u2013 he reached between my legs. \u2018No!\u2019 I said, and shoved my hand in his face, palm out, like a traffic cop. I knew it would stop him \u2026 Looking mildly astonished, Quin sat back and said, \u2018I like the strength and clarity of your \u201cno\u201d.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 I replied.\u201d Recollecting this meeting years later, Margot thinks: \u201cThe main thing I remember from that night was the expression on his face as he retreated from my upraised palm, the surprised obedience that was somehow grounded and more genuine than his reaching hand had been.\u201d I ask Gaitskill what she wanted to illuminate about Quin in that scene, whether his \u201cgenuine\u201d expression came from a sense of encountering an authentic response, even if it was a refusal. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly it,\u201d Gaitskill says. \u201cI\u2019ve had that experience where a man \u2026 It\u2019s almost like they are glad [to have] a genuine connection coming back to them.\u201d In a 1994 Harper\u2019s essay called \u201cThe Trouble With Following the Rules\u201d, Gaitskill describes one of these experiences: making out with a casual friend after dinner one night, both of them drunk, as he became more and more aggressive. \u201cI do remember taking one of his hands in both of mine, looking him in the eyes and saying, \u2018If this comes to a fight, you would win, but it would be very ugly for both of us. Is that really want you want?\u2019\u201d His expression changes; and then he leaves. Gaitskill doesn\u2019t deploy the anecdote as a call for resistance so much as a call for more complexity in our stories. Immediately after the scene ends, she confesses that in the \u201coriginal version of this essay \u2026 I didn\u2019t mention that we became lovers for the next two years\u201d and admits that \u201cin omitting the aftermath of that \u2018responsible\u2019 decision, I was making the messy situation far too clear-cut, actually undermining my own argument by making it about propriety rather than the kind of fluid emotional negotiation that I see as necessary for personal responsibility.\u201d That resistance to simplifying the \u201cmessy situation\u201d is part of what animates This Is Pleasure, though she tells me that fiction allowed her to write more directly about feelings: \u201cThat essay was more rational, talking about my mind more than my emotions,\u201d while in the story, \u201cwhat I\u2019m writing about \u2026 is [the] women\u2019s ambiguity about some of the things that have happened.\u201d She refers to a scene in which Quin playfully spanks a younger co-worker, a woman who becomes one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against him. \u201cIn my mind,\u201d Gaitskill says, \u201cthat girl in the story, she\u2019s flirting, she\u2019s joking \u2013 she doesn\u2019t really expect him to do it. They go to lunch, they have a good time; she doesn\u2019t really know how she feels until later.\u201d Gaitskill is quick to point out that she\u2019s not trying to excuse Quin\u2019s behaviour \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s blameless\u201d \u2013 but rather making room for shifting layers of feeling. She wants to make it clear she hasn\u2019t written a book that blames women for acts of aggression committed against them, or excuses the men who have committed them \u2013 rather she\u2019s insisting on a level of nuance that she believes is often elided from these narratives. At the core of This Is Pleasure is a complicated friendship, after all, rather than a lawsuit. Margot holds a lot of anger toward Quin, and a lot of gratitude for the support he has offered her, the playfulness of his spirit, the singularity of his mind. This anger and that gratitude exist at once, in uneasy relation. Gaitskill tells me she understands the need driving Quin as \u201ca need for love, [a] very strong need to have women look at him, smile at him, be dependent on him, want him for something, want him to touch them. I could be wrong, but I would interpret that as a need for love. Maybe there would be men [for whom] it would purely be a need for power, but not in the character I\u2019ve created.\u201d And after a pause: \u201cI\u2019m sure some people would think that is too soft.\u201d In her Harper\u2019s essay, Gaitskill describes her evolving emotions around an unwanted sexual encounter with a young man in Detroit: \u201cFor some time after, I described this event as \u2018the time I was raped\u2019 \u2026 At times I even elaborately lied about what had happened, grossly exaggerating the threatening words, adding violence \u2013 not out of shame or guilt, but because the pumped-up version was more congruent with my feelings of violation than the confusing facts.\u201d The great intellectual and ethical feat of the essay that follows \u2013 a project continued by This Is Pleasure \u2013 is its insistence on giving space to both the feelings of violation and the confusing facts. When I ask Gaitskill about the moment in This Is Pleasure when Margot reflects on the \u201cbook of charming stories about masochistic women\u201d that forged her reputation \u2013 \u201cI have never quite separated myself from that titillating yet tiresome aura\u201d\u2013 she just laughs: \u201cWho could that be?\u201d She explains that it was a slight exaggeration of her own feelings about Bad Behaviour, which has become a touchstone for a younger generation of writers, including Kristen Roupenian, whose short story \u201cCat Person\u201d went viral in 2017 and is now a text Gaitskill herself teaches. She doesn\u2019t find the enduring fascination with that first book \u201ctiresome,\u201d exactly, but sometimes bewildering: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best book I\u2019ve written,\u201d she says, though she tells me that This Is Pleasure \u201ccould be a more mature story in Bad Behaviour. It\u2019s definitely on that continuum.\u201d And what about her critical reception \u2013 the way her work has often been read as cruel and unsentimental? \u201cI find it painful and also confusing,\u201d she tells me, paraphrasing Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s quip that readers who found her work grotesque had never been to the south. Gaitskill is suggesting that some people might find the worlds of her own fiction brutal largely because they are so unfamiliar, but part of me wonders if people call her work brutal not because of what they don\u2019t know, but because of what they do know, and how difficult it can be to face certain kinds of knowledge. I can believe that someone might find Gaitskill\u2019s narrative terrain exotic \u2013 a reader who has never been spanked, or been to a strip club \u2013 but I can\u2019t believe there are readers who haven\u2019t encountered the ways love inevitably holds pain. \u2022 This Is Pleasure by Mary Gaitskill is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a37.99).

This compares to countries such as Portugal, which has full fibre to 89% of homes, and Spain, which is at 71%.</p> <p>When Boris Johnson came to power earlier this year he made a bold pledge to accelerate the rollout of full fibre, which the government has referred to as the gold standard of broadband, across the UK by 2025. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/the-cost-of-boris-johnson-pricing-up-the-next-prime-minister-pledges\">His \u00a35bn plan</a> \u2013 to deliver full fibre nationwide eight years quicker than original government planning \u2013 was criticised by experts as not achievable.</p> <p>Johnson subsequently watered down the plan to achieve \u201cgigabit\u201d speeds, which would allow the inclusion of speed upgrades by companies including Virgin Media, which are not actually full fibre.</p> <h2><strong>How easy would it be to nationalise BT?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b7fa261e6ba22ac4280140994518d8ab1f9c4ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b7fa261e6ba22ac4280140994518d8ab1f9c4ea/22_1090_4651_2790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT Openreach handout\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Openreach was set up as a subsidiary of BT in 2006 but two years ago was legally separated from its parent company by Ofcom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BT Openreach</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labour\u2019s plans do not involve nationalising all of BT, just Openreach, which operates the UK\u2019s broadband network, and other parts that relate to broadband provision, such as the retail arm BT Consumer.</p> <p>Openreach was set up as a subsidiary of BT in 2006 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/10/bt-ofcom-openreach-telecoms-broadband\">two years ago was legally separated from its parent company</a> by the communications industry regulator, Ofcom, to counter complaints from rivals that its lack of independence was limiting competition in the market.</p> <p>That separation would make the nationalisation of Openreach much simpler but taking the business into state ownership would be a daunting proposition.</p> <p>Openreach employs about 32,000 staff \u2013 almost a third of BT\u2019s global workforce \u2013 and has a turnover of about \u00a35bn.</p> <p>It is responsible for the rollout of full fibre across the UK, which at an estimated cost of \u00a335bn is the biggest infrastructure project after the HS2 rail project.</p> <h2><strong>What will nationalisation mean for BT\u2019s rivals?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0466863092ea5e59ed75b9308bf90a0a50f56cf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0466863092ea5e59ed75b9308bf90a0a50f56cf9/35_19_5054_3033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virgin Media engineer connects a house to the Virgin telephone internet and cable television network\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour\u2019s John McDonnell has suggested BT\u2019s rivals such as Virgin Media could end up under the ambit of the new nationalised business, British Broadband.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labour\u2019s pledge to give broadband away for free \u2013 the average current cost per household is \u00a330 a month \u2013 backed by government funding would be bad news for rivals such as Virgin Media, TalkTalk and CityFibre, who are also investing in full fibre. They could rethink whether it is worth investing. Indeed, Labour\u2019s John McDonnell suggested on Friday morning that Virgin Media and co could end up under the ambit of the new nationalised business, British Broadband. </p> <p>There is also the danger that nationalising Openreach could mean the return of the very problems that forced Ofcom to step in and legally separate the business in the first place \u2013 accusations that BT put its own interests first and dragged its heels with investment. In 2017 Ofcom fined BT \u00a342m, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/27/bt-fined-42m-over-delays-to-high-speed-cable-installation\">the largest penalty it has ever imposed</a>, and ordered the company to pay \u00a3300m in compensation to rivals over delays installing high-speed internet connections.</p> <h2><strong>Could the government and BT shareholders agree a fair price for Openreach?</strong></h2> <p>There is likely to be significant difficulty valuing British Broadband, which is what Labour would call a nationalised Openreach. Bloomberg has valued it at \u00a315bn.</p> <p>The Labour party has said parliament would decide what to pay but it would have to be a fair price to get the backing of employee shareholders, pension fund investors, small shareholders and big overseas investors. Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom, which has 12% of the business, is likely to be a tough negotiator, for instance.</p> <p>But it would likely cost less than it would have done a few years ago. BT\u2019s share price was 500p in 2015 but is now only 191p. Labour has said that BT shareholders would get government bonds in return for their shares, which pay a lower dividend than BT investors currently receive. </p> <h2><strong>Would nationalising broadband work?</strong></h2> <p>Australia has tried to do this with its National Broadband Network and it has been branded <a href=\"https://tottnews.com/2019/04/18/australia-nbn-disaster/\">one of the biggest infrastructure failures in its history</a>. Set up in 2006, the government\u2019s plan was to roll out full fibre to 93% of all premises, although over the years this was watered down to a \u201cmulti-technology mix\u201d using different technologies offering varying levels of speed and service to consumers. \u201cOnly one other country in the world has come close to going down this route, Australia,\u201d says Matthew Howett, the principal analyst at telecoms research firm Assembly. \u201cAnd for a good reason \u2013 it\u2019s hard, expensive and fraught with difficulty. Australia\u2019s NBN is years late, massively overbudget and offering speeds and technology a fraction of the original political intention.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Could the policy fall foul of </strong><strong>rules on state aid?</strong></h2> <p>There is no EU prohibition of publicly-owned industry. Indeed there are over 800 companies in the EU that are fully or partly nationalised. The key to whether a state intervention is legal under state aid rules is how the industry is run rather than the status of the owner.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s pledge to provide free full-fibre broadband to every home and business in the UK, including part-nationalising BT and introducing a tax on the tech giants to help pay for it, is an eye-catching offer to potential voters \u2013 but raises a host of questions about the feasibility of such a move. So what is full-fibre broadband and why is it important to the UK? Full-fibre networks use fibre optic cables to deliver broadband directly to homes and business premises at speeds of more than one gigabit per second \u2013 which allows an HD movie to be downloaded in less than 50 seconds. Until recently the government had been focused on rolling out only \u201csuperfast\u201d broadband, which uses a slower mix of part-fibre, part-copper wire to homes, which has much slower download speeds. How does the UK compare with other countries on superfast broadband? The UK is an embarrassing full-fibre laggard on the world stage, with only 8% of homes able to get it. This compares to countries such as Portugal, which has full fibre to 89% of homes, and Spain, which is at 71%. When Boris Johnson came to power earlier this year he made a bold pledge to accelerate the rollout of full fibre, which the government has referred to as the gold standard of broadband, across the UK by 2025. His \u00a35bn plan \u2013 to deliver full fibre nationwide eight years quicker than original government planning \u2013 was criticised by experts as not achievable. Johnson subsequently watered down the plan to achieve \u201cgigabit\u201d speeds, which would allow the inclusion of speed upgrades by companies including Virgin Media, which are not actually full fibre. How easy would it be to nationalise BT? Labour\u2019s plans do not involve nationalising all of BT, just Openreach, which operates the UK\u2019s broadband network, and other parts that relate to broadband provision, such as the retail arm BT Consumer. Openreach was set up as a subsidiary of BT in 2006 but two years ago was legally separated from its parent company by the communications industry regulator, Ofcom, to counter complaints from rivals that its lack of independence was limiting competition in the market. That separation would make the nationalisation of Openreach much simpler but taking the business into state ownership would be a daunting proposition. Openreach employs about 32,000 staff \u2013 almost a third of BT\u2019s global workforce \u2013 and has a turnover of about \u00a35bn. It is responsible for the rollout of full fibre across the UK, which at an estimated cost of \u00a335bn is the biggest infrastructure project after the HS2 rail project. What will nationalisation mean for BT\u2019s rivals? Labour\u2019s pledge to give broadband away for free \u2013 the average current cost per household is \u00a330 a month \u2013 backed by government funding would be bad news for rivals such as Virgin Media, TalkTalk and CityFibre, who are also investing in full fibre. They could rethink whether it is worth investing. Indeed, Labour\u2019s John McDonnell suggested on Friday morning that Virgin Media and co could end up under the ambit of the new nationalised business, British Broadband. There is also the danger that nationalising Openreach could mean the return of the very problems that forced Ofcom to step in and legally separate the business in the first place \u2013 accusations that BT put its own interests first and dragged its heels with investment. In 2017 Ofcom fined BT \u00a342m, the largest penalty it has ever imposed, and ordered the company to pay \u00a3300m in compensation to rivals over delays installing high-speed internet connections. Could the government and BT shareholders agree a fair price for Openreach? There is likely to be significant difficulty valuing British Broadband, which is what Labour would call a nationalised Openreach. Bloomberg has valued it at \u00a315bn. The Labour party has said parliament would decide what to pay but it would have to be a fair price to get the backing of employee shareholders, pension fund investors, small shareholders and big overseas investors. Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom, which has 12% of the business, is likely to be a tough negotiator, for instance. But it would likely cost less than it would have done a few years ago. BT\u2019s share price was 500p in 2015 but is now only 191p. Labour has said that BT shareholders would get government bonds in return for their shares, which pay a lower dividend than BT investors currently receive. Would nationalising broadband work? Australia has tried to do this with its National Broadband Network and it has been branded one of the biggest infrastructure failures in its history. Set up in 2006, the government\u2019s plan was to roll out full fibre to 93% of all premises, although over the years this was watered down to a \u201cmulti-technology mix\u201d using different technologies offering varying levels of speed and service to consumers. \u201cOnly one other country in the world has come close to going down this route, Australia,\u201d says Matthew Howett, the principal analyst at telecoms research firm Assembly. \u201cAnd for a good reason \u2013 it\u2019s hard, expensive and fraught with difficulty. Australia\u2019s NBN is years late, massively overbudget and offering speeds and technology a fraction of the original political intention.\u201d Could the policy fall foul of rules on state aid? There is no EU prohibition of publicly-owned industry. Indeed there are over 800 companies in the EU that are fully or partly nationalised. The key to whether a state intervention is legal under state aid rules is how the industry is run rather than the status of the owner. And in the field of broadband the European commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive arm \u2013 has a permissive policy. EU guidance published in 2013 on the issue of broadband rollout warned that \u201cstate intervention should limit as much as possible the risk of crowding out private investments, of altering commercial investment incentives and ultimately of distorting competition contrary to the common interest of the European Union\u201d. But the guidance suggested that a significant degree of market distortion would be acceptable if the government\u2019s intervention would \u201cresult in a higher level, or a faster rate of broadband coverage and penetration than would be the case without state aid\u201d. Labour\u2019s proposal would need to demonstrate, for example, \u201cthat private investors are not in a position to provide in the near future adequate broadband coverage to all citizens or users, thus leaving a significant part of the population unconnected\u201d. How would Labour\u2019s plan to tax tech giants such as Google and Facebook work? The tech tax is a means of paying for the broadband policy. Labour has estimated that the costs of maintaining a UK-wide full-fibre network will cost about \u00a3230m a year \u2013 analysts say the annual maintenance costs are in the range of \u00a31bn to \u00a32bn. According to BT\u2019s annual report, the division\u2019s operating costs are more than \u00a32bn a year. It has more than 30,000 staff and an annual wage bill of more than \u00a3800m. To cover operating costs, Labour plans to introduce a tax on multinationals, including Google and Facebook. Labour\u2019s plans on this are light on detail but include a proposal to \u201ctax UK-based multinationals on the share of their global profits that reflects their UK share of their global sales, employment and assets\u201d. It is not clear how this would work in practice but it could lead to a rethink by some of the tech giants on future investment in the UK. Last year the then chancellor, Philip Hammond, proposed a \u201cnarrowly targeted digital services tax\u201d on online firms making more than \u00a3500m globally. Is BT\u2019s pension deficit an issue? Ofcom examined the possibility of breaking up BT in 2016 and cited BT\u2019s \u00a36bn pension deficit as one of the reasons why it would not be a good idea. Steve Unger, Ofcom\u2019s director of strategy, said at the time a full-blown separation would trigger \u201cvery significant costs\u201d related to the deficit. What would it mean for consumer choice? Large numbers of households switch between broadband providers regularly to chase better deals, using comparison sites that would presumably become redundant if the UK moves to a single supplier model. Consumers switching typically gain prices about \u00a38 a month lower than loyal customers. But Ofcom has warned that as many as nine million households are on \u201cout-of-contract\u201d deals and paying much higher monthly fees. BT has a 34% share of the 26.7m fixed broadband connections in the UK, according to Ofcom, with the remaining market split almost equally between Virgin Media, TalkTalk and Sky. Competition has not necessarily produced the lowest prices, however. According to research by Cable, a price comparison site, Italy has Europe\u2019s cheapest broadband, with the UK fifth, behind France and Germany.

His naivety is palpable here, and might be a bit much for some, with the title track and Just Regular People truly childlike. But that guileless stance, staring up at the world in confusion, hurt and wonder, is what sets Russell apart, none more so than on a pair of devastatingly unrequited love songs, Words of Love and In Love With You for the Last Time: two new classics on a set full of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/3LMsFkOLJImsFFUddEjLDy\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3LMsFkOLJImsFFUddEjLDy\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "When he died in 1992 of Aids-related illnesses at the age of 40, Arthur Russell left behind one of the most staggeringly beautiful bodies of songwriting ever \u2013 and it is still emerging. This compilation of unreleased tracks from his archive mostly date from the mid-1970s, recalling the country-tinged songwriting collected on 2008\u2019s Love Is Overtaking Me, with a scattering of the lopsided, slightly wacky funk and new wave he scaled up to in the 80s. Russell nerds will be enthralled by curiosities such as Barefoot in New York, a piece of brass-backed stuttering spoken word, and the lusted-for 1985 deep cut You Did It Yourself, which points the way to both the jittery disco of Get Around to It and, further, the haunted aesthetic of World of Echo. Its workaday lyrics, complaining about the ending of a movie (\u201cit just seemed tacked on\u201d), are made strangely mythic by the vaporous new-wave backing. But this isn\u2019t only for completists \u2013 anyone will thrill to Russell, whose ability to anchor wandering thought with melodic resolution is as strong as Bob Dylan\u2019s. His naivety is palpable here, and might be a bit much for some, with the title track and Just Regular People truly childlike. But that guileless stance, staring up at the world in confusion, hurt and wonder, is what sets Russell apart, none more so than on a pair of devastatingly unrequited love songs, Words of Love and In Love With You for the Last Time: two new classics on a set full of them.",

Consider the cascade of consequences that follows a felony label, which disproportionately affects black Americans. Trumped-up felony convictions and plea deals leave thousands of black Americans unable to vote; unable to access housing; unable to hold a wide range of jobs, from nail tech to childcare worker; unable even to purchase life insurance, rendering them the walking dead.</p> <p>We see it in the rampant environmental racism that threatens the lives of black people in low-income neighborhoods across the country. Consider that the most polluted zip code in Michigan, 48217, is 84% black. Isn\u2019t it ironic that hundreds of thousands of black Americans are in prison for selling small amounts of drugs because prosecutors and judges maintained they were poisoning the community \u2013 but when it came to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/flint-water-trial-charges-dropped-michigan\">Flint</a>, where the whole community was literally poisoned, not one official was punished?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have tried to hold a mirror to America\u2019s face, because we know our nation can and must do better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If that isn\u2019t enough evidence of genocide, consider the last two acts contained in the UN\u2019s definition \u2013 preventing births or forcibly transferring the children of one group to another. In my book, I document how black people have been sterilized without their knowledge or against their will for decades and are still coerced into sterilization to reduce a prison sentence. For much of the last century, a majority of states carried out <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/07/26/our-long-troubling-history-of-sterilizing-the-incarcerated\">eugenics</a> laws, resulting in the sterilization of nearly 65,000 Americans, most often women of color. In California, nearly 150 incarcerated women were <a href=\"https://www.revealnews.org/article/female-inmates-sterilized-in-california-prisons-without-approval/\">sterilized</a> between 2004 and 2013, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting. And as recently as 2017, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/07/21/judge-to-inmates-get-sterilized-and-ill-shave-off-jail-time/\">Tennessee</a> judge offered to reduce criminal sentences by 30 days for individuals who agree to sterilization or long-form birth control implants.</p> <p>Black children are much more likely to intersect with the social welfare system, where they are likely to end up in foster care or adopted \u2013 that is, raised by a group other than their own. In <a href=\"https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/featured/new-york-city-de-blasio-black-foster-care/33992\">New York City</a>, 53% of children in foster care are black, though only 25% of children in the city are black. In <a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/black-families-ask-minnesota-to-stop-taking-so-many-of-their-children/479327113\">Minnesota</a>, black children are three times more likely to be removed from their homes than white children. In many cases, the \u201ccrime\u201d that led to the children\u2019s removal is their parents\u2019 poverty, a condition imposed or fostered by society.</p> <p>The physical, financial, mental, and even spiritual deaths inflicted on black Americans are evident everywhere \u2013 in substandard schools, in the food deserts that leave black communities without food to survive or thrive, in impoverished neighborhoods subject to polluted water and air.</p> <p>That the use of the word genocide would prove so shocking suggests that many Americans lack both a knowledge of our history and an awareness of the circumstances all around them. In Open Season I have tried to hold a mirror to America\u2019s face, because we know our nation can and must do better. Like the CRC members declared nearly 70 years ago, I charge genocide. The case is clear.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ben Crump is a civil rights attorney, and founder of the law firm Ben Crump Law, based in Tallahassee, Florida</p></li> </ul>",

We see it as the government devises ways to profit from the legal marijuana industry while thousands of black Americans rot in prison for possessing or selling weed to support their families. We see it in the masses of black Americans who have been forced or coerced into felony convictions or plea deals, costing them the basic essentials of a successful life \u2013 an act I call in my book \u201ckilling us softly\u201d. Consider the cascade of consequences that follows a felony label, which disproportionately affects black Americans. Trumped-up felony convictions and plea deals leave thousands of black Americans unable to vote; unable to access housing; unable to hold a wide range of jobs, from nail tech to childcare worker; unable even to purchase life insurance, rendering them the walking dead. We see it in the rampant environmental racism that threatens the lives of black people in low-income neighborhoods across the country. Consider that the most polluted zip code in Michigan, 48217, is 84% black. Isn\u2019t it ironic that hundreds of thousands of black Americans are in prison for selling small amounts of drugs because prosecutors and judges maintained they were poisoning the community \u2013 but when it came to Flint, where the whole community was literally poisoned, not one official was punished? If that isn\u2019t enough evidence of genocide, consider the last two acts contained in the UN\u2019s definition \u2013 preventing births or forcibly transferring the children of one group to another. In my book, I document how black people have been sterilized without their knowledge or against their will for decades and are still coerced into sterilization to reduce a prison sentence. For much of the last century, a majority of states carried out eugenics laws, resulting in the sterilization of nearly 65,000 Americans, most often women of color. In California, nearly 150 incarcerated women were sterilized between 2004 and 2013, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting. And as recently as 2017, a Tennessee judge offered to reduce criminal sentences by 30 days for individuals who agree to sterilization or long-form birth control implants. Black children are much more likely to intersect with the social welfare system, where they are likely to end up in foster care or adopted \u2013 that is, raised by a group other than their own. In New York City, 53% of children in foster care are black, though only 25% of children in the city are black. In Minnesota, black children are three times more likely to be removed from their homes than white children. In many cases, the \u201ccrime\u201d that led to the children\u2019s removal is their parents\u2019 poverty, a condition imposed or fostered by society. The physical, financial, mental, and even spiritual deaths inflicted on black Americans are evident everywhere \u2013 in substandard schools, in the food deserts that leave black communities without food to survive or thrive, in impoverished neighborhoods subject to polluted water and air. That the use of the word genocide would prove so shocking suggests that many Americans lack both a knowledge of our history and an awareness of the circumstances all around them. In Open Season I have tried to hold a mirror to America\u2019s face, because we know our nation can and must do better. Like the CRC members declared nearly 70 years ago, I charge genocide.

I\u2019ve always had difficulty ejaculating during sex; when I lost my virginity, my partner didn\u2019t believe it was my first time because I lasted so long. The problem has only got worse as I\u2019ve got older, and these days, I often lose my erection after about 10 minutes due to the stress of knowing I won\u2019t orgasm. In my whole life, I\u2019ve only had sex five or six times without this being an issue. </p> <p>At 35, I discovered the term traumatic masturbatory syndrome online. I think this is at the root of my problems; my early experiments with masturbation may have reduced the nerve function in my penis. I also worry that my 5in penis is smaller than average. My first girlfriend told me it was inadequate, and in my 20s, another girlfriend laughed about it in front of several mutual friends at a party.</p> <p>As a result of this insecurity, and my issues ejaculating, my sex life with my first wife was almost nonexistent. This led to me sleeping with a friend of hers. After a messy divorce for each of us, we are still together 20 years later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/25/my-life-in-sex-young-widow\">My life in sex: the young widow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am lucky that my current wife realises my struggle to ejaculate frustrates me, too, and does her best to understand that my problem is not anything to do with my feelings towards her.

      "bodyText": "I envy men who have premature ejaculation: at least they can finish. I\u2019ve always had difficulty ejaculating during sex; when I lost my virginity, my partner didn\u2019t believe it was my first time because I lasted so long. The problem has only got worse as I\u2019ve got older, and these days, I often lose my erection after about 10 minutes due to the stress of knowing I won\u2019t orgasm. In my whole life, I\u2019ve only had sex five or six times without this being an issue. At 35, I discovered the term traumatic masturbatory syndrome online. I think this is at the root of my problems; my early experiments with masturbation may have reduced the nerve function in my penis. I also worry that my 5in penis is smaller than average. My first girlfriend told me it was inadequate, and in my 20s, another girlfriend laughed about it in front of several mutual friends at a party. As a result of this insecurity, and my issues ejaculating, my sex life with my first wife was almost nonexistent. This led to me sleeping with a friend of hers. After a messy divorce for each of us, we are still together 20 years later. I am lucky that my current wife realises my struggle to ejaculate frustrates me, too, and does her best to understand that my problem is not anything to do with my feelings towards her. She has encouraged me to seek medical help, and I\u2019m now prescribed medication for erectile dysfunction. It helps me maintain an erection, but I still find it nearly impossible to finish. I\u2019m exhausted. \u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?

The 33-year-old has kept goal with quiet authority as Leicester\u2019s defence has become the stingiest in the league, conceding only eight times. Ederson might have been a more obvious choice but the Brazilian has not been as assured for Manchester City this season. Schmeichel has been error-free and solid with his distribution. An honourable mention should go to Ben Foster who has made some wonderful stops while being overworked at Watford.</p> <h2>Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool)</h2> <p>He entered the Guinness Book of Records for his 12 league assists last season and has continued where he left off. He can sometimes be caught out positionally but his bravery in possession and speed of thought are what sets him apart as the most modern of right-backs.

Brendan Rodgers deserves great credit for polishing a player who he said \u201clooked like someone who would make a couple of mistakes\u201d when he first saw the 23-year-old. Soyuncu\u2019s panache in possession has helped give his side an added dimension and his reading of the game alongside Jonny Evans has made Leicester the hardest side in the league to break down.</p> <h2>Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)</h2> <p>Liverpool are struggling to keep clean sheets in the way they did last season, but does this mean Virgil van Dijk is any less dominant?

It is no fluke that a player who struggled to get into the Blades team last season is now the beating heart of Chris Wilder\u2019s side.

Her previous releases have been lithe, dancefloor-ready EPs, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqGphxKXDMA\">a collaboration</a> with fellow Bristolian techno producer Hodge, earlier this year.</p> <p>Tangerine is her first artistic statement proper, with instruments she has never used before including her own vocals and a kalimba recorded at her father\u2019s house in Chile. It\u2019s an enveloping listen. At times it sounds like something that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a yoga or meditation class \u2013 particularly on the dazzling Slow Wave, a beatless sigh of ambient, minimalist melodies.

      "bodyText": "The transition from DJ to album artist is a tricky one. While one art is about reading the room, the other is a more isolated and intimate experience. For Bristolian Shanti Celeste, on her debut full-length Tangerine, it\u2019s an opportunity to show subtlety and depths that she doesn\u2019t often have space to explore on the dancefloor. Celeste channels the style of early house and techno pioneers, via the influence of her beloved Bristol scene (she started out working at local record shop Idle Hands, and ran a label called BRSTL). Her previous releases have been lithe, dancefloor-ready EPs, including a collaboration with fellow Bristolian techno producer Hodge, earlier this year. Tangerine is her first artistic statement proper, with instruments she has never used before including her own vocals and a kalimba recorded at her father\u2019s house in Chile. It\u2019s an enveloping listen. At times it sounds like something that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a yoga or meditation class \u2013 particularly on the dazzling Slow Wave, a beatless sigh of ambient, minimalist melodies. But this is an album informed by the club: the panicky percussion and bubble-light synths of Aqua Block, the elastic bassline of Sesame, and the chaotic house thump of Infinitas are all primed for a 2am workout. Yet Tangerine is equally an album you may want to stick on when you get home at the end of the night, full of nuance, space and soft textures to help you float away.",

Here, he tells us about the no dig method, demystifies dealing with weeds, and shares some of his suggestions for maximising your garden or balcony.</p> <h2><strong>What is the no dig method of gardening?</strong></h2> <p>No dig is a simple and easy method, which perhaps is why, until recently, it hasn\u2019t really been taken seriously.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cef1f381efe61f6066acc8ce05f3eff9e9069045\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cef1f381efe61f6066acc8ce05f3eff9e9069045/0_17_700_420/500.jpg\" alt=\"Charles\u2019 no dig market garden in September 2019, 1000 square metres of beds. Use the same approach for one bed or 100 beds.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles\u2019 no dig market garden in September 2019, 1000 square metres of beds. Use the same approach for one bed or 100 beds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Dowding</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are three key facets of the no dig method:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Soil is undisturbed so its organisms can work and multiply.</strong></p><p>Most soil already has structure for roots to grow and nutrients to feed plants, and it is full of growth-enabling organisms. Billions of fungal threads, nematodes and earthworms \u2013 to name but a few \u2013 are being helpful right under our feet. We need to help them to help us.</p><p>You have already started no dig without knowing! Since the last time you dug, tilled or forked your soil, it has been healing itself, with networks of fungi and the recreation of a stable structure. With no dig you simply and literally build on that.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Organisms are fed with organic matter on the surface, as in nature but faster.</strong></p><p>Allow soil to work its magic. Nutrients become available when needed by plants, through a combination of air and soil temperatures being high enough for photosynthesis to happen. Roots ask fungi for food and moisture, and fungi work best when undisturbed, which is why you see stronger growth in no dig soil.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Plant feeding is about biology (such as fungi) more than chemistry (nutrients/minerals).</strong></p><p>No dig increases the ability of plants to find food. Compost mulches serve as a rapid source of food for soil organisms and enhance their activity, thus improving soil structure. In damp climates, compost is best for mulching as it is no suitable habitat for slugs.</p></li> </ol>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"60f89effe487fd676ad3df735b9e439e5ae6d341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60f89effe487fd676ad3df735b9e439e5ae6d341/0_39_700_420/500.jpg\" alt=\"Homeacres no dig garden 29th October.

No compost or feeds have been applied for 10 months, showing how nutrients are available all the time without using fertilisers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Dowding</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Why is no dig beneficial?</strong></h2> <p>In three words: speed, ease and productivity. For example, you can plant into a new bed created on weeds, on the same day; see the video below.

      "bodyText": "Charles Dowding has been a lead innovator of organic and no dig gardening since 1983 \u2013 so there is no one better placed to give you tips for making your outside space as special as possible. In February, Charles joins our lineup of experts for a full-day gardening masterclass, but we wanted to grab a few tips and tricks from him before then. Here, he tells us about the no dig method, demystifies dealing with weeds, and shares some of his suggestions for maximising your garden or balcony. What is the no dig method of gardening? No dig is a simple and easy method, which perhaps is why, until recently, it hasn\u2019t really been taken seriously. There are three key facets of the no dig method: Soil is undisturbed so its organisms can work and multiply. Most soil already has structure for roots to grow and nutrients to feed plants, and it is full of growth-enabling organisms. Billions of fungal threads, nematodes and earthworms \u2013 to name but a few \u2013 are being helpful right under our feet. We need to help them to help us. You have already started no dig without knowing! Since the last time you dug, tilled or forked your soil, it has been healing itself, with networks of fungi and the recreation of a stable structure. With no dig you simply and literally build on that. Organisms are fed with organic matter on the surface, as in nature but faster. Allow soil to work its magic. Nutrients become available when needed by plants, through a combination of air and soil temperatures being high enough for photosynthesis to happen. Roots ask fungi for food and moisture, and fungi work best when undisturbed, which is why you see stronger growth in no dig soil. Plant feeding is about biology (such as fungi) more than chemistry (nutrients/minerals). No dig increases the ability of plants to find food. Compost mulches serve as a rapid source of food for soil organisms and enhance their activity, thus improving soil structure. In damp climates, compost is best for mulching as it is no suitable habitat for slugs. Why is no dig beneficial? In three words: speed, ease and productivity. For example, you can plant into a new bed created on weeds, on the same day; see the video below. Note that beds with new compost often want treading down to firm the compost. Problems diminish and gardening becomes easier, in particular because weeds grow less, since their healing properties are not needed by healthy soil. It is worth noting: Soil is lively, structured and does not stick to your boots. You can walk on your beds, thanks to the firm but open structure of soil. No dig means no compacted layers caused by damage from cultivations, and no compaction means no fermentation due to anaerobic conditions. No fermentation means that no alcohol is produced, and no alcohol means fewer slugs \u2013 this explanation is thanks to Elaine Ingham. With no dig, you can also grow more from less, keeping paths narrow and avoiding wooden sides where possible No dig uses less compost than an equivalent area dug, because no carbon is lost from cultivation, and active soil life increases fertility. How can gardeners adopt the method organically without risk of invasive weeds? In a word, mulch. This means covering weeds to deprive them of light, so that new weed growth is futile because it happens in darkness and cannot feed existing weed roots. Eventually they die completely; see the video below for more. However only in the first year do you need to use light-excluding mulches such as cardboard and polythene, to kill perennial weeds. This saves much time, in all subsequent years. I have many times completely and easily eradicated couch/twitch grass (Elymus repens) within a year. Q. If I cover weeds with polythene, how do I know when they are dead? A. The best method is to lift the polythene and check for recent growth: it will have white or pale yellow stems. If you see lots of them, best leave the polythene in place because weed roots still have sufficient reserves in their roots to continue growing. Q. Why does no dig mean less weeding? A. Less weeds germinate in undisturbed soil, and compost mulches on the surface make it easy to pull weeds or to run a hoe through the surface. Light hoeing and raking is fine, usually the top 3cm/1in which is your surface mulch of compost. Use a dibber or trowel to create holes for new plants. Q. Does no dig work to control marestail and other perennial weeds? A. From the many reports I hear, gardeners who don\u2019t disturb soil have more success for less effort in reducing marestail (equisetum), compared to those who dig. Whatever weeds you have, mulching rather than attempting to dig out every root means soil grows it less. Why? If only soil could talk\u2026 like all organisms, it\u2019s happier when not disturbed. What are three small things you think all new gardeners should know? 1 Feed the soil \u2013 not the plants. 2 Simple, easy methods are not lazy but clever. 3 Do your homework on best sowing and harvest times for all your food plants. What advice do you have for people with limited outdoor space but who want to get green fingers? Practice. Start with a pot or a box on or in a window, sow a few salad seeds (fast to harvest), and buy a few plants as well, for rapid results. Plant a potato in spring in a small bag or bucket of compost \u2013 it\u2019s fun but the leaves need space to grow! Make one small bed, even say 1.2 square metres (4ft) and pack it full of multipurpose compost. Sow or plant in that, and keep it full with new plants all the time \u2013 as soon as gaps appear. Don\u2019t use any synthetic fertilisers or chemicals, they are bad for soil life. Buy some mesh to keep pests off, perhaps also some fleece (30gsm thickness) to warm early plantings in spring. No dig is great for flowers and ornamental plants: fewer weeds, gorgeous blooms. The end result is that you have more time for productive rather than routine work, plants are healthier, you harvest more food per square metre and your garden glows with health.",

Energy projects applying for EIB funding will have to show they can produce one kilowatt hour of energy while emitting less than 250 grammes of carbon dioxide.</p> <p>The decision to prioritise renewable and efficient energy follows a policy promise by the incoming European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to turn the EIB into a \u201cclimate bank\u201d, unlocking a potential \u20ac1tn in funds to help move Europe\u2019s economy toward cleaner energy.</p> <p>Von der Leyen also wants the EU to raise its target of cutting emissions by at least 40% from 1990 levels by 2030 in support of plans to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.</p> <p>The EIB\u2019s announcement comes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/26/eib-plans-to-cut-all-funding-for-fossil-fuel-projects-by-2020\">a year later than hoped</a> by climate campaigners but also limits approvals of new fossil fuel projects before 2021 to projects that are already under appraisal by the EIB. This could pose long-term problems for the gas industry, which has more than $200bn in liquefied natural gas projects planned over the next five years.</p> <p>Colin Roche, of Friends of the Earth Europe, called the decision \u201ca significant victory\u201d for the climate movement. \u201cFinally, the world\u2019s largest public bank has bowed to public pressure and recognised that funding for all fossil fuels must end \u2013 and now all other banks, public and private, must follow their lead,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nick Mabey, of the environmental thinktank E3G, said: \u201cEurope is sending a clear signal that it intends to move away from fossil fuel investments toward the climate-neutral future its citizens want. The EIB is sending a message to other financial institutions that investment in fossil fuels is drawing to an end.\u201d</p> <p>Environmental campaigners estimate that the EIB handed out \u20ac6.2m every day to fossil fuel companies between 2013 and 2018. </p> <p>The EIB handed one of Europe\u2019s largest ever loans to the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), which will bring Caspian gas to Europe, and it has funded plans by the Polish utility PGE to build two gas-fired power plants.</p> <p>The climate campaign group 350.org said a decisive end to this financial lifeline could prove another nail in the coffin for the fossil fuel industry.</p> <p>Kate Cahoon, a campaigner for 350.org, which is based in Germany, said: \u201cWhen the world\u2019s biggest public lender decides to largely ditch fossil fuels, financial markets across the globe will take notice: this is the beginning of the end of climate-wrecking fossil fuel finance.\u201d</p> <p>However, the group warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/15/concerns-eu-bank-balks-plans-halt-fossil-fuel-investments-climate-action-eib\">the EIB\u2019s pledge included loopholes</a> that could still lock European countries into decades of dependence on fossil fuels. The EIB will continue to support any project added to the EU\u2019s \u201cprojects of common interest\u201d list before 2022. At present, more than 50 gas projects could be eligible.</p> <p>Alex Doukas, an analyst with Oil Change International, said the EIB had failed to pass a policy consistent with the Paris agreement because of the hold the fossil fuel industry still had over EU politics.</p> <p>\u201cGas lobbyists were able to convince many parties \u2013 most significantly Germany and the European commission \u2013 to override public support for a fossil-free EIB and write significant concessions into this policy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, with people-powered movements for climate action stronger than ever, the gas industry will face an uphill battle in using these EIB loopholes to get new projects funded by 2021.\u201d</p>",

The EIB, the world\u2019s largest multilateral financial institution, described its decision as a \u201cquantum leap\u201d in ambition. \u201cClimate is the top issue on the political agenda of our time,\u201d said the bank\u2019s president, Werner Hoyer. \u201cWe will stop financing fossil fuels and launch the most ambitious climate investment strategy of any public financial institution anywhere.\u201d The bank\u2019s vice-president, Andrew McDowell, said the move was \u201can important first step \u2013 not the last step, but probably one of the most difficult.\u201d Under its new policy, the bank will end all lending to fossil fuels within two years and align all funding decisions with the Paris climate accord. Energy projects applying for EIB funding will have to show they can produce one kilowatt hour of energy while emitting less than 250 grammes of carbon dioxide. The decision to prioritise renewable and efficient energy follows a policy promise by the incoming European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to turn the EIB into a \u201cclimate bank\u201d, unlocking a potential \u20ac1tn in funds to help move Europe\u2019s economy toward cleaner energy. Von der Leyen also wants the EU to raise its target of cutting emissions by at least 40% from 1990 levels by 2030 in support of plans to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The EIB\u2019s announcement comes a year later than hoped by climate campaigners but also limits approvals of new fossil fuel projects before 2021 to projects that are already under appraisal by the EIB. This could pose long-term problems for the gas industry, which has more than $200bn in liquefied natural gas projects planned over the next five years. Colin Roche, of Friends of the Earth Europe, called the decision \u201ca significant victory\u201d for the climate movement. \u201cFinally, the world\u2019s largest public bank has bowed to public pressure and recognised that funding for all fossil fuels must end \u2013 and now all other banks, public and private, must follow their lead,\u201d he said. Nick Mabey, of the environmental thinktank E3G, said: \u201cEurope is sending a clear signal that it intends to move away from fossil fuel investments toward the climate-neutral future its citizens want. The EIB is sending a message to other financial institutions that investment in fossil fuels is drawing to an end.\u201d Environmental campaigners estimate that the EIB handed out \u20ac6.2m every day to fossil fuel companies between 2013 and 2018. The EIB handed one of Europe\u2019s largest ever loans to the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), which will bring Caspian gas to Europe, and it has funded plans by the Polish utility PGE to build two gas-fired power plants. The climate campaign group 350.org said a decisive end to this financial lifeline could prove another nail in the coffin for the fossil fuel industry. Kate Cahoon, a campaigner for 350.org, which is based in Germany, said: \u201cWhen the world\u2019s biggest public lender decides to largely ditch fossil fuels, financial markets across the globe will take notice: this is the beginning of the end of climate-wrecking fossil fuel finance.\u201d However, the group warned that the EIB\u2019s pledge included loopholes that could still lock European countries into decades of dependence on fossil fuels. The EIB will continue to support any project added to the EU\u2019s \u201cprojects of common interest\u201d list before 2022. At present, more than 50 gas projects could be eligible. Alex Doukas, an analyst with Oil Change International, said the EIB had failed to pass a policy consistent with the Paris agreement because of the hold the fossil fuel industry still had over EU politics. \u201cGas lobbyists were able to convince many parties \u2013 most significantly Germany and the European commission \u2013 to override public support for a fossil-free EIB and write significant concessions into this policy,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, with people-powered movements for climate action stronger than ever, the gas industry will face an uphill battle in using these EIB loopholes to get new projects funded by 2021.\u201d",

The quail, in its peculiar, not entirely lovable mole glaze, looks like a mafia warning. Four pieces of strategically sculpted carrot steeped in orange cost \u00a36.

Well, it is slighty ridiculous, sometimes delicious, sometimes \u201cmeh\u201d, but at least it aims to challenge. Does anyone actually want cabbage and blue cheese? And I\u2019m not entirely sure tortilla (fancy runny omelette) even complements caviar (fancy runny fish goo) yet, like zombies, diners order it (at \u00a340 for the small one). Food comes on wooden boards, on top of brown parchment paper, or on pale, marble slabs. Dinner resembles an autopsy by a highly precise pathologist. The quail, in its peculiar, not entirely lovable mole glaze, looks like a mafia warning. Four pieces of strategically sculpted carrot steeped in orange cost \u00a36. Carbs do not play a huge part on Decimo\u2019s menu, or in the lifestyle choice of anyone who works there. One of the greatest things I ate there, or indeed have eaten all this year, was a fairly innocuous-sounding concoction called \u201cmarinated red peppers\u201d, which turned out to be an odd, circular serving of rich, smoky-sweet, remarkable-tasting pepper served on marble with nothing. \u201cWould you like bread?\u201d asked one of the celestial visions. What else would we do with it? Scrape the marble with a knife directly into our mouths? I called Charles before writing this, and he asked if we\u2019d even eaten here. I said, \u201cYes, we sat at the table and ate bowls of amazing smoked almonds. And an absolutely gorgeous piece of turbot. The staff were lovely and they talked to you about mezcal.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember eating,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had quail, which arrived cut in half on a marble slab. We had gambas rojo, which were delicious, but, like, \u00a318 for four. And a plate of cecina. And chocolate tart, which was sort of so-so. The staff all seemed to be models.\u201d \u201cI remember the staff,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d Decimo \u2013 gorgeous, sexy and glamorous as hell \u2013 is sweeping the restaurant world into a new decade. Whether Charles is getting to go there with me is an entirely different column. \u2022 Decimo The Standard, 10 Argyle Street, London WC1, 020-3981 8888. Open Tues-Sat, dinner only (for the time being), 6pm-3am (midnight Tues &amp; Wed). About \u00a375 a head, plus drinks and service. Food 7/10 Atmosphere 9/10 Service 8/10",

      "bodyText": "The oddest thing on Tindersticks\u2019 12th album is its longest track, See My Girls. Stuart Staples, a mannered singer anyway, sounds as if he has been studying Ron Moody playing Fagin in Oliver! And the lyric he delivers in that sly and insinuating voice is set in an unspecified past, in which cameras and newsstands are still everyday things. On the walls of his kiosk, the narrator has pinned the photos his girls have sent him from their travels \u2013 Paris, Rome, the Pyramids \u2013 via some very odd phrasing (\u201cThe tall buildings of the Americas / Skyscrapers as they are known.\u201d Skyscrapers, you say? Really?). Eventually they end up at the scenes of death: Flanders, Birkenau, Cambodia, Yemen, Israel and Palestine. And then it\u2019s back to turtles and dolphins and trees. It appears to be the blandest of all messages: well, the world\u2019s a rum old place, eh? Musically it is so compelling \u2013 a twisting, droning, spidery piece \u2013 that it only makes the lyric seem odder. That aside, No Treasure But Hope is much as you would expect: subdued and crepuscular, everything stripped back so each musical element is distinct and has its own breathing space.

Her sensual montages are the stuff of dreams. She was Picasso\u2019s collaborator as well as lover, taking a series of photographs that document the creation of his masterpiece Guernica in a Left Bank loft.

Chicago\u2019s famous installation The Dinner Party put women on the top table of history. Her equally spectacular works here include The Birth Project, an intimate exploration of motherhood, and her dark, even apocalyptic recent meditations on death and extinction. <br><em><a href=\"https://baltic.art/whats-on/exhibitions/judy-chicago\">BALTIC, Gateshead, Saturday 16 November to 19 April</a></em></p> <h2>Troy: Myth and Reality</h2> <p>The siege of a city in Asia Minor by an alliance of Greek heroes is an event between legend and history. The Greek poet Hesiod called the warriors \u201cdemigods\u201d. Homer tells of the obstinacy of the mightiest, Achilles, in The Iliad. But what is the archaeological reality behind this war that has echoed through world culture and still inspires fiction and films today? This should be a fascinating, even moving, journey to the dawn of human memory. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/troy-myth-and-reality\">British Museum, WC1, Thursday 21 November to 8 March</a></em></p> <h2>Hamish Fulton</h2> <p>This pioneer of British conceptual art has spent a lifetime walking. Even more ascetically than his contemporary Richard Long, he rejected the permanent, commodified art object in favour of a direct and transient engagement with the landscape. Since 1972, he has walked the earth, recording his footsore journeys with photographs and words. In our age of planetary crisis, his ecological vision has new urgency. <br><em><a href=\"http://parafin.co.uk/artists--hamish-fulton.html\">Parafin Gallery, W1, Friday 22 November to 8 February</a></em></p> <h2>Hello, Robot.</h2> <p>Our fascination with robots is insatiable, dominating science fiction from Metropolis to the Terminator franchise. As real robots become increasingly capable, are we on the verge of living in an Asimov story? Or do we confuse R2-D2 with what are just lumbering claws and digitised cars?

She did it with Jane Eyre and now she has done a stunning job with her Narnia adaptation, which received rave reviews at Leeds Playhouse in 2017. It is full of puppets, aerial acrobatics and cracking storytelling. <br><em><a href=\"https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe/\">Bridge Theatre, SE1, to 2 February</a></em></p> <h2>The Season</h2> <p>If all you want for Christmas is a warm-hearted new musical, this one might well be it. The show is composed by Jim Barne and Kit Buchan, recipients of the 2018 MTI Stiles + Drewe mentorship award. The action kicks off on Christmas Eve, when Dougal travels from Northampton to New York for his father\u2019s wedding \u2013 and finds himself drawn to the most unlikely of love interests.

After being jailed for 92 days, he now lives in exile in Germany. This is his story, which Pippa Hill and Sophie Ivatts have adapted from the book Dundar wrote during his incarceration. It is a co-production between the Arcola and the RSC. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/we-are-arrested/\">Arcola Theatre, E8, to 7 December</a></em></p> <h2>The Strange Tale of Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel</h2> <p>Who knew Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel used to be pals? Before Chaplin discovered worldwide fame and Laurel discovered Hardy, the duo toured North America for two years with a music hall troupe. Laurel never forgot that time; Chaplin never mentioned it. Told By an Idiot investigates this unlikely coupling with its customary playfulness and wit.

Brighton, Saturday 16; London, Sunday 17; Manchester, Tuesday 19 November Toni Braxton Sure, the highlights will centre on the classic singles \u2013 the sultry hush of Breathe Again, uber-ballad Un-Break My Heart\u2019s medically dubious proclamations, and early 00s anti-moron anthem He Wasn\u2019t Man Enough for Me \u2013 but keep an ear out for choice cuts from last year\u2019s surprisingly excellent Grammy-nominated Sex &amp; Cigarettes, specifically lead single Long As I Live. Eventim Apollo, W6, Saturday 16 November MC Jan Garbarek Group The plaintive, spacey and instantly recognisable sax sound of Norway\u2019s Jan Garbarek has symbolised jazz\u2019s evolution into a global language for half a century \u2013 as has his record label, the famed ECM. At the Festival Hall, Garbarek\u2019s band, including percussion star Trilok Gurtu, help celebrate ECM\u2019s 50th, an opening-weekend highlight of the London jazz festival. Saffron Hall, Saffron Walden, Saturday 16; Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Sunday 17 November JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes? Gustavo Dudamel brings the Los Angeles Philharmonic to London for a residency at the Barbican this week. There is Ginastera, Stravinsky and Bruckner in the programmes, as well as a concert in which the orchestra are joined by jazz great Herbie Hancock (Tue), and two commissions new to London. Andrew Norman\u2019s Sustain (Wed) is described as a \u201cmeditation on humanity\u2019s relationship to nature\u201d, while John Adams\u2019s Must the Devil Have All the Best Tunes? (Mon) is a piano concerto composed for the flying fingers of Yuja Wang. Barbican Hall, EC2, Monday 18 to Wednesday 20 November Hanna Hartman Hanna Hartman, the Swedish composer-in-residence at this year\u2019s Huddersfield contemporary music festival, gets three concerts to herself. The first includes a HCMF commission, Hurricane Season, for moving amplified sounds and objects, while the second is devoted to one of Hartman\u2019s best-known pieces, Secret Security \u2013 music theatre for electronics and tiny objects, whose movements are projected on to a video screen. Various venues, Huddersfield, Sunday 17 to Tuesday 19 November Death in Venice It is more than a quarter of a century since Benjamin Britten\u2019s last opera was seen at Covent Garden. The new production of this adaptation of Thomas Mann\u2019s novella promises to be one of the highlights of the Royal Opera season. It is directed by David McVicar and designed by Vicki Mortimer, with tenor Mark Padmore as Gustav von Aschenbach, the role written for Peter Pears. Richard Farnes conducts. Royal Opera House, WC2, Thursday 21 to 6 December AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Dora Maar This radical surrealist photographer was at the heart of the Parisian avant garde in the 1930s. Her sensual montages are the stuff of dreams. She was Picasso\u2019s collaborator as well as lover, taking a series of photographs that document the creation of his masterpiece Guernica in a Left Bank loft. In this Tate retrospective, she escapes his shadow. Tate Modern, SE1, Wednesday 20 November to 15 March Judy Chicago One of the pioneers of feminist art gets a major UK survey as she turns 80. Chicago\u2019s famous installation The Dinner Party put women on the top table of history. Her equally spectacular works here include The Birth Project, an intimate exploration of motherhood, and her dark, even apocalyptic recent meditations on death and extinction. BALTIC, Gateshead, Saturday 16 November to 19 April Troy: Myth and Reality The siege of a city in Asia Minor by an alliance of Greek heroes is an event between legend and history. The Greek poet Hesiod called the warriors \u201cdemigods\u201d. Homer tells of the obstinacy of the mightiest, Achilles, in The Iliad. But what is the archaeological reality behind this war that has echoed through world culture and still inspires fiction and films today? This should be a fascinating, even moving, journey to the dawn of human memory. British Museum, WC1, Thursday 21 November to 8 March Hamish Fulton This pioneer of British conceptual art has spent a lifetime walking. Even more ascetically than his contemporary Richard Long, he rejected the permanent, commodified art object in favour of a direct and transient engagement with the landscape. Since 1972, he has walked the earth, recording his footsore journeys with photographs and words. In our age of planetary crisis, his ecological vision has new urgency. Parafin Gallery, W1, Friday 22 November to 8 February Hello, Robot. Our fascination with robots is insatiable, dominating science fiction from Metropolis to the Terminator franchise. As real robots become increasingly capable, are we on the verge of living in an Asimov story? Or do we confuse R2-D2 with what are just lumbering claws and digitised cars? This exhibition looks at the state of robotics today alongside fantasies of intelligent machines in film, pop and fashion. V&amp;A Dundee, to 9 February JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows My Brilliant Friend For fans of Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan Novels \u2013 and there are lots of us \u2013 this stage adaptation, spread over two plays, is big news. For everyone else: where have you been? The story is set in Naples and charts the ferociously intense and lifelong friendship between two girls-then-women, Lila and Lenu. Melly Still directs Niamh Cusack and Catherine McCormack. National Theatre: Olivier, SE1, to 22 February The Lion, the Witch &amp; the Wardrobe Director Sally Cookson is brilliant at capturing the essence of classic novels and releasing it on stage. She did it with Jane Eyre and now she has done a stunning job with her Narnia adaptation, which received rave reviews at Leeds Playhouse in 2017. It is full of puppets, aerial acrobatics and cracking storytelling. Bridge Theatre, SE1, to 2 February The Season If all you want for Christmas is a warm-hearted new musical, this one might well be it. The show is composed by Jim Barne and Kit Buchan, recipients of the 2018 MTI Stiles + Drewe mentorship award. The action kicks off on Christmas Eve, when Dougal travels from Northampton to New York for his father\u2019s wedding \u2013 and finds himself drawn to the most unlikely of love interests. Tim Jackson directs. New Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich, Saturday 16; The Royal, Northampton, Tuesday 19 to 30 November #WeAreArrested As editor-in-chief at a Turkish newspaper, Can D\u00fcndar was arrested after publishing footage of Turkish state intelligence delivering weapons to rebel fighters in Syria. After being jailed for 92 days, he now lives in exile in Germany. This is his story, which Pippa Hill and Sophie Ivatts have adapted from the book Dundar wrote during his incarceration. It is a co-production between the Arcola and the RSC. Arcola Theatre, E8, to 7 December The Strange Tale of Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel Who knew Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel used to be pals? Before Chaplin discovered worldwide fame and Laurel discovered Hardy, the duo toured North America for two years with a music hall troupe. Laurel never forgot that time; Chaplin never mentioned it. Told By an Idiot investigates this unlikely coupling with its customary playfulness and wit. The show previews ahead of a UK tour in 2020. Theatre Royal: The Drum, Plymouth, to 30 November; touring to 29 March MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Matthew Bourne\u2019s The Red Shoes Lavish sets, ballet in-jokes and a love letter to the world of the theatre in Matthew Bourne\u2019s dance version of the Powell and Pressburger classic. The award-winning Ashley Shaw reprises the Moira Shearer role as dancer Vicky Page, joined by Adam Cooper, returning to Bourne\u2019s company for the first time in 20 years. Theatre Royal: The Lyric, Plymouth, Monday 18 to 23 November; touring to 6 June Le Ballet De L\u2019Op\u00e9ra National Du Rhin: Les Beaux Dormants A contemporary reimagining of the Sleeping Beauty story from the Canadian choreographer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Blackburn that sees the fairytale as a metaphor for adolescent awakenings with all the energy and uncertainty of teenage life. Royal Opera House: Linbury Theatre, WC2, Thursday 21 to 24 November Company Chameleon: The Shadow Carl Jung\u2019s model of the psyche meets the apocalypse in Anthony Missen\u2019s new work. It uses athletic contemporary dance to play out a dark thriller, delving into the psychology of six characters and their shadow counterparts. HOME, Manchester, Friday 22 &amp; Saturday 23; touring to 30 November LW",

      "body": "<p>He was the right man at the right time for the New York Red Bulls. Having just moved into their jewel of a new stadium in Harrison, New Jersey, they needed something to capture new fans and a local media market which had somewhat lost interest. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/14/thierry-henry-new-york-barcelona\">signing of Thierry Henry</a> fit the bill, with the legendary striker not just going on to become one of the most influential figures in RBNY\u2019s history, but Major League Soccer as a whole.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/14/zlatan-says-goodbye-to-hollywood-leaving-behind-a-legacy-hard-to-define\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic's legacy hard to define as he bids Hollywood farewell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now Henry will attempt to make a similar impact as a manager following his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/14/thierry-henry-appointed-head-coach-mls-montreal-impact\">confirmation as the Montreal Impact\u2019s new head coach</a>. It always seemed likely that Henry would one day take a coaching job in MLS. That he accepted an offer from Canada and not from the Red Bulls was more of a surprise, but in a French-speaking, diverse and most suitably, cool, city like Montreal the 42-year-old may well feel at home.</p> <p>MLS might also be the right place at the right time for Henry. This is a league that\u2019s starting to earn itself a reputation as a proving ground for young managers. Not so long ago, MLS struggled to attract high-caliber coaches. For all the big name stars lured across the Atlantic as designated players, MLS managers tended to be former stalwarts of the league (like Jason Kreis and Ben Olsen) or the same old suspects (like Dominic Kinnear and Sigi Schmid). The (ill-fated) appointment of Ruud Gullit by the LA Galaxy in 2007 was about as adventurous as it got.</p> <p>Henry\u2019s arrival at Montreal, however, only adds to a growing trend. The Frenchman should aim to follow the precedent set by his former Arsenal and international teammate Patrick Vieira, who got his senior managerial start at New York City FC, proving himself in the Bronx before making the return to Europe with Nice. Even for a figure of Vieira\u2019s stature, MLS was useful to him as a stepping stone.</p> <p>Jesse Marsch is another who has proved the league\u2019s worth for young managers. Of course, unlike Vieira he was an MLS native, playing as a midfielder for DC United, the Chicago Fire and Chivas USA, but did enough during three years in charge of RBNY to first attract the attentions of RB Leipzig, where he served as assistant for a season, and then Red Bull Salzburg, where he became the first American coach to win a Champions League game this season.</p> <p>Of course, the Montreal Impact job isn\u2019t Henry\u2019s first in senior management. That came at Monaco where the 42-year-old lasted just 20 matches in charge. Indeed, Henry did nothing to hint at any top level potential as a coach during his time in Ligue 1 and so he needs this opportunity in MLS to show a truer reflection of himself.</p> <p>Montreal Impact president Kevin Gilmore clearly liked what he heard, with Henry the only candidate they interviewed for the job. Did this allow them to do due diligence on a coach who flamed out spectacularly in his first and only managerial job to date? Have Montreal been seduced by Henry\u2019s name rather than his qualifications for the position?</p> <p>Another MLS precedent for Henry to follow would be the one set by Frank de Boer in 2019. The Dutchman arrived at Atlanta United\u2019s new manager as damaged goods having flopped badly at Crystal Palace and Inter. Early on it seemed that he might flop at Atlanta too, but his ideas and methods took root over time, taking his team to the Eastern Conference final. If de Boer gets another chance in Europe it will be in no small part down to the work he\u2019s done in MLS.</p> <p>Even De Boer\u2019s Atlanta United predecessor, Tata Martino, used MLS in his resume to secure his next job, taking over as Mexico national team boss after winning MLS Cup in 2018. Sure, he already had a lot on his resume, working with Lionel Messi at both Barcelona and Argentina, but defeats in back-to-back Copa Am\u00e9rica finals left him with a point to prove. He did that at Atlanta United.</p> <p>Henry is widely regarded as a student of the game and having worked under Pep Guardiola and Arsene Wenger as a player he has surely soaked a lot up. As is the core challenge of management, he now has to impart that wisdom and knowledge on his Montreal players and make sure it sticks.</p> <p>At Monaco, Henry often struggled to understand why his players couldn\u2019t perform instructions as well as he could as a player. Encouragement very quickly became frustration and this was with a squad that included Cesc Fabregas, Radamel Falcao and Nacer Chadli. If Henry allowed Monaco\u2019s lack of quality to frustrate him, he might get a shock at his first Montreal Impact practice session.</p> <p>As an MLS franchise, the Montreal Impact have long occupied a strange no man\u2019s land between the marquee level and the bottom feeders. They have made big moves before, like the one to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/27/didier-drogba-montreal-impact-chelsea\">sign Didier Drogba back in 2015</a>, they have shown ambition, like with the appointment of former Aston Villa and Lyon manager Remi Garde in 2017, but have never been able to match the likes of the LA Galaxy, Atlanta United, Los Angeles FC and rivals Toronto FC both in terms of mainstream attention and silverware.</p> <p>Henry\u2019s appointment on its own won\u2019t do that, but Montreal hope that his arrival at Stade Saputo will herald a new age for the club. The Frenchman\u2019s arrival in MLS as a player nine years ago carried a certain significance and the same could prove to be true of his return to the league as a manager.</p>",

      "bodyText": "He was the right man at the right time for the New York Red Bulls. Having just moved into their jewel of a new stadium in Harrison, New Jersey, they needed something to capture new fans and a local media market which had somewhat lost interest. The signing of Thierry Henry fit the bill, with the legendary striker not just going on to become one of the most influential figures in RBNY\u2019s history, but Major League Soccer as a whole. Now Henry will attempt to make a similar impact as a manager following his confirmation as the Montreal Impact\u2019s new head coach. It always seemed likely that Henry would one day take a coaching job in MLS. That he accepted an offer from Canada and not from the Red Bulls was more of a surprise, but in a French-speaking, diverse and most suitably, cool, city like Montreal the 42-year-old may well feel at home. MLS might also be the right place at the right time for Henry. This is a league that\u2019s starting to earn itself a reputation as a proving ground for young managers. Not so long ago, MLS struggled to attract high-caliber coaches. For all the big name stars lured across the Atlantic as designated players, MLS managers tended to be former stalwarts of the league (like Jason Kreis and Ben Olsen) or the same old suspects (like Dominic Kinnear and Sigi Schmid). The (ill-fated) appointment of Ruud Gullit by the LA Galaxy in 2007 was about as adventurous as it got. Henry\u2019s arrival at Montreal, however, only adds to a growing trend. The Frenchman should aim to follow the precedent set by his former Arsenal and international teammate Patrick Vieira, who got his senior managerial start at New York City FC, proving himself in the Bronx before making the return to Europe with Nice. Even for a figure of Vieira\u2019s stature, MLS was useful to him as a stepping stone. Jesse Marsch is another who has proved the league\u2019s worth for young managers. Of course, unlike Vieira he was an MLS native, playing as a midfielder for DC United, the Chicago Fire and Chivas USA, but did enough during three years in charge of RBNY to first attract the attentions of RB Leipzig, where he served as assistant for a season, and then Red Bull Salzburg, where he became the first American coach to win a Champions League game this season. Of course, the Montreal Impact job isn\u2019t Henry\u2019s first in senior management. That came at Monaco where the 42-year-old lasted just 20 matches in charge. Indeed, Henry did nothing to hint at any top level potential as a coach during his time in Ligue 1 and so he needs this opportunity in MLS to show a truer reflection of himself. Montreal Impact president Kevin Gilmore clearly liked what he heard, with Henry the only candidate they interviewed for the job. Did this allow them to do due diligence on a coach who flamed out spectacularly in his first and only managerial job to date? Have Montreal been seduced by Henry\u2019s name rather than his qualifications for the position? Another MLS precedent for Henry to follow would be the one set by Frank de Boer in 2019. The Dutchman arrived at Atlanta United\u2019s new manager as damaged goods having flopped badly at Crystal Palace and Inter. Early on it seemed that he might flop at Atlanta too, but his ideas and methods took root over time, taking his team to the Eastern Conference final. If de Boer gets another chance in Europe it will be in no small part down to the work he\u2019s done in MLS. Even De Boer\u2019s Atlanta United predecessor, Tata Martino, used MLS in his resume to secure his next job, taking over as Mexico national team boss after winning MLS Cup in 2018. Sure, he already had a lot on his resume, working with Lionel Messi at both Barcelona and Argentina, but defeats in back-to-back Copa Am\u00e9rica finals left him with a point to prove. He did that at Atlanta United. Henry is widely regarded as a student of the game and having worked under Pep Guardiola and Arsene Wenger as a player he has surely soaked a lot up. As is the core challenge of management, he now has to impart that wisdom and knowledge on his Montreal players and make sure it sticks. At Monaco, Henry often struggled to understand why his players couldn\u2019t perform instructions as well as he could as a player. Encouragement very quickly became frustration and this was with a squad that included Cesc Fabregas, Radamel Falcao and Nacer Chadli. If Henry allowed Monaco\u2019s lack of quality to frustrate him, he might get a shock at his first Montreal Impact practice session. As an MLS franchise, the Montreal Impact have long occupied a strange no man\u2019s land between the marquee level and the bottom feeders. They have made big moves before, like the one to sign Didier Drogba back in 2015, they have shown ambition, like with the appointment of former Aston Villa and Lyon manager Remi Garde in 2017, but have never been able to match the likes of the LA Galaxy, Atlanta United, Los Angeles FC and rivals Toronto FC both in terms of mainstream attention and silverware. Henry\u2019s appointment on its own won\u2019t do that, but Montreal hope that his arrival at Stade Saputo will herald a new age for the club. The Frenchman\u2019s arrival in MLS as a player nine years ago carried a certain significance and the same could prove to be true of his return to the league as a manager.",

Also out this month Charles Rumback and Ryley Walker\u2019s Little Common Twist (Thrill Jockey) plays with folk instrumentation in subtly psychedelic, inventive ways. Alison Cotton\u2019s The Girl I Left Behind Me (Claypipe Music) is not an album as such, but a 10-inch of two very long tracks, adding wintry twists to her eerie palette of folk soundscapes (both were originally recorded as soundtracks to Muriel Spark short stories). Catherine Rudie\u2019s The M\u00f6bius Kiss (Hudson Records) is a fascinating, personal debut from the Scottish folk singer, exploring the experience of a long-term relationship ending as her home and studio were destroyed to make way for luxury flats. Her rootsy voice and folk melodies mesh with electronic sounds, warmly drawing you in.",

For the Lib Dems to make inroads and avoid being squeezed, their task is to try and dramatically change the narrative \u2013 which the party is trying to do by putting highly selective polling information on its campaign leaflets in individual seats in an attempt to get voters to rethink. This may prove possible in some cases, most notably in Finchley and Golders Green, where Luciana Berger, a former Labour MP, hopes to come from a distant fourth to snatch the seat by focusing her campaign on antisemitism in a constituency with a significant proportion of Jewish voters. It is far more challenging to do so nationally however. The party has tried, by portraying its leader, Jo Swinson, as a potential prime minister, although this is an unlikely possibility, given its position third in the polls. This attempted prime ministerial portrayal also explains why the Lib Dems are so unhappy about being squeezed out of the first TV debate: a head to head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, and why the two main parties are so keen to do so. Current polling suggests that the Lib Dems will do better than in 2017, when the party secured a dismal 7.4% and only picked up 12 seats. But the Guardian\u2019s poll tracker shows that it will come under intense pressure from Labour, now ahead among remain voters, and that its national share is currently only 16%. All in all, the party will do exceptionally well to end up with 30 seats, and in fact, faces a battle to better the 20 it held at the conclusion of the last parliament, boosted by defections from both the Conservatives and Labour.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarah-hall-novelist\" title=\"\">Sarah Hall</a> is one of our most influential short story writers. Echoes of her dark magic realism, eco-apocalyptic landscapes, coolly sexual heroines and coiled, restrained, blackly ironic narrative voices are everywhere in the work of emerging writers such as Nicole Flattery and Julia Armfield. Her 2017 collection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/07/madame-zero-sarah-hall-review\" title=\"\"><em>Madame Zero</em></a> was electrifying: a taut, defiant body of stories that evoked in glorious prose the animal in us all, and took us, in tale after tale, to the edge of what makes us human.</p> <p>So this new collection is much anticipated, and when it opens, as <em>Madame Zero</em> did, with the story of a transforming woman, we brace ourselves for another terrifying ride. At first, it seems to deliver. Here are the careful, sensual descriptions, like those that changed a young wife into a vixen in the award-winning \u201cMrs Fox\u201d. A lawyer becomes a harpy: there is \u201ca crack behind her, huge and dull and viscose as the wings extend, unfurl and are filled, begin her flight\u201d. Here is the crisp use of the present tense; the single-word, rhythmic sentences; and the violence. \u201cAccident. A broken neck. And no post-mortem to reveal the delicately evacuated heart.\u201d This time, though, the story is told from the point of view of the transforming person, and she is allowed feelings, pity for her lover, plans and even a little exposition. Soon, she is functioning within a recognisable moral scheme: transformed by her own womanly pain and motivated by other women\u2019s pain. Mrs Fox, on the other hand, became a fox because, thrillingly, she just did, and alarmingly, mightn\u2019t we all?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The imagery becomes gloriously florid, the observation acute, the dialogue hilarious, the action fluid</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The following story is, by Hall\u2019s standards, downright soothing. A man in a Turkish resort follows a young woman and recognises in her the child that he once knew. The landscape is full of light and beautifully realised, but tension is lacking because the protagonist is, startlingly for a Hall story, almost entirely benign. Another story set in Turkey, a fable set round a sacred well, takes us back into her familiar darkness \u2013 \u201cthe water is so cold it can shatter bones; it can sting the brain and seize the heart within a minute\u201d \u2013 but here again the tale is contained, rescued, this time by storytelling women who seem to be making an intervention on the right side of history.</p> <p>Moral reasoning has even touched Hall\u2019s famously savage portrayals of sex. The elderly protagonist of \u201cOrton\u201d is gifted with memories of alfresco intercourse to set beside the disinhibited love-making of Evie in <em>Madame Zero</em>. This woman is also fitted out with one of Hall\u2019s usually fiendish futuristic machines \u2013 this time, a pacemaker that you can arrange to have turned off when you are ready to die. The combination of sex and machine, though, leads to a more reassuring conclusion. Whereas Evie\u2019s gorging on sex turns out to have a disturbing basis \u2013 a brain tumour \u2013 here the protagonist is reconciling herself to death and answering that familiar question: what was the finest moment of your life?</p> <p>Two apparently autobiographical stories at the end of the collection seem to account for this softening. In \u201cSudden Traveller\u201d a woman with a baby watches her father and brother dig her mother\u2019s grave and considers what stories are for: \u201cthe currency of past lives. Families, lovers, enemies, friends. We are all of us sudden travellers in the world, blind, passing each other, reaching out, missing, sometimes taking hold.\u201d The story provides an elegant, moving series of reflections but it is static in both time and space, as is the next piece, \u201cLive that You May Live\u201d, where a young mother tells her sleepless daughter tales about magical birds and similarly hopes that stories will anchor her in time. \u201cShe is another story, not this story \u2026 She is not mine \u2026 They will wind her forward every night \u2026 They are coming on white, definite wings.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/29/a-new-start-sarah-hall-trauma-unexpected-tonic-extreme-reading-booker\">A new start: Sarah Hall on trauma and the unexpected tonic of extreme reading</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Hall is at her best when she lets her stories displace us in time; when they reveal gaps, not connections, between people. \u201cThe Grotesques\u201d, for instance, makes magnificent play of a mother who fails to let her daughter tell her own story: \u201cMummy could change a story or revise history with astonishing audacity.\u201d As a result, the adult Dilly finds herself hapless, tottering around a rainy Cambridge on her birthday, wondering if she will be allowed to eat a scone at tea, and how to explain to her family about Charlie-bo, a sleeping homeless man who has had fruit arranged over him by students.</p> <p>As soon as she is dealing only with dreadful people \u2013 cruel undergraduates, a scapegoating, utterly English family who wear each other\u2019s dressing gowns and have no proper boundaries, a terrible clergyman \u2013 Hall lets go of the grandeur and stasis that weigh down parts of this collection. The imagery becomes gloriously florid, the observation acute, the dialogue hilarious, the action fluid, and the ending shocking yet wholly inevitable. The story is also, it is true, appalling: a vertiginous vista to the very depths of humanity. It is not comfortable on this edge, and it is easy to understand why Hall has retreated from it a little. Harsh as it may be, though, I can\u2019t help but hope that this exceptional writer will go back to that verge soon.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Kate Clanchy\u2019s Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me is published by Picador.

      "bodyText": "Sarah Hall is one of our most influential short story writers. Echoes of her dark magic realism, eco-apocalyptic landscapes, coolly sexual heroines and coiled, restrained, blackly ironic narrative voices are everywhere in the work of emerging writers such as Nicole Flattery and Julia Armfield. Her 2017 collection Madame Zero was electrifying: a taut, defiant body of stories that evoked in glorious prose the animal in us all, and took us, in tale after tale, to the edge of what makes us human. So this new collection is much anticipated, and when it opens, as Madame Zero did, with the story of a transforming woman, we brace ourselves for another terrifying ride. At first, it seems to deliver. Here are the careful, sensual descriptions, like those that changed a young wife into a vixen in the award-winning \u201cMrs Fox\u201d. A lawyer becomes a harpy: there is \u201ca crack behind her, huge and dull and viscose as the wings extend, unfurl and are filled, begin her flight\u201d. Here is the crisp use of the present tense; the single-word, rhythmic sentences; and the violence. \u201cAccident. A broken neck. And no post-mortem to reveal the delicately evacuated heart.\u201d This time, though, the story is told from the point of view of the transforming person, and she is allowed feelings, pity for her lover, plans and even a little exposition. Soon, she is functioning within a recognisable moral scheme: transformed by her own womanly pain and motivated by other women\u2019s pain. Mrs Fox, on the other hand, became a fox because, thrillingly, she just did, and alarmingly, mightn\u2019t we all? The following story is, by Hall\u2019s standards, downright soothing. A man in a Turkish resort follows a young woman and recognises in her the child that he once knew. The landscape is full of light and beautifully realised, but tension is lacking because the protagonist is, startlingly for a Hall story, almost entirely benign. Another story set in Turkey, a fable set round a sacred well, takes us back into her familiar darkness \u2013 \u201cthe water is so cold it can shatter bones; it can sting the brain and seize the heart within a minute\u201d \u2013 but here again the tale is contained, rescued, this time by storytelling women who seem to be making an intervention on the right side of history. Moral reasoning has even touched Hall\u2019s famously savage portrayals of sex. The elderly protagonist of \u201cOrton\u201d is gifted with memories of alfresco intercourse to set beside the disinhibited love-making of Evie in Madame Zero. This woman is also fitted out with one of Hall\u2019s usually fiendish futuristic machines \u2013 this time, a pacemaker that you can arrange to have turned off when you are ready to die. The combination of sex and machine, though, leads to a more reassuring conclusion. Whereas Evie\u2019s gorging on sex turns out to have a disturbing basis \u2013 a brain tumour \u2013 here the protagonist is reconciling herself to death and answering that familiar question: what was the finest moment of your life? Two apparently autobiographical stories at the end of the collection seem to account for this softening. In \u201cSudden Traveller\u201d a woman with a baby watches her father and brother dig her mother\u2019s grave and considers what stories are for: \u201cthe currency of past lives. Families, lovers, enemies, friends. We are all of us sudden travellers in the world, blind, passing each other, reaching out, missing, sometimes taking hold.\u201d The story provides an elegant, moving series of reflections but it is static in both time and space, as is the next piece, \u201cLive that You May Live\u201d, where a young mother tells her sleepless daughter tales about magical birds and similarly hopes that stories will anchor her in time. \u201cShe is another story, not this story \u2026 She is not mine \u2026 They will wind her forward every night \u2026 They are coming on white, definite wings.\u201d But Hall is at her best when she lets her stories displace us in time; when they reveal gaps, not connections, between people. \u201cThe Grotesques\u201d, for instance, makes magnificent play of a mother who fails to let her daughter tell her own story: \u201cMummy could change a story or revise history with astonishing audacity.\u201d As a result, the adult Dilly finds herself hapless, tottering around a rainy Cambridge on her birthday, wondering if she will be allowed to eat a scone at tea, and how to explain to her family about Charlie-bo, a sleeping homeless man who has had fruit arranged over him by students. As soon as she is dealing only with dreadful people \u2013 cruel undergraduates, a scapegoating, utterly English family who wear each other\u2019s dressing gowns and have no proper boundaries, a terrible clergyman \u2013 Hall lets go of the grandeur and stasis that weigh down parts of this collection. The imagery becomes gloriously florid, the observation acute, the dialogue hilarious, the action fluid, and the ending shocking yet wholly inevitable. The story is also, it is true, appalling: a vertiginous vista to the very depths of humanity. It is not comfortable on this edge, and it is easy to understand why Hall has retreated from it a little. Harsh as it may be, though, I can\u2019t help but hope that this exceptional writer will go back to that verge soon. \u2022 Kate Clanchy\u2019s Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me is published by Picador.

The space was usually used as a basketball court, and someone had fastidiously taped a blue tarpaulin over the floor.</p> <p>Biden spoke for about 10 minutes and answered questions, adeptly, on topics including the environment and gun control. Like at the statehouse event, there was a gaggle of youngsters, roughly 18 to 25. A lot of them had been at the earlier rally. The youth had been placed behind Biden, holding signs and generally looking enthusiastic. Again, none would chat to the media.

      "bodyText": "Plastic waste exports to south-east Asia have been implicated in extreme levels of toxins entering the human food chain in Indonesia. A new study that sampled chicken eggs around sites in the country where plastic waste accumulates identified alarming levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls long recognised as extremely injurious to human health. In one location the level of dioxins in eggs collected near an Indonesian factory that burns plastics for fuel were similar to levels in eggs collected near the notorious Agent Orange hotspot in Bien Hoa, Vietnam, which is considered one of the most dioxin-contaminated locations on Earth. The study is the first to demonstrate food chain contamination in south-east Asia with high levels of hazardous chemicals as a consequence of waste mismanagement and plastic waste imports. The report \u2013 Plastic Waste Poisons Indonesia\u2019s Food Chain \u2013 was compiled by researchers from the global environmental health network IPEN, along with the Arnika Association and several local Indonesian organisations. According to the study, an adult eating just one egg from a free-range chicken foraging in the vicinity of the tofu factory in Tropodo would exceed the European Food Safety Authority tolerable daily intake for chlorinated dioxins by seventy-fold. Researchers collected and analysed free-range chicken eggs from the Bangun and Tropodo communities in East Java, locations that have been inundated with imported plastic waste since China closed its doors to such waste in 2018. By contrast, Indonesia\u2019s import volume doubled between 2017 and 2018, with residents in some areas burning piles of plastic waste to reduce the volume clogging streets and piling up around houses. In Tropodo, the waste is used to fuel local tofu factories. Eggs collected in the communities were found to contain highly hazardous banned chemicals including dioxins, flame retardants, and the toxic \u201cforever chemical\u201d, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Numerous studies have linked the chemicals found in the eggs with a host of health impacts. Dioxin exposure is linked to a variety of serious illnesses in humans, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and endometriosis. Flame retardant chemicals, short-chain chlorinated paraffins and polybrominated diphenyl ethers disrupt endocrine function and negatively affect reproductive health. PFOS causes reproductive and immune system damage, and internal company documents indicate that manufacturers knew about its toxicity for decades, but continued making it. \u201cPlastic waste is a serious toxic chemical pollution problem,\u201d said Yuyun Ismawati, co-founder of Nexus3, one of the Indonesian NGOs involved. \u201cOur results should ring alarm bells in every community trying to deal with a tsunami of plastic waste.

      "bodyText": "To enter the highlands of Chiapas, in southern Mexico, is to enter a world of vibrant indigenous culture, breathtaking natural beauty, entrenched racism and grinding poverty. It is also to enter the territory of Coca-Cola. More Coke is consumed per capita in Mexico than in any other country, and some studies suggest the indigenous communities of the highlands, or Los Altos, may be the soft drink\u2019s most loyal customers on the planet. San Juan Cancuc, a small community in Chiapas known for its consumption of Coca-Cola A Coca-Cola van in the narrow streets of San Crist\u00f3bal The signs are everywhere. Red trucks emblazoned with the curly white logo are familiar sights in towns and far-flung villages and on the winding, mist-shrouded mountain roads that connect them. Coca-Cola fridges occupy the most visible spots in most corner shops, while billboard adverts are so widespread they often end up as building materials for the very poor. A celebration in the village of Zinacant\u00e1n, with dancing, singing, alcohol and soft drinks No gathering to celebrate a birth, a marriage or a patron saint is considered complete without Coke for the guests. Strikingly, Coca-Cola has become an integral part of indigenous religious observance and healing ceremonies, which are often intertwined with the Catholic pantheon but operate autonomously from the church. A bottle of Coke, believed to feed the good spirits and help the sick, is today as central a feature of many public and private rituals as incense, candles and sacrificial chickens. A woman in front of an altar at her home in El Pinar. Coca-Cola has become so intertwined with the local culture that is part of spiritual ceremonies such as this one in Tenejapa. Pascuala is a pulsadora, a type of healer. Several years ago she started using Coke in her ceremonies \u201cCoca-Cola is sweet, so the spirits will appreciate it, and it also has certain healing properties\u201d said Pascuala, a traditional healer from El Pinar. But the intertwining of Coca-Cola with local tradition in Los Altos has contributed to the rise of a health emergency that activists accuse authorities of not taking seriously enough. Type-2 diabetes is now firmly established as the biggest killer in the region, according to a study of death certificates between 2008 and 2012 in three municipalities. Jaime Page, a medical anthropologist who carried out the study, says the government has sought to keep diabetes mortality out of official statistics to avoid looking bad. Other health problems related to excessive sugar consumption, such as tooth decay, are also rampant. \u201cThe consumption of soft drinks here is really terrible, and even with diabetics themselves it can seem impossible for them to stop,\u201d Paige said. \u201cI think it might be a lost battle.\u201d Sanando Heridas is a free and itinerant healthcare system for indigenous people. Rosa is pregnant and has comes to check on the baby and her glucose level The story of how Coca-Cola became so deeply embedded in this verdant land of age-old traditions and minimal disposable income goes back to the 1960s when local indigenous leaders, with state backing, began accumulating power in religious, social and economic spheres. This included taking control of the concessions for the distribution of Coca-Cola and, initially, Pepsi too. Paige says this happened at the same time as evangelical churches were making inroads in the area and pressuring indigenous communities to stop drinking alcohol. This combination led indigenous religious leaders to start substituting Coca-Cola for the local firewater, called pox, which they had long used to feed the spirits in their rituals. In the Merced church in San Crist\u00f3bal, indigenous people have their own altar where they pray to the Virgin Mary as well as the spirits of nature.

Marketing strategies have included huge billboards with smiling indigenous models, religious references and slogans written in indigenous languages, as well as the proliferation of points of sale no matter how small the volumes shifted.

Tania, aged three, a Coke drinker, has had four milk teeth removed. Arana says the addiction starts ever earlier.

      "body": "<p>All marriages are a mystery to outsiders, they say, and even more so to the married people themselves. In 2013, writer-director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/noah-baumbach\" title=\"\">Noah Baumbach</a> got divorced from screen star Jennifer Jason Leigh, and, until Leigh presents us with her own fictionalised movie version of their breakup (and who knows if she hasn\u2019t considered it, or is considering it), we won\u2019t have anything approaching the complete creative picture. Until then, here is Baumbach\u2019s superb Marriage Story, a glorious laugh-out-loud, cry-out-loud portrait of a relationship in its death throes.</p> <p>This wonderfully sweet, sad and funny film simply delivers more moment-by-moment pleasure than anything else around. It would be reductive to call it autobiographical, but it is notable how scrupulously generous his movie is to the soon-to-be-ex-wife figure, played impeccably by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson\" title=\"\">Scarlett Johansson</a>. It is adroitly balanced and emotionally calibrated, although there are incidental details about who is the first to lawyer up, and a 55/45% split in the child custody arrangement.

But (to her chagrin) she is becoming far less important to a husband who, despite his devastating and quite unaffected intelligence and charm, is indifferent to her needs and opinions. They have an eight-year-old son, Henry (Azhy Robertson). The offer of high-profile TV work in Los Angeles brings Nicole\u2019s discontent to an awful crisis, even more painful because Charlie has a genuine, affectionate closeness to Nicole\u2019s mother, Sandra \u2013 a wonderful performance by Julie Hagerty \u2013 and sister Cassie (Merritt Wever).

      "bodyText": "All marriages are a mystery to outsiders, they say, and even more so to the married people themselves. In 2013, writer-director Noah Baumbach got divorced from screen star Jennifer Jason Leigh, and, until Leigh presents us with her own fictionalised movie version of their breakup (and who knows if she hasn\u2019t considered it, or is considering it), we won\u2019t have anything approaching the complete creative picture. Until then, here is Baumbach\u2019s superb Marriage Story, a glorious laugh-out-loud, cry-out-loud portrait of a relationship in its death throes. This wonderfully sweet, sad and funny film simply delivers more moment-by-moment pleasure than anything else around. It would be reductive to call it autobiographical, but it is notable how scrupulously generous his movie is to the soon-to-be-ex-wife figure, played impeccably by Scarlett Johansson. It is adroitly balanced and emotionally calibrated, although there are incidental details about who is the first to lawyer up, and a 55/45% split in the child custody arrangement. I wonder what Leigh makes of these points. Adam Driver and Johansson play Charlie and Nicole. He is a brilliant director in the world of off-Broadway theatre, now becoming the toast of the town; she is his wife and star player \u2013 a one-time LA movie actor who moved to New York to be with her husband and lent crucial glamour to his fledgling stage company in the beginning. But (to her chagrin) she is becoming far less important to a husband who, despite his devastating and quite unaffected intelligence and charm, is indifferent to her needs and opinions. They have an eight-year-old son, Henry (Azhy Robertson). The offer of high-profile TV work in Los Angeles brings Nicole\u2019s discontent to an awful crisis, even more painful because Charlie has a genuine, affectionate closeness to Nicole\u2019s mother, Sandra \u2013 a wonderful performance by Julie Hagerty \u2013 and sister Cassie (Merritt Wever). These women are besotted with Charlie, and who can blame them? Their relationship unravels, as does the couple\u2019s undiscussed assumption that things can be settled amicably and informally. Without realising the arms race she\u2019s starting, Nicole naively hires tough LA attorney Nora, played by Laura Dern in deliciously predatory mode, always kicking her heels off to snuggle up to her tearful client on the office couch. The baffled and bemused Charlie has no choice but to find a crazily expensive representative of his own, and must choose between attack dog Jay, played by Ray Liotta (and what a thrill to hear his syrupy-gravelly voice again) and gentle, avuncular Bert, hilariously played by Alan Alda \u2013 always including meandering anecdotes and interminable funny stories in his billable hours. (\u201cAm I paying for this joke?\u201d asks Charlie at one point, desperately.)

      "bodyText": "The methane emissions leaking from the world\u2019s coalmines could be stoking the global climate crisis at the same rate as the shipping and aviation industries combined. Coalmines are belching millions of tonnes of methane into the atmosphere unchecked, because policymakers have overlooked the rising climate threat, according to new research. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that the amount of methane seeping from new and disused coalmines may have reached just under 40m tonnes last year. The potent greenhouse gas is a major concern among climate scientists because it has a far more powerful effect on global temperatures than carbon dioxide. The global energy watchdog estimates that one tonne of methane is the climate equivalent of 30 tonnes of carbon dioxide. This would put annual coalmine emissions broadly in line with the international aviation and shipping sectors combined. The IEA revealed its shock findings in the same report which found carbon emissions from the global energy industry had reached a new record in 2018 despite a boom in renewable energy in recent years. The research is one of the first major global studies examining the problem of methane emissions from coalmines, and may help to explain the unexpected surge in methane emissions in recent years. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has found that last year\u2019s rise in methane emissions was the third biggest in two decades. A study by the American Geophysical Union said urgent action would be required to stop methane from triggering an accelerated climate crisis in which temperatures climb well beyond the target of 2C of warming. Previous studies have laid blame for rising levels of methane in the atmosphere on belching cattle, melting arctic permafrost and the destruction of wetlands and peat bogs. Methane is also known to escape from oil and gas wells, which has prompted calls for tougher regulation of the industry to reduce the climate impact. To date, coalmines have managed to avoid similar scrutiny because of a lack of data. Dave Jones, an analyst at the climate thinktank Sandbag, said the report proves the global coal industry \u201cis even more polluting than we thought\u201d and should face tougher regulation. \u201cHaving such high-profile global research from the IEA showing such a big impact should help shock policymakers into addressing coalmine methane,\u201d he said. Jones called on governments to begin accounting for the emissions from producing coal, including methane leakage, on top of the pollution caused by burning it to generate electricity. The IEA said that methane leakage from coalmines would prove more difficult to tackle than the methane pollution from the oil and gas industry, and added it did not expect the situation to improve before 2040. Oil producers could end methane leaks at zero cost if companies trap the greenhouse gas and sell it on to manufacturers, the IEA said, but capturing the emissions from coalmines would be technically tricky because the concentration of methane released by the mines is often very low.

      "bodyText": "From a Siberian slackliner who tiptoes across a line slung 100 metres above Lake Baikal to a champion free-diver with seemingly superhuman breath-holding powers, the 2019 Kendal Mountain Festival \u2013 taking place this weekend (14-17 November) in the Lake District market town \u2013 features extraordinary tales of bravery and endurance. But, among the more extreme stories, there are also tales of the healing power of nature and inspiring stories of women adventurers, older athletes and disabled outdoors lovers. Here are five highlights from the 103 films being shown over the weekend. Next year the film festival will go on tour, with Kendal film nights running in 22 locations from February to June. Bob &amp; Marion Marion Luker (78) and husband Bob (81) have been running marathons for decades. In this inspirational film they talk about why they run \u2013 and why they have no intention of stopping. It\u2019s interspersed with footage of them running across Dartmoor\u2019s epic landscape. The Running Pastor Sverri Steinholm is a Lutheran pastor on the Faroe Islands who uses trail running to deal with the challenges of his job. The camera tracks him as he takes on routes through the islands\u2019 wild, rugged terrain. Wild Swim \u201cIt\u2019s the closest I can get to my brain being still.\u201d In Wild Swim, Amy Walker talks honestly about how swimming helps her deal with depression and accept her body shape. In the film, shot at Janet\u2019s Foss waterfall in North Yorkshire, she refers to the great joy she finds in cold-water swimming. Climbing Blind This film follows the story of blind climber Jesse Dufton as he prepares to scale a remote Scottish sea stack, the Old Man of Hoy. He leads the climb, with his partner, Molly, following. Eastbound with Jenny Graham Premiering at the festival, this film profiles the endurance cyclist who broke the round-the-world record by more than two weeks in 2018, riding more than 18,000 miles fully self-supported in just under 124 days. Her story is all the more impressive given that she was in her mid-30s before she started endurance cycling. \u2022 kendalmountainfestival.com Looking for a holiday with a difference?

It includes discounts on business rates, rate relief for pubs, money to reopen train stations and a \u00a3150m fund to help groups trying to take over and run pubs and post offices threatened with closure.

Jeremy Corbyn will outline the plan during a speech in Lancaster, saying: \u201cWhat was once a luxury is now an essential utility.\u201d The plan, estimated to cost around \u00a320bn, will be funded partly by high taxes on internet companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google.

      "bodyText": "Good morning and welcome to your morning wrap of the news. The parties have rolled out some eye-catching election pledges. Our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news is up and running. In other news, impeachment procedures against Donald Trump are picking up pace. What\u2019s going on? Both parties have rolled out big-spending and, they hope, crowd-pleasing election pledges as we come to the end of a second week of campaigning. The Conservatives are offering a package to revitalise neglected towns, while Labour is promising free full-fibre broadband for homes and businesses. Boris Johnson says a Tory government would spend hundreds of millions of pounds reviving dying high streets and struggling communities. It includes discounts on business rates, rate relief for pubs, money to reopen train stations and a \u00a3150m fund to help groups trying to take over and run pubs and post offices threatened with closure. Labour has criticised the proposal, saying the Conservatives are the ones responsible for destroying high streets and towns through \u201ca decade of vicious cuts to the services that people on our communities rely on\u201d. Meanwhile Labour is promising free full-fibre broadband for every home and business by partly nationalising BT. Jeremy Corbyn will outline the plan during a speech in Lancaster, saying: \u201cWhat was once a luxury is now an essential utility.\u201d The plan, estimated to cost around \u00a320bn, will be funded partly by high taxes on internet companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. The Conservatives criticised the policy, saying it was a \u201cfantasy plan to effectively nationalise broadband [that] would cost hardworking taxpayers tens of billions\u201d. The drama around deals between parties continues to roil. Nigel Farage has attacked the Conservative party after it was claimed that senior Brexit party figures \u2013 including Ann Widdecombe \u2013 had been offered post-election roles or peerages as part of an attempt to get him to stand down more candidates at the general election. Farage said it showed \u201cthe system is corrupt and broken\u201d. At a glance Radical Labour plans to force large companies in Britain to give staff a 10% stake should be scaled back, a key architect of the policy has said. Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour will not put an arbitrary target on immigration, defending the \u201cvalue of migration to society\u201d in the face of the Tory pledge to cut numbers. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has launched a scathing review of plans from both parties to cut in-work poverty. Labour has for a long time been arguing that austerity was wrong, writes economist Mariana Mazzucato \u2013 now it finally has a plan for growth. In Canterbury the political debate and sharing of political news is playing out not in local newspapers or on television, but in a local residents\u2019 Facebook group. Six months ago Nigel Farage could fill medium-sized arenas. Now the function room of the Hull Ionians rugby club in a small town outside Hull is way too big for this self-partnered campaign genius, writes John Crace. We have a guide to the odd and unexpected candidates running in the election, from Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s niece to Count Binface. When New Labour came to power in 1997, just 3% of the public cited immigration as a key issue. By the time of the EU referendum in 2016 that figure was 48%. In today\u2019s long read Rachel Shabi unpacks how immigration became Britain\u2019s most toxic political issue. The day ahead Jeremy Corbyn will be announcing his broadband plan in a speech on digital infrastructure in Lancaster this morning. Boris Johnson will launch his campaign bus in Oldham at lunchtime. The Lib Dems go to Leeds, where Ed Davey will be giving a speech in the afternoon on economics. And there is a big question mark hanging over the Brexit party\u2019s campaign events today. There is meant to be a launch in Dudley for their candidate but it\u2019s unclear if that will go ahead \u2013 given the candidate has pulled out of the seat. Best of the rest &gt; Donald Trump\u2019s fixer Rudy Giuliani has said to the Guardian in an apparent joke that he has good \u201cinsurance\u201d if Donald Trump throws him under a bus in the impeachment process. Today, investigators are due to hear from Marie Yovanovitch, sacked by Trump as ambassador to Ukraine, who has said state department colleagues were too scared of the president to fight her corner. Nancy Pelosi says Trump committed \u201cbribery\u201d as Democrats change up their language about the impeachment. &gt; Taylor Swift says her former managers are stopping her performing her old hits at this year\u2019s American music awards. Swift is due to receive the artist of the decade award at the AMAs but says she has been told by Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta \u2013 with whom she does not get along \u2013 that doing any of the songs from the time she was contracted to them would amount to re-recording them, which she is not allowed to do until next year. &gt; Researchers have found some people have more reason to doubt their ancestry than others, especially if they are descended from city-dwelling labourers and weavers of the Industrial Revolution. Over the past 500 years, births from extramarital couplings were as low as half a percent for farmers and the rural middle and upper classes \u2013 but reached a peak of nearly 6% among the working classes and the poor in the densely populated cities of the 19th century.

      "body": "<h2>Blue Note Records: Beyond the Notes <br>9.30pm, BBC Four</h2> <p>With jazz in good health, Sophie Huber\u2019s history of the famous label is well-timed. Like the best label bosses, Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff were fans more than businessmen. They didn\u2019t just create a space for the music they loved; they created an aesthetic (Reid Miles\u2019s beautiful sleeve art is still genre-defining) and launched a vehicle for black empowerment in post-second world war America. This documentary is a fine tribute to a label that remains vital to this day. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>BBC Children in Need </strong><br><strong>7.30pm, BBC One</strong></h2> <p>More questionable variety-show hijinks in aid of excellent causes as the annual telethon launches.

Plus, we get some sinful rogering in the woods. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2><strong>Very Ralph </strong><br><strong>9pm, Sky Atlantic</strong></h2> <p>Ralph Lauren\u2019s remarkable trick has been to make his brand seem simultaneously high-end and affordable. This knack is possibly a result of his humble origins in the Bronx, where style often had to be self-generated. This documentary follows the designer as he embarks upon his sixth decade in the business. <em>PH</em></p> <h2><strong>A Lie to Die for </strong><br><strong>9pm, Sky Crime</strong></h2> <p>Sky\u2019s latest US true-crime series focuses on the deceptions that preface murders. First is the case of Lori Soares, killed by her husband in Utah in 2004. His participation in missing-person appeals was merely the latest in a series of proliferating falsehoods, some of which Lori uncovered just before she died. <em>JS</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86fdbe88905eebd87369010beb728b243b7c82f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86fdbe88905eebd87369010beb728b243b7c82f9/0_52_2944_1766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All work and no play ...

      "bodyText": "Blue Note Records: Beyond the Notes 9.30pm, BBC Four With jazz in good health, Sophie Huber\u2019s history of the famous label is well-timed. Like the best label bosses, Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff were fans more than businessmen. They didn\u2019t just create a space for the music they loved; they created an aesthetic (Reid Miles\u2019s beautiful sleeve art is still genre-defining) and launched a vehicle for black empowerment in post-second world war America. This documentary is a fine tribute to a label that remains vital to this day. Phil Harrison BBC Children in Need 7.30pm, BBC One More questionable variety-show hijinks in aid of excellent causes as the annual telethon launches. Graham Norton, Tess Daly, Mel Giedroyc and Ade Adepitan introduce attractions including an EastEnders edition of Strictly, a visit from Doctor Who and a surprise arranged by the England football team. PH Flirty Dancing 8pm, Channel 4 A return series for the dating show that might equally be called I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor. Ashley Banjo pairs up two couples and has them dance together, counting only on physical chemistry to win the day. This week, former ballet dancer Ruby is paired with lovelorn Emmerson to strut their stuff. Ali Catterall The Name of the Rose 9pm, BBC Two The passive-aggressive sniping cranks up as the men of God prepare to debate whether Christ would condone their wealth. There is also a gift for the abbot and fruity Cardinal du Pouget (Rinat Khismatouline, in a role crying out for Matt Berry) arrives. Plus, we get some sinful rogering in the woods. Jack Seale Very Ralph 9pm, Sky Atlantic Ralph Lauren\u2019s remarkable trick has been to make his brand seem simultaneously high-end and affordable. This knack is possibly a result of his humble origins in the Bronx, where style often had to be self-generated. This documentary follows the designer as he embarks upon his sixth decade in the business. PH A Lie to Die for 9pm, Sky Crime Sky\u2019s latest US true-crime series focuses on the deceptions that preface murders. First is the case of Lori Soares, killed by her husband in Utah in 2004. His participation in missing-person appeals was merely the latest in a series of proliferating falsehoods, some of which Lori uncovered just before she died. JS Film choice The Shining 12.30am, Sky Cinema Greats The current dodgy sequel, Doctor Sleep, is a good excuse to revisit Stanley Kubrick\u2019s superbly crafted ghost story. Based on the Stephen King novel, it is set in the snowbound, sepulchral Overlook Hotel, where Jack Nicholson\u2019s writer-turned-caretaker goes slowly mad, terrorising his wife and son.

Core styles such as grime and drill emerged from the capital, as have the vast majority of the most significant British rappers of the past 20 years: Dizzee Rascal, J Hus, Wiley and Kano from the east; AJ Tracey and Fredo from the west; Skepta, JME and Wretch 32 from the north; Stormzy, Dave and Giggs from the south. The Streets\u2019 Mike Skinner may have kept his Brummie accent, but he had already left Birmingham by the time his debut was out.</p> <p>But some of the most successful British rap tracks are now coming from artists around the UK. This summer Birmingham\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tweet_mist?lang=en\" title=\"\">Mist</a> scored his first Top 10 track with So High, following a Top 5 album last year; Northampton rapper Slowthai was nominated for this year\u2019s Mercury prize and is rated as one of the UK\u2019s most exciting live acts; Nottingham\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YoungTandBugsey?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Young T &amp; Bugsey</a> were inescapable as autumn began with Strike a Pose, which spent six weeks in the Top 10. \u201cRap music in the UK is at the absolute top of its game,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00012dh\" title=\"\">Tiffany Calver</a>, host of the 1Xtra Rap Show. \u201cPeople want to hear people that sound like them. But we live in a world where songs are posted every second, so having someone who\u2019s got something different about them, whether that\u2019s how they sound or their rhyming pattern, you\u2019re naturally going to be really interested in it, too.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDuVsE6yGdA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nDuVsE6yGdA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Guesting on Strike a Pose was 19-year-old Mancunian <a href=\"https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/who-is-aitch-get-to-know-the-manchester-rapper-taking-over-the-charts__27066/\" title=\"\">Aitch</a>, who has become the biggest success story of all, reaching No 2 in September with his endearingly lecherous Taste (Make It Shake), and scoring another Top 10 single, Buss Down, a month later. Ed Sheeran was quick to notice the trend \u2013 he employed Aitch and Birmingham rapper Jaykae for a knowingly regional remix of Sheeran and Stormzy\u2019s chart-topping ode to the capital, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQcuKhO5n0\" title=\"\">Take Me Back to London</a>. Aitch scoffs at the city that once ruled British rap. \u201cEveryone from London just supported everyone from London,\u201d he says. \u201cYou think they\u2019re untouchable, but they\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>He, Jay1 and Leicester rapper <a href=\"https://trenchtrenchtrench.com/features/why-i-rate-trillary-banks\" title=\"\">Trillary Banks</a> have come down to London for some overpriced drinks and ruminations on why, in 2019, a regional accent is as essential a rap accessory as a designer man-purse. The first thing to note is that this isn\u2019t a sudden, random occurrence: Jaykae and Mist\u2019s first official releases came in 2016, and before that, Birmingham propped up the grime scene after it had waned in London, as did Leicester. \u201cLeicester has always had sick grime MCs,\u201d Aitch says. \u201cThere always used to be that odd guy going: \u2018Yo, Leicester!\u2019\u201d Trillary Banks was one of them. \u201cIn 2009, 2010, I used to spit out \u2018Leicester City!\u2019 before the track started,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"311b2a3c69f2c03d54cea038fd83015b616e08a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/311b2a3c69f2c03d54cea038fd83015b616e08a7/0_0_4727_7091/667.jpg\" alt=\"Trillary Banks.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trillary Banks: \u2018In 2009, I used to spit out \u2018Leicester City!\u2019 before the track started.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aitch says a rap scene was coming together in Manchester, too \u2013 but shakily. \u201cShifty did a Tim Westwood freestyle in 2009 which got over 600,000 views on YouTube, which is sick for then. A situation happened with him, something which I\u2019m in no position to speak about\u201d \u2013 Shifty was badly injured in a car accident \u2013 \u201cand he stopped doing music. After that there was a big gap \u2013 no one knew what was going on. Everyone was trying their best to blow, but no one was blowing.\u201d</p> <p>One of the only successes was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thebugzymalone\" title=\"\">Bugzy Malone</a>, a pugnacious ambassador for grime with four Top 10 albums dating back to 2015. Aitch also picks out <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iamddb/?hl=en\" title=\"\">IAMDDB</a>. \u201cShe\u2019s got a Manchester wave\u201d \u2013 or energy. \u201cIf you listen to other Manchester music, you\u2019d get it. It\u2019s just a fact that it\u2019s been a musical city, with Oasis, Stone Roses and that, and house. What was that club called, the Ha\u00e7ienda?\u201d</p> <p>Other regional rappers became popular with genre fans and started to cross into the mainstream: Liverpool\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aystar_?lang=en\" title=\"\">Aystar</a>, Nottingham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-kJ94vGgFI\" title=\"\">Splinta</a> and, of course, Birmingham\u2019s Lady Leshurr and her ferociously funny <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyodeHtVvkA\" title=\"\">Queen\u2019s Speech freestyles</a>. As Aitch acknowledges, it\u2019s often the exoticism of their accents that helps them cut through. \u201cI don\u2019t think people from out of London realise how weird we actually sound to Londoners\u2019 ears,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got a funny accent, but everyone else does. That just draws bare attention. A lot of things in London were repetitive \u2013 people were looking for something else.\u201d</p> <p>No other regional artist has achieved the chart successes of the most recent crop, though. Aitch won\u2019t tell me his secret sauce \u2013 \u201cIf I say it now Jay1 might steal it,\u201d he deadpans \u2013 but it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s a combination of factors: the network effects of streaming and YouTube, the growing dominance of rap in pop culture more generally, a desire from national radio to represent the whole of the UK \u2013 and, of course, raw talent and charisma. The casually dextrous Aitch is like a guy whose shameless chat-up lines you can\u2019t help but grin at. Does the fact that he\u2019s white make a difference too? \u201cYou hear it, people saying that I only blew because I\u2019m white. That\u2019s just air.

I rate it.</p> <p>\u201cNone of us would be in a position we are if it wasn\u2019t for our individual cities,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe make such a statement, a footprint. If there wasn\u2019t people like us from these different cities, it would be just London music. And no disrespect to anyone, but people from London are trying to sound like they\u2019re from America, and they\u2019re saying UK music this, UK music that. People from outside of London represent UK music sometimes a bit better than people from London.\u201d Indeed, they are bringing a vibrancy and variety to the charts that wasn\u2019t there even a couple of years ago \u2013 and still getting change from a tenner for a round of drinks.</p> <p><em>Aitch is playing at SWG3, Glasgow on 3 December, then touring</em></p> <h2>Other non-capital assets</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jaykae10?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Jaykae</a><br></strong>After underlining his Brummie credentials with a Peaky Blinders-themed video, Jaykae recently branched from grime-y rap to UK garage with the infectious Chat.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.unityradio.fm/meekz-talks-to-daisy-adams-about-becoming-one-of-the-hottest-rappers-in-manchester-after-only-four-months-on-the-scene/\">Meekz</a><br></strong>In just over a year, Meekz has become one of the most popular rappers in Manchester, wearing drill-like masks, but deploying a deep, bleak, trap-influenced meter.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NafeSmallz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Nafe Smallz</a><br></strong>Luton might be London to budget airlines, but it\u2019s still a long way from the bustling epicentre of British rap.

      "bodyText": "If someone comes to visit London, it\u2019s only ever a matter of minutes before they mention the price of two things: houses and alcoholic beverages. Even if they\u2019re a successful rapper with sell-out tours and Top 20 hits under their belt, they will still be horrified. \u201cLook at the house prices \u2013 it\u2019s way cheaper in Cov,\u201d notes Coventry\u2019s Jay1. \u201cLondon is expensive, man.\u201d He gestures at his passionfruit daiquiri. \u201cIt probably cost \u00a310 for this!\u201d Yep, not far off. The oppressive price of cocktails is one of many reasons why the UK\u2019s rap scene is currently flourishing beyond London. Core styles such as grime and drill emerged from the capital, as have the vast majority of the most significant British rappers of the past 20 years: Dizzee Rascal, J Hus, Wiley and Kano from the east; AJ Tracey and Fredo from the west; Skepta, JME and Wretch 32 from the north; Stormzy, Dave and Giggs from the south. The Streets\u2019 Mike Skinner may have kept his Brummie accent, but he had already left Birmingham by the time his debut was out. But some of the most successful British rap tracks are now coming from artists around the UK. This summer Birmingham\u2019s Mist scored his first Top 10 track with So High, following a Top 5 album last year; Northampton rapper Slowthai was nominated for this year\u2019s Mercury prize and is rated as one of the UK\u2019s most exciting live acts; Nottingham\u2019s Young T &amp; Bugsey were inescapable as autumn began with Strike a Pose, which spent six weeks in the Top 10. \u201cRap music in the UK is at the absolute top of its game,\u201d explains Tiffany Calver, host of the 1Xtra Rap Show. \u201cPeople want to hear people that sound like them. But we live in a world where songs are posted every second, so having someone who\u2019s got something different about them, whether that\u2019s how they sound or their rhyming pattern, you\u2019re naturally going to be really interested in it, too.\u201d Guesting on Strike a Pose was 19-year-old Mancunian Aitch, who has become the biggest success story of all, reaching No 2 in September with his endearingly lecherous Taste (Make It Shake), and scoring another Top 10 single, Buss Down, a month later. Ed Sheeran was quick to notice the trend \u2013 he employed Aitch and Birmingham rapper Jaykae for a knowingly regional remix of Sheeran and Stormzy\u2019s chart-topping ode to the capital, Take Me Back to London. Aitch scoffs at the city that once ruled British rap. \u201cEveryone from London just supported everyone from London,\u201d he says. \u201cYou think they\u2019re untouchable, but they\u2019re not.\u201d He, Jay1 and Leicester rapper Trillary Banks have come down to London for some overpriced drinks and ruminations on why, in 2019, a regional accent is as essential a rap accessory as a designer man-purse. The first thing to note is that this isn\u2019t a sudden, random occurrence: Jaykae and Mist\u2019s first official releases came in 2016, and before that, Birmingham propped up the grime scene after it had waned in London, as did Leicester. \u201cLeicester has always had sick grime MCs,\u201d Aitch says. \u201cThere always used to be that odd guy going: \u2018Yo, Leicester!\u2019\u201d Trillary Banks was one of them. \u201cIn 2009, 2010, I used to spit out \u2018Leicester City!\u2019 before the track started,\u201d she says. Aitch says a rap scene was coming together in Manchester, too \u2013 but shakily. \u201cShifty did a Tim Westwood freestyle in 2009 which got over 600,000 views on YouTube, which is sick for then. A situation happened with him, something which I\u2019m in no position to speak about\u201d \u2013 Shifty was badly injured in a car accident \u2013 \u201cand he stopped doing music. After that there was a big gap \u2013 no one knew what was going on. Everyone was trying their best to blow, but no one was blowing.\u201d One of the only successes was Bugzy Malone, a pugnacious ambassador for grime with four Top 10 albums dating back to 2015. Aitch also picks out IAMDDB. \u201cShe\u2019s got a Manchester wave\u201d \u2013 or energy. \u201cIf you listen to other Manchester music, you\u2019d get it. It\u2019s just a fact that it\u2019s been a musical city, with Oasis, Stone Roses and that, and house. What was that club called, the Ha\u00e7ienda?\u201d Other regional rappers became popular with genre fans and started to cross into the mainstream: Liverpool\u2019s Aystar, Nottingham\u2019s Splinta and, of course, Birmingham\u2019s Lady Leshurr and her ferociously funny Queen\u2019s Speech freestyles. As Aitch acknowledges, it\u2019s often the exoticism of their accents that helps them cut through. \u201cI don\u2019t think people from out of London realise how weird we actually sound to Londoners\u2019 ears,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got a funny accent, but everyone else does. That just draws bare attention. A lot of things in London were repetitive \u2013 people were looking for something else.\u201d No other regional artist has achieved the chart successes of the most recent crop, though. Aitch won\u2019t tell me his secret sauce \u2013 \u201cIf I say it now Jay1 might steal it,\u201d he deadpans \u2013 but it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s a combination of factors: the network effects of streaming and YouTube, the growing dominance of rap in pop culture more generally, a desire from national radio to represent the whole of the UK \u2013 and, of course, raw talent and charisma. The casually dextrous Aitch is like a guy whose shameless chat-up lines you can\u2019t help but grin at. Does the fact that he\u2019s white make a difference too? \u201cYou hear it, people saying that I only blew because I\u2019m white. That\u2019s just air. There are white MCs about, but they ain\u2019t as big as me. So if I only blew because I\u2019m white, where\u2019s all the others? I\u2019m stood here on my own.\u201d As regional rap scenes matured, Coventry remained a wilderness. \u201cWhat can you lot honestly say about Cov?\u201d Jay1 asks the others. \u201cJay1,\u201d Aitch replies. \u201cJay1 officially put Cov on the map: mad official.\u201d \u201cYeah, literally,\u201d says Trillary. \u201cThere was a crew called COV, time ago, but they\u2019re older, they\u2019re probably in their mid-30s now. I never really knew a lot about Coventry \u2013 even the carnival, I went there and was like, where are all the people?\u201d Jay1 has released two of the best British rap tracks this year: Mocking It, a magnificently stripped-back showcase of pinpoint lyrical skill, and the uproarious infidelity taunt of Your Mrs \u2013 a phrase that is only ever uttered from the Midlands northwards. \u201cYour missus!\u201d Trillary claps with delight. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m goin\u2019t town with the missus.\u2019 In London, it would be: \u2018I\u2019m out with my gyal.\u2019\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve picked up from living there,\u201d says Jay1, who moved to Coventry from north London with his parents seven years ago \u2013 thanks, he says, to those cheap house prices. \u201cWhen I started doing music, I thought: there\u2019s no point me trying to rep London any more. I\u2019m just here now, and so I might as well rep Cov. It\u2019s a leap of faith: I rep these ends with my chest, and I\u2019m not embarrassed at all.\u201d Without the network of record labels and rap video platforms such as GRM Daily and LinkUpTV in London, he was forced to go it alone, and released his first freestyle on his YouTube channel. Word of mouth in rap-starved Coventry was swift, \u201cand it went off, it had 50k [views] in a month. That was all locals, banging it out. There\u2019s a lot of [Coventry] youts out there that also want to start doing it now.

There\u2019s a line from Jay1\u2019s Your Mrs about a Mancunian girl called Becky, and he slips into a Manc accent when delivering it: \u201cBad B from Manny brought Beckeh / spent one week in the 0161 ...\u201d Trillary finishes the line: \u201cNow I call Cov girls sexeh!\u201d \u201cI pronounce it Beckeh, not Beckee, because of Aitch,\u201d Jay1 says. \u201cYou give that swag to that name!\u201d Aitch says he in turn gets influenced by the Midlands accent. \u201cI go check Jaykae, I come back and I start chatting like I\u2019m from Brum. Everyone influences everyone. We\u2019re a little gang, everyone not from London. I rate it. \u201cNone of us would be in a position we are if it wasn\u2019t for our individual cities,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe make such a statement, a footprint. If there wasn\u2019t people like us from these different cities, it would be just London music. And no disrespect to anyone, but people from London are trying to sound like they\u2019re from America, and they\u2019re saying UK music this, UK music that. People from outside of London represent UK music sometimes a bit better than people from London.\u201d Indeed, they are bringing a vibrancy and variety to the charts that wasn\u2019t there even a couple of years ago \u2013 and still getting change from a tenner for a round of drinks. Aitch is playing at SWG3, Glasgow on 3 December, then touring Other non-capital assets Jaykae After underlining his Brummie credentials with a Peaky Blinders-themed video, Jaykae recently branched from grime-y rap to UK garage with the infectious Chat. Meekz In just over a year, Meekz has become one of the most popular rappers in Manchester, wearing drill-like masks, but deploying a deep, bleak, trap-influenced meter. Nafe Smallz Luton might be London to budget airlines, but it\u2019s still a long way from the bustling epicentre of British rap. Nafe Smallz has nevertheless transcended his smalltown background with a sing-song, US-indebted flow. Lotto Boyzz This Brummie duo have an almost boyband vibe with their Haribo-sweet choruses, and recently played to a rapturous arena of thousands in their hometown for BBC 1Xtra Live. Coco A brilliant club MC who can tackle grime, speed garage and more, Coco\u2019s Sheffield accent is stronger than a shot of Henderson\u2019s Relish. Tunde Getting notice for a kitchen-sink freestyle over Rose Royce\u2019s Wishing On a Star, Chorlton\u2019s Tunde is another rapper bringing stark tales from the 0161 area code. Zeph A&amp;Rs on the lookout for the next Aitch will have had their ears pricked up by Zeph, a heavily accented Manny rapper rolling boastful freestyles out over minimal, sensual trap. Deep Green First getting notice back in 2012 for a blockbusting flow over the Adele-sampling Hometown riddim, this deep-voiced Sheffield MC embraced a seriously blinged-out aesthetic for 2019 mini-hit Quavo.",

      "body": "<p>Few chance encounters have had a greater political impact than Gordon Brown\u2019s fateful meeting with Gillian Duffy on an April morning in Rochdale in 2010. When the then prime minister was caught on a hot mic calling the Labour-voting pensioner a \u201cbigoted woman\u201d \u2013 after she cornered him with complaints about immigrants \u201cflocking\u201d into Britain \u2013 it did not just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-bigotgate-marina-hyde\" title=\"\">sink his floundering campaign</a>. It set the tone for the way immigration would become the most toxic issue in British politics for the decade to come.</p> <p>When New Labour came to power in 1997, just 3% of the public cited immigration as a key issue. By the time of the EU referendum in 2016, that figure was 48%. During those intervening years, the issue came to dominate and distort British politics \u2013 exactly according to the script established by Bigotgate. Brown\u2019s gaffe both consolidated and gave credence to a political coding that would shape everything that came after: the \u201chostile environment\u201d, the Windrush scandal, the EU referendum and the revival of Britain\u2019s far right \u2013 deploying a narrative in which sneering, out-of-touch, big-city politicians who favour foreigners and open borders are hopelessly oblivious to the struggles and the so-called \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d of ordinary working people (who, in this scenario, are always white).</p> <p>The Labour movement still bears the battlescars of Bigotgate, as divisions over immigration cut across party factions. With the Labour party about to release its election manifesto, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/mccluskey-tells-corbyn-defy-calls-extend-freedom-of-movement\" title=\"\">an outburst against free movement</a> of migrants from the leader of Unite the Union, the party\u2019s biggest affiliate, threatens to thwart efforts to move to a more progressive position on the issue.</p> <p>By the time Brown took his ill-fated walkabout in 2010, immigration was already polling as a top concern, overtaking the NHS and only topped by the economy for a few years following the 2008 crash. By then, politicians and the media had shaped a venomous narrative around the volume of new arrivals to the UK, the identity of those coming and why they did so.</p> <p>For more than 30 years, the UK has been at the forefront of a neoliberal economic globalisation that deregulated markets and pared back the state \u2013 deepening the global economic inequalities that produce labour immigration. In the UK, local manufacturing-based economies that supported entire communities were shut down or shipped out. Across the global south, structural adjustment programmes imposed by the west as loan conditions were collapsing national economies. But these harsh economic realities did not appear in our media\u2019s fearmongering accounts of a \u201ctide\u201d of migrants \u201cflooding\u201d into soft-touch Britain on supposedly spurious grounds and overwhelming the country.</p> <p>Just as communities were exposed to the shocks of an unrestrained free market and a shrinking state, they were simultaneously bombarded with stories about \u201cSlovak spongers\u201d and cheating Czechs. Politicians of all stripes fell in line, producing hostile rhetoric and policies in response \u2013 and defining the issue as a reflection of supposed concerns over the exact number of arrivals, the \u201cpace of change\u201d in local communities and the need to exert control over migration. This was the catalyst for David Cameron\u2019s foolish 2010 election pledge to introduce a target figure for \u201cnet migration\u201d \u2013 which the Conservative party failed to meet, again and again, only enflaming public resentment and mistrust over the issue (this impossible target underpinned the Conservative\u2019s hostile environment policy and produced the Windrush scandal).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7cd9236976442770661f2dc2267793c7124026ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cd9236976442770661f2dc2267793c7124026ef/0_0_3000_1944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bigotgate: Gordon Brown talking with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bigotgate: Gordon Brown talking with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the run-up to the EU referendum, called by Cameron to block the popularity of Ukip and silence Tory Eurosceptics, the leave campaign repeated the idea that it was Labour\u2019s policy to increase immigration that had made it a burning issue in British politics. More specifically, the blame was focused on a commitment made in 2004 by Tony Blair as prime minister. In a 2015 BBC documentary called The Truth About Immigration, the presenter Nick Robinson talked of immigration in the UK as an issue that \u201cadds up to an awful lot of change and that\u2019s led to an awful lot of anxiety\u201d. He identified the source of all this worry: \u201cA single decision taken without much thought in Downing Street, to allow immigration from new members of the EU from eastern Europe.\u201d That decision by the Labour government would, Robinson said, likely be debated by historians in 50 years\u2019 time as the \u201cmost significant taken since the second world war\u201d.</p> <p>According to this analysis \u2013 which was widespread across the media \u2013 what created the problem was the arrival of immigrants in larger numbers, not the way immigration was depicted, described, debated or demonised.</p> <p>But what if this narrative is the wrong way around? Perhaps it wasn\u2019t immigration itself that was such a defining issue of those 20 years \u2013 but rather, the way political parties and journalists discussed it and the policies implemented in response. The big assumption is that it was a foregone conclusion that there would be hostility to immigration, which in turn would become politically explosive in the UK. While Britain has always received migrants with initial suspicion, it was not inevitable that the issue would become so damaging or derail our politics so comprehensively.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By the 1990s, conflict across the world began to drive migration. Responding to the earliest of the 1980s arrivals, parts of the British media labelled Tamils fleeing Sri Lanka as \u201cbogus\u201d asylum seekers. This term was adopted by politicians to cast suspicion on asylum seekers and focus anxiety about immigration on fair play and the abuse of British generosity.</p> <p>During this period, Conservative and Labour ministers presented their asylum policies in this fashion, premised on preserving the integrity of the system. The Conservatives in power during the early 90s ramped up rhetoric against \u201cfloods\u201d of asylum seekers, even though Germany then had the highest numbers of asylum seekers in Europe. Tory legislation sought to hasten the \u201crapid rejection of a large number of unfounded claims\u201d, which would \u201cplay a major part in deterring further abuse of the process\u201d, in the words of Kenneth Baker, the Conservative home secretary between 1990 and 1992.</p> <p>By the time Labour came to power in 1997, newspapers were routinely scaremongering about the new arrivals: that year the Daily Mail ran a story about a \u201cflood of bogus asylum-seekers swamping Dover\u201d while the Independent warned: \u201cGypsies invade Dover hoping for a handout.\u201d The actual numbers were tiny. <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/images/media/files/publication/2011/05/asylum_factfile_feb05_1344.pdf\" title=\"\">There were</a> 32,500 overall asylum claims in 1997, with 81% refused asylum. In the decade to 2000, the UK accepted 1.9% of asylum claims from Sri Lanka; in France that figure was 73.6%.</p> <p>The Labour government scrapped the rules barring spouses of British citizens from joining them in the UK and removed restrictions discriminating against homosexual and other long-term relationships. But things did not continue in this hopeful vein. The 1999 Asylum Act formalised the use of detention centres as a routine administrative measure rather than an exception, and also replaced cash benefits for asylum seekers with vouchers, since cash benefits were, in the words of Labour\u2019s home secretary Jack Straw, \u201ca major pull factor that encourage fraudulent claims\u201d. </p> <p>At the same time, the asylum dispersal system sent claimants, without a choice, into deprived parts of the country. This created the perception of a burden to be shared, while cutting newcomers off from legal and translation services. As resentment grew, asylum seekers faced harassment and physical attacks in areas where the media and politicians whipped up fury at their arrival. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a253018c518a3d8628f9e0f9a7cbc8dc0151d2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a253018c518a3d8628f9e0f9a7cbc8dc0151d2e/56_0_1613_968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Straw (right) in 2000, then the home secretary, watches as a stowaway is helped down from a lorry at Dover docks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Straw (right) in 2000, then the home secretary, watches as a stowaway is helped down from a lorry at Dover docks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Dempsey/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 2002, asylum claims \u2013 most of which were coming from Iraq at that time \u2013 had peaked at just over 80,000 (it has not gone higher since), although Britain did not rank in the top 10 receiving countries in Europe in the number of claims per population. Still, Tony Blair pledged to halve the number of asylum seekers in the UK by September that year. Labour\u2019s commitment to such reductions indicated they were prepared to believe that at least half of all claims were not valid. In 1998, at the height of media hysteria against Roma arrivals, Straw <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/victory-for-the-gypsy-family-that-britain-branded-as-scroungers-1158726.html\" title=\"\">had claimed</a> that not one of their asylum cases had been recognised as genuine. In 2001, the Home Office had sent immigration officers to Prague\u2019s Ruzyne airport to discourage mostly Roma asylum claimants from boarding planes to Britain. Three years later, the law lords ruled that this practice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/10/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices\" title=\"\">amounted to</a> \u201cinherent and systematic\u201d racism.</p> <p>In 2001, then home secretary David Blunkett wanted to force asylum claimants to carry ID cards. A year later, Labour proposed the children of asylum seekers should be taught separately, saying they were \u201cswamping\u201d classrooms. Both plans faced massive opposition and were dropped. The 2002 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act limited access to legal aid and removed benefits from those claiming asylum later than three days after arrival. The act also removed the right to work while awaiting a claim \u2013 employment was considered another \u201cpull\u201d factor. And the 2004 Asylum and Immigration Act removed benefits from families whose asylum cases had been rejected: trying to \u201cstarve them out\u201d as the Labour MP David Winnick <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmhaff/uc692-ix/uc69202.htm\" title=\"\">protested</a> at the time.</p> <p>The Labour leadership held that, if the system could be shown to be fair, hostility to asylum seekers would diminish. Barbara Roche, Labour minister for immigration for two years until 2001, stands by this formulation: \u201cIf you aren\u2019t rigorous about keeping asylum as what it\u2019s for, you lose the concept,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel passionately about protecting it. So yes, there were some things that were made tougher.\u201d</p> <p>The trouble is that foregrounding \u201cfairness\u201d fuels public assumptions that immigration is somehow unfair or deceitful. Immigration lawyers describe a system premised on disbelief and a tendency to view migrants from wealthy white nations more favourably. As former barrister Frances Webber chronicles in her book, Borderline Justice, asylum seekers during that period were routinely assumed to be lying. In 2000, one asylum seeker was sent a letter from the Home Office stating: \u201cThe secretary of state believes your claim to be a pile of pants.\u201d</p> <p>Advisers of the time insist Labour had no need to make policy to placate tabloid readers. One top strategist for Blair says: \u201cA government with a 150 seat majority is making the weather.\u201d But a Home Office special adviser from that time says half of each day\u2019s media cuttings were about asylum seekers. \u201cThere would be pictures of people trying to get on to lorries and trains and cutting fences \u2026 it was incredibly intense, you were under constant scrutiny, always in court, always assailed by forces from all sides.\u201d None of that, he notes, made for an environment conducive to rational policy-making.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By this stage, little about the conversation on immigration was rational. In 2003, the Sun ran a front page fake news story under the headline Swan Bake, in which it claimed eastern Europeans were barbecuing swans pulled out of an east London park (following complaints, the paper did not apologise, even though there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/dec/10/sun.pressandpublishing\" title=\"\">no evidence</a> to support this assertion). In a 31-day period in 2003, the Daily Express ran 22 front page stories on the subject.</p> <p>In both policy focus and language used, Labour had added to this mounting impression of migrants and refugees as \u201csneaking into the UK\u201d, \u201ccheating\u201d the system and \u201cliving off benefits\u201d. Advisers of the time acknowledge that a negative view of asylum was seeping more widely into hostility to all migrants. The hope, according to one home office adviser, was that \u201cif people saw we were dealing with abuse but also improving the channels for legal migration, we could get public trust back\u201d.</p> <p>But this is not how public sentiment works. \u201cAs we found out after 2004, that wasn\u2019t the case \u2013 they simply moved on to Eastern Europeans [arrivals from new EU member states] as a focus of concern,\u201d the adviser said. Charting the rising number of race-hate attacks around that time in cities from Stoke to Plymouth and Peterborough, <a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/news/the-new-geographies-of-racism-peterborough/\">IRR reports in 2012</a> show that migrants who were not asylum seekers, as well as black and ethnic minority British people, often faced hostilities exacerbated by asylum dispersal, tough political rhetoric and media scaremongering. </p> <p>By 2004, 26% of the population saw the number of immigrants and asylum seekers coming into the country as the <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/today_uk_import/YG-Archives-pol-dTel-GenPolIssues-041217.pdf\" title=\"\">third most important</a> voting issue, after public services and law and order. That same year, with cross-party support, Labour opened the borders to migrants from eastern Europe\u2019s A8 countries: the Czech republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. To this day, this is cast as a supposed mistake, with former and current Labour MPs lining up to apologise for it. In 2012, Labour leader Ed Miliband said immigration was \u201cone of the areas we got wrong\u201d and spoke of \u201clocal talent\u201d being \u201clocked out of opportunity\u201d. And in 2013, Straw, the former home secretary, described it as a \u201cspectacular mistake\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ahead of the A8 accession, a government report predicted that up to 13,000 additional migrants would arrive annually from those states. It was way off: in 2005, 129,000 migrants from the A8 entered the UK. </p> <p>It was later painted as a crisis, but in truth, the British economy needed even those unexpected numbers. David Blunkett tried at the time to explain that migrants would in any case be coming to Britain in high numbers and it was better to have them in the labour market legally, paying tax. Study after study has showed that EU migration, in particular from A8 countries, produced a net economic gain for the UK. <a href=\"http://ftp.iza.org/dp3695.pdf\" title=\"\">According to one</a> authored by economists Helen Lawton and Danny Blanchflower in 2008: \u201cThe fact that the UK opened its borders to a flow of highly skilled, motivated, educated, low cost mobile workers upon EU-enlargement was a stroke of genius, for which the UK government should be given credit.\u201d </p> <p>Although the economy was booming through the 90s and early 00s, it was finance- and debt-fuelled and not equally enjoyed across the population. The social geographer Danny Dorling has dubbed Blair \u201cthe king of inequality\u201d, observing that Labour from 1997 to 2010 presided over a period during which inequalities in income, health and wealth actually rose. </p> <p>Don Flynn, the former director of the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, says: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that a group of politicians had taken their eye off the ball and immigrants had come through. It was that the immigration was the product of the type of economy created after the 1980s, with 80% of people working in a service industry of one sort or another, where the fastest areas of economic growth were London and the south-east, where a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week economy needed flexible workers doing antisocial hours in precarious, zero-hours, relatively low-paid jobs. And natives were going to do their level best to avoid those.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>While Labour in 2004 had underestimated the number of arrivals from new EU member states, the tabloids wildly overestimated those figures. On the eve of accession, columnists in the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph respectively predicted that 4 million and 4.4 million migrants would come to Britain. Channeling this alarmism, the Conservatives under Michael Howard (the son of a Jewish refugee from Romania) ran campaign billboards during the 2005 proclaiming: \u201cIt\u2019s not racist to impose limits on immigration \u2026 Are you thinking what we\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p> <p>As new arrivals settled outside of big cities, tensions over asylum dispersal and scaremongering over jobs and resources boiled over into racially motivated attacks. By 2006, some of the country\u2019s most neglected areas were targeted by the British National party, which made gains in that year\u2019s local elections.</p> <p>At the same time, the idea that multiculturalism had failed \u2013 which had been percolating on the far-right \u2013 now spilled into the mainstream. The suggestion was that the left\u2019s supposed promotion of diversity had failed to foster integration and disadvantaged the white working class. It set the tone for the BBC\u2019s White Season, a documentary series that came out in 2008 and asked: \u201cIs white working class Britain becoming invisible?\u201d Trevor Phillips, then head of the equalities and human rights commission, echoed this sentiment when he said that the white working-class would need help in the economic recession, noting: \u201cThe colour of disadvantage isn\u2019t black or brown. It is white.\u201d By this reckoning \u201cwhite working-class\u201d was a minority, or protected group, that had hitherto been overlooked.</p> <p>Describing loss and disadvantage in these cultural terms gave rightwing attackers a way to claim multiculturalism in itself licensed an indifference to rising immigration and a clampdown on discussion of the subject. It all dovetailed into the accusation that Labour had abandoned its working-class heartlands.</p> <p>Labour politicians were also feeding this debate, concurring that they had not listened to \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d over migration. Earlier in 2009, MPs had claimed that the \u201cpace of change\u201d was too fast, or that, in the words of the home secretary at the time, Jacqui Smith, the \u201ccultural and emotional impact\u201d had not been properly understood. That same year, the immigration minister Phil Woolas said there was a need to find jobs for the \u201cindigenous population\u201d. Communities secretary Hazel Blears said: \u201cWhite working-class people living on estates sometimes just don\u2019t feel anyone is listening or speaking up for them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e93bde216bfdf5afb1541fd4d240e8c22ae7b0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e93bde216bfdf5afb1541fd4d240e8c22ae7b0f/385_0_3047_1829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite the Union (centre) and delegates at the Labour party conference in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite the Union (centre) and delegates at the Labour party conference in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In January that year, a government report found that the white working-class felt ignored over immigration. Those in deprived areas, without much direct experience of immigration, felt \u201ca real and perceived sense of unfairness\u201d over the issue, coupled with a reluctance to speak out for fear of being branded as racist. Looking back now, it is striking that this report gives equal footing to \u201creal\u201d and \u201cperceived\u201d concerns \u2013 the idea that a sense of unfairness, not borne out by fact and misattributed to migrants, should be politically heeded. Four years after the Conservatives were criticised for using it on election campaign billboards, Gordon Brown said in a speech in November 2009 that it was \u201cnot racist\u201d to talk about immigration.</p> <p>Blue Labour \u2013 a faction positing that the party\u2019s social and economic liberalism had led to a drop in working-class support and pushing social conservatism as the solution \u2013 emerged in 2009. A substantial number of the 4m votes Labour lost between 1997 and 2005 were from its working-class base. But some factions in the party explored other elements, such as economic alienation and New Labour\u2019s disconnected, managerial style of politics. Diane Abbott says: \u201cWe moved post-Thatcher to this post-industrial society and [New Labour] really didn\u2019t have a strategy to deal with it,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were being affected economically, seeing their lives and communities shattered \u2026 and we didn\u2019t help, we didn\u2019t have an alternative.\u201d</p> <p>Labour lost the 2010 election and saw the Conservatives and Lib Dems form a coalition government. In opposition, Brown was not allowed to forget \u201cBigotgate\u201d, and Labour was hounded by the accusation that it had shut down a conversation about immigration \u2013 even while the subject was self-evidently dominating politics. This charge was coming not just from the Conservatives, but also from inside the party. Standing as candidate for party leadership in 2010, Andy Burnham claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s still an ambivalence among some in Labour about discussing immigration.\u201d Both these themes dominated the 2015 election. One adviser to Ed Miliband, Brown\u2019s successor as Labour leader, recalls the overwhelming media narrative of Labour as a party that \u201ccrashed the economy, opened the floodgates to immigration, was led by someone who looked nerdy and stabbed his brother in the back\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe spent five years being shit-scared,\u201d says one of Miliband\u2019s key advisers. \u201cIf we had the time again, I would force Ed to do a speech on the fallacy of blaming immigration for the reality of austerity cuts.\u201d Instead, Labour produced nebulous pledges over a caring NHS and higher wages for working families. One of those \u2013 \u201cControls on immigration\u201d \u2013 ended up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/29/diane-abbott-labour-immigration-controls-mugs-shameful\" title=\"\">a party promotional mug</a>, a dismal sign of a rightward shift in slogan form.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In March this year, an Ipsos Mori poll showed the public was more positive than negative over the impact of immigration on Britain. One in five said they had become less negative on the subject. When asked why, 51% said it was because discussions in the past few years had highlighted how much migrants contribute to the UK. This is an encouraging shift for those who have long argued that, had the left in British politics articulated a robust defence of immigration, this could have detoxified the public narrative.</p> <p>Records of parliamentary debates show objections \u2013 roundly ignored \u2013 to New Labour\u2019s hostile and punitive immigration policies dating back to when it took office in 1997, often raised by then backbenchers Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn. Bill Morris, then secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union (the precursor to Unite), spearheaded a campaign against asylum vouchers, which led to them being scrapped in 2001, albeit to resurface in 2006. And in 2003, a Trade Union Congress report argued that the \u201cblurring by media and governments of the distinction between refused asylum seekers, illegal working, illegal entry and criminal activity such as trafficking\u201d was feeding a general suspicion around all migrants.</p> <p>In the early years of Blair\u2019s government, it was riding high on a historic victory, while the prime minister enjoyed extraordinary popularity, support from the Sun and the Daily Mail. Abbott, among others, views this period as a missed opportunity to reset the terms of the debate. \u201cTony Blair could have used his considerable persuasion in middle England to make a different case about the role of immigration and what causes asylum seekers,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was in a very good position to change the conversation.\u201d</p> <p>But New Labour did not want to go against public sentiment. \u201cThere was a sense of real public hostility,\u201d recalls a special adviser to the Home Office at the time. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t just turn around and say to people: \u2018Your hostility is misplaced and wrong.\u2019\u201d This exact same instinct is raised by one of Miliband\u2019s advisers from 2010 to 2015: \u201cYou can\u2019t have your first sentence [to the public] being \u2018You\u2019re wrong about the thing that you\u2019re thinking, the thing that you\u2019re worried about.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Political scientists Anthony Geddes and Jonathan Tonge have written of a \u201cratcheting effect\u201d whereby tough words and policy on immigration gives it more salience, creating, in turn, a public hunger for tougher words and policy. As Abbott puts it: \u201cIf the Labour party is banging on about immigration, our people feel legitimised in banging on about immigration. If we turn their attention to other things, they stop feeling as though it is the most terrible thing affecting their lives.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9444ba0bd11c0811036200d33adb6c4d65ec8142\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9444ba0bd11c0811036200d33adb6c4d65ec8142/507_106_4732_2839/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn Labour leader\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Labour under Corbyn has changed the debate on austerity, wealth redistribution and renationalisation ... but has hardly rushed to steer a similar shift on immigration.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That politicians and tabloids are no longer \u201cbanging on\u201d about immigration \u2013 certainly not at the fever pitch of the years prior to the EU referendum \u2013 may partly explain why immigration has dropped in prominence as a public concern: it now ranks just below the environment as the sixth biggest issue of the December general election. Brexit, which tops this same YouGov poll from last week, may for some be acting as a proxy for immigration. But perhaps the Windrush scandal has also had an impact, as well as staff shortages across health and social care, hospitality and farming. Labour\u2019s own internal polling shows little public disagreement with the statement that: \u201cPoliticians blame immigrants or people on benefits to distract from their own failures.\u201d</p> <p>While Labour under Corbyn has changed the frame of debate on austerity, wealth redistribution and renationalisation, it has hardly rushed to steer a similar shift on immigration. A rare window to do so opened amid the public outrage over the Windrush scandal, where a generation of British citizens were caught in the government\u2019s hostile environment dragnet, resulting in deportations and denied access to housing and healthcare. Amid a discussion that was unusually sympathetic, Labour MPs often ending up reinforcing stereotypes over \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants \u2013 cementing the idea of a system that had failed to filter properly, rather than widening the frame to explore how an entire process was premised on suspicion and prejudice.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the leadership\u2019s strong credentials on immigration \u2013 earned over decades of showing up to support various cases and causes \u2013 has been dented by Labour\u2019s pledge to end free movement. Grassroots dismay over this went beyond the need to defend an important principle, as the party was seen as closing off terrain that should have been used to make the pro-migration arguments that had been so lacking during the New Labour years. Triangulating over Brexit, the party has shown it is streaked with the same political reluctance over immigration that has long plagued Labour. Even elements that support the Corbyn project have misdirected a need to represent the working class into language that fuels populist-right frames of hostility to immigration. That much was clear in the recent intervention by the Unite leader, Len McCluskey, urging the party not to back free movement. This in turn prompted an exasperated backlash from campaigners and senior Labour figures alike, with one noting that McCluskey was \u201cpart of a backward-looking, small-c conservative nostalgia-tripping wing of the labour movement that wants \u2018trade union rights for British workers\u2019\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/01/dizzying-maze-uk-immigration-system-hostile-environment\">'A dizzying maze': how the UK immigration system is geared to reject</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the party prepares to launch its manifesto, campaigners are watching to see whether the immigration motion passed at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Brighton in September, including a commitment to freedom of movement, will be honoured.

Last week, Corbyn said that free movement \u201cenriches the lives of all of us\u201d, crucially shifting into language that goes beyond economic contribution. \u201cI want to make sure all those European Union nationals do remain here, can come here, will stay here and we will be happy to work with them as indeed many British people have made their homes in other parts of Europe,\u201d he said.

But the party\u2019s own history on immigration suggests that it may take time to embed significant changes in rhetoric and policy. Even with a leadership that is theoretically supportive, there are likely to be wobbles along the way. </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

When the then prime minister was caught on a hot mic calling the Labour-voting pensioner a \u201cbigoted woman\u201d \u2013 after she cornered him with complaints about immigrants \u201cflocking\u201d into Britain \u2013 it did not just sink his floundering campaign. It set the tone for the way immigration would become the most toxic issue in British politics for the decade to come. When New Labour came to power in 1997, just 3% of the public cited immigration as a key issue. By the time of the EU referendum in 2016, that figure was 48%. During those intervening years, the issue came to dominate and distort British politics \u2013 exactly according to the script established by Bigotgate. Brown\u2019s gaffe both consolidated and gave credence to a political coding that would shape everything that came after: the \u201chostile environment\u201d, the Windrush scandal, the EU referendum and the revival of Britain\u2019s far right \u2013 deploying a narrative in which sneering, out-of-touch, big-city politicians who favour foreigners and open borders are hopelessly oblivious to the struggles and the so-called \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d of ordinary working people (who, in this scenario, are always white). The Labour movement still bears the battlescars of Bigotgate, as divisions over immigration cut across party factions. With the Labour party about to release its election manifesto, an outburst against free movement of migrants from the leader of Unite the Union, the party\u2019s biggest affiliate, threatens to thwart efforts to move to a more progressive position on the issue. By the time Brown took his ill-fated walkabout in 2010, immigration was already polling as a top concern, overtaking the NHS and only topped by the economy for a few years following the 2008 crash. By then, politicians and the media had shaped a venomous narrative around the volume of new arrivals to the UK, the identity of those coming and why they did so. For more than 30 years, the UK has been at the forefront of a neoliberal economic globalisation that deregulated markets and pared back the state \u2013 deepening the global economic inequalities that produce labour immigration. In the UK, local manufacturing-based economies that supported entire communities were shut down or shipped out. Across the global south, structural adjustment programmes imposed by the west as loan conditions were collapsing national economies. But these harsh economic realities did not appear in our media\u2019s fearmongering accounts of a \u201ctide\u201d of migrants \u201cflooding\u201d into soft-touch Britain on supposedly spurious grounds and overwhelming the country. Just as communities were exposed to the shocks of an unrestrained free market and a shrinking state, they were simultaneously bombarded with stories about \u201cSlovak spongers\u201d and cheating Czechs. Politicians of all stripes fell in line, producing hostile rhetoric and policies in response \u2013 and defining the issue as a reflection of supposed concerns over the exact number of arrivals, the \u201cpace of change\u201d in local communities and the need to exert control over migration. This was the catalyst for David Cameron\u2019s foolish 2010 election pledge to introduce a target figure for \u201cnet migration\u201d \u2013 which the Conservative party failed to meet, again and again, only enflaming public resentment and mistrust over the issue (this impossible target underpinned the Conservative\u2019s hostile environment policy and produced the Windrush scandal). In the run-up to the EU referendum, called by Cameron to block the popularity of Ukip and silence Tory Eurosceptics, the leave campaign repeated the idea that it was Labour\u2019s policy to increase immigration that had made it a burning issue in British politics. More specifically, the blame was focused on a commitment made in 2004 by Tony Blair as prime minister. In a 2015 BBC documentary called The Truth About Immigration, the presenter Nick Robinson talked of immigration in the UK as an issue that \u201cadds up to an awful lot of change and that\u2019s led to an awful lot of anxiety\u201d. He identified the source of all this worry: \u201cA single decision taken without much thought in Downing Street, to allow immigration from new members of the EU from eastern Europe.\u201d That decision by the Labour government would, Robinson said, likely be debated by historians in 50 years\u2019 time as the \u201cmost significant taken since the second world war\u201d. According to this analysis \u2013 which was widespread across the media \u2013 what created the problem was the arrival of immigrants in larger numbers, not the way immigration was depicted, described, debated or demonised. But what if this narrative is the wrong way around? Perhaps it wasn\u2019t immigration itself that was such a defining issue of those 20 years \u2013 but rather, the way political parties and journalists discussed it and the policies implemented in response. The big assumption is that it was a foregone conclusion that there would be hostility to immigration, which in turn would become politically explosive in the UK. While Britain has always received migrants with initial suspicion, it was not inevitable that the issue would become so damaging or derail our politics so comprehensively. * * * By the 1990s, conflict across the world began to drive migration. Responding to the earliest of the 1980s arrivals, parts of the British media labelled Tamils fleeing Sri Lanka as \u201cbogus\u201d asylum seekers. This term was adopted by politicians to cast suspicion on asylum seekers and focus anxiety about immigration on fair play and the abuse of British generosity. During this period, Conservative and Labour ministers presented their asylum policies in this fashion, premised on preserving the integrity of the system. The Conservatives in power during the early 90s ramped up rhetoric against \u201cfloods\u201d of asylum seekers, even though Germany then had the highest numbers of asylum seekers in Europe. Tory legislation sought to hasten the \u201crapid rejection of a large number of unfounded claims\u201d, which would \u201cplay a major part in deterring further abuse of the process\u201d, in the words of Kenneth Baker, the Conservative home secretary between 1990 and 1992. By the time Labour came to power in 1997, newspapers were routinely scaremongering about the new arrivals: that year the Daily Mail ran a story about a \u201cflood of bogus asylum-seekers swamping Dover\u201d while the Independent warned: \u201cGypsies invade Dover hoping for a handout.\u201d The actual numbers were tiny. There were 32,500 overall asylum claims in 1997, with 81% refused asylum. In the decade to 2000, the UK accepted 1.9% of asylum claims from Sri Lanka; in France that figure was 73.6%. The Labour government scrapped the rules barring spouses of British citizens from joining them in the UK and removed restrictions discriminating against homosexual and other long-term relationships. But things did not continue in this hopeful vein. The 1999 Asylum Act formalised the use of detention centres as a routine administrative measure rather than an exception, and also replaced cash benefits for asylum seekers with vouchers, since cash benefits were, in the words of Labour\u2019s home secretary Jack Straw, \u201ca major pull factor that encourage fraudulent claims\u201d. At the same time, the asylum dispersal system sent claimants, without a choice, into deprived parts of the country. This created the perception of a burden to be shared, while cutting newcomers off from legal and translation services. As resentment grew, asylum seekers faced harassment and physical attacks in areas where the media and politicians whipped up fury at their arrival. By 2002, asylum claims \u2013 most of which were coming from Iraq at that time \u2013 had peaked at just over 80,000 (it has not gone higher since), although Britain did not rank in the top 10 receiving countries in Europe in the number of claims per population. Still, Tony Blair pledged to halve the number of asylum seekers in the UK by September that year. Labour\u2019s commitment to such reductions indicated they were prepared to believe that at least half of all claims were not valid. In 1998, at the height of media hysteria against Roma arrivals, Straw had claimed that not one of their asylum cases had been recognised as genuine. In 2001, the Home Office had sent immigration officers to Prague\u2019s Ruzyne airport to discourage mostly Roma asylum claimants from boarding planes to Britain. Three years later, the law lords ruled that this practice amounted to \u201cinherent and systematic\u201d racism. In 2001, then home secretary David Blunkett wanted to force asylum claimants to carry ID cards. A year later, Labour proposed the children of asylum seekers should be taught separately, saying they were \u201cswamping\u201d classrooms. Both plans faced massive opposition and were dropped. The 2002 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act limited access to legal aid and removed benefits from those claiming asylum later than three days after arrival. The act also removed the right to work while awaiting a claim \u2013 employment was considered another \u201cpull\u201d factor. And the 2004 Asylum and Immigration Act removed benefits from families whose asylum cases had been rejected: trying to \u201cstarve them out\u201d as the Labour MP David Winnick protested at the time. The Labour leadership held that, if the system could be shown to be fair, hostility to asylum seekers would diminish. Barbara Roche, Labour minister for immigration for two years until 2001, stands by this formulation: \u201cIf you aren\u2019t rigorous about keeping asylum as what it\u2019s for, you lose the concept,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel passionately about protecting it. So yes, there were some things that were made tougher.\u201d The trouble is that foregrounding \u201cfairness\u201d fuels public assumptions that immigration is somehow unfair or deceitful. Immigration lawyers describe a system premised on disbelief and a tendency to view migrants from wealthy white nations more favourably. As former barrister Frances Webber chronicles in her book, Borderline Justice, asylum seekers during that period were routinely assumed to be lying. In 2000, one asylum seeker was sent a letter from the Home Office stating: \u201cThe secretary of state believes your claim to be a pile of pants.\u201d Advisers of the time insist Labour had no need to make policy to placate tabloid readers. One top strategist for Blair says: \u201cA government with a 150 seat majority is making the weather.\u201d But a Home Office special adviser from that time says half of each day\u2019s media cuttings were about asylum seekers. \u201cThere would be pictures of people trying to get on to lorries and trains and cutting fences \u2026 it was incredibly intense, you were under constant scrutiny, always in court, always assailed by forces from all sides.\u201d None of that, he notes, made for an environment conducive to rational policy-making. * * * By this stage, little about the conversation on immigration was rational. In 2003, the Sun ran a front page fake news story under the headline Swan Bake, in which it claimed eastern Europeans were barbecuing swans pulled out of an east London park (following complaints, the paper did not apologise, even though there was no evidence to support this assertion). In a 31-day period in 2003, the Daily Express ran 22 front page stories on the subject. In both policy focus and language used, Labour had added to this mounting impression of migrants and refugees as \u201csneaking into the UK\u201d, \u201ccheating\u201d the system and \u201cliving off benefits\u201d. Advisers of the time acknowledge that a negative view of asylum was seeping more widely into hostility to all migrants. The hope, according to one home office adviser, was that \u201cif people saw we were dealing with abuse but also improving the channels for legal migration, we could get public trust back\u201d. But this is not how public sentiment works. \u201cAs we found out after 2004, that wasn\u2019t the case \u2013 they simply moved on to Eastern Europeans [arrivals from new EU member states] as a focus of concern,\u201d the adviser said. Charting the rising number of race-hate attacks around that time in cities from Stoke to Plymouth and Peterborough, IRR reports in 2012 show that migrants who were not asylum seekers, as well as black and ethnic minority British people, often faced hostilities exacerbated by asylum dispersal, tough political rhetoric and media scaremongering. By 2004, 26% of the population saw the number of immigrants and asylum seekers coming into the country as the third most important voting issue, after public services and law and order. That same year, with cross-party support, Labour opened the borders to migrants from eastern Europe\u2019s A8 countries: the Czech republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. To this day, this is cast as a supposed mistake, with former and current Labour MPs lining up to apologise for it. In 2012, Labour leader Ed Miliband said immigration was \u201cone of the areas we got wrong\u201d and spoke of \u201clocal talent\u201d being \u201clocked out of opportunity\u201d. And in 2013, Straw, the former home secretary, described it as a \u201cspectacular mistake\u201d. Ahead of the A8 accession, a government report predicted that up to 13,000 additional migrants would arrive annually from those states. It was way off: in 2005, 129,000 migrants from the A8 entered the UK. It was later painted as a crisis, but in truth, the British economy needed even those unexpected numbers. David Blunkett tried at the time to explain that migrants would in any case be coming to Britain in high numbers and it was better to have them in the labour market legally, paying tax. Study after study has showed that EU migration, in particular from A8 countries, produced a net economic gain for the UK. According to one authored by economists Helen Lawton and Danny Blanchflower in 2008: \u201cThe fact that the UK opened its borders to a flow of highly skilled, motivated, educated, low cost mobile workers upon EU-enlargement was a stroke of genius, for which the UK government should be given credit.\u201d Although the economy was booming through the 90s and early 00s, it was finance- and debt-fuelled and not equally enjoyed across the population. The social geographer Danny Dorling has dubbed Blair \u201cthe king of inequality\u201d, observing that Labour from 1997 to 2010 presided over a period during which inequalities in income, health and wealth actually rose. Don Flynn, the former director of the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, says: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that a group of politicians had taken their eye off the ball and immigrants had come through. It was that the immigration was the product of the type of economy created after the 1980s, with 80% of people working in a service industry of one sort or another, where the fastest areas of economic growth were London and the south-east, where a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week economy needed flexible workers doing antisocial hours in precarious, zero-hours, relatively low-paid jobs. And natives were going to do their level best to avoid those.\u201d * * * While Labour in 2004 had underestimated the number of arrivals from new EU member states, the tabloids wildly overestimated those figures. On the eve of accession, columnists in the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph respectively predicted that 4 million and 4.4 million migrants would come to Britain. Channeling this alarmism, the Conservatives under Michael Howard (the son of a Jewish refugee from Romania) ran campaign billboards during the 2005 proclaiming: \u201cIt\u2019s not racist to impose limits on immigration \u2026 Are you thinking what we\u2019re thinking?\u201d As new arrivals settled outside of big cities, tensions over asylum dispersal and scaremongering over jobs and resources boiled over into racially motivated attacks. By 2006, some of the country\u2019s most neglected areas were targeted by the British National party, which made gains in that year\u2019s local elections. At the same time, the idea that multiculturalism had failed \u2013 which had been percolating on the far-right \u2013 now spilled into the mainstream. The suggestion was that the left\u2019s supposed promotion of diversity had failed to foster integration and disadvantaged the white working class. It set the tone for the BBC\u2019s White Season, a documentary series that came out in 2008 and asked: \u201cIs white working class Britain becoming invisible?\u201d Trevor Phillips, then head of the equalities and human rights commission, echoed this sentiment when he said that the white working-class would need help in the economic recession, noting: \u201cThe colour of disadvantage isn\u2019t black or brown. It is white.\u201d By this reckoning \u201cwhite working-class\u201d was a minority, or protected group, that had hitherto been overlooked. Describing loss and disadvantage in these cultural terms gave rightwing attackers a way to claim multiculturalism in itself licensed an indifference to rising immigration and a clampdown on discussion of the subject. It all dovetailed into the accusation that Labour had abandoned its working-class heartlands. Labour politicians were also feeding this debate, concurring that they had not listened to \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d over migration. Earlier in 2009, MPs had claimed that the \u201cpace of change\u201d was too fast, or that, in the words of the home secretary at the time, Jacqui Smith, the \u201ccultural and emotional impact\u201d had not been properly understood. That same year, the immigration minister Phil Woolas said there was a need to find jobs for the \u201cindigenous population\u201d. Communities secretary Hazel Blears said: \u201cWhite working-class people living on estates sometimes just don\u2019t feel anyone is listening or speaking up for them.\u201d In January that year, a government report found that the white working-class felt ignored over immigration. Those in deprived areas, without much direct experience of immigration, felt \u201ca real and perceived sense of unfairness\u201d over the issue, coupled with a reluctance to speak out for fear of being branded as racist. Looking back now, it is striking that this report gives equal footing to \u201creal\u201d and \u201cperceived\u201d concerns \u2013 the idea that a sense of unfairness, not borne out by fact and misattributed to migrants, should be politically heeded. Four years after the Conservatives were criticised for using it on election campaign billboards, Gordon Brown said in a speech in November 2009 that it was \u201cnot racist\u201d to talk about immigration. Blue Labour \u2013 a faction positing that the party\u2019s social and economic liberalism had led to a drop in working-class support and pushing social conservatism as the solution \u2013 emerged in 2009. A substantial number of the 4m votes Labour lost between 1997 and 2005 were from its working-class base. But some factions in the party explored other elements, such as economic alienation and New Labour\u2019s disconnected, managerial style of politics. Diane Abbott says: \u201cWe moved post-Thatcher to this post-industrial society and [New Labour] really didn\u2019t have a strategy to deal with it,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were being affected economically, seeing their lives and communities shattered \u2026 and we didn\u2019t help, we didn\u2019t have an alternative.\u201d Labour lost the 2010 election and saw the Conservatives and Lib Dems form a coalition government. In opposition, Brown was not allowed to forget \u201cBigotgate\u201d, and Labour was hounded by the accusation that it had shut down a conversation about immigration \u2013 even while the subject was self-evidently dominating politics. This charge was coming not just from the Conservatives, but also from inside the party. Standing as candidate for party leadership in 2010, Andy Burnham claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s still an ambivalence among some in Labour about discussing immigration.\u201d Both these themes dominated the 2015 election. One adviser to Ed Miliband, Brown\u2019s successor as Labour leader, recalls the overwhelming media narrative of Labour as a party that \u201ccrashed the economy, opened the floodgates to immigration, was led by someone who looked nerdy and stabbed his brother in the back\u201d. \u201cWe spent five years being shit-scared,\u201d says one of Miliband\u2019s key advisers. \u201cIf we had the time again, I would force Ed to do a speech on the fallacy of blaming immigration for the reality of austerity cuts.\u201d Instead, Labour produced nebulous pledges over a caring NHS and higher wages for working families. One of those \u2013 \u201cControls on immigration\u201d \u2013 ended up on a party promotional mug, a dismal sign of a rightward shift in slogan form. * * * In March this year, an Ipsos Mori poll showed the public was more positive than negative over the impact of immigration on Britain. One in five said they had become less negative on the subject. When asked why, 51% said it was because discussions in the past few years had highlighted how much migrants contribute to the UK. This is an encouraging shift for those who have long argued that, had the left in British politics articulated a robust defence of immigration, this could have detoxified the public narrative. Records of parliamentary debates show objections \u2013 roundly ignored \u2013 to New Labour\u2019s hostile and punitive immigration policies dating back to when it took office in 1997, often raised by then backbenchers Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn. Bill Morris, then secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union (the precursor to Unite), spearheaded a campaign against asylum vouchers, which led to them being scrapped in 2001, albeit to resurface in 2006. And in 2003, a Trade Union Congress report argued that the \u201cblurring by media and governments of the distinction between refused asylum seekers, illegal working, illegal entry and criminal activity such as trafficking\u201d was feeding a general suspicion around all migrants. In the early years of Blair\u2019s government, it was riding high on a historic victory, while the prime minister enjoyed extraordinary popularity, support from the Sun and the Daily Mail. Abbott, among others, views this period as a missed opportunity to reset the terms of the debate. \u201cTony Blair could have used his considerable persuasion in middle England to make a different case about the role of immigration and what causes asylum seekers,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was in a very good position to change the conversation.\u201d But New Labour did not want to go against public sentiment. \u201cThere was a sense of real public hostility,\u201d recalls a special adviser to the Home Office at the time. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t just turn around and say to people: \u2018Your hostility is misplaced and wrong.\u2019\u201d This exact same instinct is raised by one of Miliband\u2019s advisers from 2010 to 2015: \u201cYou can\u2019t have your first sentence [to the public] being \u2018You\u2019re wrong about the thing that you\u2019re thinking, the thing that you\u2019re worried about.\u2019\u201d Political scientists Anthony Geddes and Jonathan Tonge have written of a \u201cratcheting effect\u201d whereby tough words and policy on immigration gives it more salience, creating, in turn, a public hunger for tougher words and policy. As Abbott puts it: \u201cIf the Labour party is banging on about immigration, our people feel legitimised in banging on about immigration. If we turn their attention to other things, they stop feeling as though it is the most terrible thing affecting their lives.\u201d That politicians and tabloids are no longer \u201cbanging on\u201d about immigration \u2013 certainly not at the fever pitch of the years prior to the EU referendum \u2013 may partly explain why immigration has dropped in prominence as a public concern: it now ranks just below the environment as the sixth biggest issue of the December general election. Brexit, which tops this same YouGov poll from last week, may for some be acting as a proxy for immigration. But perhaps the Windrush scandal has also had an impact, as well as staff shortages across health and social care, hospitality and farming. Labour\u2019s own internal polling shows little public disagreement with the statement that: \u201cPoliticians blame immigrants or people on benefits to distract from their own failures.\u201d While Labour under Corbyn has changed the frame of debate on austerity, wealth redistribution and renationalisation, it has hardly rushed to steer a similar shift on immigration. A rare window to do so opened amid the public outrage over the Windrush scandal, where a generation of British citizens were caught in the government\u2019s hostile environment dragnet, resulting in deportations and denied access to housing and healthcare. Amid a discussion that was unusually sympathetic, Labour MPs often ending up reinforcing stereotypes over \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants \u2013 cementing the idea of a system that had failed to filter properly, rather than widening the frame to explore how an entire process was premised on suspicion and prejudice. Meanwhile, the leadership\u2019s strong credentials on immigration \u2013 earned over decades of showing up to support various cases and causes \u2013 has been dented by Labour\u2019s pledge to end free movement. Grassroots dismay over this went beyond the need to defend an important principle, as the party was seen as closing off terrain that should have been used to make the pro-migration arguments that had been so lacking during the New Labour years. Triangulating over Brexit, the party has shown it is streaked with the same political reluctance over immigration that has long plagued Labour. Even elements that support the Corbyn project have misdirected a need to represent the working class into language that fuels populist-right frames of hostility to immigration. That much was clear in the recent intervention by the Unite leader, Len McCluskey, urging the party not to back free movement. This in turn prompted an exasperated backlash from campaigners and senior Labour figures alike, with one noting that McCluskey was \u201cpart of a backward-looking, small-c conservative nostalgia-tripping wing of the labour movement that wants \u2018trade union rights for British workers\u2019\u201d. As the party prepares to launch its manifesto, campaigners are watching to see whether the immigration motion passed at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Brighton in September, including a commitment to freedom of movement, will be honoured. Labour\u2019s readiness to put the idea of EU citizens having full voting rights to parliament just weeks ago suggests this part of the motion could be adopted as policy. Last week, Corbyn said that free movement \u201cenriches the lives of all of us\u201d, crucially shifting into language that goes beyond economic contribution. \u201cI want to make sure all those European Union nationals do remain here, can come here, will stay here and we will be happy to work with them as indeed many British people have made their homes in other parts of Europe,\u201d he said. The latest YouGov polling shows 67% support for the retention of reciprocal free movement rights post-Brexit, something that Labour is now likely to commit to. A source close to the leadership says the shift is down to \u201ca lot of hard work internally and pressure from the membership\u201d, adding that a softening of public attitudes to immigration and the Windrush scandal have both had an impact on MPs who might previously have hesitated over pro-migration policies. But the party\u2019s own history on immigration suggests that it may take time to embed significant changes in rhetoric and policy. Even with a leadership that is theoretically supportive, there are likely to be wobbles along the way. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

In response to criticisms of the landmark proposal by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the leftwing Common Wealth thinktank said changing the policy to focus on profits made in Britain, rather than globally, would help to address concerns that firms would relocate to avoid the rules. Such a move would also limit the impact on company investors and pension funds, and counter accusations that the inclusive ownership funds policy would be a stealth tax benefiting the Treasury more than workers, it added. The refreshed plan comes from Mathew Lawrence, the director of Common Wealth, who was influential in the launch of the original proposal. The suggestion could give an insight into Labour\u2019s thinking as the party prepares its manifesto, which is expected to include further detail on the funds, which aim to give workers greater control of firms and a bigger share of profits. A party source said: \u201cLabour will set out its full plans for government and publish its manifesto in due course.\u201d The original plan, announced a year ago, was designed to force companies with more than 250 employees to transfer shares to an ownership fund controlled by its workers. Firms would hand over at least 1% a year, up to a maximum 10%. Control of the shares would entitle workers to any dividends a company paid to its shareholders, up to a cap of \u00a3500 per employee. In effect a new levy on private business, any payouts above that level would go to the Treasury. The plan is designed to benefit 10.7 million workers at about 7,500 companies across the UK. The updated Common Wealth plan would force firms to issue a new kind of company share controlled by workers that would have rights to up to 10% of dividends related to UK-generated profits. Limiting the scope of the policy to domestic profits would reduce the total value of inclusive ownership funds to about \u00a35.8bn, with about \u00a33.6bn available to workers under the \u00a3500 cap. About \u00a32.2bn would be paid to the exchequer. Analysis published in September by the law firm Clifford Chance said forcing the largest 600 public and private firms in Britain to pay dividends on global profits would mean paying out about \u00a310.7bn. However, it said the \u00a3500 cap would mean \u00a31.3bn was paid to workers and \u00a39.4bn to tax authorities.

With a cap of \u00a3500, about 99% of the dividends would go to the Treasury, in effect meaning a significant tax on global companies for being headquartered in the UK. The thinktank said: \u201cBy tying the policy to UK activity rather than UK headquarters, it would significantly mitigate the incentive on firms to relocate, as the policy\u2019s cost would be proportional to UK activity.\u201d It also said companies would not be able to avoid creating inclusive ownership funds by relocating their headquarters, alluding to a law in France that forces firms to share profits with employees, which is mandatory for companies with at least 50 staff. \u201cTo build an economy that is democratic and sustainable by design, we need to transform how the company operates and for whom,\u201d Common Wealth said. \u201cFundamental to this must be a deep institutional turn in ownership to redistribute not just wealth and income, but power and control within the firm.\u201d",

This disillusionment is in each case two points even higher among military veterans. Soldiers don\u2019t like wars they can\u2019t win.</p> <p>The last British survey of such opinion was back in 2015. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/06/03/remembering-iraq\" title=\"\">YouGov revealed</a> that support for Middle East intervention had collapsed from two-thirds to one-third since 2003. A similar fall, from 63% to 38%, was recorded by YouGov America. Yet in Britain\u2019s current election, there is no suggestion from any politician \u2013 even Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 that British forces be withdrawn. It is as if democracy had grown numb to the costs and consequences of projecting violence overseas.</p> <p>The US has spent a <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/news/2019-11-13/costsofwar\" title=\"\">staggering $6.4tn</a> on almost two decades of interventions, with more than 7,000 military dead. Britain has lost 634. In addition, unknowable thousands of civilians have died, and billions of pounds\u2019 worth of property been destroyed. Christianity has been all but wiped out in the region, and some of the finest cities in the ancient world have been bombed flat. No audit has been made of this. The opportunity cost must be unthinkable.

Yet in Britain successive governments have parroted absurdities about \u201ckeeping our streets safe from terror\u201d. The opposite is manifestly the case. The threat to London is said to be \u201csubstantial\u201d and parts of Westminster look like a pastiche of Guantanamo Bay.</p> <p>The assumption is that at least the public and the military establishment are \u201cbehind the troops\u201d. That is clearly not the case. As long ago as 2004 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/12/field-marshal-lord-bramall-obituary\" title=\"\">Lord Bramall</a>, who died this week and was once Thatcher\u2019s favourite soldier, challenged the government to prove that the Iraq war, then just a year old, was worth the cost. It had, he said, already proved \u201cerroneous and counter-productive\u201d despite promises that it would bring democracy to Iraq. He added: \u201cOne can but wonder what legal \u2013 or, now, even moral \u2013 mandate the [western] coalition really has to do that.\u201d Bramall was emphatic that he spoke for many in the military establishment opposed to Tony Blair\u2019s mission, undertaken to please the Americans. In the <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2004-05-26a.1330.0&amp;m=100327\" title=\"\">15 years</a> since he made that speech nothing has changed.</p> <p>Every maxim about wars being easier to start than end has been vindicated.

In July there were even reports that Britain was being asked to replace the US forces in <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/09/britain-planning-send-troops-syria-backfill-us-withdrawal/\" title=\"\">Syria</a> withdrawn by Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/18/britain-young-afghanistan-trump-demands-defence-policy\">Britain cannot send its young to Afghanistan simply because Trump demands it | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a prolonged period of peace, the US and Britain face no existential threat from anyone. Yet they seem magnetised to distant military glory, in Britain\u2019s case by the prospect of \u201cpunching above our weight\u201d. Leaders assume a vague mandate for intervention, viewing war as patriotism in practice. Thatcher\u2019s Falklands war was undeniably popular. But in Afghanistan and Iraq what began as punitive raids mutated into crypto-imperial missions, intended to convert the heathen to western democracy. When the heathen declined and order collapsed, they died in their thousands.</p> <p>Precious few soldiers of my acquaintance believe there is any purchase in Britain staying in the Middle East. They just pray for a government with the guts to withdraw. None seems to have such guts. Thick is the glue that keeps western troops on alien soil. Staying is now an exercise in saving face, in not being seen to cut and run. Downing Street wants any chance to play on the global stage, to keep in with America for after Brexit. None of these objectives seems plausible. Nor are they popular. We are stuck with war, and no one can explain why.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The US has spent a staggering $6.4tn on almost two decades of interventions, with more than 7,000 military dead. Britain has lost 634. In addition, unknowable thousands of civilians have died, and billions of pounds\u2019 worth of property been destroyed. Christianity has been all but wiped out in the region, and some of the finest cities in the ancient world have been bombed flat. No audit has been made of this. The opportunity cost must be unthinkable. What diseases might have been eradicated, what climate crisis relieved? The wars of 9/11 must rank among the cruellest, most costly and senseless of the post-imperial age. Yet in Britain successive governments have parroted absurdities about \u201ckeeping our streets safe from terror\u201d. The opposite is manifestly the case. The threat to London is said to be \u201csubstantial\u201d and parts of Westminster look like a pastiche of Guantanamo Bay. The assumption is that at least the public and the military establishment are \u201cbehind the troops\u201d. That is clearly not the case. As long ago as 2004 Lord Bramall, who died this week and was once Thatcher\u2019s favourite soldier, challenged the government to prove that the Iraq war, then just a year old, was worth the cost. It had, he said, already proved \u201cerroneous and counter-productive\u201d despite promises that it would bring democracy to Iraq. He added: \u201cOne can but wonder what legal \u2013 or, now, even moral \u2013 mandate the [western] coalition really has to do that.\u201d Bramall was emphatic that he spoke for many in the military establishment opposed to Tony Blair\u2019s mission, undertaken to please the Americans. In the 15 years since he made that speech nothing has changed. Every maxim about wars being easier to start than end has been vindicated. British defeats in Basra and Helmand have been brushed under the carpet, as was David Cameron\u2019s fiasco in 2011 in Libya. Yet a Commons vote in 2013 against joining the Americans in Syria was disregarded by Downing Street in favour of covert operations. Today British drone killings are continuing across the Middle East. In July there were even reports that Britain was being asked to replace the US forces in Syria withdrawn by Trump. After a prolonged period of peace, the US and Britain face no existential threat from anyone. Yet they seem magnetised to distant military glory, in Britain\u2019s case by the prospect of \u201cpunching above our weight\u201d. Leaders assume a vague mandate for intervention, viewing war as patriotism in practice. Thatcher\u2019s Falklands war was undeniably popular. But in Afghanistan and Iraq what began as punitive raids mutated into crypto-imperial missions, intended to convert the heathen to western democracy. When the heathen declined and order collapsed, they died in their thousands. Precious few soldiers of my acquaintance believe there is any purchase in Britain staying in the Middle East. They just pray for a government with the guts to withdraw. None seems to have such guts. Thick is the glue that keeps western troops on alien soil. Staying is now an exercise in saving face, in not being seen to cut and run. Downing Street wants any chance to play on the global stage, to keep in with America for after Brexit. None of these objectives seems plausible. Nor are they popular. We are stuck with war, and no one can explain why. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "In February 2016, a few months before the referendum, Donald Tusk published the European Council\u2019s draft plans for renegotiating Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU. David Cameron was prepared for the possibility that Tusk\u2019s response would be less than he hoped for \u2013 it was a negotiation, after all. But what really shocked the then prime minister were the front pages the next day. \u201cCameron\u2019s EU deal is a joke\u201d, said the Daily Express; \u201cThe great delusion\u201d, barked the Daily Mail; \u201cMinisters defy PM on Europe\u201d, claimed the Telegraph; while the Sun went with \u201cWho do EU think EU are kidding, Mr Cameron?\u201d, which compared the offer to a \u201csteaming pile of manure\u201d. \u201cThe Tories [in the leadership of the remain camp] were about to run a referendum campaign based on a playbook \u2026 for winning elections in an environment where the print media was sympathetic,\u201d writes Tim Shipman in his book All Out War. \u201cBut this time their natural allies were hostile.\u201d Senior Tories were not used to having their arguments distorted, the facts so hideously disfigured in their opponent\u2019s favour that they were unrecognisable, or blatant falsehoods by the opposition taken seriously. These were not only rules of engagement to which they were unaccustomed \u2013 they were rules under which they could not compete. \u201cIt pains me to say it,\u201d a member of Cameron\u2019s team told Shipman, \u201cbut if the Mail, Sun and the Telegraph had been for \u2018In\u2019 we would have romped home.\u201d Now that we are back in election mode, normal service has been resumed. The Tories\u2019 \u201cnatural allies\u201d are back in the trenches alongside them, ready to help them \u201cromp home\u201d. This was to be expected. Indeed, we have all become so inured to the naked rightwing partisanship of the British press that it barely registers beyond a knowing shrug. But somehow we never quite seem to compensate for its effect in our politics. Its persistent power has produced a corrosive democratic deficit. It is simply not possible to make an informed decision when one is routinely, wilfully and cynically misinformed. When devout remainers insist the referendum was invalid because we were lied to, they talk as though the misinformation of 2016 was a one-off. It wasn\u2019t. On that basis we should revoke all pretence that we live in a democracy and start again. (The left can lie too, of course. It just doesn\u2019t have the capacity to distribute those lies on anything like the same scale.) People think they are immune to all of this. They\u2019re not. We can and do, of course, make up our own minds. But we don\u2019t make them up out of thin air. Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cTeflon qualities\u201d, Labour\u2019s \u201cincomprehensible\u201d Brexit policy or Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u201cleadership failings\u201d are all remarked upon as though they are unrivalled facts rather than judgments, all mediated through an almighty filter with extreme prejudice. The framing is so dominant and pervasive, and reproduced so consistently, omnisciently and persistently, that it ceases to feel like a frame at all. \u201cInevitably our opinions cover a bigger space, a longer reach of time, a greater number of things, than we can directly observe,\u201d wrote Walter Lippmann in his landmark book, Public Opinion. \u201cThey have, therefore, to be pieced together out of what others have reported.\u201d And a significant amount of what has been reported lately is extremely dubious. With a handful of notable exceptions, what emerges is a kind of political kabuki, where substantive discussion is performed on the basis of an insubstantial script. Take Andrew Marr\u2019s flagship BBC show last Sunday, in which he began with the newspaper review: \u201cConservative Central Office will be delighted because their analysis of Labour spending hits front page after front page after front page,\u201d he began.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong protesters have alighted on a new way to counter the police, as the five-month old anti-government resistance grinds on and their tactics evolve further. The latest strategy being deployed across the city involves protesters stacking bricks that resemble mini-temples across thoroughfares to function as roadblocks. Locally dubbed \u201cbrick battlegrounds\u201d or \u201cmini-Stonehenges\u201d, they have been hailed by many supporters as creative installations to deter the advance of riot police and stop cars from driving over thoroughfares. It is the latest tactic adopted by protesters in the five-month anti-government movement which has seen metal and plastic roadside barriers used as make-shift barricades, umbrellas and cling film used to shield against tear gas and pepper spray, foam swimming boards and cupboard doors used as shields against rubber bullets and sponge rounds, and sporting goods such as bows and arrows used as weapons. Demonstrators were setting up the structures on Friday during a lunchtime rally in the central business district. They could be seen outside the entrances of Chinese University of Hong Kong, one of the focal points of the protests. \u201cWe are putting them everywhere,\u201d a protester said. Demonstrators said that the three-part structures help slow down police vehicles - water cannons or armoured cars. When struck by a wheel, the block on top falls away from the wheel and behind the two remaining bricks, acting as a buttress. Conflict between police and protesters escalated this week after a police officer shot a 21-year-old student in the stomach as demonstrators attempted to disrupt the Monday morning rush hour. A citywide strike and widespread traffic disruption this week was called for by protesters after the death of Chow Tsz-lok, a 22-year-old student who died last Friday from brain damage following a fall during protests. Many thoroughfares outside universities and in the financial hub of Central have been blocked by the \u201cbrick battlegrounds\u201d \u2013 some overlaid with long bamboo poles used for building scaffolding locally \u2013 since Monday. The tactic has successfully forced traffic to grind to a halt and bus routes to divert this week. Local Hong Kongers have also complained about not being able to go about their daily lives and get to work. Protesters also dropped bricks onto main roads or threw burning objects onto railway tracks in an attempt to paralyse Hong Kong\u2019s normally efficient public transport.

But businesses are way too busy to follow all this. They worry: will this person need a permit, how long will that take, what will it cost?\u201d</p> <p>The 137 companies in Madrid to which Halliday has applied since he was let go earlier this year \u201cwith real regret\u201d by the global finance firm he was working for plainly decided \u201cthey\u2019d rather not take the risk. And I understand them. I\u2019d do the same.\u201d</p> <p>Across the EU, British citizens are starting to face similar difficulties. Not all: plenty have signed new contracts without a hitch. But many say that three years of confusion and doubt among EU employers about the rights of British workers after Brexit are taking their toll.</p> <h2>\u2018Nothing can fully replicate free movement\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cBrexit hasn\u2019t happened yet and British citizens living and working in the EU are already suffering the consequences,\u201d says Laura Shields, the spokeswoman for the <a href=\"https://britishineurope.org/\">British in Europe lobby group</a>, for whom Halliday\u2019s experience is \u201cno surprise at all\u201d.</p> <p>For employers, \u201cno candidate is so special that you look at a pile of CVs and say: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s take a big risk with that one,\u2019\u201d Shields says. \u201cThis is what ending free movement into Britain means: barriers going up for Britons wanting to work in that enormous great market on our doorsteps.\u201d</p> <p>The risk of no deal, which would leave 1.3 million British nationals in the EU \u2013 80% of them of working age or younger \u2013 facing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/14/britons-in-europe-face-citizens-rights-lottery-in-event-of-no-deal-brexit\">postcode lottery of 27 unilateral solutions</a> for residency rights, social security, healthcare and recognition of qualifications, has now receded until 31 January, although it will return.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s renegotiated withdrawal deal, if it is ratified, does secure basic residency and social security rights, guaranteeing the freedom to move and live within the EU during the transition period plus the right to stay when it ends, and to apply for permanent residence after five years.</p> <p>But the freedom of British citizens living in one EU country to move at will within the bloc, as they can now, and the right of all those who leave the UK after Brexit to live and work in the EU at all, are subject to any future agreement \u2013 and will depend on the rules Britain applies to EU citizens coming to the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWe have absolutely no idea what the regime will be like unless and until the future relationship is actually agreed,\u201d says Shields. \u201cWill there be visa-free working? No one knows. There\u2019ll certainly have to be some kind of permit system. And nothing can fully replicate free movement.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, anecdotal evidence suggests that continuing uncertainty about the exact status of British nationals on the continent after Brexit is already prompting some European employers to steer clear. \u201cPeople are being turned down because they may soon not be EU citizens,\u201d Shields says.</p> <h2>\u2018If you have 10 CVs from around Europe, why look at a Brit?\u2019</h2> <p>In Germany, Megan Thornton, who has held a succession of jobs in sales, customer service and travel consultancy since moving to Berlin in 2013, suddenly found her CV was being \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d when she started looking for a new post last year.</p> <p>\u201cEither they didn\u2019t respond at all, or it was an instant no,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d never had trouble finding work in Berlin; quite the reverse. I had the right skills and experience. One company finally explained it couldn\u2019t accept candidates who needed a work permit. I said I didn\u2019t: I was still an EU citizen. I never heard back.\u201d</p> <p>Thornton has since applied for, and been granted, permanent residence in Germany. Straightaway, she secured a string of interviews and, last week, a new job.</p> <p>A similar experience greeted a British IT expert who moved to Luxembourg in 2017 with his wife, after she was recruited to a new job there from the UK. The couple, who asked not to be named, had planned for him to spend a year at home with their young children before he started looking for work, he said.</p> <p>\u201cQuite soon after that, I was offered a great job with Euratom, the European atomic energy agency \u2013 we got to choosing the company car,\u201d he says. \u201cThen, overnight, they changed their mind. The recruiter told me afterwards they couldn\u2019t get anyone to sign off on me because of the uncertainty over my future status.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, he says, things had got to the point where \u201cwe nearly gave up and went home. We\u2019d budgeted for two salaries. I must have sent 100 CVs and got maybe five responses. I\u2019ve now spoken to a lot of people, a lot of agencies, and the general perception is: if you have 10 CVs from around Europe, why look at a Brit?\u201d</p> <p>This simply reflects \u201ca wish to avoid a hassle and a risk you don\u2019t need\u201d, he says. \u201cFirms here are used to hiring Japanese employees. They know the rules. But Brits are now an unknown. If you\u2019re an Italian hiring here, you read a headline, hear something on the radio \u2026 You don\u2019t have the time or the inclination. You play safe.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018British contractors are at the bottom of the pile\u2019</h2> <p>Daniel Hibbs-Woodings has encountered the same difficulty. A highly qualified and experienced social housing professional who had previously studied and lived in Germany, he followed his German partner to Cologne in February.</p> <p>\u201cProperty management jobs are plentiful here,\u201d Hibbs-Woodings says. \u201cI sent off 50 applications and got no replies. One filed online was rejected within 29 minutes. I knew I was instantly employable for all these jobs. I was stumped.\u201d</p> <p>Then he asked a recruitment agency to put him forward. Stripped of personal details such as name and nationality, his anonymised candidacy attracted instant interest from a number of employers. Once they had seen his full CV, however, none subsequently followed through.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cd00be1819e58fbcad920f99d32b4a1c820a6f25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd00be1819e58fbcad920f99d32b4a1c820a6f25/68_263_609_761/400.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Williams\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Williams, a technical contractor based in Spain, was told that no UK contractors would be considered \u2018until Brexit has been finalised\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe harsh reality is that if employers have a choice, most will not go for someone with an entirely uncertain visa status,\u201d says Hibbs-Woodings, who finally found a job outside his field for which he is substantially overqualified. \u201cIt could be a problem for many \u2013 you can only apply for permanent residence in Germany after five years.\u201d</p> <p>The difficulties for contractors working across several European countries are even more complex. Chris Williams, a senior independent technical contractor based in Spain, is currently working for Airbus on a major international project to install new military communications equipment in Nato bases across Europe.</p> <p>He accepted the work after being told flatly by Galileo, the European global satellite navigation system, that no UK contractors would be considered \u201cuntil Brexit has been finalised and we know exactly what the new rules are. And that applies to some extent all over: British contractors are at the bottom of the pile.\u201d</p> <p>Williams has already had to complete different formalities in Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium to be granted a temporary right to continue functioning as a provider of cross-border services. Next year, when he will be working in many more counties, he has no idea what the situation will be.</p> <p>\u201cMy contract is with Airbus France, and under French contract law it is my responsibility to be aware of and comply with all the rules and regulations for third-country nationals working in EU countries,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard indeed to work out exactly what I\u2019m going to have to do.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018No one knows whether Brexit will be a problem\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5acf2e9cb417b1ef52857262dfea14c8364a12e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5acf2e9cb417b1ef52857262dfea14c8364a12e6/0_0_2816_2112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lily Hall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018French employers are asking whether Brexit will be a problem,\u2019 says Lily Hall, a seasonal ski school worker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In France, Lily Hall, an office manager for a ski school, is increasingly concerned about work after Brexit. She moved to France with her parents in 1997, aged four, and for the past six years has been a seasonal employee with French companies contracted by British tour operators to look after their clients in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re.</p> <p>\u201cFrench employers are now seriously asking about whether Brexit will be a problem, and asking for papers,\u201d she says. \u201cI tell them no, but the truth is no one knows. My application for citizenship has been turned down once already because as a seasonal worker, I don\u2019t have a permanent address in Savoie, where I work.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Madrid, Halliday said he and five other British nationals working for the same multinational were let go \u201cbecause it was a highly time-sensitive project, running to a very tight schedule, and we represented a potential issue they could not afford\u201d.</p> <p>Hoping some Brexit clarity would emerge, he and his Spanish partner paid three months\u2019 rent upfront to extend the lease on their flat to mid-October. \u201cOf course, it didn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd paying the rent in advance pretty much cleared us out.

A highly qualified and experienced social housing professional who had previously studied and lived in Germany, he followed his German partner to Cologne in February. \u201cProperty management jobs are plentiful here,\u201d Hibbs-Woodings says. \u201cI sent off 50 applications and got no replies. One filed online was rejected within 29 minutes. I knew I was instantly employable for all these jobs. I was stumped.\u201d Then he asked a recruitment agency to put him forward. Stripped of personal details such as name and nationality, his anonymised candidacy attracted instant interest from a number of employers. Once they had seen his full CV, however, none subsequently followed through. \u201cThe harsh reality is that if employers have a choice, most will not go for someone with an entirely uncertain visa status,\u201d says Hibbs-Woodings, who finally found a job outside his field for which he is substantially overqualified. \u201cIt could be a problem for many \u2013 you can only apply for permanent residence in Germany after five years.\u201d The difficulties for contractors working across several European countries are even more complex. Chris Williams, a senior independent technical contractor based in Spain, is currently working for Airbus on a major international project to install new military communications equipment in Nato bases across Europe. He accepted the work after being told flatly by Galileo, the European global satellite navigation system, that no UK contractors would be considered \u201cuntil Brexit has been finalised and we know exactly what the new rules are. And that applies to some extent all over: British contractors are at the bottom of the pile.\u201d Williams has already had to complete different formalities in Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium to be granted a temporary right to continue functioning as a provider of cross-border services. Next year, when he will be working in many more counties, he has no idea what the situation will be. \u201cMy contract is with Airbus France, and under French contract law it is my responsibility to be aware of and comply with all the rules and regulations for third-country nationals working in EU countries,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard indeed to work out exactly what I\u2019m going to have to do.\u201d \u2018No one knows whether Brexit will be a problem\u2019 In France, Lily Hall, an office manager for a ski school, is increasingly concerned about work after Brexit. She moved to France with her parents in 1997, aged four, and for the past six years has been a seasonal employee with French companies contracted by British tour operators to look after their clients in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. \u201cFrench employers are now seriously asking about whether Brexit will be a problem, and asking for papers,\u201d she says. \u201cI tell them no, but the truth is no one knows. My application for citizenship has been turned down once already because as a seasonal worker, I don\u2019t have a permanent address in Savoie, where I work.\u201d Back in Madrid, Halliday said he and five other British nationals working for the same multinational were let go \u201cbecause it was a highly time-sensitive project, running to a very tight schedule, and we represented a potential issue they could not afford\u201d. Hoping some Brexit clarity would emerge, he and his Spanish partner paid three months\u2019 rent upfront to extend the lease on their flat to mid-October. \u201cOf course, it didn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd paying the rent in advance pretty much cleared us out. We\u2019re going back to our parents\u2019 to sit out the next few months.\u201d Some names have been changed or abbreviated",

Swift made the allegations in a tweet posted on 14 November, imploring fans to make their feelings known to Big Machine Label Group executives Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun. On 15 November, BMLG issued a statement describing Swift\u2019s allegations as being based on \u201cfalse information\u201d and issued new allegations that Swift \u201chas admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company\u201d.

In an email dated 28 October seen by the Guardian, a BMLG executive explicitly states that the label \u201cwill not agree to issue licenses for existing recordings or waivers of its re-recording restrictions in connection with the Netflix documentary and the Alibaba \u2018Double Eleven\u2019 event\u2019\u201d, a Chinese sales gala at which Swift performed earlier this week. Swift\u2019s representatives issued a statement clarifying that Swift only performed material from her 2019 album Lover \u2013 her first for Universal Music Group \u2013 at the event in Shanghai \u201cas it was clear that BMLG felt any televised performance of catalogue songs violated her agreement\u201d.

As a way of reclaiming some control over her music, Swift said in August that she planned to record copycat versions of her back catalogue from November next year. In the note posted to Twitter, Swift said she had been planning to perform a medley of her hits at the AMAs, which will be broadcast on US television. But the singer also alleged she had been told by Braun and Borchetta that she was \u201cnot allowed to perform my old songs on television because that would be re-recording my music before I\u2019m allowed to next year\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A man who was fired by BP over a Downfall parody video is appealing to the full bench of the Fair Work Commission, saying a deputy president of the commission did not properly understand the long-running meme. The oil refinery technician had helped make a video mocking his bosses during a \u201ctense\u201d period of pay negotiations, according to court documents. He was fired after the video was discovered, and lodged a claim for unfair dismissal. Guardian Australia reported he lost his case in September, with commission deputy president Melanie Binet saying the video was \u201cinappropriate and offensive\u201d and there were valid grounds for his dismissal. But the man\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal, arguing that Binet \u201cmischaracterised\u201d the video and misunderstood \u201cthe broader genre of Downfall video\u201d. The Downfall meme is a popular parody format in which humorous captions are overlaid on footage from the 2004 film Downfall, which shows Adolf Hitler panicking and shouting at his generals. The meme first came to prominence in 2008 and has been used for everything from reaction to the new iPad to Cristiano Ronaldo leaving Manchester United for Real Madrid to the Warringah election this year. In this case, the video depicted BP bosses panicking about how negotiations were going. Titled \u201cHitler Parody EA Negotiations\u201d, it included captions such as \u201cI offered the carrot, I tried using the stick ... Don\u2019t they know I\u2019m in charge?\u201d and \u201cI made promises to London\u201d. After the worker shared the video in an employee Facebook group, he was investigated by BP and fired in January 2019. BP said he \u201cdistributed material which is highly offensive and inappropriate\u201d and had breached the company code of conduct. But the worker argued the video was not offensive and was intended to \u201cboost morale\u201d. BP had argued that the video was \u201coffensive and/or inappropriate\u201d because it created a parallel between Hitler and Nazi officers and the BP management team. Previous decisions of the commission have found that calling an employer \u201ca Nazi\u201d is offensive. Deputy president Binet said: \u201cI do not accept that by labelling something as a parody is a \u2018get out of jail free card\u2019 and necessarily means something is not offensive \u2026 I am satisfied that when viewed in context that a reasonable person would consider the Hitler video inappropriate and offensive.\u201d But in appeal documents filed to the commission, lawyer Kamal Farouque of Maurice Blackburn argued this was a \u201cmanifest mischaracterisation\u201d of the video. The submissions argue that Downfall videos do not mean to actually compare the subject to Hitler or Nazis. \u201cThe Downfall video genre involves an absurd juxtaposition between Hitler\u2019s downfall and a contemporary mundane, commonplace or day-to-day matter not going to plan,\u201d the submissions said. \u201cThe absurd juxtaposition is a device to make a humorous point about the contemporary matter not going to plan. There would be no humour in the Downfall video genre if it constituted calling, depicting, likening a person as a Nazi or imputing that the person has the characteristics of Hitler or the leaders of the Nazi party.\u201d Previously, BP had argued the video \u201cattributes to Hitler\u2019s character\u201d comments the refinery manager had made during the negotiations. \u201cHitler lists the proposals which [the company] have made during the negotiation process and expresses his fury at the workforce\u2019s refusal to agree to the deal despite these concessions,\u201d BP said in its submissions. In September, Binet said the video had \u201cthe potential to undermine, demean and denigrate the BP senior management team amongst an audience which they were charged to lead\u201d. According to the ruling, the video was made by the man\u2019s wife in September 2018, using the website captiongenerator.com. Bruno Ganz, the actor who portrayed Hitler in Downfall, died in February this year at age 77.",

      "bodyText": "The Daily Telegraph\u2019s front page on Friday featured an exclusive interview with former soldier Ben Roberts-Smith, who accuses leaders of the Australian Defence Force of \u201cshamefully protecting their own careers at the expense of rank-and-file soldiers\u201d. Roberts-Smith is fronting the Tele\u2019s Save Our Heroes campaign, which is calling for a royal commission into the suicides of serving and retired military. The Telegraph held a Save Our Heroes summit in parliament house last week to press the government to hold a royal commission. But the newspaper version of the story failed to say that the Victoria Cross recipient is being investigated by the Australian federal police for alleged war crimes in an Afghan village in 2012. Roberts-Smith vehemently denies the accusations and is suing the Nine newspapers that first reported them. An interview with Roberts-Smith will be screened on Sky News on Friday evening. Roberts-Smith is the deputy chair of the prime ministerial advisory council on veterans\u2019 mental health, which advises government on issues of mental health of veterans and their families. At a meeting in July the council rejected the Telegraph\u2019s call for a royal commission: \u201cCouncil members agreed a better outcome for our veterans would be for the considerable energy and resources that would be attracted to a royal commission to be applied in better addressing the plethora of existing major reports and inquiries into veterans\u2019 wellbeing and their recommendations. \u201cThe council considers the current public rhetoric on calls for a royal commission into veterans\u2019 suicide is damaging to [the veterans\u2019 affairs department] and could paralyse the good work already being undertaken as part of [the department\u2019s] transformation agenda, which has potential to negatively impact or unnecessarily delay services and entitlements for veterans.\u201d A final paragraph acknowledging the allegations has been added to the Telegraph\u2019s online copy: \u201cMr Roberts-Smith has strongly denied war crimes allegations levelled against him and has launched defamation action against Nine-owned Fairfax newspapers.\u201d Bettina Arndt lights her own fire Former sex-therapist turned men\u2019s rights campaigner Bettina Arndt made news last year for her \u201cFake Rape Crisis Tour\u201d of universities which sparked student protests, and #MenToo: The Other Side of the Story, her book about the \u201canti-male feminist agenda\u201d. This week she popped up with a ridiculous take on the bushfire emergency in the midst of a spate of bad takes which included the Australian\u2019s front page blaming the Greens for the bushfires. Arndt tweeted that it was \u201cbrave men\u201d who were fighting the fires and we should give thanks to them because it\u2019s \u201cusually men who do the really dangerous\u201d work. It didn\u2019t take long for people to point out that hundreds of women were fighting fires too. But that\u2019s not Arndt\u2019s only recent misfire. The woman who styles herself as a campaigner for men has even managed to rile the leader of an American men\u2019s movement. Arndt got into a slanging match with A Voice for Men founder Paul Elam, over his plans for an international men\u2019s conference in the Hunter Valley next year. The Southern Poverty Law Centre, which monitors extreme and far-right activity in the US, has included Elam on a list of \u201cmale supremacists\u201d. After Arndt objected to the choice of location, Elam accused his former ally of \u201cgynocentrism\u201d and cancelled the conference. \u201cSome of you are likely aware that Paul Elam from A Voice For Men has announced that the ICMI conference in Sydney will not go ahead because I was threatening not to support the conference because of the chosen venue,\u201d she wrote on her website. \u201cIt\u2019s true that, in a moment of passion, I said and also wrote in an email that I didn\u2019t think I could support the conference if it were held in Hunter Valley. Understandably, Paul interpreted this statement as a threat. \u201cI am sorry I said it, and sabotaging the conference is the last thing I would ever want to do.\u201d After Arndt\u2019s apology Elam said the conference would go ahead, but in Sydney. Fray to steady Crikey\u2019s leaking ship Several recent departures from Crikey \u2013 managing editor Bhakthi Puvanenthiran, opinion editor Meg Watson, investigative editor Lauren Molan \u2013 appeared to signal something might be awry at the almost 20-year-old digital news site started by Stephen Mayne in 2000. Private Media\u2019s chairman, Eric Beecher, has hired the experienced newspaper editor Peter Fray as editor-in-chief and managing editor, presumably to steady the ship. Fray will leave UTS, where he is professor of journalism practice and co-director of the centre for media transition, next month to take up the job overseeing the editorial direction of the Mandarin and SmartCompany as well as Crikey. The former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Sun-Herald will take charge of the relatively new investigative unit, Inq. It was only February when Private Media announced it would hire a dozen full-time journalists, funded by a Private Media investor, Cameron O\u2019Reilly. No Games \u2013 but no \u2018hunger games\u2019 either ABC management\u2019s latest pay offer to its 3,600 staff may signal the end of the hated \u201chunger games\u201d, a description unions used to describe the way staff were made redundant in the past few years. Staff were put in a \u201cpool\u201d, from which they would have to compete against colleagues to prove why they shouldn\u2019t be made redundant. The new pay offer includes a voluntary redundancy provision which kicks in when more than 10 jobs are targeted, something ABC staff have not been offered before. With a new round of redundancies looming, this is an attractive offer. ABC MD David Anderson told senate estimates \u201cthere will be job losses\u201d but didn\u2019t say how many or when. The ABC has already saved about $1m by not covering the Tokyo Olympic Games on radio next year as it is tries to fill an $84m hole in the budget from a Coalition cut in May 2018. In August ABC staff rejected the 1.7% offer; 66.7% voted against the proposal. The new three-year agreement is for a 2% pay rise per annum for the three years. Cuts, cuts and more cuts at ACM There has been a brutal purge of middle management at Australian Community Media, publishers of the Canberra Times, the Illawarra Mercury, the Newcastle Herald and 130 community-based websites. Managing editors started disappearing across the company earlier in the week, before any announcement was made. The former Domain boss Antony Catalano and billionaire Alex Waislitz bought ACM from Nine Entertainment earlier this year, paying a fraction of the $3bn price Fairfax Media paid for it in 2007. On Thursday Catalano sacked the managing editor of agricultural publishing, Brad Cooper, the national sales director, Penny Kaleta, the head of agricultural publishing, John Waters, and the digital sales director, Jason King. \u201cI would like to extend my gratitude for the tireless efforts of these departing leaders over many years,\u201d Catalano said in a note to shocked staff. On Friday there were more names with the departure of all the managing editors from the different states: Kim Treasure, Andrew Eales, Mark Baker, David Coren and Sean Cowan. Kiribati \u2018misleads\u2019 over 60 Minutes visa When the Channel Nine reporter Liam Bartlett and crew from 60 Minutes were detained in a hotel on Kiribati last month, the government claimed they had arrived without the correct permits and put them under house arrest. They were in the Pacific island archipelago to film a story about the recent decision of the Kiribati government to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and establish relations with China. Photojournalist Ben Bohane, a Pacific islands specialist, says the \u201cshrill statements put out by the Kiribati government\u201d were misleading and 60 Minutes did apply for a visa before arriving. \u201cA day after we arrived immigration took us in for questioning and told us the permit would cost $5,000, perhaps expecting we would baulk at the outrageous cost,\u201d he said. \u201cThis fee suggests Kiribati is starting to use the same approach as Nauru with its $8,000 media visa, which also has no guarantee of being approved and acts as an effective block on all foreign media coverage of the refugee detention centres. \u201cAs far as I am aware, the Kiribati government has not issued any foreign media permits for the past two years since the ferry sinking disaster in January 2018 which claimed 95 lives. Now they are concerned about sensitivities around the diplomatic switch to China, for instance blocking all local media coverage of a pro-Taiwan public demonstration on 27 September. Our attempts to access footage of the demonstration shot by an independent local cameraman were blocked.\u201d The story will air on Nine on Sunday.",

      "bodyText": "An active investigation into Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, includes probes into possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent, Bloomberg reports: The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump\u2019s presidency from a man that former national security adviser John Bolton has called a \u201chand grenade.\u201d A second official said Giuliani\u2019s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn\u2019t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation. Giuliani is a central figure in the U.S. House impeachment inquiry, which focuses on an effort led by the former New York City mayor to pressure Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate the president\u2019s political rivals. If Giuliani is charged or indicted, he could expose Trump to a new level of legal and political jeopardy, especially if he\u2019s accused of committing a crime on the president\u2019s behalf. Trump\u2019s lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to protect the president\u2019s tax returns from subpoenas. A diplomat who reportedly overheard a key conversation between Trump and EU ambassador Gordon Sondland is set to testify in a closed-door deposition tomorrow. Activists protested outside a black-tie event where Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh is making a rare public appearance after angrily denying allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford. At least two students were killed and three others injured after a 16-year-old suspect opened fire at a high school in Santa Clarita, California, prompting more calls for gun control. Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats are moving away from the language of \u201cquid pro quo\u201d. Instead, they\u2019re using the world bribery to describe Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to force Ukrainian investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. The Ethics Committee said in a statement that it is \u201caware of public allegations\u201d that the 14-term Democrat has a relationship with a member of his staff, violating a 2018 rule that prohibits sexual relationships between lawmakers and staff. The staffer was not identified, but Hastings has previously admitted to having a relationship with his deputy district director Patricia Williams. Democratic representative Katie Hill of California resigned last month after the committee began investigating whether she had an inappropriate relationship with an aide. David Holmes, the counselor for political affairs at the US Embassy in Ukraine who overheard a conversation between Trump and Gordon Sondland during which they reportedly discussed \u201cinvestigations\u201d , is set to testify at a closed-door deposition tomorrow. Yesterday, acting Ukraine ambassador Bill Taylor said in the first public hearing of the impeachment inquiry that an aide was also told by Sondland that Trump cased more about an investigation into the Bidens than US-Ukraine policy. Taylor did not name Holmes, multiple news organizations are reporting that Holmes is the aide Taylor was referencing. A multi-day Republican National Committee event will be held at the Trump National Doral in Florida, the Washington Post reports. Last month, Trump briefly tried to hold next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit at Doral, but canceled the plan after facing bipartisan criticism for essentially awarding himself a huge, lucrative contract. From The Post : The first GOP meeting at Doral was in spring 2018. That event produced about $630,000 in revenue for Trump\u2019s company, from the GOP and individual attendees, according to a review of campaign-finance records. At another GOP meeting, in winter 2018, the GOP held most of the event at another hotel \u2014 but it also included a dinner at Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel, for which it paid Trump\u2019s company $169,000. Brett Kavanaugh makes a rare public appearance Kavanaugh is addressing conservative judges at the Federalist Society, making a rare public appearance since he was confirmed to the Supreme Court. The Trump-appointed justice was narrowly confirmed in the Senate after angrily denying allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in 1982, when Kavanaugh was a high school student. The audience at the Federalist Society gala today is a friendly one. One of the organization\u2019s leaders Leonard Leo has served as an adviser to Trump on judicial nominations. But outside the event, it seems activists aren\u2019t too happy. Facebook has also faced criticism for funding the gala. Bill Clinton\u2019s advises Donald Trump on how to handle impeachment Clinton told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper his advice for Trump is to do as he did during his impeachment. \u201cLook, you got hired to do a job. \u2026 Every day\u2019s an opportunity to make something good happen,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I would say, \u2018I\u2019ve got lawyers and staff people handling this impeachment inquiry and they should just have at it. Meanwhile, I\u2019m going to work for the American people.\u2019 That\u2019s what I would do/\u201d As a reminder, Trump has fought hard to shield his tax returns, and at each step so far he\u2019s been rebuffed. Last week, a unanimous three-judge panel of a federal appeals court in Manhattan rejected Trump\u2019s argument that as president he was immune from criminal investigation, and allowed the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s subpoena to move forward. Yesterday, judges from the federal appeals court in the District of Columbia Circuit refused to rehear a ruling that Trump\u2019s accounting firm must comply with the House Oversight and Reform Committee\u2019s subpoena for his financial records. The president\u2019s lawyers have asked the supreme court to stop a Manhattan prosecutor\u2019s investigation into his finances, setting up a landmark case over exactly how much authority the president has. The justices could weigh in on Trump\u2019s broader claim that sitting presidents are exempt from investigation or prosecution due to executive privilege. The filing today concerns Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr\u2019s attempt to enforce a grand jury subpoena to obtain eight years of Trump\u2019s tax returns from Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm. Vance is seeking these financial records as part of a broader investigation into payments made to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, two women who claim they had affairs with the president. Trump denies their claims. A separate case could be headed to the court involving a subpoena by House investigators seeking Trump\u2019s financial records from the same firm. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Two teenagers were killed and another three injured after a shooter opened fire on his southern California high school. The tragedy prompted more demands for legislative action to curb gun violence. Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of bribery in the Ukraine controversy as the House speaker and her caucus move away from the language of \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to describe alleged efforts to force Ukrainian investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. The White House is reportedly planning to release a transcript from Trump\u2019s April call with the Ukrainian president. (The pair\u2019s July call set off the impeachment inquiry.) In an interview with the Guardian, Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, joked he has \u201cinsurance\u201d in case Trump abandons him. A second staffer at the US embassy in Kyiv reportedly overheard Trump\u2019s July phone call with Gordon Sondland, in which the president allegedly asked the US ambassador to the EU about \u201cthe investigations\u201d in Ukraine. Maanvi will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Running behind schedule for his campaign rally in Louisiana, Trump concluded his meeting with attorney general William Barr and others before departing for Marine One without taking questions from reporters. Just before leaving for his Louisiana campaign rally, Trump was spotted in the Oval Office having what one White House reporter called an \u201canimated conversation\u201d with attorney general William Barr. Trump is about to depart for Louisiana, where he is hosting a campaign rally tonight alongside Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone. Rispone will attempt to unseat Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards in a Saturday runoff, and Republican groups have devoted significant resources to try to regain the governor\u2019s mansion in the deeply conservative state. However, there are signs of GOP anxiety about the race. The Republican National Committee is pouring another $1 million into the state as some GOP strategists privately acknowledge Edwards is a slight favorite to win. Earlier today, Trump showed the transcript from his first call with the Ukrainian president to Republican senators, one of whom said it was not a very interesting document. The White House reportedly plans to soon release the transcript of Trump\u2019s first call with the Ukrainian president, which took place in April. Trump teased the release of the transcript in a Monday tweet, claiming it was the \u201cmost important\u201d of the calls he has had with the Ukrainian president. (It was Trump\u2019s July call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy that initiated the impeachment inquiry.) \u201cIn order to continue being the most Transparent President in history, I will be releasing sometime this week the Transcript of the first, and therefore most important, phone call I had with the President of Ukraine,\u201d Trump wrote in the tweet. \u201cI am sure you will find it tantalizing!\u201d The Republican National Committee reportedly plans to hold its 2020 winter meeting at Trump National Doral, the same Florida resort where the Trump administration initially planned to hold the G-7 summit. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced during a press conference last month that the G-7 summit would be held at the Miami resort, but the administration quickly reversed that decision amid a flurry of backlash from Democrats and Republicans. Senator Bernie Sanders and representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are holding a press conference on Capitol Hill calling for a \u201cGreen New Deal for Housing.\u201d The public housing plan is the first major policy proposed under the broader \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d that Ocasio-Cortez has championed. Presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro has officially failed to qualify for the November debate, according to an announcement from the Democratic National Committee listing the participants in next week\u2019s event. Castro was widely expected to miss the Nov. 20 debate, as he had seemingly failed to meet the polling qualification laid out by the DNC despite crossing the donor threshold. Castro will be the only candidate from the October debate not participating -- with the exception of Beto O\u2019Rourke, who suspended his campaign earlier this month. The news comes days after reports emerged that Castro was laying off employees in New Hampshire and South Carolina while supporting staffers to look for other jobs. Former president Bill Clinton called into CNN to offer his thoughts on the school shooting in California and the House impeachment inquiry against Trump. Clinton, the last president to sign major gun-control legislation, accused Republicans of burying their hands in the sand on the issue. \u201cBut at some point, denial is no longer an option,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThe Congress is basically in denial of the consequences of doing nothing, or at least the people who are opposed to it.\u201d On the question of the inquiry, Clinton, who was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate, encouraged Trump to focus on governing. \u201cYou got hired to do a job,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cEvery day\u2019s an opportunity to make something good happen.\u201d Matt Bevin, the Republican governor of Kentucky who narrowly lost his reelection race last week, has finally conceded to Democrat Andy Beshear. Final results showed that Bevin, the most unpopular governor in the country, lost to Beshear by just 5,000 votes or 0.4 percent. Bevin announced in a press conference today that he would not contest those results. Trump campaigned for Bevin in Kentucky, a state the president won by 30 points in 2016, but the visit was not enough to help the unpopular governor win another term in the deeply conservative state. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has launched his first statewide radio ad in South Carolina, part of a $2 million media investment in the early voting state. \u201cThis country cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump,\u201d the Indiana mayor says in the ad. \u201cWe know that he is going to do everything he can to hold onto power. But if you nominate me, his playbook isn\u2019t going to work this time around.\u201d Buttigieg has surged in the largely white states of Iowa and New Hampshire, but he has struggled to break through in South Carolina, which has a much larger African-American electorate. A recent Monmouth University poll put Buttigieg\u2019s support in South Carolina at just 3 percent, with only 1 percent of African-American voters saying they back his White House bid. Mitt Romney was asked by a Capitol Hill reporter for his thoughts on Deval Patrick, another former Massachusetts governor, entering the Democratic presidential primary. The Utah senator responded with a self-deprecating joke about his own failed presidential bid. \u201cDelusion runs deep in the veins of Massachusetts politicians thinking of running for president,\u201d Romney said. Democratic presidential candidates offered their prayers and condolences to the families affected by the mass shooting in southern California, while also demanding legislative action to curb gun violence. Kamala Harris, who serves as California\u2019s junior senator, said the shooting was evidence of how communities are being \u201cterrorized\u201d by gun violence. Other 2020 Democrats expressed dismay at children fearing their schools as gun-control legislation passed by the House languishes in the Senate. During her weekly press conference, Nancy Pelosi accused the president of bribery and appeared to also insult his intelligence. The House speaker was arguing Trump could defend himself in the impeachment inquiry by presenting evidence that contradicts the allegations Democrats have laid out. \u201cIf the president has something that is exculpatory -- Mr. President, that means you have anything that shows your innocence -- then he should make that known,\u201d Pelosi said, looking directly at the camera in the briefing room. \u201cSo far we haven\u2019t see that.\u201d In an interview with the Guardian, Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, said he thought Trump would remain loyal to him but joked he had \u201cinsurance\u201d in case he didn\u2019t. The Guardian\u2019s Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports: In a telephone interview with the Guardian, in response to a question about whether he was nervous that Trump might \u2018throw him under a bus\u2019 in the impeachment crisis, Giuliani said with a slight laugh: \u2018I\u2019m not, but I do have very, very good insurance, so if he does, all my hospital bills will be paid.\u2019 Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Mark Costello, who was also on the call then interjected: \u2018He\u2019s joking.\u2019 Whether it was a joke, or a veiled threat, Giuliani has emerged as a key player in the impeachment proceedings, which center on the question of whether the president sought to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Here\u2019s where the day stands: A shooter opened fire on a high school in southern California, reportedly killing at least one person. The tragedy comes as the White House has failed to put forth its promised proposals to curb gun violence. Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of bribery in the wake of yesterday\u2019s public impeachment hearing, saying the president dangled military assistance to Ukraine to pressure officials into investigating Joe Biden. A second staffer at the US embassy in Kyiv reportedly overheard Trump asking Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, about \u201cthe investigations\u201d in Ukraine. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Lloyd Blankfein, the senior chairman of Goldman Sachs who served as the investment bank\u2019s CEO until last year, criticized Elizabeth Warren after the Democratic presidential candidate released an ad slamming billionaires. The ad features four billionaires who have criticized Warren\u2019s proposals, including her plan to impose a wealth tax. The video specifically mentions the money Blankfein made during the Great Recession. \u201cVilification of people as a member of a group may be good for her campaign, not the country,\u201d Blankfein said in response to the ad. \u201cMaybe tribalism is just in her DNA,\u201d he added, apparently referencing Warren\u2019s past claims of Native American ancestry. The campaign manager of Trump\u2019s reelection bid said the president raised more than $3 million in the 24 hours after the start of the first public impeachment hearing. Trupm\u2019s reelection campaign sent out fundraising requests to supporters yesterday, seeking to capitalize on the widely publicized hearing. The president\u2019s campaign has previously bragged about raising money off the inquiry, but Democrats have also seen fundraising bumps from the investigation. A second staffer from the US embassy in Ukraine reportedly overheard Trump\u2019s July phone call with Gordon Sondland, in which the president asked the US ambassador to the EU about \u201cthe investigations\u201d in Ukraine. The AP reports: The July 26 call between Trump and Gordon Sondland was first described during testimony Wednesday by William B. Taylor Jr., the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Taylor said one of his staffers overhead the call while Sondland was in a restaurant the day after Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that triggered the House impeachment inquiry. The second diplomatic staffer also at the table was Suriya Jayanti, a foreign service officer based in Kyiv. A person briefed on what Jayanti overheard spoke to AP on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter currently under investigation. According to a number of reports, the first staffer Taylor identified as overhearing the call is David Holmes, who is scheduled to speak to impeachment investigators behind closed doors tomorrow. Trump promised after the August mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton that his administration would propose policies to curb gun violence. However, the president has yet to release any gun-control proposals, and he has reportedly abandoned the plan in recent weeks. The Washington Post reported earlier this month: Trump has been counseled by political advisers, including campaign manager Brad Parscale and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, that gun legislation could splinter his political coalition, which he needs to stick together for his reelection bid, particularly amid an impeachment battle. The president no longer asks about the issue, and aides from the Domestic Policy Council, once working on a plan with eight to 12 tenets, have moved on to other topics, according to aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private deliberations. A nearby hospital said it had received two patients in critical condition from the shooting at a high school near Los Angeles, with three more victims en route. The White House said Trump is monitoring updates from the shooting. \u201cThe President is monitoring the ongoing reports of a school shooting in Santa Clarita, CA,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cThe White House encourages all those in the area to follow the advice of local law enforcement and first responders.\u201d The shooting took place in California\u2019s 25th congressional district, which is currently lacking a House representative following the resignation of Katie Hill. At least three victims have been reported from a shooting at a high school near Los Angeles, and the attacker has reportedly not yet been arrested. NBC Los Angeles reports: There are at least three victims in a shooting Thursday morning at a high school in Santa Clarita, where the search continues for the shooter. Police and firefighters responded to Saugus High School, about 40 miles north of Los Angeles. Initial reports from the Los Angeles County Fire Department indicated there were seven victims. That figure was later revised to three victims. Details about the victims\u2019 conditions were not immediately available. Some of the victims are students. \u2018We have multiple victims down,\u2019 said Sgt. Bob Boese of the LA County Sheriff\u2019s Department. \u2018Our deputies are doing a systematic search of the campus, trying to locate the suspect.\u2019 Nancy Pelosi said the alleged actions of Trump in the Ukraine controversy are more alarming than those of former president Richard Nixon, who resigned over the Watergate scandal. \u201cThe cover-up makes what Nixon did look almost small,\u201d the House speaker said of the president\u2019s actions. \u201cAlmost small.\u201d Nixon attempted to cover up the fact that five men connected to his reelection campaign broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. Democrats are accusing the Trump White House of trying to conceal the details of the president\u2019s Ukraine call by unnecessarily placing it in a highly secure server. Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of attempting to bribe Ukraine to harm the electoral fortunes of one of his political rivals, Joe Biden. In recent days, Democrats have moved away from the language of \u201cquid pro quo\u201d and toward the term \u201cbribery\u201d to describe the alleged efforts by the president\u2019s team to pressure Ukraine to announce an investigation into Biden and the 2016 election. \u201cI am saying what the president has admitted to and said it\u2019s perfect, I say it\u2019s perfectly wrong,\u201d Pelosi asserted. \u201cIt\u2019s bribery.\u201d Asked to define the bribery in this instance, the House speaker said, \u201cThe bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections. That\u2019s bribery.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi is now addressing reporters at her weekly press conference and offering some thoughts on the first public hearing in the impeachment hearing. The California Democrats said the hearing marked a \u201cvery somber, prayerful day.\u201d \u201cThe devastating testimony corroborated evidence of bribery,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe go forward sadly, prayerfully, with a heavy heart because it\u2019s not what we came here to do,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cBut we must.\u201d Don McGahn, Trump\u2019s former White House counsel who has refused to testify in congressional investigations, was spotted on Capitol Hill this morning. The White House has argued McGahn and other former officials cannot be compelled to testify because of executive privilege, but a federal judge expressed skepticism of that argument late last month. A number of senior House Democrats are calling for the resignation of Stephen Miller, a top adviser to Trump, after the uncovering of 2015 and 2016 emails in which Miller peddled material drawn from white nationalists to a writer at the far-right website Breitbart. The leaders of the congressional progressive caucus, the congressional black caucus, the congressional Hispanic caucus and the congressional Asian Pacific American caucus issued a joint statement demanding that Miller resign. \u201cWe feel like it is up to us to point out the obvious \u2014 someone who writes, talks, and governs like a white nationalist is in fact a white nationalist,\u201d the statement says. \u201cStephen Miller is a white nationalist and he has no business serving in the White House. ... As leaders in the Democratic Caucus, representing diverse constituencies who have been targeted by Stephen Miller\u2019s hateful beliefs, we call for his resignation without delay.\u201d Louise Linton, who is married to treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, has just shared an Instagram post criticizing the Trump administration\u2019s stance on big-game hunting. Linton was reacting to the story of a lion trophy from Tanzania that was approved for import to the United States. \u201cAmericans should not be permitted to kill exotic animals for fun!!\u201d Linton wrote in her Instagram caption. She went on to encourage her followers to contact their members of Congress about the Conserving Ecosystems by Ceasing the Importation of Large Animal Trophies (CECIL) Act, which would ban such imports. The Trump administration has previously said it would make decisions on big-game trophies on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis after the president split with his interior department on the issue. One lingering question over Deval Patrick\u2019s expected campaign announcement was how he would find experienced staffers to advise his White House bid, given that his opponents have already grabbed many of the most well-known names in Democratic politics. Patrick has at least partially answered that question by employing the former traveling press secretary to Beto O\u2019Rourke, who ended his bid earlier this month, as his campaign manager. It\u2019s become a popular take in Washington that \u201creal\u201d Americans do not care about the impeachment inquiry. However, front pages across the country today are carrying headlines about the inquiry\u2019s first public hearing. One of Deval Patrick\u2019s fellow Massachusetts Democrats, Elizabeth Warren, said earlier this week that the former governor\u2019s expected entry into the race would not complicate her own White House bid. \u201cI\u2019m out there talking to people every single day about an America that works great for those at the top, but just isn\u2019t working for most everybody else,\u201d Warren told the NPR affiliate WBUR. \u201cAnd whenever I do that, there are lots of folks who start to nod. And it\u2019s not just Democrats. It\u2019s Democrats, independents and Republicans who get it.\u201d Patrick is hoping Democratic primary voters are dissatisfied with their options, but it\u2019s possible that feeling may be exclusive to pundits and well-funded donors. As expected, former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick announced this morning that he would enter the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. In a video announcing his late entry, Patrick said, \u201cI admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field. ... But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time it\u2019s about the character of the country.\u201d Patrick will face a number of hurdles in trying to seize the Democratic nomination. For one thing, his opponents have had months to build support that he will now have to try to chip away at. And he does not have the personal fortune of billionaire Michael Bloomberg, another late-entry candidate, to bankroll his campaign. Patrick\u2019s resume also has some spots that he will likely be pressed on. After leaving the governor\u2019s mansion, he spent time working for Bain Capital, the private investment firm founded by former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. But perhaps the most baffling question about Patrick\u2019s candidacy is one of strategy. Patrick, who served as the first black governor of Massachusetts, is expected to focus his efforts on the early voting state of South Carolina, which has a large African-American electorate. But that was almost the exact same strategy initially pursued by senator Kamala Harris, and her campaign is now closing offices amid declining polling and fundraising numbers. Given Patrick\u2019s lower name recognition now that he has been out of office for several years, the question becomes: why would he succeed where she failed? Trump was weighing in on the first public impeachment hearing this morning, applauding one of his congressional allies for pressing Bill Taylor and George Kent on what the \u201cimpeachable\u201d element was in the president\u2019s communications with Ukraine. However, Taylor and Kent repeatedly emphasized that they were not there to make a case for impeachment. They said they considered themselves \u201cfact witnesses\u201d and were there to testify to the events they saw, while the ultimate question of impeachment would be left up to lawmakers. Despite that, Republicans on the House intelligence committee were eager to paint the two longtime public servants as Democratic pawns who were only there to unfairly smear the president. Good morning, live blog readers! We are right in between the first and second public hearings of the House impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, and Democrats and Republicans are already telling two very different stories about what happened yesterday. To Democrats, the testimony of Bill Taylor and George Kent more directly tied the president to efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate one of his political rivals, Joe Biden. To Republicans, the hearing was a waste of time and taxpayer dollars to hear from two diplomats who never spoke to Trump and did not hear his call with the Ukrainian president. One of Trump\u2019s advisers, Kellyanne Conway, was making the rounds on television this morning to make the argument that Taylor and Kent were like \u201ca bunch of gossip girls\u201d. Democrats and Republicans will likely dig their heels in more as additional hearings are held, but tomorrow\u2019s testimony from former US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch could help shape the opinion of the American public, which matters far more. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will meet with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg at 2pm ET before traveling to Louisiana for a campaign rally. Jury deliberations will begin in the trial of Roger Stone, a former Trump associate. House speaker Nancy Pelosi will hold a press conference at 10.45am ET. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Microsoft revealed a host of new Xbox and PC titles at its X019 fan event in London on Thursday night, including projects from Rare and Obsidian. The company also announced it would expand its xCloud game streaming service and its Xbox Game Pass subscription platform. The major game revelation was Everwild, a title from veteran studio Rare. With development being led by Louise O\u2019Connor, known for her work on the cult favourite Conker\u2019s Bad Fur Day, the project looks to be a mystical, woodland-set action adventure game, with a muted painterly art style reminiscent of Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. \u201cWhile Everwild is still early in development, we are very excited about the unique potential of the game we are creating,\u201d said Rare studio\u2019s head, Craig Duncan. \u201cThe Everwild team is focused on building an experience that allows for new ways to play in a natural and magical world.\u201d No release date was given. The role-playing adventure specialist Obsidian Entertainment showed off its next project, Grounded, a first-person cooperative survival game in which players are shrunk to the size of insects and have to survive in a garden, building protective forts and seeing off attacks from ants and spiders. Survivors must hunt for resources and craft weapons and tools while exploring the open environment. The French studio Dontnod unveiled Tell Me Why, an adventure about identical twins reuniting in the Alaskan town in which they grew up and tackling their difficult past. Microsoft also announced a range of deals with Japanese studios and publishers. Sega\u2019s acclaimed action titles Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 are all coming to Xbox One and Game Pass in early 2020, as are all the Final Fantasy titles from VII onwards. Among the 50-plus other titles announced for the service were Witcher 3, Wastelands 3 and Minecraft Dungeons \u2013 all arriving at the same time as they release on Xbox. The xCloud game streaming service \u2013 which will allow users to play Xbox games on their Android phones and other devices \u2013 is set to be launched in 2020 after this year\u2019s test phase. But there are still no details on how payment will work \u2013 whether a monthly subscription will be all that\u2019s required, or if users will also have to pay for most games, as with Google\u2019s Stadia. Fifty titles are being added to the xCloud roster, including Hitman, Just Cause 4 and Forza Horizon 4, and Windows 10 PCs will also be able to access the platform. Microsoft has a prototype of the service running on iPhone although there are no details on when it may arrive on Apple\u2019s devices. A wider range of controllers will be supported next year, too, including the PlayStation Dualshock. An interesting range of independent games was also announced. Publisher Annapurna Interactive revealed Last Stop, a supernatural adventure set in modern London, and the Swedish publisher Raw Fury showed gothic twin-gun rogue-like shooter West of Dead, starring Ron Perlman with a story by Fable co-creator Dene Carter.

      "bodyText": "The city of Christchurch has welcomed Behrouz Boochani with a civic reception and a traditional M\u0101ori mihi whakatau \u2013 a formal welcome \u2013 as his presence, and liberty, in New Zealand once again underscores the country\u2019s political differences with Australia over immigration. Boochani was formally greeted from the plane by the mayor of Christchurch and the city\u2019s M\u0101ori leaders, who told him he was welcomed by the mountains, the rivers, and the people of the city. The Kurdish Iranian refugee, elated but weary after a 34-hour journey across six timezones in the Asia-Pacific, thanked the people of NZ, saying it was \u201can honour to be here \u2026 and a reminder of kindness\u201d. For six years, NZ has had a standing offer to resettle 150 refugees from the offshore processing islands of Manus and Nauru each year, but that offer has been consistently rebuffed by Australia. The government MP Golriz Ghahraman, a member of the NZ Greens party and herself a former Kurdish refugee from Iran, said NZ was a nation that stood against \u201chate and division\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m just so proud that New Zealand gets to stand as the counterpoint to the kind of politics that has led to Australia\u2019s prison camps being in operation for so long,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a man like this, a human being \u2026 trapped for six years, and we get to be the country that stands for inclusion and for human rights and for freedom. \u201cFor Behrouz to be able to stand and be the voice of all of the people who are ignored and trapped right now is just incredible \u2026 [but] it is a reminder of how many others are trapped in refugee camps, in detention or in war.\u201d Asked if she had a message for the Australian government, Ghahraman said: \u201cclose the camps \u2026 they amount to torture. It\u2019s time the Australian government acts like a good international citizen.\u201d Lianne Dalziel, the mayor of Christchurch, welcomed Boochani to the city alongside Upoko Te Maire Tau, representing the Iwi of Christchurch, the Ng\u0101i Tahu. Dalziel said her city, traumatised by the mosque shootings in March, remained committed to multiculturalism and to welcoming people from all over the world. The mayor was immigration minister in the NZ government during Australia\u2019s Tampa crisis of 2001. A significant proportion of the asylum seekers on that ship turned away by Australia were ultimately resettled in NZ. \u201cI don\u2019t support the idea that people are basically put in detention and left forever with no option other than to return to certain death or imprisonment, or to remain virtually imprisoned on an island,\u201d Dalziel said. \u201cI understand why people would want to have a reaction to the people smugglers, the traders in human misery \u2026 but I don\u2019t think that that can be a reason for overriding people\u2019s human rights.\u201d Amnesty International\u2019s NZ executive director, Meg de Ronde, said Boochani\u2019s liberty was a reminder that 500 men, women and children remained held within Australia\u2019s offshore detention regime. \u201cThis is a glimmer of hope for all of those men, women and children who are still trapped in offshore detention,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have Behrouz Boochani set foot in New Zealand it really shows up the Australian government\u2019s really torturous regime for what it really is.\u201d Boochani\u2019s future remains unclear. He has a one-month visa for New Zealand, and will appear at the Word Christchurch festival this month. Asked directly whether he would consider applying for asylum in New Zealand, he demurred. \u201cI want to be free just for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a writer, nothing else. I don\u2019t want to be a part of a process for a while. I don\u2019t want to answer that question now.\u201d He did say he hoped NZ might consider extending his visa for an additional month. Boochani, technically, has been accepted for resettlement in the US under Australia\u2019s \u201crefugee swap\u201d deal with America. But his flight to NZ might lead to that offer being withdrawn. Other refugees who have escaped Manus have sought \u2013 and won \u2013 asylum in Europe, while others have been privately sponsored to resettle in Canada. The multiple award-winning writer has vowed he will never submit to Australia\u2019s offshore regime again, but he will continue to advocate for those who remain held within it. Nearly 50 men were being held without sufficient food or medication, he said, and with almost no communication with the outside world, in dire circumstances in Bomana prison in Papua New Guinea. \u201cIf they continue to keep them there, more people will die.\u201d Australia\u2019s hardline policy of deporting foreign nationals who serve prison sentences \u2013 regardless of whether their connection to their country of nationality is tenuous or historic or was juvenile \u2013 has deeply angered NZ and other Pacific nations who argue that Australia is bullying regional neighbours by dumping unwanted people with no support or assistance.",

I very much doubt I\u2019ll vote.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked whether he had ever not voted before, he replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I did spoil a paper in 1992.

And what of a Labour majority? The answer will not be welcomed by Jeremy Corbyn: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The chances of a Labour majority are as close to zero as it is possible to be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said the issues for Labour included Corbyn\u2019s personal unpopularity with voters (although he also noted that Johnson was \u201cthe most unpopular new prime minister in polling history\u201d), and the fact that they had lost both remain and leave votes through a middle-ground approach to Brexit. Curtice said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Where they have demonstrated Blairite moderation is the one issue on which you shouldn\u2019t demonstrate Blairite moderation, as it won\u2019t get you anywhere.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The current Tory lead of about 10 percentage points would most likely be enough for Boris Johnson, Curtice said.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With a 10-point lead, however you look at it, if that was to transpire in the ballot box it would be highly likely the Conservatives would win a majority of a size that would be sufficient to get the withdrawal treaty through.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But given the likelihood the Tories will lose a \u201cfair chunk\u201d of seats in Scotland and to the Lib Dems, Johnson needed to keep the lead above about six or seven percentage points: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If it get below that, the odds are beginning to swing in favour of a hung parliament. So be aware: just because the Tories are ahead in the polls, it doesn\u2019t mean to say that Boris is going to get a majority.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The key battle in northern Tory target seats, he said, would be for the Conservatives to hang on to gains made by Theresa May in 2017, and for the Lib Dems to take seats from Labour. Curtice said: \u201cBoris Johnson would love the Liberal Democrats to go up.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The one exception to the binary end point, he noted, would be the very particular result where the Tories won 320 or so seats, just below a working majority, and the DUP held the balance. With the Northern Irish party wanting neither to support Corbyn or back Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, this could bring a new deadlock.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1746b53d29bb9afc4dc24bc16357500a5b5a19b7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1746b53d29bb9afc4dc24bc16357500a5b5a19b7/0_0_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Sir John Curtice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Sir John Curtice.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Hunter/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-14T14:13:05.379Z\">at 2.13pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dcd51048f083559fb1cb362\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-14T13:16:32.712Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>According to the Press Association, which had a pool reporter accompanying Boris Johnson when he visited West Monkton primary school, near Taunton, Johnson held Rosie the rabbit and sang songs with pupils.</p> \n  <p>The PM then suggested singing The Wheels on the Bus, remarking: \u201cThe wheels are staying very much on the bus.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4f09a2280f559350fba81eb70e6fb545a3a7374\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4f09a2280f559350fba81eb70e6fb545a3a7374/0_272_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson holding Rosie the rabbit during a visit to West Monkton primary school in Taunton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson holding Rosie the rabbit during a visit to West Monkton primary school in Taunton.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>According to PA, Johnson asked a separate group of pupils for their favourite book before asking: \u201cHave you got the Incredible Hulk?

This means that levels of net migration would more than treble if Labour introduced their proposals for completely open borders.</p> \n   <p>This analysis is deliberately cautious and is likely to provide a significant underestimate of net inflows from non-EEA countries under Labour\u2019s plans.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This claim is that it is based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/25/labour-members-back-motion-give-all-uk-residents-full-voting-rights\">a motion passed at Labour party\u2019s conference.</a> But there are two problems with citing it as evidence that Labour would allow annual net immigration to rise to 840,000 a year. First, the wording of the motion was very generalised (the full text is <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2019/09/labour-conference-approves-motion-to-extend-free-movement/\">here)</a>, and it was not clear what it would mean in practice. And, second, Labour is only committed to implementing policies in its manifesto, not motions passed at conference.</p> \n  <p>Today Labour is arguing that, when the conference motion demanded a manifesto pledge to \u201cmaintain and extend free movement rights\u201d, this was not a reference to allowing non-EU nationals to come and live in the UK freely. \u201cThere was no mention [in the motion] of geographically extending freedom of movement to other countries,\u201d a party source said. Instead this was a reference to extending the rights that already apply to British citizens and others with the right to live in the UK, for example by making it easier for spouses to join them, the source argued.</p> \n  <p>This may be a fair way to interpret the motion passed by Labour conference, but this is not a point that the party made particularly forcefully at the time.</p> \n  <p>Today Labour has dismissed the Tory claims as \u201cfake news\u201d. In a statement <strong>Diane Abbott</strong>, the shadow home secretary, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is more fake news from the Conservative party\u2019s make-believe research department. Unlike the Tories we won\u2019t scapegoat migrants or deport our own Windrush generation citizens. The damage done to our society has been through damaging Conservative cuts to our public services, not by EU nationals coming to work in them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What is true, though, is that Labour has yet to say what its immigration policy would be. Jeremy Corbyn and others have said things that imply that they would like to keep free movement for EU nationals after Brexit, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/05/general-election-news-latest-corbyn-brexit-speech-gove-says-labours-claim-uk-us-trade-deal-cost-cost-nhs-500m-per-week-nonsense-live-news?page=with:block-5dc169058f08c2d1f80d9f9d#block-5dc169058f08c2d1f80d9f9d\">during the campaign Corbyn has tended to sidestep questions about what Labour\u2019s exact policy will be</a>, saying details will be given in the manifesto. But Labour does want to negotiate a soft version of Brexit with the EU, keeping the UK aligned to the single market, and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has admitted that negotiating this would involve a negotiation about whether or not the UK would maintain EU free movement rules.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-14T09:45:11.663Z\">at 9.45am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dcd11c38f083559fb1cb10a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-14T08:41:23.350Z\">8.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver.</p> \n  <p><strong>Brandon Lewis</strong>, the Home Office minister, is now being interviewed on Today.

In the texts given to journalists, Johnson likened Labour\u2019s approach to spending, Brexit and Scottish independence to <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/12/boris-johnson-to-promise-end-to-brexit-groundhoggery-in-first-stump-speech\">\u201cself-obsession and onanism</a>\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But when Johnson delivered the speech the word onanism was left out. Asked about the omission by the Sun\u2019s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, Johnson tried to laugh it off.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cAll I can say is that a stray early draft seems to have somehow found its way into your otherwise peerless copy, by a process that I don\u2019t pretend to understand, but I will make inquiries.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Reports of the pre-briefed version of the speech led to a spike in Google searches for the arcane term for masturbation.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-14T06:47:42.010Z\">at 6.47am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dccf17b8f083559fb1cb07a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-14T06:24:03.084Z\">6.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Conservatives to \u2018reduce immigration overall\u2019, promises Priti Patel</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The home secretary, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Priti Patel,</strong> has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/conservatives-pledge-to-cut-overall-immigration\">promised that a Conservative government would reduce immigration overall</a>, in an attack on Labour\u2019s immigration policy.</p> \n  <p>Patel criticised Labour\u2019s immigration policy, which has not been announced yet, saying:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Under Corbyn\u2019s Labour, immigration would surge and put huge strain on schools and our NHS.

The Lib Dems and Labour will use it to announce <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/13/equal-pay-election-rivals-set-out-plans-to-target-gender-pay-gap\">measures to tackle the gender pay gap</a>. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to oblige bigger companies to publish data on employment levels by gender, as well as for BAME and LGBT staff, and would push for a law to end the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/jan/22/gender-based-pink-taxes-women\">so-called pink tax</a>, whereby companies charge higher prices for fundamentally identical products such as razors or deodorants simply because they are marketed at women. <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/gender-pay-gap-labour-women\">Labour has pledged to eradicate the gender pay gap</a> by 2030 through measures such as fines for organisations that fail to report on the subject, and by extending the reporting requirement from firms with 250 or more employees to those with more than 50.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/environment/2019/nov/13/boris-johnson-refuses-to-apologise-for-slow-response-to-england-floods\">Boris Johnson has come under fire for his government\u2019s slow response</a> to the flooding across parts of England\u2019s north and has declined to apologise, saying a huge amount of work was going on to help and compensate victims. The PM spent time in deluged regions of Yorkshire, the east Midlands and Lincolnshire on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>Corbyn has criticised the government, saying its spending on flood defences until 2021 \u201cheavily favours London and the south-east of England\u201d. Richard Partington has fact-checked this claim, and while it is technically true, those figures are <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/13/does-the-government-spend-more-on-flood-defences-for-the-south\">seriously influenced by long-term funding</a> for Thames estuary projects running up to 2100.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re now going to close our live blog, but here are the main political developments of the day: In what might well be the most eye-catching pledge of the election campaign yet, Labour promised free full-fibre broadband for every home and business by part-nationalising BT. The party said the policy, estimated to cost around \u00a320bn, would be partly paid for by high taxes on internet companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. The Conservatives criticised the policy, saying it was a \u201cfantasy plan to effectively nationalise broadband [that] would cost hardworking taxpayers tens of billions\u201d. A string of public figures have declared they will not vote for Labour due to its association with antisemitism. Authors John Le Carr\u00e9 and William Boyd were among two dozen signatories of a letter published in the Guardian which cites fears of effectively surrendering the fight against antisemitism. The Brexit party claimed that senior figures within their ranks including former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe and its candidate in Peterborough Mike Greene were offered post-election roles by the Tories in exchange for stepping aside. The allegations were vociferously denied by the Tories. A spokesman said: \u201cNeither the Conservative party, nor its officials have offered Brexit party candidates jobs or peerages. We don\u2019t do electoral pacts - our pact is with the British people.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn said people should be allowed to reunite with their families and stressed the necessity of inward immigration to the UK due to skills shortages. The Labour leader ruled out imposing what he described as \u201carbitrary\u201d net migration targets after successive failures to achieve them. His comments came after the Home Secretary Priti Patel appeared to retreat from a Tory pledge issued overnight to \u201creduce immigration overall\u201d. By this afternoon she seemed to water down that commitment (see 3.52pm). Meanwhile prime minister Boris Johnson said he welcomed \u201cpeople of talent\u201d migrating to the UK but that he was \u201calso in favour of control\u201d. Fake nurse! The Labour party in Wales withdrew a party election broadcast after it emerged that a nurse featured in the video who criticised the Conservative party was an actor. The Liberal Democrats dismissed suggestions (see 8.53pm) that the party has put itself before the national interest in fielding a replacement candidate in Canterbury (see 7.21pm) and in contesting the South West Hertfordshire seat where pro-Remain former minister David Gauke is running as an independent. Earlier, my colleague Andrew Sparrow summed up the day\u2019s events up until the late afternoon (see 6.06pm). Thanks for joining us, and for all your comments. The announcement, one of the most significant of the campaign so far, is now leading the major news channels. However, Jim Pickard from the Financial Times has rightly highlighted the apparent inconsistency between John McDonnell\u2019s claim in July that the nationalisation of the water companies was \u201cthe limit of [Labour\u2019s] ambition when it comes to nationalisation\u201d and the pledge this evening. He had promised in an interview with the Sunday Times that \u201cThere are no tricks up my sleeve\u201d, that Labour had no plans to nationalise companies such as BT and would limit takeovers to power networks, Royal Mail, rail and water companies. Nicky Morgan, the outgoing culture secretary, has dismissed Labour\u2019s pledge to provide free Wi-Fi as \u201creckless\u201d and claimed it was part of an effort to distract from the party\u2019s divisions over Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s fantasy plan to effectively nationalise broadband would cost hardworking taxpayers tens of billions. Corbyn is so clearly trying to distract from his party\u2019s divisions on Brexit and immigration that he will promise anything, regardless of the cost to taxpayers and whether it can actually be delivered. What reckless idea will be next? Of course, the policy would indeed technically cost taxpayers billions, but according to Labour it would be delivered without raising taxes for individuals. And here\u2019s some more reaction to the eye-catching policy pledge. A new tax on Big Tech companies including Facebook, Google and Amazon would help fund Labour\u2019s plans to provide homes and businesses with free internet connections, while the part of BT responsible for broadband would also be taken under public ownership. A new British Broadband public service would boost 5G connectivity and deliver fast full-fibre internet across the country, where parts have poor internet connections, the party said. If in government, it would aim to deliver the service at no cost to members of the public by 2030 after integrating the broadband-relevant parts of BT into the new public entity. Jeremy Corbyn will make the announcement in Lancaster on Friday where is expected to describe the new free public service as central to his plans to transform the country and economy. The rollout would begin with communities which have the worst broadband access, including rural and remote communities and some inner city-areas, followed by towns and smaller centres, and then lastly by areas currently well served by super-fast or ultrafast broadband. Labour said it will be paid for through the party\u2019s \u201cGreen Transformation fund\u201d and the greater taxation of corporations, adding that it will save the average person \u00a330.30 a month. There would be a one-off capital cost to rollout the full-fibre network of \u00a315.3 billion, in addition to the government\u2019s existing and not yet spent \u00a35 billion commitment. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is expected to say that the plans represented \u201cpublic ownership for the future\u201d and would challenge \u201crip-off \u2018out-of-contract pricing\u201d. He told the Mirror: We\u2019re dramatically falling behind. The future of our economy has got to be based on the fourth industrial revolution and new technology and artificial intelligence. In some areas it\u2019s quite clear it\u2019s holding back the local economy. We\u2019re falling behind our international competitors when it comes to the roll out of broadband. It\u2019s the basic form of communication and where the jobs will come from in future. In the smaller towns and coastal communities, the same message comes up: we\u2019re being held up by our transport connections and our broadband connections. This will also transform rural economies. Cat Hobbs, director of campaign group We Own It, also told the paper: It\u2019s absolutely clear that privatisation is bad deal for the public purse, and for our public services. We\u2019re wasting billions on shareholder dividends and the higher cost of investment in the private sector. By bringing our services into public ownership, we could use that money to deliver better services for all of us. David Lammy has accused the prime minister of not knowing the words to \u201cThe wheels on the bus\u201d after he appeared to initially falter when singing part of the popular nursery rhyme. Boris Johnson mentioned his visit to a school in Taunton during his round up of his day\u2019s exploits only to say that he discussed education funding. Here\u2019s a bit more from the Labour rally in Edinburgh. Holding off from committing to specific new policies, Jeremy Corbyn did not address demands for Scottish independence either. Fundamentally our message is one of social justice, social justice that brings a sense of decency to people\u2019s lives. That is foremost what we would do. Somebody asked me the other day you would like to do when you go into office on December 13. Lots of things, hundreds of things, I could ask all of you what your priority would be and we would probably come up with lots of things different things. I just thought for a second or two, and I thought the thing I would really like to do is use the power of government, the power of office to end rough sleeping homelessness once and for all. He also repeated his pledge that a Labour government would establish a department of employment rights to \u201cguarantee from day one of your employment you have got full rights at work, including the right to join a trade union\u201d. Meanwhile, the SNP\u2019s logo and a slogan saying \u201cEscape Brexit\u201d was projected onto the facade of McEwan Hall in Edinburgh. Brexit party officials are now claiming that senior figures within their ranks including former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe and its candidate in Peterborough Mike Greene were offered post-election roles. In a video directly uploaded to YouTube, party leader Nigel Farage said: They then tried something that borders on corruption. Repeatedly, it\u2019s been suggested to me that I might like a seat in the House of Lords so I can go quietly. Every time this gets said my answer is the same: I\u2019m not for sale. I\u2019m not interested. Knowing they couldn\u2019t buy me off, there was a concerted attempt from people who work deep inside No 10 Downing Street \u2013 and I\u2019m not blaming Boris for this, I don\u2019t believe he would be part of this but it shows you the calibre of people he\u2019s got around him, the culture that exists in Westminster. He bypassed me and went to other senior figures in the Brexit party suggesting that eight of them could go in the House of Lords and all they had to do was come to Nigel and convince him to stand down in a whole load more marginal seats. As you can imagine, I said I do not want, and will never have anything to do with, this kind of behaviour. At a rally tonight, Farage has also demanded the House of Lords is abolished to prevent people being \u201cbrought off\u201d. And some light relief from the Guardian\u2019s sketch writer John Crace. My colleague Severin Carrell is reporting from a Labour rally in Edinburgh where Jeremy Corbyn has announced the party\u2019s manifesto will be \u201cbigger, better and - I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m pleased to say it - longer than the last one\u201d Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard earlier criticised the Scottish National party for what he claimed was a contradictory position in supporting unity in Europe but division in the UK. However, Nicola Sturgeon predicted earlier today that Corbyn would soon back her call for a Scottish independence vote in 2020 after he appeared to soften a commitment made to journalists on Wednesday that such a referendum would not take place during Labour\u2019s first hypothetical five years in power. Brexit party chairman Richard Tice has hit out at the Conservative party and re-stoked the row (see 4.34pm) over whether the Tories offered \u201cjobs and titles\u201d to his party\u2019s candidates standing in Labour-held seats. Since our decision to stand down more than half our candidates for the good of this country, we have been dismayed by the behaviour of senior Conservative Party figures. Our people have been offered jobs and titles to stand down as candidates on the last day of nominations, as part of a concerted campaign to undermine our party. We made a unilateral gesture which should prevent a second referendum and keep Boris Johnson in office. We are proud and grateful that our candidates have resisted these distasteful overtures and stood firm. A Tory spokesman said Brexit party candidates had not been offered peerages. Neither the Conservative Party, nor its officials have offered Brexit Party candidates jobs or peerages. We don\u2019t do electoral pacts - our pact is with the British people. The only way to get Brexit done and unleash Britain\u2019s potential is to vote for your local Conservative candidate, otherwise the country runs the risk of another deadlocked Parliament, or even worse a Labour/SNP coalition led by Jeremy Corbyn who would subject Britain to two referendums in 2020. Earlier, Brexit party candidate Rupert Lowe \u2013 the former Southampton FC chairman \u2013 announced that he was not going to contest the election in Dudley North for fear of enabling a Labour victory (see 4.46pm). Chuka Umunna, the Liberal Democrat economics spokesperson, has been fielding accusations that his party has put itself before the national interest in fielding a replacement candidate in Canterbury (see 7.21pm) and in contesting the South West Hertfordshire seat where pro-Remain former minister David Gauke is running as an independent. He criticised the party\u2019s former candidate in the constituency, journalist Tim Walker, for acting unreasonably and said there must be \u201creciprocity\u201d among parties if candidates are to step aside. Let\u2019s take a look at the facts. We want to stop Brexit, we are the UK\u2019s biggest and strongest remain party. We have agreed unprecedented arrangements \u2026 I can\u2019t think of any other instance where one of the main parties in the UK has stood aside in an election for other parties in a number of seats. These arrangements can only work where you have a party that is committed to remaining in the European Union. The Labour party has been steadfast in saying it is not a Remain party. But also, if you do these arrangements, there needs to be reciprocity. The problem with what [Tim Walker] did there was that he took a unilateral decision and you operate as part of a team. You are a candidate for a political party. He didn\u2019t consult anybody about that decision. That would be like you [the interviewer] announcing that you\u2019re going to defect to CNN live on air before actually talking to your employers. That\u2019s obviously not a reasonable way to conduct yourself. A string of public figures have declared they will not vote for Labour due to its association with antisemitism. Authors John Le Carr\u00e9 and William Boyd are among two dozen signatories of a letter published in the Guardian which cites fears of effectively surrendering the fight against antisemitism. The Labour party in Wales has withdrawn a party election broadcast after it emerged that a nurse featured in the video who criticised the Conservative party was an actor. My colleagues Lisa O\u2019Carroll and Pamela Duncan have the story In the film, which was broadcast on Tuesday on the BBC, ITV and S4C, the nurse tells viewers how a trade deal with US president Donald Trump is a threat to the NHS. The actor, dressed in a blue NHS style uniform, told viewers: \u201cWe will increase the funding available to our health service. Labour is the party that created the NHS, and we will defend it against Tory attempts to sell it off for parts to Donald Trump.\u201d Labour said it was not aware that the nurse was fake until someone pointed out she was an actor, in contravention of the guidelines for such broadcasts. Plaid Cymru branded the advert \u201cfake\u201d and attacked the Labour party\u2019s record on the NHS in Wales. The Green party in Canterbury has announced it will not stand a candidate in the marginal seat where pro-Remain Labour MP Rosie Duffield is defending a wafer-thin majority against the Tories. It comes after the Liberal Democrat candidate unilaterally stood down yesterday, citing fears of dividing the remain vote despite not trusting Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit. Green Party spokesperson Henry Stanton said: The Green Party - unlike other political parties - places local democracy and local parties at the heart of its operations. In this instance, members voted not to stand a general election candidate... The local party will instead be focussing efforts on campaigning to save the Wincheap wet woodland and water meadows, improve public transport and clean up Canterbury and Whitstable\u2019s dirty air. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was forced to deny losing control over her party on Wednesday after Tim Walker suddenly announced he was standing aside in an article for the Guardian. The party \u2013 which came a distant but respectable third in 2017 \u2013 swiftly installed an outside candidate, Claire Malcolmson, a councillor in Surrey, to replace him. Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster has confirmed her party will run 17 candidates across the 18 constituencies in Northern Ireland, with none of the major parties contesting all seats due to a unionist electoral pact and pro-Remain agreements. Foster also criticised Sinn Fein over the party\u2019s historic decision to not to take up seats in Westminster, which is due to their principled refusal to \u201cvalidate British sovereignty over the island of Ireland\u201d. This will be a close election. It\u2019s about who has a plan to deliver for Northern Ireland. The DUP has a strong team of candidates who have a plan to get Northern Ireland moving again. We will stand on our record as the only party to have delivered 1.5 billion more to support hospitals, schools, broadband and roads. Real investment in real lives. Sinn Fein want a mandate to do nothing. They won\u2019t take their seats in Westminster and won\u2019t let the other parties form an executive in Stormont. It\u2019s time to get Northern Ireland moving again. This is from PA Media: The Democratic Unionist Party is running in 17 constituencies, standing aside in Fermanagh South Tyrone in support of Ulster Unionist candidate Tom Elliott. Sinn Fein is running in 15 constituencies, and will not field candidates in South Belfast, East Belfast or North Down and will instead support pro-Remain candidates in those seats. Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist Party will run candidates in 16 constituencies. Alliance is the only political party that is running candidates in all 18 constituencies. At the last election, the DUP won 10 seats and Sinn Fein won seven, along with independent Sylvia Eileen. A total of 102 candidates will contest 18 constituencies across Northern Ireland at this year\u2019s General Election. Nominations closed on Thursday ahead of next month\u2019s polling day. Steve Aiken from the UUP had previously suggested the party would run in all of the region\u2019s 18 constituencies. He later rowed back from that position following pressure in North Belfast and from unionist rivals over standing a candidate against Democratic Unionist deputy leader Nigel Dodds, who is expected to face a tight race against Sinn Fein\u2019s John Finucane. The other constituency which the UUP will not run in is West Belfast, a seat which has traditionally been dominated by Sinn Fein with only a small unionist vote. Aiken also came under pressure for his party to stand aside in South Belfast where the DUP\u2019s Emma Little Pengelly is expected to come under pressure from SDLP candidate Claire Hanna. The Green Party has stepped aside in South Belfast for Hanna due to her Remain credentials. Meanwhile, the SDLP announced it has completed the nomination of the 15 candidates it will run. The party had previously said it was stepping aside in three constituencies in support of other remain candidates. Those are North Belfast, East Belfast and North Down. The Green Party is stepping aside in East, West and North Belfast in support of pro-remain candidates. Of the smaller parties, People Before Profit is running two candidates, the NI Conservative Party is contesting four seats and Aontu will stand candidates in seven constituencies. My colleague Jamie Grierson has debunked the Tories\u2019 claim that net migration would reach 840,000 under a Labour government. The Tories had said its analysis of Labour\u2019s conference proposals suggested net migration could increase to 840,000 a year under Corbyn, but the opposition party dismissed the \u201cfake news from the Conservative party\u2019s make-believe research department\u201d. The Guardian has been fact-checking claims made during the run-up to the general election. Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, has responded to the news that O\u2019Mara will not contest the Sheffield Hallam seat. She said his decision was \u201ca victory for women across the country\u201d and endorsed the Liberal Democrats in the constituency. The Women\u2019s Equality Party is the only political party that has won in four fifths of its target seats before a single vote has been cast. WE announced we would be standing against Jared O\u2019Mara to hold him to account at the ballot box, after he publicly admitted sexually harassing a 20-year-old staff member and has yet to face any consequences. He was one of five MPs we targeted and is now the fourth of those men to step down. This speaks to the enormous courage of survivors and campaigners who have spoken out against MPs facing allegations of abuse in this election. Our campaign has made it impossible for parties to continue to ignore abuse and for individual politicians facing unresolved allegations to continue as MPs. O\u2019Mara\u2019s decision is a victory not just for the constituents of Sheffield Hallam but for women across the country. However, this situation should never have been allowed to continue for so long. That\u2019s why the Women\u2019s Equality Party is pleased to be endorsing the Liberal Democrats in Sheffield Hallam in exchange for them taking on our key policies in their manifesto. The changes we are calling for in the Recall Act will give the public more power to sack their MPs, ensuring that constituents never end up in this situation again. Former Labour MP Jared O\u2019Mara will not stand in the general election, as expected, Sheffield Council has confirmed. He famously won the seat from former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg in 2017, and shall not defend the more than 2,000 majority he achieved in Labour\u2019s first ever victory in the constituency since it was established in 1885. Former aid worker Laura Gordon will look to prevent local councillor Olivia Blake from upholding Labour\u2019s majority, while the Conservatives\u2019 Ian Walker will fight the Sheffield Hallam seat for the third time after coming a respectable third at the last election. O\u2019Mara was accused by a junior staffer of sexual harassment after his suspension from the Labour party when a series of sexist and homophobic tweets emerged, written before he was elected. He had said he would be taking time out to deal with his mental health \u2013 he has autism and cerebral palsy \u2013 after a former aide accused him of being \u201cthe most disgustingly morally bankrupt person I have ever had the displeasure of working with\u201d. Please let everyone be assured that I will be tendering my resignation via the official parliamentary process as soon as term restarts. I am not in any fit state to continue and nor would that be appropriate if I was. I reiterate my apology to my constituents, the people of Sheffield and the people of the UK as whole. The European commission has said it is launching \u201cinfringement proceedings\u201d against the UK after the government refused to nominate a new British EU commissioner. This news only broke within the last few minutes, and the practical impact will probably turn out to be minimal or non-existent, but in symbolic or headline terms, this is probably a gift to Boris Johnson. For Tory leaders (and some Labour ones too) it has for years been taken as axiomatic that voters like to see their PM in a wrangle with Brussels (a flawed mindset that ultimately contributed to the Brexit vote) and now at last Johnson will be able to perform this role. Being in breach of EU treaties will go down better with his Brexiter base than sending the letter requesting an article 50 extension, something he did last month after promising he never would. In a statement the commission said: As the guardian of the treaties, the European commission has today sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom for breaching its EU treaty obligations by not suggesting a candidate for the post of EU commissioner. The UK authorities have until Friday 22 November at the latest to provide their views. This short time period is justified by the fact that the next commission must enter into office as soon as possible. Following the UK\u2019s reply on 13 November to the two letters sent by president-elect Ursula von der Leyen recalling the UK\u2019s obligations under the EU treaty - and the European council decision of 29 October 2019 extending the article 50 period (1) -, the commission has now analysed this reply and considers that the UK is in breach of its EU treaty obligations. The Conservatives have sought to brush aside new figures showing that A&amp;E waiting times are at their worst level for 15 years. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, claimed this was a byproduct of increased demand, and that the NHS is in some ways \u201cperforming better than it ever has\u201d, but for Labour this was essentially a free hit. Labour was placed on the defensive as the Tories launched an attack on its immigration policy. CCHQ issued a press notice claiming that Labour is committed to an open border policy, or \u201cfree movement\u201d for the whole world, and that as a result 840,000 people could come to the UK every year. CCHQ also said that, if Labour just maintained EU free movement, average net migration might be 260,000 every year for the next 10 years, or 2.6m in total over the next decade. Interestingly the press notice includes an implicit admission of the Tories\u2019 failure to meet their own immigration target (getting annual net migration below 100,000), because it says 260,000 per year would be a \u201cslight increase\u201d on current immigration levels. The claim that Labour would operate an open border policy is untrue and ludicrous, but Labour has not yet finalised its immigration policy and there is a tension between those in the party who backed a conference \u201cfree movement\u201d motion (the Momentum wing, crudely) and those who back immigration controls (the Unite wing, crudely). Jeremy Corbyn has said that he wants an immigration system that is \u201cfair\u201d. Boris Johnson said that he favoured \u201ccontrolled immigration\u201d and that in some circumstances this would mean net migration levels falling. He said: We want to have a controlled system ... And yes, that may mean in some sectors immigration comes down. Johnson has been accused of refusing to meet members of the public and running scared of protests during a visit to Somerset. The Tories have denied a claim from Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, that one of Johnson\u2019s most senior aides has been offering jobs to his candidates to get them to stand down in Tory target seats. Farage made his allegation as nominations closed, meaning it is now too late for parties to replace candidates who are standing down. After the 4pm deadline one Brexit party candidate in a ultra-marginal seat announced he would not contest the election because he wanted to help the Tories take it off Labour. Jeremy Corbyn has ruled out agreeing to a second Scottish independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Mattha Busby is writing the blog now. People should be allowed to reunite with their families, Jeremy Corbyn has said in an interview where he also stressed the necessity of inward immigration to the UK due to skills shortages. The Labour leader told the BBC that policymakers had to be realistic about the issues the country faces, and ruled out imposing what he described as \u201carbitrary\u201d net migration targets after successive failures to achieve the stated goal. We have to be realistic that in this country we have 40,000 nurse vacancies, we have a great shortage of doctors, we have shortages of many skills, and they cannot be met very quickly because we\u2019re not training enough people, so there\u2019s going to be immigration in the future. Pressed on whether he would rather see the number of migrants in the UK go up or go down, he said: As a point of principle I want people to be able to be reunited and I want British people to be able work across Europe as they are at the present time. Putting arbitrary figures on it as successive governments have done simply doesn\u2019t work. Our immigration strategy is based on fairness, justice and the economic needs of our society, and they are considerable. I have made my case very clear about the value of migration to our society, about the stability of people living in our society, about the horrors of the hostile environment created deliberately by Theresa May, and others, and the uncertainty that so many EU nationals have been put through. I think that uncertainty should finish, they should have guaranteed rights to remain in Britain. The BBC reports that Corbyn said Labour\u2019s eventual migration policy would depend on the outcome of Brexit. The party has, of course, promised a second referendum which could see the UK remain within the EU. I recognise why people voted Remain and why people voted Leave in different parts of the country and for different reasons - in my own communities where I represent and also all across the country. [But] I think that is actually a sensible approach that a very large number of people [have] come to think, well, at least somebody has been grown-up about this. Corbyn\u2019s comments come after the Home Secretary Priti Patel appeared to retreat from a Tory pledge issued overnight to \u201creduce immigration overall\u201d. By this afternoon she seemed to water down that commitment (see 3.52pm). The prime minister Boris Johnson also spoke to the BBC earlier where he welcomed \u201cpeople of talent\u201d migrating to the UK but said he was \u201calso in favour of control\u201d. The Labour party in Wales have withdrawn a party election broadcast after it emerged that a nurse featured in the video who criticised the Conservative party was an actress. In the film, which was broadcast on Tuesday on the BBC, ITV and S4C, the nurse tells viewers how a trade deal with US president Donald Trump is a threat to the NHS. Labour said the production company had used an actress without telling them and as soon as it was brought to its attention it withdrew the advert. It will not be working with the company in future, a spokesman said. The deadline for election candidates to be nominated was 4pm today. That means that, if a candidate now withdraws, it is too late for their party to replace them. And, right on cue, Rupert Lowe has announced that, despite being selected as the Brexit party candidate for Dudley North, he is not going to contest the election. Dudley North is a Labour/Tory marginal where Labour won by just 22 votes in 2017. The MP was Ian Austin, who left Labour to sit as an independent and who is now urging voters to back Boris Johnson. In a statement, Lowe says he cannot afford to take the risk of his candidature helping Labour win. In an interview with Sky News Jeremy Corbyn confirmed that the \u201cextend free movement\u201d motion passed at conference would not necessarily be included in full in the party\u2019s manifesto. The party\u2019s manifesto policy on immigration (and everything else) would be decided at a Clause V meeting of the party this weekend, he said. He went on: The conferences passes motions, and that is absolutely fine. The meeting that\u2019s held this weekend will decide what actually goes in the manifesto, which is not necessarily every last dot and comma of every resolution passed at conference. Tory sources are dismissing the Nigel Farage claim (see 4.20pm) as rubbish and \u201ctypical Farage attention-seeking\u201d. They may say something more specific later. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claims Sir Edward Lister, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief strategic adviser in No 10, has been calling Brexit party candidates offering them jobs if they stand down in target seats. I\u2019ve asked the Tories for a comment, and will post their reply when I get it. UPDATE: Tory sources are dismissing the Nigel Farage claim as rubbish and \u201ctypical Farage attention-seeking\u201d. They may say something more specific later. On the BBC\u2019s World at One Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that increasing demand was to a large extent responsible for A&amp;E waiting times in England being at their worst level for 15 years. Over the last five years the number of people going to A&amp;E had risen by a quarter, he said. \u201cParts of the system are responding extremely well,\u201d he insisted. He went on: In terms of getting operations done, there\u2019s been a 7% rise, so when people talk about the performance of the NHS, in many ways the NHS is performing better than it ever has. Jonathan Ashworth, his Labour shadow, said Hancock\u2019s response was \u201cstaggering\u201d. According to the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith, Priti Patel, the home secretary, did eventually confirm that the Tories went to reduce immigration in her broadcast interview. (See 3.52pm.) Boris Johnson labelled climate change protesters \u201ccrusties\u201d after security concerns forced him to change his election campaign visit to a bakery, the Press Association reports. Extinction Rebellion activists were positioned outside Burns The Bread in Glastonbury, Somerset, prompting a decision to divert the prime minister to one of the company\u2019s shops in Wells. At the shop in Wells Johnson commented on the change in plan, saying: \u201cThere were lots of crusties there - more crusty than your loaves.\u201d In a press notice overnight Priti Patel, the home secretary, said the Conservatives would \u201creduce immigration overall\u201d. But in an interview this afternoon she has appeared to back away from that pledge, according to the BBC\u2019s Callum May and Norman Smith. Scottish Labour strategists have armed Jeremy Corbyn with data on the numbers of people giving disability payments for mental illness and child poverty for each of the Westminster constituencies he has visited in Scotland. In an effort to switch the agenda from the harder territory of Brexit or Scottish independence on to core topics such as poverty, party officials have mined official data to produce fact sheets for Corbyn and Labour candidates to use in campaigning. Corbyn\u2019s two-day trip to Scotland, taking in key seats in Glasgow, Hamilton, Uddingston, Dundee and West Lothian, has been short on new policies but heavy in incident. He has been heckled by opponents, and tripped himself up on party policy on a Scottish independence referendum. But addressing the small crowds and audiences which gather at campaign stops, Corbyn reels off data on local poverty levels. Speaking at Newtongrange Scottish mining museum in Midlothian on Thursday, where Labour\u2019s Danielle Rowley won a shock victory in 2017, he lambasted the Conservatives and Lib Dems for their \u201cpolitical choice of imposing austerity on the whole of the UK \u2026 Nine years later we see the result of it.\u201d He said: In a constituency like this, which has almost 5,000 people in receipt of personal independence payments, almost 40% of those get it for what\u2019s called \u2018psychiatric disorders\u2019 \u2013 in reality it\u2019s mental health stress. When you have so many people suffering from mental health stress: then you ask yourself, why is that? Is it just one of those things, or is it because of insecurity in their lives? Insecurity in housing, insecurity in the private rented sector, poverty at home. Why are so many children living in poverty in this area? Why are 25% of the population in this constituency in fuel poverty? Are any of these things necessary? Why are 8,000 children living in poverty? Is any of this necessary? No. These are from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall, who has been out on the campaign trail. The Lib Dems published a plan for equalities and human rights at a new event this morning attended by Sal Brinton, the party president and two Lib Dem candidates who have joined from Labour, Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna. This is from the Jewish Chronicle\u2019s Lee Harpin who was there. Boris Johnson has an update on the flooding. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has been tweeting about Labour\u2019s stance on free movement. She confirms - as the party was saying earlier, see 9.45am - that Labour is not treating the \u201cextend free movement\u201d motion passed at conference in September as referring to maintaining free movement for everyone from EU countries after Brexit. It referred to \u201cfree movement rights\u201d, she says. But the Conservatives continue to clam that Labour actually go much further. Following up on the press release issued overnight (see 9.45am), Priti Patel, the home secretary, has released an open letter to Abbott saying party figures have consistently called for looser immigration rules. Patel quotes John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, saying in 2013: \u201cIf we\u2019re a civilised society, we should have open borders ... It should be a basic human right.\u201d But, of course, McDonnell wasn\u2019t shadow chancellor in 2013. At that point he was just a backbencher. My colleague Paul Johnson has detected something of a pattern in Boris Johnson\u2019s walkabouts around the country. The Brexit party leader Nigel Farage says he does not expect to vote in the general election. According to the Press Association, there will be no Brexit party candidate in the Tory-held Kent seat where he votes (presumably Sevenoaks, where he had his family home), and he does not want to vote Conservative. He told reporters: \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll vote. I very much doubt I\u2019ll vote.\u201d Asked whether he had ever not voted before, he replied: I did spoil a paper in 1992. I couldn\u2019t vote for John Major, I couldn\u2019t do it. My last Conservative vote was 1987. The BBC\u2019s Alex Forsyth has more on Boris Johnson\u2019s Glastonbury no-show. (See 1.56pm.) There were lively scenes in Glastonbury as Boris Johnson dodged a crowd of protesters at a bakery in a business park on the outskirts of the Somerset town. Word got out that Johnson was on his way and a crowd of about 100 \u2013 including Extinction Rebellion protesters, musicians and even a bard \u2013 turned up to greet him at the Burns the Bakery unit. It got tense when the police moved the crowd away from the front of the bakery on to a grass verge close to a busy road. Tory supporters including James Heappey, the party\u2019s candidate in Wells, waited at the bakery for Johnson for more than an hour, but he did not show. There was no explanation, leading to frustration and anger from those who had hoped to express their concerns about issues ranging from the climate emergency to the state of the NHS and pensions to the PM. Retired NHS manager Martin Campbell said: \u201cHe\u2019s running scared. He doesn\u2019t want to talk to ordinary people about the issues that affect us all.\u201d At one point a rumour went round that Johnson was in Glastonbury high street, leading to a dash from Burns the Bakery into the town but there was no sign there. A video clip later appeared on Johnson\u2019s Facebook page of him serving a customer at a Burns the Bread shop, though not at either of the company\u2019s two branches in Glastonbury. In an interview this morning in Scotland Jeremy Corbyn said he rejected the claim from Donald Tusk, the outgoing European council president, that Britain will become a \u201csecond-rate player\u201d if it leaves the EU. Asked if he agreed, he replied: No I don\u2019t think we are ever going to be a second-rate player. This is a big country, an important country and trading partner and I look forward to leading a government that will be working with others around the world. [Tusk] makes many statements at many times and he is the president of the EU and, yes, he can make those statements and I look forward to discussing them with him. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh has got hold of a briefing note from Momentum, the pro-Corbyn Labour group, advising activists how to respond to awkward questions on the doorstep. We have received a briefing from the monarch of UK psephologists, Prof Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University, about what might happen in the election, and the short version is this: while there are many imponderables in play, it seems a toss-up between a Boris Johnson majority and a hung parliament. Curtice said it was \u201cpretty much a binary contest\u201d between the two. And what of a Labour majority? The answer will not be welcomed by Jeremy Corbyn: The chances of a Labour majority are as close to zero as it is possible to be. He said the issues for Labour included Corbyn\u2019s personal unpopularity with voters (although he also noted that Johnson was \u201cthe most unpopular new prime minister in polling history\u201d), and the fact that they had lost both remain and leave votes through a middle-ground approach to Brexit. Curtice said: Where they have demonstrated Blairite moderation is the one issue on which you shouldn\u2019t demonstrate Blairite moderation, as it won\u2019t get you anywhere. The current Tory lead of about 10 percentage points would most likely be enough for Boris Johnson, Curtice said. With a 10-point lead, however you look at it, if that was to transpire in the ballot box it would be highly likely the Conservatives would win a majority of a size that would be sufficient to get the withdrawal treaty through. But given the likelihood the Tories will lose a \u201cfair chunk\u201d of seats in Scotland and to the Lib Dems, Johnson needed to keep the lead above about six or seven percentage points: If it get below that, the odds are beginning to swing in favour of a hung parliament. So be aware: just because the Tories are ahead in the polls, it doesn\u2019t mean to say that Boris is going to get a majority. The key battle in northern Tory target seats, he said, would be for the Conservatives to hang on to gains made by Theresa May in 2017, and for the Lib Dems to take seats from Labour. Curtice said: \u201cBoris Johnson would love the Liberal Democrats to go up.\u201d The one exception to the binary end point, he noted, would be the very particular result where the Tories won 320 or so seats, just below a working majority, and the DUP held the balance. With the Northern Irish party wanting neither to support Corbyn or back Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, this could bring a new deadlock. According to the Press Association, which had a pool reporter accompanying Boris Johnson when he visited West Monkton primary school, near Taunton, Johnson held Rosie the rabbit and sang songs with pupils. The PM then suggested singing The Wheels on the Bus, remarking: \u201cThe wheels are staying very much on the bus.\u201d According to PA, Johnson asked a separate group of pupils for their favourite book before asking: \u201cHave you got the Incredible Hulk? That\u2019s the one I like.\u201d In a newspaper article in the autumn Johnson famously compared himself, or the UK as a whole, to the Incredible Hulk. Then he ended up talking about breasts. As PA reports, while looking at a Hulk book, one pupil shouted \u201cboobies\u201d to which the PM replied: \u201cThose aren\u2019t boobies, they are muscles.\u201d While Johnson was inside the school, chants of \u201cBoris out\u201d could be heard outside, where Labour, Liberal Democrat and climate change activists were gathered. Jeremy Corbyn is now saying that he would not agree to a Scottish independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government - which would rule out one being held in 2020 or 2021. This is a change from what Corbyn was saying at one point yesterday, when he was ruling it out for the entire five years of a Labour government, although the party subsequently said it would be open to one after the Holyrood elections in spring 2021 (which, given the amount of time preparing for a referendum might take, would be close to saying 2023 at the earliest). In response, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has posted this on Twitter. My colleague Steven Morris says it is starting to look as if Boris Johnson might be giving Glastonbury a miss after all. Boris Johnson is due in Glastonbury shortly. According to my colleague Steven Morris, who is there, not everyone wants to give him a warm welcome. Here is some footage of Jeremy Corbyn being confronted by a heckler at a meeting in Dundee. (See 10.53am.) According to the Press Association, the heckler later identified himself as Bob Costello, a former SNP activist. It is often assumed that being heckled reflects badly on a politician, but it is hard to watch this and think that Costello emerges with much credit. \u201cIs this democracy?\u201d he shouted at one point, during his prolonged interruption of proceeding. Corbyn replied: The democracy is that we have a public meeting where we conduct it in a reasonable manner, and those who wish to say something at the end are of course free to do so. Democracy is not when you interrupt somebody when they are speaking. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, had to delete a tweet this morning saying he would be \u201clive from South Yorkshire\u201d when he was in Hull. Hull is in East Yorkshire, as he subsequently acknowledged. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has pledged to revoke article 50 on day one of her premiership if she is elected to Number 10. Speaking to the PA news agency on a visit to the Guru Nanak Sikh temple in Glasgow, she said: The Liberal Democrats have been very clear - we want to remain in the European Union. We are an internationalist party and so a Liberal Democrat majority government would revoke article 50 on day one. She also stressed her opposition to a second referendum on Scottish independence. I want Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom for very much the same reasons I want the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union. We work better when we are closely together with our nearest neighbours, where we share values and we share economic interests. So I want Scotland to stay in the UK, I do not want another independence referendum, Liberal Democrats will not support indyref2. Here is the full quote from Nigel Farage alleging that Tories have been using underhand methods to try to persuade Brexit party candidates to stand down. He did not give any specific examples, and he did not say where this was happening, or who was responsible, but it was clear that he was claiming that this pressure was coming from Conservatives. Farage said: What is going on right now is nothing short of disgraceful. There is a full-scale attempt, going on out there as I speak, to stop men and women, freely, putting themselves up before the UK electorate. You would have thought this was Venezuela. And that is what is happening. Our people, men and women \u2013 much like these on the platform here \u2013 who put themselves forward are now coming under relentless phone calls, email and abuse, and being told they must stand down. That is happening in 21st Britain. I think that is a complete and utter disgrace. The battle for Scotland\u2019s anti-Tory vote between Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon became bitter and personal on Wednesday evening after the Labour leader accused Sturgeon of \u201cbeing willing to usher in another heartless Conservative government\u201d. The two clashed on Twitter after Corbyn\u2019s two-day campaigning visit to Scotland got off to a rocky start, when he had tied himself in knots over Labour\u2019s referendum policy. He first ruled out backing one for a full five-year term, before retracting that after being corrected by his aides to say Labour would not support one for the first few years. He simultaneously rejected Sturgeon\u2019s calls for a \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d to defeat the Tories, insisting it was \u201ctheir choice\u201d whether to back Labour or allow the Tories to regain power. Sturgeon retorted that Scottish National party MPs would only support a minority Labour government if it allowed Holyrood to stage a fresh independence referendum at a time of its choosing. Sturgeon wants one next year. Corbyn retaliated by tweeting back footage from 1979, when SNP support for a vote of no confidence helped topple James Callaghan\u2019s Labour government, allowing Margaret Thatcher to win her first general election and heralding 18 years of Tory government. The SNP leader hit back by accusing Corbyn of \u201cdesperate stuff\u201d, pointing out she was in primary school in 1979. The SNP had tabled a no-confidence motion after Callaghan\u2019s government decided not to introduce devolution to Scotland as the 1979 devolution referendum required 40% of all Scotland\u2019s voters to say yes. After a low turnout, that threshold was not met. With backing too from the Liberal party, Thatcher tabled an early day motion stating the house had no confidence in Callaghan\u2019s government which went to a vote. Along with unionist MPs from Northern Ireland, the SNP\u2019s 11 MPs voted against Labour, which lost the motion by one vote. Those events are engrained in Labour folklore as proof of the SNP\u2019s dishonesty about opposing the Tories. With the polls showing Labour support as low as 12% in Scotland, they face another wipeout on 12 December and are desperately trying to mobilise disillusioned and apathetic Labour voters. Scottish Labour\u2019s Facebook page features film of Ian Lavery, the party chairman and a former National Union of Mineworkers president, insisting a minority Labour government would challenge the SNP to vote down its budget, including \u00a370bn extra spending for Scotland, rather than agree a deal. He concluded: \u201cLet the SNP decide whether they want to accept that or not. Let them decide whether they want to stick their fingers up at the Scottish people.\u201d Farage says in September he offered to work with the Tories on a \u201cleave alliance\u201d. That could win an 80 or 100-seat majority. But the Tories were not interested, he says. He claims this shows the Tories are putting party before country. Here is one of the Farage quotes. Farage says if his candidates get to Westminster they will not be \u201cgood little boys and girls\u201d. They will fight for Brexit. He cannot understand why people think it makes sense for the UK to be shackled to 15% of the world\u2019s economy, he says. Farage says the Tories have not been grateful for his decision not to stand candidates in Tory-held seats. Instead, all that the party has had from the Tories has been \u201cwall to wall abuse\u201d, he says. And he claims something \u201cdisgraceful\u201d is happening that the audience do not know about. Brexit party candidates are coming under relentless pressure to stand down. They are getting phone calls, emails and abuse, he says. Farage claims, again, that Boris Johnson signalled a \u201cmarked change of direction\u201d in a video he posted on Twitter on Sunday about Brexit. (Actually, he didn\u2019t.) Farage says he would be happy with a Canada-style trade deal, or a no-deal Brexit. Under either option, the UK would not be bound by EU laws. Farage says the Tories are today talking about reducing immigration. \u201cAre you having a laugh?\u201d In the last three elections they have promised this, but failed, he says. Farage says democracy only works if you have losers\u2019 consent. The losers must accept the result of the election, he says. He says the Brexit party will fight Labour in every seat in this country. Farage says the audience probably used to think they lived in a 21st century democracy. But all the promises made by politicians have not been delivered, he says. He claims Labour think people did not know what they voted for. Labour wants people to do it all again. Labour is treating voters with contempt, he says. In May the highest Brexit party vote came in areas with the most Labour MPs, he says. He says Labour is now more about Hoxton than Hull. In Labour areas there is no enthusiasm for Jeremy Corbyn, he says. He claims many Labour voters will stay at home. That gives the Brexit party a phenomenal opportunity, he claims. Nigel Farage is speaking at the Brexit party event. He is in Hull, and he says this is Brexit country. He says the Brexit party reset the political agenda when it was set up earlier this year. Its success in the European elections led to the removal of Theresa May as prime minister, he claims. He welcomes Michelle Dewberry to the party. At the Brexit party event Michelle Dewberry is speaking now. A former winner of the TV reality show The Apprentice, Dewberry is the Brexit party\u2019s candidate in Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle. Maybe this is the \u201cbig announcement\u201d the party promised earlier. (See 10.15am.) Dewberry stood as an independent, pro-Brexit candidate in the same constituency in 2017. She says in this campaign it seems as though wanting to speak up for the north has become trendy. But for years the north has been neglected by Westminster, she says. She says Brexit will allow the UK to decide how the country should be run. There should be deeper devolution, she says. She says she is tired of having the north treated \u201cas an afterthought\u201d. This has to stop, she says. She says politics is broken. There has been a lot of talk of tactical voting. That shows the system does not work. Parliament should truly reflect the desires of the people. First-past-the-post does not achieve that. She says the Brexit party wants constitutional reform. She also rejects the claim that by standing in Hull West and Hessle (a seat Labour held in 2017 with a majority of 8,025) she is splitting the pro-Brexit vote. Every person can use their vote way they wish, she says. The Brexit party event flagged up earlier (see 10.15am) has just started. Nigel Farage, the party leader, is due to speak soon, but at the moment David Bull, a doctor and Brexit party MEP, is speaking. One in six patients waited longer than four hours in A&amp;E in England during October \u2013 the worst-ever performance since a target was introduced in 2004, according to official data released this morning. In response Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said these figures showed why the NHS needed Labour\u2019s \u00a340bn rescue plan. He said: The Conservatives have ushered in the worst NHS crisis on record. Under Boris Johnson the NHS is in crisis and we\u2019re heading for a winter of abject misery for patients. Our A&amp;Es are overwhelmed, more so than ever. In every community there\u2019s an ever growing queue of people waiting for treatment. In his response Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said almost nothing about why the figures were so bad, but instead just attacked Labour. He said: With rising demand, and with dedicated staff already working exceptionally hard, the last thing our NHS can afford is Labour\u2019s plans for a four-day week and uncontrolled and unlimited immigration, which would cripple our health service \u2013 leaving it understaffed and underfunded. It is not true to say that Labour is planning uncontrolled and unlimited immigration. (See 9.45am.) Labour is finding it harder to explain how the NHS would absorb the possible costs of its plans for a 32-hour working week (the Times has splashed on the issue today), but, as John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, explained at a news conference yesterday, this is a 10-year aspiration, not something to be introduced immediately, and the idea is that productivity increases will make it affordable. Here is an explanation of the Labour 32-hour working week plan. It may feel to some of us as if the election campaign has been going on for ages, but on the Today programme this morning Deborah Mattinson, the pollster and public opinion specialist, issued a healthy corrective. Most members of the public are not yet taking any notice, she said. She told the programme: One of the things to bear in mind is that nothing much is landing from this campaign at the moment anyway. There was a poll this week saying 42% of people had picked up nothing. I asked people in a focus group yesterday: \u2018What have you heard since the campaign began?\u2019 And literally they all looked at me blankly. Mattinson said it was only in the last fortnight of the campaign that non-committed voters would start to take an interest in what was going on. Jeremy Corbyn was heckled by a supporter of another Scottish independence referendum as gave a speech this morning at the Queen\u2019s Hotel in Dundee, PA Media reports. The report goes on: On the second day of his Scottish tour, Corbyn was interrupted by a shouting member of the audience who asked him what he planned to do about the \u201cwill of the Scottish people\u201d. The man shouted: \u201cIs this democracy?\u201d Corbyn tried to quieten him, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly democratic when we listen to each other, so I\u2019ll listen to you in a moment.\u201d \u201cTake your hands off me,\u201d the heckler shouted as people grabbed him. He was then ejected to the cheers and claps of the audience. Boris Johnson began campaigning in a rainy south-west by visiting a school, the Press Association reports. Pupils at West Monkton primary school, near Taunton, welcomed the prime minister who was accompanied by Rebecca Pow, the Conservative candidate seeking re-election for Taunton Deane. In the overnight Conservative party press notice about immigration Priti Patel, the home secretary, restates her commitment to introducing an \u201cAustralian-style points system so what we can control our borders\u201d. What do you think David Cameron, the former Tory prime minister, thinks of that? Apart from a low-key day of canvassing in Reading West, he does not seem to have played a role in the election so far, and it would be surprising if he were to start giving interviews criticising his successor. But on this issue we know what he thinks, because he covers it in his revealing and extremely readable memoir, For the Record. Writing about the Brexit campaign, he says: By the time we got to June, referendum month, Boris [Johnson] and [Michael] Gove were pledging to introduce an \u2018Australian-style points-based immigration system\u2019 before the next general election if Britain voted leave. Quite apart from the fact that we already had the equivalent of a points system (clear categories for immigrants, with some channels such as unskilled labour from outside the EU set at zero), our system was tougher than Australia\u2019s, and our level of immigration much lower. From the Brexit party I don\u2019t know what that will be about, but we\u2019ll tune in ... In his Today interview Brandon Lewis, the security minister, said wealthy Russian businessmen had an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to donate to the Conservative party if they were British citizens. Admitting that he had received donations from prominent Russians himself, he said: I have had donations from Lubov [Chernukhin] and also Alexander Temerko, as has the Conservative party. They are British citizens, they are prominent British businesspeople as well - Alexander himself has invested in the renewable energy industry in the East of England. So British citizens have the absolute right, as any other British citizen does, to invest in and be part of the British political scene, and I think it\u2019s wrong to accuse them of anything else. It is interesting that CCHQ put up Brandon Lewis, a Home Office minister, to give interviews this morning defending what is the Conservative party\u2019s overnight attack line against Labour - the claim that average net immigration would rise to 840,000 a year under Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 and not his boss, Priti Patel. Patel, the home secretary, is very popular with with rightwing Tories and Brexit party supporters, but she is not one of the cabinet minister most skilled at dealing with forensic questioning. Here is the extract from the Conservative news release explaining how the party justifies its claim. (Bold type in the original document.) New analysis released today, using official figures and based on HM government\u2019s own methodology reveals: Maintaining free movement with existing EEA members would result in average net immigration to the UK of 260,000 per year over the next 10 years. This is equivalent to a city the size of Brighton moving to the UK every year. Labour\u2019s policy of maintaining EU free movement would lead to 2.6 million more people moving to the UK over the next 10 years. This scenario is a minimal interpretation of Labour\u2019s policy and represents a slight increase based on current immigration levels. Extending free movement to the rest of the world would result in average net immigration to the UK of 840,000 per year over the next 10 years. This is equivalent to the combined populations of Manchester and Newcastle moving to the UK every single year. This means that levels of net migration would more than treble if Labour introduced their proposals for completely open borders. This analysis is deliberately cautious and is likely to provide a significant underestimate of net inflows from non-EEA countries under Labour\u2019s plans. This claim is that it is based on a motion passed at Labour party\u2019s conference. But there are two problems with citing it as evidence that Labour would allow annual net immigration to rise to 840,000 a year. First, the wording of the motion was very generalised (the full text is here), and it was not clear what it would mean in practice. And, second, Labour is only committed to implementing policies in its manifesto, not motions passed at conference. Today Labour is arguing that, when the conference motion demanded a manifesto pledge to \u201cmaintain and extend free movement rights\u201d, this was not a reference to allowing non-EU nationals to come and live in the UK freely. \u201cThere was no mention [in the motion] of geographically extending freedom of movement to other countries,\u201d a party source said. Instead this was a reference to extending the rights that already apply to British citizens and others with the right to live in the UK, for example by making it easier for spouses to join them, the source argued. This may be a fair way to interpret the motion passed by Labour conference, but this is not a point that the party made particularly forcefully at the time. Today Labour has dismissed the Tory claims as \u201cfake news\u201d. In a statement Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: This is more fake news from the Conservative party\u2019s make-believe research department. Unlike the Tories we won\u2019t scapegoat migrants or deport our own Windrush generation citizens. The damage done to our society has been through damaging Conservative cuts to our public services, not by EU nationals coming to work in them. What is true, though, is that Labour has yet to say what its immigration policy would be. Jeremy Corbyn and others have said things that imply that they would like to keep free movement for EU nationals after Brexit, but during the campaign Corbyn has tended to sidestep questions about what Labour\u2019s exact policy will be, saying details will be given in the manifesto. But Labour does want to negotiate a soft version of Brexit with the EU, keeping the UK aligned to the single market, and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has admitted that negotiating this would involve a negotiation about whether or not the UK would maintain EU free movement rules. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Brandon Lewis, the Home Office minister, is now being interviewed on Today. He was talking about flooding on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain earlier. (See 8.23am.) He accepts that the Tories have let people down in the past by failing to hit their target of getting net migration below 100,000. But he claims that was partly due to the Tories being in coalition with the Lib Dems from 2010 to 2015. Q: Which immigrants would you allow? And don\u2019t just say the brightest and the best. Lewis says the migration advisory committee would advise the government on this issue. The government has to look at this methodically, he says. It would take the MAC\u2019s advice. Q: You claim there would be surge of migration under Labour. But this claim is based on a motion passed by the Labour conference that won\u2019t be in the manifesto. Lewis says the Tory claim is also based on what Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell has said. He says the Tory claim that Labour could end up allowing more than 800,000 migrants into the UK per year is an understatement. The shadow employment secretary, Laura Pidcock, has dismissed immigration targets as \u201carbitrary\u201d. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Pidcock said: We know actually that migrant labour does not undercut wages, it is exploitative bosses that seek to undermine national agreements \u2013 that\u2019s our emphasis. Questioned on whether she would be happy for immigration to rise under a Labour government, Pidcock added: \u201cI think these targets are arbitrary.\u201d When pushed on comments in the Guardian by the leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, more free movement, Pidcock said: It isn\u2019t right that we place the blame on numbers of immigrants for wages. Actually those employers that seek to undermine those national agreements are to blame for the exploitation. And he [McCluskey] talked about stricter regulations and that is what we are proposing. Pidcock added: \u201cI think it\u2019s a false flag, this issue of immigration.\u201d She then accused the media of \u201cmischaracterising\u201d McCluskey. Pidcock said: What you are actually doing is mischaracterising Len McCluskey as some kind of false division in the Labour party. He is the leader of the trade union that I am a member of, he talked very clearly about there not being an environment where national terms and conditions can be undermined by exploitative bosses. Pushed again on whether she is in favour of extended free movement rights, as was voted for at the Labour party\u2019s conference, Pidcock added: I am in favour of making sure there are conditions where no worker, whether they be British or a foreign worker are exploited in this country, because that is the real issue. The issue is not about migrant labour, the issue is about what kind of legislative environment we have for workers, and we will create one where all workers are protected. Pidcock also hit back at the CBI\u2019s claims that Labour\u2019s pledge to sanction businesses who cannot prove that they are working to remove their gender pay gap is \u201cadding bureaucracy\u201d. She said: We don\u2019t want employers, and some do, to see this as a tick box-exercise where they look and say: \u2018OK we do have a gender pay gap, and we\u2019ve written down that we do, but we\u2019re not going to do anything about that.\u2019 There has to be proof of how they\u2019re working to close that gap, and if there\u2019s absolutely no proof as to how they\u2019re working towards the elimination of that gap then there will be some form of sanction. The security minister, Brandon Lewis, has defended the prime minister\u2019s refusal to apologise over the government response to the floods in Yorkshire and the east Midlands. Appearing on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Lewis, a former floods minister, was played clips of Boris Johnson being heckled about his response to the flood and why he had refused to say sorry. Lewis said: \u201cObviously, it\u2019s not the PM\u2019s fault that there\u2019s been a flood.\u201d He also suggested Johnson had held back from visiting flood-hit areas because he didn\u2019t want to hamper the clean-up operation. He said: Sometimes when a big group of politicians and the media turn up, they get in the way and they distract people from doing the job. The prime minister was able to visit when it\u2019s right, not distracting from the core work of getting people\u2019s lives back together as quickly as possible. Lewis was challenged on why Doncaster, one of the areas worst hit by the floods, has had its funding cut by 50% since 2010. He defended the government austerity policy. He said: We had such a dreadful economic situation back in 2010 that we inherited that we had to reduce spending so the country could get back gradually to living within its means. Local authorities are a huge part of the public sector expense. And if it was right that they played their part and there was a lot of efficiencies we could find. Asked if he was claiming that 50% of Doncaster budget was being wasted, he said: The 50% [cut] refers to just one part of their budget. It doesn\u2019t include the council tax and other income they get. So it not a 50% cut overall. When we have a situation like flooding, that\u2019s why we have what\u2019s called the Bellwin scheme and that\u2019s something that kicks in to take on in this kind of natural disaster. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has rejected pressure to withdraw more of his candidates in Labour or Liberal Democrat seats. Speaking to Today, on the day when nominations for candidates close, he said: We\u2019re going to fight 300 seats and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do. The job of the Brexit party is to hold him [Boris Johnson] to account, because too many times over the last three years the Conservatives have made promises and not delivered. He also criticised the Conservatives for refusing to do a deal with the Brexit party in Labour seats. \u201cI\u2019ve realised that the Conservatives want a Conservative majority in parliament, not a Brexit majority in parliament.\u201d He added: There are very clearly seats in which we are the lead challenger and their are other seats in which they are the lead challenger to Labour, and we could have done a deal on that basis, but the priority for the Conservative party, they do not want the Brexit party to get seats in parliament. They\u2019d rather risk not winning the election than having a leave majority, a leave alliance. He also criticised his old ally Arron Banks, who urged him to withdraw more candidates. Farage said Banks was suffering from \u201cBrexhaustion\u201d. And he claimed the election would be decided by tactical voting. Farage said: I\u2019m going to go out around the country saying to Labour voters: \u2018You are being let down badly, betrayed by the Labour party who now want you to vote again.\u2019 And the same for Conservative voters: in seats that the Conservatives have never won in 100 years, your best chance of getting Brexit is to get us in there and hold Boris Johnson to account. And ultimately this election will be decided by tactical voting decisions all across the country. Luciana Berger, the Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for health and social care, has defended the party\u2019s insistence on putting up a candidate in Canterbury despite the previous candidate decision to stand aside in favour of Labour. Berger, who defected from Labour earlier this year, conceded that the Labour candidate\u2019s, Rosie Duffield, is \u201ca very lovely person\u201d. But speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme she added: I know her very well personally, but she\u2019s campaigning to put Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10. This comes down to the choice who\u2019s going to be our next prime minister at this general election. Berger pointed out that Labour had refused to take part in cross-party talks on a remain pact. She said: I wish the Labour party would have been involved in the unite to remain discussions. They had ample opportunity to do so but they refused to engage. One of the most senior members has said that the Labour party is not a party of remain. And if people want to party remain at this election, they have to vote for the Liberal Democrats. The papers Matthew Weaver brings us one of the more disturbing stories of the day. Boris Johnson dropped a reference to \u201conanism\u201d from an election campaign speech after previews of the text drew criticism from the opposition. On Tuesday night Johnson\u2019s advisers released extracts from the speech the prime minister was due to give at an electric taxi factory in the West Midlands on Wednesday. In the texts given to journalists, Johnson likened Labour\u2019s approach to spending, Brexit and Scottish independence to \u201cself-obsession and onanism\u201d. But when Johnson delivered the speech the word onanism was left out. Asked about the omission by the Sun\u2019s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, Johnson tried to laugh it off. He said: \u201cAll I can say is that a stray early draft seems to have somehow found its way into your otherwise peerless copy, by a process that I don\u2019t pretend to understand, but I will make inquiries.\u201d Reports of the pre-briefed version of the speech led to a spike in Google searches for the arcane term for masturbation. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has promised that a Conservative government would reduce immigration overall, in an attack on Labour\u2019s immigration policy. Patel criticised Labour\u2019s immigration policy, which has not been announced yet, saying: Under Corbyn\u2019s Labour, immigration would surge and put huge strain on schools and our NHS. Jeremy Corbyn has no credible plan for how to deal with the consequences of his open borders policy. The biggest risk to our NHS is Corbyn\u2019s plans for uncontrolled and unlimited immigration, for ever. By contrast, the Conservatives will get Brexit done, end free movement and introduce an Australian-style points system so that we can control our borders and protect our public services. We will reduce immigration overall while being more open and flexible to the highly skilled people we need, such as scientists and doctors. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: This is more fake news from the Conservative party\u2019s make-believe research department. Unlike the Tories, we won\u2019t scapegoat migrants or deport our own Windrush-generation citizens. The damage done to our society has been through damaging Conservative cuts to our public services, not by EU nationals coming to work in them. Boris Johnson has hit back at claims he is \u201cin cahoots\u201d with Nigel Farage. In a speech he said that in fact \u201cthe Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance would consign this country to months, if not years, of dither, delay, discord, division\u201d. Corbyn said Labour was \u201cnot doing pacts, not doing deals\u201d if it failed to win a majority in the election, rejecting suggestions fuelled by Sturgeon that he had privately agreed to support a second independence referendum in exchange for Scottish National party support. Instead, he challenged Sturgeon to support a minority Labour government. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the day\u2019s politics news. It is Equal Pay Day \u2013 when the average woman effectively stops earning for the year, taking into account a mean gender pay gap of 13.1%. The Lib Dems and Labour will use it to announce measures to tackle the gender pay gap. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to oblige bigger companies to publish data on employment levels by gender, as well as for BAME and LGBT staff, and would push for a law to end the so-called pink tax, whereby companies charge higher prices for fundamentally identical products such as razors or deodorants simply because they are marketed at women. Labour has pledged to eradicate the gender pay gap by 2030 through measures such as fines for organisations that fail to report on the subject, and by extending the reporting requirement from firms with 250 or more employees to those with more than 50. Boris Johnson has come under fire for his government\u2019s slow response to the flooding across parts of England\u2019s north and has declined to apologise, saying a huge amount of work was going on to help and compensate victims. The PM spent time in deluged regions of Yorkshire, the east Midlands and Lincolnshire on Wednesday. Corbyn has criticised the government, saying its spending on flood defences until 2021 \u201cheavily favours London and the south-east of England\u201d. Richard Partington has fact-checked this claim, and while it is technically true, those figures are seriously influenced by long-term funding for Thames estuary projects running up to 2100. Over the spending period to 2021, Labour is wrong, with more spent per head on flood defences in Yorkshire and the Humber. I\u2019ll be running the blog for the first hour or so, before handing over to my colleagues. You can get in touch with me on Twitter. Thanks for reading.",

      "bodyText": "Three months after one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern US history, the Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, where 22 were killed in an August rampage reopened on Thursday amid tears and smiles from customers and staff as the border city continues to reel from the racially-driven tragedy. The 9am opening began with the raising of the American flag \u2013 which had been flown at half-staff since the attack \u2013 and the unfurling of an \u201cEl Paso Strong\u201d banner, a slogan which is now found on bumper stickers, shirts and buildings throughout the city. Inside the store, hundreds of employees lined up to greet each new customer as they arrived, while cashiers, stockers and managers hugged, cried and laughed as intermittent cheers of \u201cWelcome to Walmart\u201d rang out through the store. \u201cIt will take time to heal,\u201d said El Paso resident Randy Villegas, just minutes before the store opened. \u201cThe situation was bad, but it made us strong. We\u2019re here to show our pride and move on from that terrible day.\u201d On 3 August, Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old from Allen, Texas, entered the Walmart in eastern El Paso, not far from the US-Mexico border, and opened fire on shoppers with an AK-47 assault rifle, killing 22 and injuring dozens of others. Upon his arrest, Crusius confirmed he was the shooter and stated his target were \u201cMexicans\u201d, according to a police affidavit. According to a racist, white nationalist rant posted online shortly before the attack and thought to have been written by the suspect, the shooting was a response to what it called the \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas\u201d. \u201cI am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion,\u201d the author wrote on the far-right message board 8chan. Crusius pleaded not guilty last month to murder charges. He faces the death penalty if convicted. For residents of El Paso, a border city that is more than three-quarters Hispanic, the alleged racist motivations of the attack have had a profound and lingering impact. \u201cEveryone in El Paso knew someone that was here, this touched everyone,\u201d said Villegas, whose wife and best friend both work at the Walmart on Gateway Boulevard but were off during the day of the attack. It is thought that almost 3,000 witnesses were present during the sustained attack. \u201cHe was after people like us,\u201d said Javier Luis, a father of three from Ciudad Juarez, El Paso\u2019s sister city in Mexico, directly across the Rio Grande which forms the border dividing the two metropolises. Luis said he crosses into the US with his wife Maria once a month to shop at this particular Walmart branch, as do many Mexicans living near this part of the border. \u201cWe were scared to come back, but racism won\u2019t change how we live,\u201d he said determinedly. In the US, mass shootings have become more frequent and more deadly. The attack in El Paso was just one of 22 fatal mass shootings in the US this year alone, and of the 10 deadliest massacres in the modern US, four have occurred in Texas. According to the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), a not-for-profit research group tracking mass shootings and gun violence, the number of mass shootings (defined by GVA as an attack where at least four people were shot) in the US has thus far outpaced the number of days in 2019. Just as the store opened, news came through of multiple people shot at a high school in Santa Clarita, in southern California. El Paso resident Miguel Arturo, who was at the Walmart reopening to get his regular consignment of groceries, specifically some avocados, he said, remarked that the city and the country could learn from such tragedies. \u201cWho needs assault rifles?\u201d he asked, echoing the point recently and forcefully made by local political luminary Beto O\u2019Rourke following the El Paso shooting. O\u2019Rourke dropped out of the 2020 presidential race just days ago, but he made his mark with gun control advocates. \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said at the Democratic primary debate in September. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow them to be used against fellow Americans any more.\u201d For Villegas and others, the hope is that the re-opening of the store can be a small step towards healing and a return to normal life. \u201cThis attack does not represent our city,\u201d said Villegas, as more and more customers poured into the store, while welcoming cheers continued to ring out from the staff. \u201cWe won\u2019t forget, but we will move on.\u201d",

The tax and spending watchdog said a Tory proposal to increase wages at a slower pace would only double the number of people protected by the minimum wage by 2024 and also largely benefit those in better-off households. In a scathing review of the parties\u2019 proposals to reduce in-work poverty, the IFS said less than one in five of the people who would benefit from a higher minimum wage lived in low-income households. \u201cThe direct benefits from minimum wage increases would mostly go to middle-income households,\u201d the report says. Only 17% of minimum-wage workers live in the poorest fifth of households and just 19% are in households in relative income poverty, after a shift to part-time work that often means low-paid workers live with higher earners, it says. Those workers who are on the minimum wage and live in the poorest households would lose much of the gains under Tory and Labour plans without reforms to universal credit making it more generous. \u201cMany of those who do live in low-income households would see part of their gains clawed back through reduced benefit entitlements,\u201d the report says.

More than \u00a31m a day is being lost to scams in which people are duped into authorising a payment to an account controlled by a criminal. The failure to agree a protection plan may make it more likely that the next government will step in. In response to this growing crime, a voluntary code requiring banks to reimburse affected customers who meet the criteria took effect on 28 May 2019. But the funding arrangement that bails out some of the victims of this scam is due to end on 31 December. This relates to where the customer and their bank have done everything expected of them under the code \u2013 known as the \u201cno blame scenario\u201d. Last month the consumer body Which? warned that time was running out and, unless a solution was agreed soon, there was a risk of \u201ca return to the dark days of blameless victims losing their life savings to this devastating crime\u201d. A proposal for banks to pay a small fee on some transfers to collectively fund a no-blame reimbursement pot was put forward by seven banks and building societies. A 2.9p levy would be applied to some faster types of payment. But the payment body Pay.UK, which was tasked with making the final decision, has rejected this proposal after a consultation. It concluded that there was no industry consensus to finance a central fund to reimburse victims. The body said the lack of agreement among banks, building societies and other financial firms meant the proposal could not be implemented or enforced in practice, with the consultation feedback indicating \u201ca number of unresolvable issues\u201d. So from January it will be up to individual banks to decide whether they are going to reimburse victims. Fraudsters stole \u00a3616m from UK bank customers during the first six months of 2019, according to the banking group UK Finance. Of this total, \u00a3207m was lost to bank transfer scams \u2013 up 40% on the same period in 2018. This type of scam is officially known as authorised push payment fraud and includes cases where email accounts \u2013 either those of individuals or the companies or tradespeople they have employed \u2013 are hacked to trick consumers into sending large sums to criminal accounts.

Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary, said: \u201cThe Tories are destroying our high streets and towns. A decade of vicious cuts to the services that people in our communities rely on has taken 60p in every \u00a31 from council budgets.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson said a future Conservative government would extend the retail discount on business rates to 50% next year. For businesses with a rateable value of less than \u00a351,000, this will mean an increase on the current retail discount of 33% in 2020-21. This would amount to \u201can effective \u00a3280m tax cut\u201d for small businesses, the party claimed.</p> <p>A new \u00a31,000 business rates relief for pubs would also be introduced under a Johnson majority government \u2013 an \u00a318m tax cut for next year, it is claimed.</p> <p>The Conservatives said they would also introduce a \u00a3150m fund that will help groups trying to take over and run pubs and post offices threatened with closure.</p> <p>Following on from previous pledges to reverse rail cuts recommended by Dr Richard Beeching in the 1960s, Johnson has also pledged to set up a \u00a3500m Beeching Reversal fund.</p> <p>Towns such as Ashington, Seaton Delaval and Blyth, with a combined population of 100,000, will receive cash following a request from Northumberland council for \u00a399m to reinstate stations, the Tories claimed.</p> <p>Willenhall and Darlaston in the West Midlands will receive \u00a318m to reopen stations \u2013 a further \u00a310m has already been provided by the government, the party said.</p> <p>Investment will also be provided to connect Skelmersdale to Liverpool and Manchester. A disused railway line will be funded to improve transport connections for Thornton-Cleveleys and Fleetwood. <br><br>In a statement last night, Johnson said: \u201cFor too long, too many towns and villages across Britain have been overlooked and left behind. When the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, many communities felt their voices had been heard for the first time in decades and that their lives would improve.<br><br>\u201cWe will invest in these communities and help people put the heart back into the places they call home.\u201d</p> <p>One organisation representing retailers said Johnson\u2019s plans did not go far enough to revive the UK\u2019s troubled shopping districts.</p> <p>Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said the majority of the UK\u2019s 3 million retail workers were employed in businesses that would not benefit from today\u2019s announcement.</p> <p>\u201cIt is essential that the next government scraps \u2018downwards transition\u2019, which costs retailers \u00a31.3bn, freezes next year\u2019s rates increase, and introduces an improvement relief to encourage investment in our high streets.</p> <p>\u201cTo ensure the long-term vitality of our town and city centres, the next government should follow the recommendations of the treasury select committee and commit to wholesale reform of our broken business rates system,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Conservatives have been accused of using public money to boost their election prospects after it emerged that funding from the towns fund was going to wealthier Tory marginals. An analysis by the Times found this week that a third of the 100 towns due to receive some of the \u00a33.6bn pot were not among the 300 most deprived towns.</p> <p>These included Loughborough, which was won by Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, at the last election, with a majority of around 4,000. Kirby was not on the list.</p>",

The Conservatives said they would also introduce a \u00a3150m fund that will help groups trying to take over and run pubs and post offices threatened with closure. Following on from previous pledges to reverse rail cuts recommended by Dr Richard Beeching in the 1960s, Johnson has also pledged to set up a \u00a3500m Beeching Reversal fund. Towns such as Ashington, Seaton Delaval and Blyth, with a combined population of 100,000, will receive cash following a request from Northumberland council for \u00a399m to reinstate stations, the Tories claimed. Willenhall and Darlaston in the West Midlands will receive \u00a318m to reopen stations \u2013 a further \u00a310m has already been provided by the government, the party said. Investment will also be provided to connect Skelmersdale to Liverpool and Manchester. A disused railway line will be funded to improve transport connections for Thornton-Cleveleys and Fleetwood. In a statement last night, Johnson said: \u201cFor too long, too many towns and villages across Britain have been overlooked and left behind. When the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, many communities felt their voices had been heard for the first time in decades and that their lives would improve. \u201cWe will invest in these communities and help people put the heart back into the places they call home.\u201d One organisation representing retailers said Johnson\u2019s plans did not go far enough to revive the UK\u2019s troubled shopping districts. Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said the majority of the UK\u2019s 3 million retail workers were employed in businesses that would not benefit from today\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt is essential that the next government scraps \u2018downwards transition\u2019, which costs retailers \u00a31.3bn, freezes next year\u2019s rates increase, and introduces an improvement relief to encourage investment in our high streets. \u201cTo ensure the long-term vitality of our town and city centres, the next government should follow the recommendations of the treasury select committee and commit to wholesale reform of our broken business rates system,\u201d he said. The Conservatives have been accused of using public money to boost their election prospects after it emerged that funding from the towns fund was going to wealthier Tory marginals. An analysis by the Times found this week that a third of the 100 towns due to receive some of the \u00a33.6bn pot were not among the 300 most deprived towns. These included Loughborough, which was won by Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, at the last election, with a majority of around 4,000. Kirby was not on the list.",
