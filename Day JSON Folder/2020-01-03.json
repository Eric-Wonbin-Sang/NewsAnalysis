I tell them you have to win through the early rounds to even have a chance of cup luck. We\u2019ve beaten Boston and Wrexham to get this far, so we do feel we deserve it. When I was a player at Rochdale we could never get past the League One and Two teams we drew in the first round. My FA Cup memories before I became a coach are nonexistent.\u201d</p> <p>Though relatively unknown in this country Barry-Murphy is a famous name in Ireland, owing to his father Jimmy\u2019s prowess in hurling and Gaelic sports. \u201cI don\u2019t want to big him up too much but I know exactly how Darren Ferguson feels about always being associated with your dad,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dad is a similar figure to Sir Alex in Irish sports, incredibly well-known.

That\u2019s how we ended up with a 15-year-old on the bench and a 16-year-old [Luke Matheson] scoring our goal. I was worried going into the game because I felt responsible for those lads, I thought some of them might get exposed. It was a big learning curve for me personally too, because I have never experienced anything on that scale, but once the game started we all felt strangely at home.</p> <p>\u201cWe were OK in the end, irrespective of how the game finished we showed what we are about, how we can play and how our academy players can step up and do the same. To be able to show all that on such a grand stage made us all as proud as punch.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/02/fa-cup-third-round-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">FA Cup third round: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 41-year-old suspects some of his players might have preferred another away game at a leading ground this time, though he knows they are excited about being on television again and Spotland will be full for a change. \u201cWe find it hard to sell our stadium out. We\u2019ve never done it before in my time, even when we played Tottenham a couple of seasons back. It\u2019s good for the players to play in front of a full house, it gives them a sense of how well they have done.</p> <p>\u201cI keep trying to point out that staying in League One is our real priority, that we can\u2019t lose our main focus just because Andy Carroll is coming to town but I learned from the Manchester United game that there\u2019s no point doing that.

      "bodyText": "Brian Barry-Murphy\u2019s Rochdale host Newcastle in the FA Cup on Saturday afternoon, a little over three months after taking Manchester United to penalties in a Carabao Cup tie. A manager also earning compliments for the attractive football his team play and the number of academy graduates he promotes could easily get used to the high life but Barry-Murphy has a natural antidote to prevent his feet ever leaving the ground. \u201cI just nip home,\u201d he says, home being Cork. \u201cMy friends in Ireland are never slow to tell me I\u2019m going to get my comeuppance. Every time I\u2019m over there I get a strong sense of \u2018who do you think you are?\u2019 We have a reputation for playing stylish football, so everyone tells me I\u2019ve been watching yer man at Manchester City too much. \u201cI went back for a funeral last week and they were all saying I\u2019ve got cup luck to keep getting paired with such big opponents. I tell them you have to win through the early rounds to even have a chance of cup luck. We\u2019ve beaten Boston and Wrexham to get this far, so we do feel we deserve it. When I was a player at Rochdale we could never get past the League One and Two teams we drew in the first round. My FA Cup memories before I became a coach are nonexistent.\u201d Though relatively unknown in this country Barry-Murphy is a famous name in Ireland, owing to his father Jimmy\u2019s prowess in hurling and Gaelic sports. \u201cI don\u2019t want to big him up too much but I know exactly how Darren Ferguson feels about always being associated with your dad,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dad is a similar figure to Sir Alex in Irish sports, incredibly well-known. When I sneaked over to the UK I escaped that. I just kept it on the quiet, though I\u2019m happy to say Jimmy will be coming over for the Newcastle game.\u201d Barry-Murphy was nervous when tasked with taking a young side to Old Trafford, particularly as there was something of an injury crisis at the time. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the biggest of squads in the first place. That\u2019s how we ended up with a 15-year-old on the bench and a 16-year-old [Luke Matheson] scoring our goal. I was worried going into the game because I felt responsible for those lads, I thought some of them might get exposed. It was a big learning curve for me personally too, because I have never experienced anything on that scale, but once the game started we all felt strangely at home. \u201cWe were OK in the end, irrespective of how the game finished we showed what we are about, how we can play and how our academy players can step up and do the same. To be able to show all that on such a grand stage made us all as proud as punch.\u201d The 41-year-old suspects some of his players might have preferred another away game at a leading ground this time, though he knows they are excited about being on television again and Spotland will be full for a change. \u201cWe find it hard to sell our stadium out. We\u2019ve never done it before in my time, even when we played Tottenham a couple of seasons back. It\u2019s good for the players to play in front of a full house, it gives them a sense of how well they have done. \u201cI keep trying to point out that staying in League One is our real priority, that we can\u2019t lose our main focus just because Andy Carroll is coming to town but I learned from the Manchester United game that there\u2019s no point doing that. If the lads are excited about a game just let them be. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it and hopefully the league form will take care of itself.\u201d If that sounds a little cavalier, Barry-Murphy admits he enjoys the challenge of being brave in a league where many are dour and pragmatic. \u201cWe know the way we like to play and I enjoy seeing the lads have the balls to stick to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always work but when it does, it\u2019s great.

In 2008 when Woodgate\u2019s header won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/25/match.tottenhamhotspur\" title=\"\">League Cup final for Tottenham</a> at Chelsea\u2019s expense, few could have envisaged him reinventing himself as a studiously thoughtful, uber professional, young Middlesbrough manager who on Sunday goes head to head with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho when Spurs visit the Riverside in the third round of the FA Cup.</p> <p>Twelve years ago \u201cWoody\u201d had many fine qualities but was far too fond of a good night out with his old Teesside mates to be taken remotely seriously as future leadership material. How wrong can you be? Despite struggling at the wrong end of the Championship for most of his debut season after succeeding Tony Pulis, Woodgate\u2019s young, inexperienced team are suddenly renascent. Not content with winning their past four games \u2013 including victories at promotion\u2011chasing West Brom and Preston \u2013 they have kept three clean sheets in the process, banishing pre\u2011Christmas rumours of Neil Warnock\u2019s apparently imminent installation as the new manager.</p> <p>Instead Woodgate is readying himself for a tactical duel with Mourinho. Ultra lean and straight\u2011backed, he still looks in good enough shape to turn back time and pull on a Spurs shirt once more but is more interested in endeavouring to emulate the success of a Boro predecessor. \u201cSteve McClaren won the League Cup [in 2004] and got us to an incredible Uefa Cup final [in 2006],\u201d he says. \u201cWho would have thought Middlesbrough would be in a European final but cups are what dreams are made of.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97f843878ccbe2dbec0135b45e2289a67a42a2b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97f843878ccbe2dbec0135b45e2289a67a42a2b3/0_92_1912_1147/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Woodgate scores the winner for Tottenham against Chelsea in the 2008 League Cup final \u2013 the last time Tottenham won a trophy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Woodgate scores the winner for Tottenham against Chelsea in the 2008 League Cup final \u2013 the last time Tottenham won a trophy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Woodgate wishes he could remember more of the one he won for Spurs. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d get a run on Didier Drogba and I was brave, stuck my head in there and it went in. It was the best goal I\u2019ve ever scored with my nose. I can\u2019t remember the celebrations mind, it\u2019s all a bit of a blur!</p> <p>\u201cThe League Cup was the only thing I won, which is something I look back on with a bit of regret. I played in good teams at Leeds and Newcastle but you can\u2019t say a team\u2019s great unless you win trophies. I thought Tottenham would have won something under Mauricio Pochettino. He did an amazing job on the budget he had but I\u2019m sure their first trophy in 12 years is now on the horizon because Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s a serial winner. He\u2019s incredible, the best there\u2019s been and still top drawer.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his Spurs stint being hampered by injuries, Woodgate remains warmly received in north London, if not quite as popular as his assistant, Robbie Keane. \u201cRobbie\u2019s a God down there, a legend. But Spurs fans have always been good to me.\u201d</p> <p>Sunday promises to be, temporarily at least, rather less friendly but Woodgate has been buoyed by the arrival of two strikers, Patrick Roberts and Lukas Nmecha, on loan from Manchester City. In many respects it is a compliment that Pep Guardiola has trusted him with their development but, typically, Boro\u2019s manager insisted on interviewing the pair before agreeing to sign them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/03/fa-cup-third-round-match-previews\">FA Cup third round: match previews</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI needed to look in the whites of their eyes and talk honestly with them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to develop a hungry young squad. But it\u2019s all about being a team player, about putting the team first.\u201d That mantra lies at the core of Boro\u2019s so called \u201cgolden thread\u201d philosophy.

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Woodgate stands outside the room, eyes glued to the digital clock on his mobile phone. The instant the display flicks to 2pm he reaches for the door handle, takes a deep breath and prepares to address Middlesbrough\u2019s weekly media conference; as always he is bang on time. Punctuality matters to a manager particularly hot on a set of \u201cstandards\u201d embracing smartness (matching black shoes and belts are de rigueur with club suits), dinner table etiquette and all\u2011round good manners. Whisper it but, a couple of weeks shy of his 40th birthday, the former England and Real Madrid centre\u2011half seems to be morphing into a cross between Bruce Rioch \u2013 the famously disciplinarian manager who in the 1980s led Boro from the brink of liquidation to England\u2019s old first division \u2013 and Gareth Southgate. It is a startling transformation. In 2008 when Woodgate\u2019s header won the League Cup final for Tottenham at Chelsea\u2019s expense, few could have envisaged him reinventing himself as a studiously thoughtful, uber professional, young Middlesbrough manager who on Sunday goes head to head with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho when Spurs visit the Riverside in the third round of the FA Cup. Twelve years ago \u201cWoody\u201d had many fine qualities but was far too fond of a good night out with his old Teesside mates to be taken remotely seriously as future leadership material. How wrong can you be? Despite struggling at the wrong end of the Championship for most of his debut season after succeeding Tony Pulis, Woodgate\u2019s young, inexperienced team are suddenly renascent. Not content with winning their past four games \u2013 including victories at promotion\u2011chasing West Brom and Preston \u2013 they have kept three clean sheets in the process, banishing pre\u2011Christmas rumours of Neil Warnock\u2019s apparently imminent installation as the new manager. Instead Woodgate is readying himself for a tactical duel with Mourinho. Ultra lean and straight\u2011backed, he still looks in good enough shape to turn back time and pull on a Spurs shirt once more but is more interested in endeavouring to emulate the success of a Boro predecessor. \u201cSteve McClaren won the League Cup [in 2004] and got us to an incredible Uefa Cup final [in 2006],\u201d he says. \u201cWho would have thought Middlesbrough would be in a European final but cups are what dreams are made of.\u201d Woodgate wishes he could remember more of the one he won for Spurs. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d get a run on Didier Drogba and I was brave, stuck my head in there and it went in. It was the best goal I\u2019ve ever scored with my nose. I can\u2019t remember the celebrations mind, it\u2019s all a bit of a blur! \u201cThe League Cup was the only thing I won, which is something I look back on with a bit of regret. I played in good teams at Leeds and Newcastle but you can\u2019t say a team\u2019s great unless you win trophies. I thought Tottenham would have won something under Mauricio Pochettino. He did an amazing job on the budget he had but I\u2019m sure their first trophy in 12 years is now on the horizon because Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s a serial winner. He\u2019s incredible, the best there\u2019s been and still top drawer.\u201d Despite his Spurs stint being hampered by injuries, Woodgate remains warmly received in north London, if not quite as popular as his assistant, Robbie Keane. \u201cRobbie\u2019s a God down there, a legend. But Spurs fans have always been good to me.\u201d Sunday promises to be, temporarily at least, rather less friendly but Woodgate has been buoyed by the arrival of two strikers, Patrick Roberts and Lukas Nmecha, on loan from Manchester City. In many respects it is a compliment that Pep Guardiola has trusted him with their development but, typically, Boro\u2019s manager insisted on interviewing the pair before agreeing to sign them. \u201cI needed to look in the whites of their eyes and talk honestly with them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to develop a hungry young squad. But it\u2019s all about being a team player, about putting the team first.\u201d That mantra lies at the core of Boro\u2019s so called \u201cgolden thread\u201d philosophy. Its architect, the club\u2019s former head of recruitment Adrian Bevington, departed the Riverside at the end of last month but the ideology remains intact. \u201cOf course the golden thread\u2019s still there,\u201d insists Woodgate. \u201cYoung players have been given their chance this season. Aynsley Pears [a 21-year-old goalkeeper who spent the last campaign on loan at Gateshead but has kept seven clean sheets in 14 appearances since replacing the injured Darren Randolph] and Marcus Tavernier [a 20-year-old left winger] have been magnificent. The golden thread\u2019s running right through our club.\u201d Mourinho must ensure it does not turn into a tripwire on Sunday.",

We are your teachers, cab drivers, fast food workers, doctors, engineers, hair stylists, journalists, shopkeepers, restaurant owners, artists, anti-war activists, activists and much more. We need you to see us. We need you to see through imperial narratives. Don\u2019t let liars and warmongers justify more violence in our names. Don\u2019t let our oppressors tell you that questioning yet another one of their endless wars is supporting oppression. Without knowing what will happen or plunging into speculation, what I can tell you on a human level is that this is a terribly dangerous moment in our history. We need your solidarity. We need your congressional action, popular action, anything to prevent war with Iran and to hold to the searing light the truth about the path that got us here. Now more than ever we must fight for our democracy with great determination, in spite of a country that doesn\u2019t always seem to want us. As always, we\u2019ll fight anyway.

      "bodyText": "The Australian, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s flagship newspaper, has defended itself against criticism it downplayed unprecedented bushfires by failing to put a picture of the disaster on the front page of an edition, even as newspapers across the world featured the harrowing scenes. Many of the world\u2019s leading mastheads featured pictures of the devastation of the Australian bushfires on page one on Thursday. But the Australian\u2019s first edition ran an upbeat picture story about the New Year\u2019s Day picnic races at Hanging Rock. Sources at the newspaper said the newsroom was short-staffed over the holidays, however it was noted that resources were found to attack the ABC with gusto over its New Year\u2019s Eve concert. \u201cOur readers have been fully informed across the nation both online and in paper all week,\u201d editor John Lehmann told Guardian Australia. The national broadsheet\u2019s lead story on Thursday was about a secret proposal by police to ban alcohol in Indigenous communities in Western Australia \u2013 a story deemed more important than the bushfire report, which said eight people were dead and mass evacuations were underway. There wasn\u2019t a single photo of the catastrophic bushfires until page 4. Before readers got to that coverage, they were given an exclusive interview with \u201crebel marine scientist Peter Ridd\u201d who has challenged reef scientists to test whether or not human actions have caused a collapse in the growth rate of corals on the Great Barrier Reef. The later editions of the paper dropped the racing story and replaced it with photographs of bushfire victims surveying the damage. The Australian is not the only Murdoch-owned newspaper that has been accused of downplaying the bushfires. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Melbourne\u2019s the Herald Sun also relegated the bushfires to page 4, even as thousands of Victorians faced a serious bushfire threat. On the same day, Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph blamed the Bureau of Meteorology for inaccurate weather predictions, which may have \u201clulled residents into a false sense of security about conditions\u201d. But it was the Courier Mail\u2019s story about the \u201cOnion Oracle\u201d that had some readers wondering what was going on at News Corp. The Queensland tabloid carried the optimistic news that \u201cOnion Oracle\u201d Halwyn Hermann was predicting rain using an old German tradition. They even compared the Onion Oracle\u2019s predictions to those of the bureau of meteorology. The Australian has been consistent on one front. Throughout the bushfire season it has kept up its coverage of climate denialism. Before Christmas, the Australian attempted to smear Greg Mullins and his Emergency Leaders for Climate Action group as \u201clargely a vehicle for Tim Flannery\u201d. Flannery is a leading environmentalist and chief counsellor at the Climate Council. The former fire and emergency chiefs from multiple states and territories say Australia is unprepared for worsening natural disasters from climate change and governments are putting lives at risk. The Australian says they are a front for Flannery who is an \u201calarmist\u201d for urging that coal-fired power stations be shut down. On New Year\u2019s Eve, the paper led with another \u201cexclusive\u201d report that pushed the line Australia should not speed up its response to global warming. Climate pressure was \u201cdoomed to fail\u201d, wrote environment editor Graham Lloyd about claims by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, who warned that \u201ctop-down\u201d pressure from the UN to address climate change would fail. As communities in Victoria and New South Wales faced devastating weather conditions on the weekend the Australian assured its readers that there was nothing unusual going on. A double-page spread about the history of fires in Australia painted the national disaster as a run-of-the-mill crisis: \u201cHistory of disasters shows there is nothing new about nation\u2019s destructive blazes.\u201d \u201cWhile there is no doubt these bushfires are bad and may get worse, fuelling more talk of the nation battling an unprecedented fire threat this summer, the blazes that continue to plague the eastern states and Western Australia are nothing new,\u201d the report said. \u201cClimate change or no, these are some of the costs of being in one of the most fire-prone regions of the world.

      "bodyText": "When Labour members voted at the party\u2019s conference in Brighton last autumn to back their leader\u2019s Brexit stance, one close ally exulted: \u201cThis is Jeremy\u2019s party now!\u201d Faced with the choice of pressing for the remain position many passionately believed in and showing loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, members opted for the latter. Last month\u2019s crushing election defeat, however, has reopened the question of where members will put their faith. Early polling, which gave Keir Starmer a clear lead this week, suggests they are not ready to back the most leftwing candidate in the field en masse. Brexit is likely to be part of the explanation. The party, whose members are disproportionately in London and the south, is overwhelmingly pro-remain, even while many of its heartland constituencies \u2013 a swath of which were lost last month \u2013 voted to leave. Starmer\u2019s patient and deliberate efforts to push the leadership toward a remain position were welcomed by many grassroots members, though his critics will use the issue to raise questions about his political judgment. Team Corbyn blame the shift toward backing a second referendum for the party\u2019s electoral defeat and ridicule the fears of Starmer and his fellow leadership contender Emily Thornberry, expressed around the shadow cabinet table, that the Lib Dems could threaten them in their London seats. This and the prospect of yet another male leader \u2013 \u201cwe could be on our second Keir and we haven\u2019t had our first woman yet,\u201d said one exasperated frontbencher - are likely to be used against Starmer in the weeks and months ahead. Rival campaign teams also claim MPs and members scarred by the election result are clutching at the prospect of a Starmer leadership as a safe option, a \u201ccomfort blanket\u201d as one candidate put it. The other contenders, including the high-profile backbencher Jess Phillips and the Wigan MP, Lisa Nandy, will hope to shake up the race and fight back by pointing to the scale of Labour\u2019s defeat and the need for a change of direction. This would be in contrast to Starmer\u2019s insistence that he would not \u201coversteer\u201d. They face a scramble, however, to secure the necessary nominations from MPs and MEPs, and depending on the timetable the national executive committee (NEC) sets on Monday that race could be over in a week or less. Nandy and the anti-Brexit frontbencher Clive Lewis may struggle to convince the requisite 21 MPs, according to some colleagues. The leftwing frontrunner, Rebecca Long-Bailey, appears to have made a faltering start despite being Corbyn\u2019s heir apparent. The Labour leader spoke warmly about her when the pair appeared alongside each other at a string of general election events. The Guardian understands he has told friends he would like her to succeed him as the torchbearer of the left, but even some of his longtime allies harbour niggling doubts about the shadow business secretary. They feel she has not been tested enough, and wonder whether she might be tempted to tack toward the political centre ground at the behest of restive MPs. \u201cA lot of us on the left are talking about this. She\u2019s just never been under pressure,\u201d said one frontbencher. Some speak wistfully of Laura Pidcock, the outspoken young former North West Durham MP who was another Corbyn favourite, but who lost her seat to the Conservatives and so is out of the running. The party chair Ian Lavery\u2019s suggestion in recent days that he has not ruled out running for the leadership was read by many as a sign that key Corbyn lieutenants are not yet ready to throw their weight wholeheartedly behind Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. Floated on the hyper-partisan blog Skwawkbox, Lavery\u2019s candidacy is widely thought to be the brainchild of Corbyn\u2019s former chief of staff Karie Murphy, who was a key figure in organising Labour\u2019s election campaign and has close links with the Unite union. Unite is expected to support Long-Bailey, though no formal decision has been made. Other major unions, wary of a stitch-up or of being accused of narrowing the choice for party members, may decide to opt for alternative candidates. Union support will be crucial because of rule changes introduced since 2015 to balance the influence of MPs. Under the new and more complex system, candidates must not only win over 10% of their parliamentary colleagues, but also secure the support either of 5% of constituency parties, or of at least three trade unions or affiliated societies, which between them account for 5% or more of the affiliated membership. Whatever the reservations of some Corbyn supporters, however, Long-Bailey remains the leftwing candidate with by far the best chance of getting on the ballot paper. As such, she is likely to have the weight of Momentum\u2019s formidable campaigning machine behind her. Other candidates will hope to attract thousands of new registered supporters as Corbyn did in 2015 to bolster their cause, provided the NEC, which has sweeping powers over the race, does not try to limit their ability to do so.

      "bodyText": "\u201cYou are watching the destruction of a political leader,\u201d the former Hawke government press secretary, Barrie Cassidy, said after watching the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in the bushfire devastated NSW town of Cobargo. Leaders are often heckled. In the partisan business of politics, plenty of handshakes have been refused. To experts in public relations, Morrison\u2019s dramatic visit to the bushfire-ravaged village of Cobargo felt like something else \u2013 the political death of a salesman, a snowballing of anger at the way Morrison has dodged, dismissed and downplayed the unprecedented natural disaster. \u201cThose images would be devastating for a leader of any political persuasion,\u201d says David Marshall, the former head of Canberra Tourism and Events and a communications strategist who wrote a PhD thesis on the Howard government\u2019s media management. \u201cThe prime minister has really got to re-look at the rhetoric and the messages, particularly his New Year\u2019s message when he [downplayed] the fire situation. People don\u2019t like that. This is devastation, and that messaging from him has been completely off-putting. \u201cThat has characterised the snowballing of this issue.\u201d Time and again, for better and worse, crises have defined political leaders. After the September 11 attacks, George W Bush registered approval ratings of 92%, the highest ever recorded by pollster Gallup. After Hurricane Katrina in 2006, Bush\u2019s approval ratings plummeted after a photograph of him surveying the devastation from the window of Air Force One contributed to a belief he was disconnected from the reality of the unfolding humanitarian crisis. Marshall said John Howard\u2019s reputation was defined by his response to the Port Arthur massacre, which marked him as a strong national leader in a way that transcended party politics. \u201cThe Port Arthur massacre and the initiative he took in the gun buyback certainly were the foundations of [Howard\u2019s] prime ministership. It happened so early after he was elected. \u201cScott Morrison has unfortunately through his policies on climate change, his refusal to meet with the former fire chiefs ... and then him going to Hawaii, the combination of those events have put him on the back foot in relation to how people would assume a leader should react and act in a situation of crisis.\u201d Morrison\u2019s unannounced holiday to Hawaii itself became a public relations disaster, partly because of denials issued by the prime minister\u2019s office when rumours began to circulate. On his way home, slightly earlier than expected, Morrison gave a radio interview and said: \u201cI know Australians understand this and they\u2019ll be pleased I\u2019m coming back, I\u2019m sure, but they know I don\u2019t hold a hose, I don\u2019t sit in a control room.\u201d Morrison, a former head of Tourism Australia had been lampooned on social media as \u201cScotty from Marketing\u201d for his spin-heavy turn of phrase. Most notable of those expressions are the notion of the \u201cCanberra bubble\u201d and the implicit message that he is better connected to real people, the \u201cQuiet Australians\u201d. Marshall said Morrison\u2019s decision to hold a garden party at Kirribilli House for the Australian and New Zealand cricket teams highlighted \u201cthe remoteness of that experience to what tens of thousands of Australians were experiencing, the devastation of the bushfires\u201d. The visit to Cobargo on Thursday evening would have been an attempt to reconnect with citizens, but it backfired. Cassidy remarked on Twitter that Morrison had been unravelled \u201cnot by his own party but by his own hand\u201d. Marshall said the images, which have now been broadcast around the world, could be difficult for Morrison to shake. Much of the reaction has focused on the way he forced two unwilling people \u2013 a young woman and a volunteer firefighter, who both lost their homes \u2013 to shake his hand. \u201cThe shouting and abuse that went on surrounding those visits. Rather than sitting down and facing the situation that he turned and walked towards his car and drove off. If you\u2019re a leader you need to lead,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly now trying [to reverse that impression]. He\u2019s been out there trying to talk to lots of people and trying to take the initiative. That\u2019s to be commended, because he needs to do that as prime minister. But the damage has already been done. \u201cIf you look at how Daniel Andrews has handled the situation in Victoria, and Gladys Berejiklian in New South Wales, they\u2019ve been very proactive at a state level, people have been watching them and that\u2019s leadership.\u201d The footage of such focused rage in regional Australia will also dispel a narrative that anger towards Morrison is a social media phenomenon, not one that existed in the real world. Criticism, such as from NSW minister Andrew Constance, a fellow Liberal, has crossed the political divide. The situation has unmade Morrison\u2019s two most successful marketing phrases. The Canberra bubble has become the Kirribilli bubble, with the prime minister firmly inside. The quiet Australians credited for Morrison\u2019s election win have found their voice.",

      "bodyText": "A former Fox News reporter has added her name to the list of nearly two dozen women who have accused Donald Trump of making unwanted sexual advances towards them. In a book published next week, the Fox &amp; Friends fill-in host Courtney Friel claims Trump propositioned her before he became US president. \u201cYou should come up to my office sometime, so we can kiss,\u201d Friel says Trump told her, adding that he considered her \u201cthe hottest one at Fox News\u201d. The claims, reported by the New York Daily News, are contained in Friel\u2019s upcoming memoir, Tonight At 10: Kicking Booze and Breaking News. Friel, 39, says Trump\u2019s come-on was made during a phone call to her office weeks after she mentioned an interest in working as a judge on his Miss USA beauty pageant. She says she was shocked by the proposition, which \u201ccame out of nowhere\u201d. \u201c\u2018Donald,\u2019 I responded, \u2018I believe we\u2019re both married.\u2019 I quickly ended the call,\u201d she wrote in her book. \u201cThis proposition made it difficult for me to report with a straight face on Trump running for president. It infuriated me that he would call all the women who shared stories of his bold advances liars. I totally believe them,\u201d she says. Friel, who now works at KTLA in Los Angeles, joins a long line of accusers who say the president has sexually harassed or assaulted them. In November, Summer Zervos, a former contestant Trump\u2019s The Apprentice reality TV show, presented court evidence to support claims that Trump sexually assaulted her in a hotel room in 2007. Zevos first made her claims in 2016 after audio emerged of Trump boasting to Access Hollywood\u2019s Billy Bush about grabbing women\u2019s genitals. While Friel and Zevos\u2019 claims are not as well known as those leveled by Stormy Daniels or Karen McDougal, they bring the total number of women who have come forward accusing Trump of sexual misconduct of varying degrees to more than 20, according to a Guardian tally in November. The White House claims the women are lying, while Trump has suggested some were not attractive enough for him to want to sexually assault.",

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The drone strike came at a time when Iraq was already on the brink of an all-out proxy war, and hours after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/iraq-riots-embassy-expose-america-weaker-fewer-options\">two-day siege</a> of the US embassy in Baghdad by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/us-embassy-stormed-in-baghdad\">mob of PM</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/us-embassy-stormed-in-baghdad\">F militants</a> and their supporters.

      "bodyText": "The Middle East is starting the decade under the shadow of a major new conflict, as Iran vows to take revenge for the US drone strike that killed its most powerful general, Qassem Suleimani. The Pentagon ordered 3,000 reinforcements to the region, diplomats were reportedly told to pack their bags in case of sudden evacuation, and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called his counterparts around the world to try to persuade them the US was \u201ccommitted to de-escalation\u201d. However, there were signs overnight that the US was continuing operations against Iranian allies in Iraq, with air strikes reported against the Shia Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) in a motorcade in north Baghdad in the early hours of Saturday. According to Reuters, six people were killed and three were critically wounded. In Syria and Iraq, there was some rejoicing at Suleimani\u2019s death. The ruthless commander was implicated in tens of thousands of civilian deaths, but the general reaction in world capitals was apprehension. \u201cThis is a moment in which leaders must exercise maximum restraint,\u201d the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said. \u201cThe world cannot afford another war in the Gulf.\u201d The Iranian supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, ordered three days of mourning and declared that the US would face \u201csevere revenge\u201d for the killing of Suleimani, who ran Tehran\u2019s military operations in Iraq and Syria. The incoming commander of the Quds Force, Esmail Ghaani, was quoted on al-Jazeera as saying: \u201cWe tell everyone, be patient and see the dead bodies of Americans all over the Middle East.\u201d In a brief address from his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago on Friday afternoon, Donald Trump described Suleimani as \u201cthe number one terrorist anywhere in the world\u201d, and claimed the 62-year-old general was planning \u201cimminent and sinister\u201d attacks on US diplomats and personnel. But the US president said that he was not seeking regime change in Iran, saying: \u201cWe did not take action to start a war.\u201d An initial Pentagon statement about the Suleimani killing said only that it was aimed at \u201cdeterring future Iranian attack plans\u201d, but Pompeo later suggested that an actual attack plan by Iran had been in motion and had been foiled by the assassination. \u201cHe was actively plotting in the region to take actions \u2013 a big action, as he described it \u2013 that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk,\u201d the US secretary of state told CNN. Briefing reporters, a senior US official said the imminent attacks that Suleimani is alleged to have been preparing would have been in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. \u201cThese were attacks targeting American diplomats, American military personnel, and facilities that house Americans,\u201d the official said. Suleimani died in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, when his car was targeted by a drone as local allies from the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) were driving him from the airport. The de facto leader of the PMF, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a close Suleimani associate, was also killed in the attack. US officials said that the US became aware that Suleimani was touring the region, contacting local allies and planning attacks with them. \u201cHe\u2019s not there on vacation. He is there for the specific purpose to plan multiple attacks against Americans and facilities, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s hanging out with Muhandis [the PMF militia deputy commander],\u201d said a senior state department official. The former US general David Petraeus, who fought a battle of wits with Suleimani when he was US force commander in Iraq, said he was \u201cin my view, the second most important person in Iran and the most important Iranian regionally\u201d. \u201cThe question that looms now, of course, is how do Iranian forces and their proxies throughout the region and beyond respond to this attack?\u201d Petraeus told the Guardian. Agnes Callamard, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, said on Twitter that as a legal justification for the attack in which 10 people were killed, the Pentagon\u2019s claims were \u201cvery vague\u201d. \u201cFuture is not the same as imminent, which is the time-based test required under international law,\u201d she said. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, said Suleimani\u2019s \u201cmartyrdom\u201d would make the country more determined to resist America. \u201cWith no doubt, Iran and other freedom-seeking countries in the region will take his revenge,\u201d he said. Tehran\u2019s Lebanon-based ally Hezbollah also promised to avenge the killing. In Iraq, Hadi al-Ameri, an Iran ally and head of the paramilitary Badr Organisation, called on all Iraqi factions to expel foreign troops.

The decision came after consultation between the coach, Chris Silverwood, and Ashley Giles, the director of cricket, who arrives in South Africa next week.</p> <p>Despite the hugely popular matches now being banned, Pope, who top-scored with an unbeaten 56 on day one in Cape Town, admitted: \u201cWe do understand the reasons. It keeps us going sometimes on long tours but it\u2019s obviously very frustrating for Burnsy and everyone that he\u2019s gone, so we\u2019ll cop that one. We\u2019ll find something else to get us having a laugh in the morning. It\u2019s a freak accident, these things happen and hopefully we won\u2019t have any more.\u201d</p> <p>The injury to Burns came after a catastrophic start to the tour for England which saw 11 players \u2013 including Pope \u2013 struck down with a virus before and during the team\u2019s first-Test defeat at Centurion. Jofra Archer is missing this Test with an elbow injury. There are now fears the fast bowler could be ruled out for the rest of the series after England confirmed he was sent for a second scan on the injury on Friday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a66b53d8b9b108133c5148b6a8a2e7429663a516\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a66b53d8b9b108133c5148b6a8a2e7429663a516/0_224_3632_2180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Burns was ruled out of the series after suffering an injury while playing football\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Burns was ruled out of the series after suffering an injury while playing football.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been one of those tours really,\u201d said Pope. \u201cThe first game was ridiculous, pretty much everyone getting ill at some point. Unfortunately Burnsy\u2019s injury happened, we\u2019re all gutted for him because it\u2019s a bit of a freak accident, and then Jof\u2019s not playing as well.\u201d</p> <p>Pope was the only member of England\u2019s top seven to reach 50, despite six batsmen \u2013 including Ben Stokes who made 47 \u2013 all getting starts. On a true batting pitch, that profligacy could cost the tourists over the coming days.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a missed opportunity,\u201d said Pope. \u201cI\u2019m sure Stokesy is pretty frustrated as well, as he was playing the aggressor role and I was just getting into my innings and finding my way.

These things happen and hopefully we can learn from the mistakes we made.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good wicket but definitely there\u2019s a little bit in it for the seamers, even with the old ball. There\u2019s definitely something there. We\u2019ll find out how the wicket really is after the next day or two, when both teams have bowled on it.

      "bodyText": "Ollie Pope says England\u2019s players have accepted the ban on football after the opener Rory Burns was ruled out of the rest of the series against South Africa with an ankle injury. Burns, who averages 55 this winter, sustained ligament damage to his left ankle during the customary pre-training game of football between the players on the eve of the second Test at Newlands. The 29-year-old will return home in the coming days for treatment with the hope he will recover in time for England\u2019s two-Test series in Sri Lanka in March. As the Guardian revealed on Thursday, Burns\u2019s injury, coming 13 months after Jonny Bairstow missed two ODIs and a Test in Sri Lanka following a similar football-related mishap, has prompted England\u2019s management to ban football. The decision came after consultation between the coach, Chris Silverwood, and Ashley Giles, the director of cricket, who arrives in South Africa next week. Despite the hugely popular matches now being banned, Pope, who top-scored with an unbeaten 56 on day one in Cape Town, admitted: \u201cWe do understand the reasons. It keeps us going sometimes on long tours but it\u2019s obviously very frustrating for Burnsy and everyone that he\u2019s gone, so we\u2019ll cop that one. We\u2019ll find something else to get us having a laugh in the morning. It\u2019s a freak accident, these things happen and hopefully we won\u2019t have any more.\u201d The injury to Burns came after a catastrophic start to the tour for England which saw 11 players \u2013 including Pope \u2013 struck down with a virus before and during the team\u2019s first-Test defeat at Centurion. Jofra Archer is missing this Test with an elbow injury. There are now fears the fast bowler could be ruled out for the rest of the series after England confirmed he was sent for a second scan on the injury on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s been one of those tours really,\u201d said Pope. \u201cThe first game was ridiculous, pretty much everyone getting ill at some point. Unfortunately Burnsy\u2019s injury happened, we\u2019re all gutted for him because it\u2019s a bit of a freak accident, and then Jof\u2019s not playing as well.\u201d Pope was the only member of England\u2019s top seven to reach 50, despite six batsmen \u2013 including Ben Stokes who made 47 \u2013 all getting starts. On a true batting pitch, that profligacy could cost the tourists over the coming days. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a missed opportunity,\u201d said Pope. \u201cI\u2019m sure Stokesy is pretty frustrated as well, as he was playing the aggressor role and I was just getting into my innings and finding my way. It was a shame. He\u2019ll be as annoyed as anyone I\u2019m sure. These things happen and hopefully we can learn from the mistakes we made. \u201cIt\u2019s a good wicket but definitely there\u2019s a little bit in it for the seamers, even with the old ball. There\u2019s definitely something there. We\u2019ll find out how the wicket really is after the next day or two, when both teams have bowled on it. Hopefully we can expose whatever there is in it.\u201d",

Russia said both leaders agreed the American \u201caction might seriously escalate tensions in the region\u201d.</p> \n<p>Reflecting French concerns that the strikes will drive Iraqi public opinion against a continued US troop presence in the country, the foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said: \u201cThe priority must be to continue the actions of the international coalition against Daesh [Islamic State], which [the coalition] is operating in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi authorities and in support of Iraqi security forces. The coalition\u2019s continuity is essential to preserving the achievements of five years of combat against Daesh and guaranteeing a lasting victory against terrorism throughout the entire region.\u201d</p> \n<p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he consulted on Friday with his German, British and Chinese counterparts about the strike, seeking to reassure them that the US was seeking to de-escalate the crisis.</p> \n<p>The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, was the most critical of the European voices, stressing he had told Pompeo that Germany expected US restraint. Maas tweeted: \u201cThe US military operation followed a series of dangerous provocations by Iran. However, this action has not made it easier to reduce tensions. I made this point clearly to Pompeo as well.\u201d</p> \n<p>The German Green foreign policy spokesman, Omid Nouripour, called for a suspension of all German military operations in Iraq. \u201cAgainst the background of massive changes in the political environment, the effectiveness of this mission can no longer be demonstrated,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>In a statement that neither condemned nor condoned the killing of Suleimani, the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: \u201cWe have always recognised the aggressive threat posed by the Iranian Quds force led by Qassem Suleimani. Following his death, we urge all parties to de-escalate. Further conflict is in none of our interests.\u201d</p> \n<p>Britain was not consulted about the strike, even though 400 British troops are in Iraq training Iraqi security forces. Equally, the UK was not consulted on Trump\u2019s decision to pull 5,000 troops out of Syria.</p> \n<p>The clearest statement of support for Trump\u2019s action came from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cJust as Israel has the right of self-defence, the United States has exactly the same right,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cQassem Suleimani is responsible for the death of American citizens and many other innocent people. He was planning more such attacks. President Trump deserves all the credit for acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.\u201d</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in the Middle East, the pro-US Gulf states were cautiously supportive.</p> \n<p>But Syria\u2019s President Assad, who received crucial support from Suleimani in pushing back rebel forces, said: \u201cThe memory of martyr Suleimani will stay immortal in the consciousness of the Syrian people. They will not forget that he stood by the Syrian Arab Army in defending Syria against terrorism and its supporters.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many European capitals will fear that likely Iranian reprisals could deal a near-fatal blow to their efforts to keep the nuclear deal, and wider European relations with Iran, on life support until the possible election next year of a new, more strategic US president willing to keep diplomatic lines open to Tehran.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b926d384-5bf5-4618-af54-9966bf75a57c\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Qassem Suleimani, killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad, had become well known among Iranians and was sometimes discussed as a future president. Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the short term, hardliners within Iran are likely to benefit politically from the US airstrike in parliamentary elections this spring. The killing also makes it certain Iran will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/iran-announces-injection-of-uranium-gas-into-1044-centrifuges\">take its fifth step</a> away from the nuclear deal in the next few days.</p> \n<p>Tehran has been staging a phased withdrawal from the agreement in what it says is a response to US sanctions and the European failure to meet commitments to trade with Iran. Plans for the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to travel to the US for a meeting of the UN security council in New York are also likely to be jettisoned.</p> \n<p>European leaders will be equally concerned that the drone strike might destabilise Iraq further and encourage the Iraqi parliament to go ahead with pre-existing plans to vote to eject all US forces. The prediction by Pompeo, that the killing of Suleimani would lead to \u201cdancing in the streets of Baghdad\u201d is not universally shared.</p> \n<p>More predictably, the attacks were condemned by the Russian foreign ministry, a close ally of Iran in Syria, as \u201ca reckless step that is likely to lead to an escalation of tensions in the region\u201d.</p> \n<p>China criticised the use of violence in international relations, saying: \u201cThe People\u2019s Republic calls on the countries involved \u2013 especially the United States \u2013 to remain calm and to avoid a further escalation of the situation.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The assassination of Qassem Suleimani may have dealt a devastating blow to hopes of keeping the Iran nuclear deal alive until the US elections next year, European diplomats fear. There is also concern that the Iraqi parliament will seek to expel the 5,000 US troops based in Iraq, with unpredictable consequences for the region, including the fight against Islamic State. These private concerns were voiced as European politicians publicly called for all sides to de-escalate the crisis, appeals that are unlikely to be heeded in Tehran, which is intent on some form of reprisal. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, consulted with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, by phone and called on Iran to refrain from escalating the crisis. Russia said both leaders agreed the American \u201caction might seriously escalate tensions in the region\u201d. Reflecting French concerns that the strikes will drive Iraqi public opinion against a continued US troop presence in the country, the foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said: \u201cThe priority must be to continue the actions of the international coalition against Daesh [Islamic State], which [the coalition] is operating in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi authorities and in support of Iraqi security forces. The coalition\u2019s continuity is essential to preserving the achievements of five years of combat against Daesh and guaranteeing a lasting victory against terrorism throughout the entire region.\u201d The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he consulted on Friday with his German, British and Chinese counterparts about the strike, seeking to reassure them that the US was seeking to de-escalate the crisis. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, was the most critical of the European voices, stressing he had told Pompeo that Germany expected US restraint. Maas tweeted: \u201cThe US military operation followed a series of dangerous provocations by Iran. However, this action has not made it easier to reduce tensions. I made this point clearly to Pompeo as well.\u201d The German Green foreign policy spokesman, Omid Nouripour, called for a suspension of all German military operations in Iraq. \u201cAgainst the background of massive changes in the political environment, the effectiveness of this mission can no longer be demonstrated,\u201d he said. In a statement that neither condemned nor condoned the killing of Suleimani, the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: \u201cWe have always recognised the aggressive threat posed by the Iranian Quds force led by Qassem Suleimani. Following his death, we urge all parties to de-escalate. Further conflict is in none of our interests.\u201d Britain was not consulted about the strike, even though 400 British troops are in Iraq training Iraqi security forces. Equally, the UK was not consulted on Trump\u2019s decision to pull 5,000 troops out of Syria. The clearest statement of support for Trump\u2019s action came from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cJust as Israel has the right of self-defence, the United States has exactly the same right,\u201d he said. \u201cQassem Suleimani is responsible for the death of American citizens and many other innocent people. He was planning more such attacks. President Trump deserves all the credit for acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.\u201d Elsewhere in the Middle East, the pro-US Gulf states were cautiously supportive. But Syria\u2019s President Assad, who received crucial support from Suleimani in pushing back rebel forces, said: \u201cThe memory of martyr Suleimani will stay immortal in the consciousness of the Syrian people. They will not forget that he stood by the Syrian Arab Army in defending Syria against terrorism and its supporters.\u201d Many European capitals will fear that likely Iranian reprisals could deal a near-fatal blow to their efforts to keep the nuclear deal, and wider European relations with Iran, on life support until the possible election next year of a new, more strategic US president willing to keep diplomatic lines open to Tehran. In the short term, hardliners within Iran are likely to benefit politically from the US airstrike in parliamentary elections this spring. The killing also makes it certain Iran will take its fifth step away from the nuclear deal in the next few days. Tehran has been staging a phased withdrawal from the agreement in what it says is a response to US sanctions and the European failure to meet commitments to trade with Iran. Plans for the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to travel to the US for a meeting of the UN security council in New York are also likely to be jettisoned. European leaders will be equally concerned that the drone strike might destabilise Iraq further and encourage the Iraqi parliament to go ahead with pre-existing plans to vote to eject all US forces. The prediction by Pompeo, that the killing of Suleimani would lead to \u201cdancing in the streets of Baghdad\u201d is not universally shared. More predictably, the attacks were condemned by the Russian foreign ministry, a close ally of Iran in Syria, as \u201ca reckless step that is likely to lead to an escalation of tensions in the region\u201d. China criticised the use of violence in international relations, saying: \u201cThe People\u2019s Republic calls on the countries involved \u2013 especially the United States \u2013 to remain calm and to avoid a further escalation of the situation.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/24/former-labour-mp-andrew-miller-dies-aged-70\" title=\"\">Andrew Miller</a>, the former Labour MP, who has died aged 70, was partly responsible for one of the most far-reaching pieces of employment legislation to have been enacted before the fall of the last Labour government in 2010. He was an unsung hero whose backbench attempt to introduce a new law to give equal rights to temporary and agency workers would lead to the eventual government decision to implement the European Union\u2019s controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/sep/16/agency-workers-directive-temps\" title=\"\">Agency Workers Directive</a>.</p> <p>During the second reading debate of his temporary and agency workers (equal treatment) bill in 2008, Miller acknowledged the widespread opposition in Whitehall to the proposed legislation. But he called in evidence in favour of his bill a recent speech made by the then prime minister, Gordon Brown, who had envisaged the state of the British economy in 2020 with a skilled workforce engaged in a race for the top. It was, argued Miller, the provisions of his planned legislation that would provide the necessary motivation for the workforce to fulfil such an expectation and to do so was not only morally correct but in the long-term interest of the economy. His bill was nevertheless dropped because of government opposition, only to be reintroduced two years later in almost identical form as the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/93/contents/made\" title=\"\">Agency Workers Regulations Act</a>.</p> <p>Miller was a modest man who was unusually self-deprecating for a politician. He described himself as having been naive about the nature of politics when he arrived, somewhat unexpectedly, in the House of Commons in 1992 as the victorious Labour candidate who had overturned a Conservative majority to win the constituency of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellesmere_Port_and_Neston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)#Elections_in_the_2000s\" title=\"\">Ellesmere Port and Neston</a>, despite John Major having secured the return of a Conservative government for another five years in that election.</p> <p>But Miller swiftly demonstrated that he was far from naive in recognising the extent to which the career pattern of any individual politician was often determined by the sort of patronage he himself was not prepared to pursue. Instead he forged his own path, using his personal expertise from his previous employment to promote the interests of science in politics; his proudest achievement was as the first person elected by the Commons to chair the science and technology committee, a post he held from 2010 until he stood down as an MP in 2015.</p> <p>Born in Isleworth, west London, Andrew was the son of Ernest Miller, a civil servant, and his wife, Daphne. The family moved to Malta and then Hampshire, following Ernest\u2019s work. Andrew went to Hayling Island secondary school, then Highbury Technical College, Portsmouth, and in 1967 began work as a laboratory technician in the geology department at what was then Portsmouth Polytechnic (now the University of Portsmouth). He joined the Labour party the following year when his complaint about the actions of a rogue landlord led to the issue of a personal challenge to him to \u201cget involved\u201d in politics. </p> <p>By 1976 his political interest was sufficiently developed for him to leave his job and study for a diploma in industrial relations at the London School of Economics and then, in 1977, to become an official with the white-collar scientific trade union ASTMS (Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs), later the MSF (Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union). He moved to the north-west with his work as a divisional officer and, having married Frances Ewan in 1975, made his home in that area.</p> <p>He had no intention of making a career in politics but was invited to contest the election in 1992. One of his first tasks on arrival at Westminster was to escort a school group from his constituency around the Houses of Parliament, an event arranged somewhat optimistically by his Conservative predecessor, and which proved in the event as educational for Miller as for the children. By 1997 the surge of popular support that swept Tony Blair into office had led to Miller increasing his parliamentary majority from under 2,000 to more than 16,000, and he was invited to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/27/john-prescott-ive-only-ever-been-in-two-or-three-fights\" title=\"\">John Prescott</a>\u2019s campaign team at Westminster, where he had a post under the new deputy prime minister.</p> <p>He was more interested in constituency work, however, and for more than a year became deeply involved in a campaign on behalf of his constituent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/29/4\" title=\"\">Louise Woodward</a>, the English nanny who had been convicted of murder in the US after the death of an eight-month-old baby in her charge. Partly as a result of that campaign her offence was reduced on appeal to one of involuntary manslaughter, and Woodward returned to the UK in 1998.</p> <p>Miller had been asked to prepare a paper on intellectual property rights for the prime minister\u2019s office and as a consequence, in 2001, was given a roving role advising ministers in the Department of Trade and Industry on issues of scientific policy. After the 2005 election he was appointed chairman of the select committee on regulatory reform, a subject dear to him and which he pursued vigorously until his last days in parliament. He took part in the innovatory <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/backbench-business-committee/news/mps-take-part-in-valedictory-debate-for-retiring-mps/\" title=\"\">\u201cvaledictory debate\u201d for retiring MPs in 2015</a>.</p> <p>After leaving politics, he continued to work in science policy at the universities of Sheffield and Chester. He was a member of the <a href=\"https://ukrio.org/\" title=\"\">UK Research Integrity Office</a>, a body that oversees the ethics of research programmes, and of the Royal Society\u2019s science policy advisory group. He was awarded an honorary DSc by Chester University in 2014 and was an honorary fellow of Liverpool John Moores University in 2015.</p> <p>He is survived by Fran and their two sons and daughter.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Peter Miller, politician, born 23 March 1949; died 24 December 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Miller, the former Labour MP, who has died aged 70, was partly responsible for one of the most far-reaching pieces of employment legislation to have been enacted before the fall of the last Labour government in 2010. He was an unsung hero whose backbench attempt to introduce a new law to give equal rights to temporary and agency workers would lead to the eventual government decision to implement the European Union\u2019s controversial Agency Workers Directive. During the second reading debate of his temporary and agency workers (equal treatment) bill in 2008, Miller acknowledged the widespread opposition in Whitehall to the proposed legislation. But he called in evidence in favour of his bill a recent speech made by the then prime minister, Gordon Brown, who had envisaged the state of the British economy in 2020 with a skilled workforce engaged in a race for the top. It was, argued Miller, the provisions of his planned legislation that would provide the necessary motivation for the workforce to fulfil such an expectation and to do so was not only morally correct but in the long-term interest of the economy. His bill was nevertheless dropped because of government opposition, only to be reintroduced two years later in almost identical form as the Agency Workers Regulations Act. Miller was a modest man who was unusually self-deprecating for a politician. He described himself as having been naive about the nature of politics when he arrived, somewhat unexpectedly, in the House of Commons in 1992 as the victorious Labour candidate who had overturned a Conservative majority to win the constituency of Ellesmere Port and Neston, despite John Major having secured the return of a Conservative government for another five years in that election. But Miller swiftly demonstrated that he was far from naive in recognising the extent to which the career pattern of any individual politician was often determined by the sort of patronage he himself was not prepared to pursue. Instead he forged his own path, using his personal expertise from his previous employment to promote the interests of science in politics; his proudest achievement was as the first person elected by the Commons to chair the science and technology committee, a post he held from 2010 until he stood down as an MP in 2015. Born in Isleworth, west London, Andrew was the son of Ernest Miller, a civil servant, and his wife, Daphne. The family moved to Malta and then Hampshire, following Ernest\u2019s work. Andrew went to Hayling Island secondary school, then Highbury Technical College, Portsmouth, and in 1967 began work as a laboratory technician in the geology department at what was then Portsmouth Polytechnic (now the University of Portsmouth). He joined the Labour party the following year when his complaint about the actions of a rogue landlord led to the issue of a personal challenge to him to \u201cget involved\u201d in politics. By 1976 his political interest was sufficiently developed for him to leave his job and study for a diploma in industrial relations at the London School of Economics and then, in 1977, to become an official with the white-collar scientific trade union ASTMS (Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs), later the MSF (Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union). He moved to the north-west with his work as a divisional officer and, having married Frances Ewan in 1975, made his home in that area. He had no intention of making a career in politics but was invited to contest the election in 1992. One of his first tasks on arrival at Westminster was to escort a school group from his constituency around the Houses of Parliament, an event arranged somewhat optimistically by his Conservative predecessor, and which proved in the event as educational for Miller as for the children. By 1997 the surge of popular support that swept Tony Blair into office had led to Miller increasing his parliamentary majority from under 2,000 to more than 16,000, and he was invited to join John Prescott\u2019s campaign team at Westminster, where he had a post under the new deputy prime minister. He was more interested in constituency work, however, and for more than a year became deeply involved in a campaign on behalf of his constituent Louise Woodward, the English nanny who had been convicted of murder in the US after the death of an eight-month-old baby in her charge. Partly as a result of that campaign her offence was reduced on appeal to one of involuntary manslaughter, and Woodward returned to the UK in 1998. Miller had been asked to prepare a paper on intellectual property rights for the prime minister\u2019s office and as a consequence, in 2001, was given a roving role advising ministers in the Department of Trade and Industry on issues of scientific policy. After the 2005 election he was appointed chairman of the select committee on regulatory reform, a subject dear to him and which he pursued vigorously until his last days in parliament. He took part in the innovatory \u201cvaledictory debate\u201d for retiring MPs in 2015. After leaving politics, he continued to work in science policy at the universities of Sheffield and Chester. He was a member of the UK Research Integrity Office, a body that oversees the ethics of research programmes, and of the Royal Society\u2019s science policy advisory group. He was awarded an honorary DSc by Chester University in 2014 and was an honorary fellow of Liverpool John Moores University in 2015. He is survived by Fran and their two sons and daughter. \u2022 Andrew Peter Miller, politician, born 23 March 1949; died 24 December 2019",

The group was briefly received in the VIP section of Baghdad airport in a nod to their status, before starting the journey into the centre of the Iraqi capital, a place Suleimani knew well.</p> \n<p>Through the height of Iraq\u2019s sectarian war, when Suleimani had consolidated his extraordinary hold on the country, the drive in from Baghdad\u2019s airport was perilous. Car bombs and machine guns on either side regularly killed those who ran the gauntlet. This time, however, the foe was lurking in the darkness overhead: a US Reaper drone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b926d384-5bf5-4618-af54-9966bf75a57c\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Qassem Suleimani, killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad, had become well known among Iranians and was sometimes discussed as a future president. Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops.

      "bodyText": "He had made the journey dozens of times, boarding a plane that did not include his name on the manifest and landing at an airport where his arrival was not registered. As Qassem Suleimani criss-crossed the region over the past 20 years, there was next to no trace of his movements. The flight he took from Damascus airport in the early hours of Friday would have seemed no different. When the 62-year-old Iranian general landed in Baghdad with his entourage, two cars were waiting on the tarmac along with a reception party. Greetings would have been warm but brief in the still winter air, before the men were whisked away in the two nondescript vehicles, a Toyota Avalon and a Hyundai Starex minibus. The group was briefly received in the VIP section of Baghdad airport in a nod to their status, before starting the journey into the centre of the Iraqi capital, a place Suleimani knew well. Through the height of Iraq\u2019s sectarian war, when Suleimani had consolidated his extraordinary hold on the country, the drive in from Baghdad\u2019s airport was perilous. Car bombs and machine guns on either side regularly killed those who ran the gauntlet. This time, however, the foe was lurking in the darkness overhead: a US Reaper drone. The convoy had not even made it out of the airport compound when rockets sliced through the roofs of the vehicles, killing everyone inside both cars and ending the reign of the most influential figure in the Middle East \u2013 a man so powerful he was considered off limits by previous US administrations \u2013 in a violent flash. Senior Iraqi officials said Suleimani\u2019s body was almost destroyed in the attack, but at least one hand was largely undamaged, allowing him to be identified by a ring he always wore. Pictures circulating on social media purported to show the ring \u2013 a large oval, deep-red stone in a silver setting \u2013 on a hand distorted by the explosion and covered in mud. Suleimani, more than anyone else, had shaped events across the entire region. He was feared, loathed and admired by his pursuers in equal measure. Tracking him down had been a difficult ask until recently, and assassinating him unthinkable. That changed in the second half of last year. By then, Suleimani had shaken off the Keyser S\u00f6ze image that had been characteristic of his early years, in which his aegis was well understood but the man himself had remained shrouded in sinister mystery.

      "bodyText": "Law enforcement agencies in several major US cities have issued alerts advising residents to be vigilant in the wake of the US strike against Iran\u2019s top general as officials said they were stepping up security efforts at sensitive locations. Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security, said his agency was working with law enforcement officials and others across the country and was ready to respond to any threats, though none had yet been detected. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced he was consulting with city officials about steps the the police department will take to protect key locations \u201cfrom any attempt by Iran or its terrorist allies to retaliate against America\u201d. The city will be \u201cvigilant against this threat for a long time to come\u201d, De Blasio tweeted The New York police commissioner, Dermot Shea, added: \u201cNYPD continues to closely monitor the events in Iran &amp; across the region for any further developments. While there are no specific / credible threats to #NYC, we\u2019ve deployed additional resources to key locations. As always, if you see something, say something.\u201d Los Angeles, home to a sizable US-Iranian population, also issued an alert hours after the US strike on Qassem Suleimani, asking \u201cevery Angeleno to say something if you see something\u201d. The communication was followed by a second Los Angeles police department (LAPD) message, posted on Twitter, that also emphasized there was no current threat. \u201cWhile there is no credible threat to Los Angeles, the LAPD is monitoring the events developing in Iran. We will continue to communicate with state, local, federal and international law enforcement partners regarding any significant intel that may develop.\u201d The warnings came as the US state department urged its US citizens to leave Iraq \u201cimmediately\u201d. The US embassy in Baghdad, which was attacked by Iran-backed militiamen and other protesters earlier this week, is closed and all consular services have been suspended. The intervention of domestic law enforcement comes amid newly rising tension over foreign-backed terrorism. In November, a \u201csleeper agent\u201d of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese group listed by US authorities as a foreign terrorist organization, was sentenced to 40 years in prison by a federal court over plans to conduct terrorist attacks around New York. Prosecutors claimed that Ali Kourani was \u201crecruited, trained and deployed by Hezbollah\u2019s Islamic Jihad Organization\u201d and had spent \u201cyears conducting surveillance on the city\u2019s critical infrastructure, federal buildings, international airports, and even daycare centers\u201d. The FBI assistant director William F Sweeney Jr said Kourani\u2019s arrest was \u201ca reminder to us all that New York City and its surrounding areas remain primary targets for those looking to conduct a violent attack against our way of life\u201d.",

On the one hand, the closest we have to a Trump doctrine of foreign policy is an aversion to military entanglements, especially in the Middle East. He has derided his predecessors, Republican and Democrat, for getting bogged down in unwinnable wars in that region. In October he <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/donald-trump-vows-blood-stained-middle-east-191024074507902.html\" title=\"\">spelled it out</a> explicitly: \u201cWe\u2019re getting out.

Suleimani was <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-shadow-commander\" title=\"\">more than a mere general</a>: he was the architect of Iran\u2019s policy in the region; the mastermind behind its proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq; a close ally of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei; a possible future president. There is no way Tehran can let his death go unavenged. Tellingly, and for the very first time, Khamenei attended (and chaired) a meeting of Iran\u2019s national security council on Friday to discuss the country\u2019s response. A ruling circle divided over its nuclear ambitions is now united in fury at this killing \u2013 and Iran has shown before, with terror strikes as far away as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/iran-argentina-jewish-centre-amia-bombing\" title=\"\">Argentina</a>, that its arm is long.</p> \n<p>How, then, to square these two things? How to make sense of a US president supposedly against Middle Eastern wars nevertheless risking war by escalating an already tense standoff with one of the region\u2019s dominant powers?</p> \n<p>An immediate answer is to say that you can\u2019t, that there is no logic to be found because Trump will not have thought through the implications of his actions. This was not JFK during the Cuban missile crisis, surrounded by generals, diplomats and top-drawer cabinet secretaries, but Donald Trump on vacation at Mar-a-Lago, circled by the yes men and nodding dogs that now constitute his inner team. Trump is a stranger to strategic thinking, driven chiefly by his gut, unable to think even one move ahead. The contrast with the Iranians, engaged in a 40-year long game aimed at driving the US out of the Middle East, is sharp. In the words of one US analyst, \u201cWe\u2019re playing checkers. The Iranians are playing chess.\u201d</p> \n<p>Viewed like this, the Suleimani assassination may seem to contradict Trump\u2019s policy, but it\u2019s wholly in keeping with his character. For one thing, as Karin von Hippel, a state department official under Barack Obama and now director of the Royal United Services Institute, puts it, \u201cTrump likes to look macho.\u201d The short, sharp shock of a tactical strike appeals to him, just as it did when he <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43767156\" title=\"\">fired a few cruise missiles</a> at Syria to slap the wrist of the Assad regime over the use of chemical weapons. It looks strong and decisive, while apparently avoiding any risk of being dragged into a quagmire.</p> \n<p>Some have noted that both George W Bush and Obama had opportunities to kill Suleimani and chose not to, seeing this as evidence of Trump\u2019s recklessness. And yet that\u2019s precisely why this move would have appealed to Trump. He prides himself on daring to wade in where his predecessors feared to tread, with the 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/13/ivanka-trump-in-jerusalem-for-embassy-opening-as-gaza-braces-for-bloodshed\" title=\"\">move of the US embassy</a> from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem the textbook example.

Trump is obsessed with his predecessor and has been bent on erasing his legacy, whether that\u2019s healthcare at home or the Iran nuclear agreement abroad. As my colleague Julian Borger has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/qassem-suleimani-iran-death-middle-east-us-trump\" title=\"\">wisely noted</a>, the current confrontation with Tehran has come about in part through Trump\u2019s determination to destroy the nuclear deal and seek instead to break Iran through economic sanctions.</p> \n<p>The immediate trigger was the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/air-strikes-us-syria-iraq-latest-hezbollah-death-contractor-kirkuk-rocket-a9263771.html\" title=\"\">killing of a US contractor in Iraq</a> and an attack by a pro-Iranian group on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/us-embassy-stormed-in-baghdad\" title=\"\">US embassy in Baghdad</a>. Trump saw those events as the crossing of a red line and, unlike Obama in the Syria case, he was adamant that no such violation could occur without a lethal response. The attack on the embassy would have struck a particularly neuralgic spot for Trump, whose political worldview seems to have taken shape in the 1970s \u2013 and largely stayed there. He will have remembered the humiliation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/iranian-students-take-over-us-embassy-tehran-iran-1979\" title=\"\">US embassy siege in Tehran</a> that began in 1979, the way it crippled Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency in an election year, and have been insistent on avoiding any repeat on his watch.</p> \n<p>But the deeper provocation was surely the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/1212301034871279616\" title=\"\">tweet</a> from Khamenei on Wednesday, when Iran\u2019s supreme leader replied to a bellicose post from Trump \u2013 \u201cThis is not a Warning, it is a Threat\u201d \u2013 with the words, \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything\u201d. That was surely an egregious miscalculation on Tehran\u2019s part, underestimating the extent to which Trump will put his ego ahead of all other considerations.</p> \n<p>Khamenei would have done well to remember another defining trait of Trump\u2019s character: his tendency to project, attributing to others the negative qualities most clearly apparent in himself. With that in mind, a quick scroll through Trump\u2019s Twitter archive would have provided a clue to Thursday\u2019s drone strike on Iran\u2019s second most powerful man. For what did Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/141604554855825408\" title=\"\">tweet</a> back in November 2011, as the US entered an election year? \u201cIn order to get [re-]elected, @BarackObama will start a war with Iran.\u201d</p> \n<p>There were <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/old-trump-tweets-emerge-claim-obama-wanted-war-iran-2020-1?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">plenty more</a> in that vein over the next 12 months, which perhaps gives an insight into how Trump is approaching his own re-election effort. Trump\u2019s defenders will say there is nothing to fear, that a bad man with much blood on his hands has been removed. That Iran\u2019s ability to hit back is diminished, thanks to those choking sanctions and indeed the elimination of the pivotal Suleimani. That this will not just boost Trump\u2019s standing at home but even in the Middle East, where brute force is the one language everyone understands. That he will get away with this, despite all the <em>bien pensant</em> wails and warnings, just as he got away with the Jerusalem embassy move. That while an expert such as Sanam Vakil of Chatham House might say that \u201cthis time the gloves will be off\u201d, and that Iran will no longer hide behind the plausible deniability offered by proxies but will \u201cstrike back and strike back directly\u201d, there is nothing to fear because Tehran will be smart enough to know its own limits, restrained by the certainty that the US could answer any attempt at retaliation with devastating force.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s defenders will say all that, and they may even be right. But they miss, as Trump misses, the risk of accidents, of misread signals, of unintended consequences \u2013 the very things that sucked so many of his predecessors into quagmires they hoped to avoid. They miss too the inherent contradiction in the Trump doctrine: that pulling out of a region, as Trump hopes to pull out of the Middle East, leaves you a weaker, more exposed target in the eyes of those who want to humiliate you on your way out. Trump wants to withdraw but he also wants to avoid humiliation. That\u2019s the tension, the contradiction, that has exploded this week. Trump refuses to face it. But the rest of us may not have that luxury.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "body": "<p>When it comes to swapping shirts at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening, Tom Pope is not exactly counting his chickens. \u201cIf the Man City players have had a look at what I\u2019ve said, they\u2019ll probably tell me to bugger off,\u201d the Port Vale captain says, laughing, referring to his comments on social media after watching back England\u2019s Nations League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/06/netherlands-england-nations-league-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">defeat </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/06/netherlands-england-nations-league-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">by the Netherlands</a> in June, when he described John Stones as \u201csoft\u201d and \u201ca target man\u2019s dream\u201d, saying he would love to play against the defender every week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tom_Pope9/status/1136896482446061569\" title=\"\">because he would have a field day</a>.</p> <p>Not for the first time Pope\u2019s tweets catapulted him into the centre of a storm but six months on and before facing Manchester City in the FA Cup third round, the striker unapologetically stands by his words.</p> <p>\u201cOne hundred per cent,\u201d Pope says. \u201cIt was tongue-in-cheek, saying [I\u2019d score] 40 goals a season. But every single footballer has got their strengths and weaknesses. John Stones is a world-class centre-half and his technical ability is second to none but what I do before a game is I look at the two centre-halves and go \u2018Right, who is the weaker of the two?\u2019 And I try to play on the weaker one. It is old-fashioned percentage play. If I play on him, I\u2019ll win 80% of my headers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/03/fa-cup-third-round-match-previews\">FA Cup third round: match previews</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf I had a choice of [playing against] John Stones or Virgil van Dijk, I\u2019d go and sit on John Stones. He is physically not the strongest centre-half. He is a ball-playing centre-half. That is not a criticism of him but as a target man, if you are Andy Carroll or Peter Crouch, they would all do the same thing and try and bully him and rough him up. I\u2019d stand by that.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was overly critical. I just pointed out the physical side of his game wasn\u2019t one of his strengths and that it is something I can prey on. As a target man, if you look at a small footballing centre-half, you are licking your lips thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going to rough him up and cause some damage.\u2019 That is when the team have to play to your strengths; there is no point trying to play against Man City trying to out-pass them because you\u2019d get mullered.\u201d</p> <p>Pope relishes the blood and thunder of battle and lists Harry Maguire, Aden Flint and Sami Hyypia, whom he faced when Crewe took on Liverpool in 2008 before coming away with Daniel Agger\u2019s shirt as a memento, as some of his toughest opponents over the years. But Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, Pope says, will prove a different proposition.</p> <p>\u201cThis Man City team are probably something else,\u201d he says. \u201cNot one person on the planet is going to fancy us to get anything from the game \u2013 not even us \u2013 and sometimes when there is no pressure on the game, you can have a little feelgood factor about yourselves. You just go out there and try to do the best you can and try not to be embarrassed. And sometimes strange things can happen.\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly Pope does not take himself too seriously. When his Stones comments were dug up at the start of December, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_pope9/st atus/1201624503652102147\" title=\"\">Pope referred to himself as a \u201ccarthorse\u201d</a>.

Everybody keeps telling me you need to come off [social media] but I love interacting with people. If I reported everybody who abused me, there would be nobody left on Twitter.\u201d</p> <p>Pope was brought up a mile from Vale Park and a boyhood supporter, going back to the days when his grandfather, Joe, would push him and his brother under the turnstile. These days Pope lives a 10-minute walk from the stadium and is Vale\u2019s longest-serving player. After scoring almost 150 goals across 500 league career appearances he is comfortable in his own skin.</p> <p>\u201cI know what I am, I\u2019m the slowest footballer in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll come last in any running race but I also know what my strengths are and, if you play to my strengths, I know I am a handful for anybody. When opposition managers and centre-halves are coming off after games shaking your hand and saying: \u2018Flipping hell, what a battle or you\u2019ve battered us,\u2019 you know you have still been effective. I\u2019m just an old-fashioned centre-forward. I don\u2019t try to do anything I can\u2019t do. I\u2019m not going to start trying to take people on. I\u2019ll try and get hold of the ball, win my headers and bring people into play.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/02/bobby-madley-social-media-premier-league-referee\">Bobby Madley\u2019s plight symptomatic of social media shame culture | Max Rushden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At 19 Pope ditched a nine-to-five job glazing windows and took a pay cut to sign for Crewe on \u00a3200-a-week, seven years on from them releasing him as a boy and after four years on the non-league circuit with Biddulph Victoria and Sneyd FC, a Sunday League team his father, Rob, managed for years. \u201cWhen you are 15 and scoring goals, people are kicking lumps out of you.\u201d</p> <p>Few of City\u2019s superstars will have had such a similar grounding. \u201cNo, but they have all got big houses so. if any of them ever need any windows doing, then maybe I\u2019ll give them a call,\u201d Pope says, breaking into laughter. \u201cYou\u2019d go up for a header and land on the floor and they\u2019d stamp on you while you\u2019re down. My old man would always say, \u2018Get up, get yourself up.\u2019 You don\u2019t want to give the opposition any thought that you might be weak or that they might be bullying you or have got the better of you. You just get back up and go again.\u201d</p> <p>That will be Pope\u2019s mantra against City, along with sticking to his guns. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be robotic.

Not for the first time Pope\u2019s tweets catapulted him into the centre of a storm but six months on and before facing Manchester City in the FA Cup third round, the striker unapologetically stands by his words. \u201cOne hundred per cent,\u201d Pope says. \u201cIt was tongue-in-cheek, saying [I\u2019d score] 40 goals a season. But every single footballer has got their strengths and weaknesses. John Stones is a world-class centre-half and his technical ability is second to none but what I do before a game is I look at the two centre-halves and go \u2018Right, who is the weaker of the two?\u2019 And I try to play on the weaker one. It is old-fashioned percentage play. If I play on him, I\u2019ll win 80% of my headers. \u201cIf I had a choice of [playing against] John Stones or Virgil van Dijk, I\u2019d go and sit on John Stones. He is physically not the strongest centre-half. He is a ball-playing centre-half. That is not a criticism of him but as a target man, if you are Andy Carroll or Peter Crouch, they would all do the same thing and try and bully him and rough him up. I\u2019d stand by that. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was overly critical. I just pointed out the physical side of his game wasn\u2019t one of his strengths and that it is something I can prey on. As a target man, if you look at a small footballing centre-half, you are licking your lips thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going to rough him up and cause some damage.\u2019 That is when the team have to play to your strengths; there is no point trying to play against Man City trying to out-pass them because you\u2019d get mullered.\u201d Pope relishes the blood and thunder of battle and lists Harry Maguire, Aden Flint and Sami Hyypia, whom he faced when Crewe took on Liverpool in 2008 before coming away with Daniel Agger\u2019s shirt as a memento, as some of his toughest opponents over the years. But Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, Pope says, will prove a different proposition. \u201cThis Man City team are probably something else,\u201d he says. \u201cNot one person on the planet is going to fancy us to get anything from the game \u2013 not even us \u2013 and sometimes when there is no pressure on the game, you can have a little feelgood factor about yourselves. You just go out there and try to do the best you can and try not to be embarrassed. And sometimes strange things can happen.\u201d Unsurprisingly Pope does not take himself too seriously. When his Stones comments were dug up at the start of December, Pope referred to himself as a \u201ccarthorse\u201d. The striker is a self-deprecating character and throughout this almost hour-long conversation his searing honesty is refreshing and endearing but he knows that his tongue \u2013 his tweets, to be precise \u2013 have landed him in hot water. Last month the 34-year-old served a one-match ban for abusing Crewe fans after being found in breach of the Football Association\u2019s Rule E3, and has had to stump up thousands of pounds in fines after three separate charges, two from the FA and one from the League Two club. \u201cMy wife is at the end of her tether with it. Everybody keeps telling me you need to come off [social media] but I love interacting with people. If I reported everybody who abused me, there would be nobody left on Twitter.\u201d Pope was brought up a mile from Vale Park and a boyhood supporter, going back to the days when his grandfather, Joe, would push him and his brother under the turnstile. These days Pope lives a 10-minute walk from the stadium and is Vale\u2019s longest-serving player. After scoring almost 150 goals across 500 league career appearances he is comfortable in his own skin. \u201cI know what I am, I\u2019m the slowest footballer in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll come last in any running race but I also know what my strengths are and, if you play to my strengths, I know I am a handful for anybody. When opposition managers and centre-halves are coming off after games shaking your hand and saying: \u2018Flipping hell, what a battle or you\u2019ve battered us,\u2019 you know you have still been effective. I\u2019m just an old-fashioned centre-forward. I don\u2019t try to do anything I can\u2019t do. I\u2019m not going to start trying to take people on. I\u2019ll try and get hold of the ball, win my headers and bring people into play.\u201d At 19 Pope ditched a nine-to-five job glazing windows and took a pay cut to sign for Crewe on \u00a3200-a-week, seven years on from them releasing him as a boy and after four years on the non-league circuit with Biddulph Victoria and Sneyd FC, a Sunday League team his father, Rob, managed for years. \u201cWhen you are 15 and scoring goals, people are kicking lumps out of you.\u201d Few of City\u2019s superstars will have had such a similar grounding. \u201cNo, but they have all got big houses so. if any of them ever need any windows doing, then maybe I\u2019ll give them a call,\u201d Pope says, breaking into laughter. \u201cYou\u2019d go up for a header and land on the floor and they\u2019d stamp on you while you\u2019re down. My old man would always say, \u2018Get up, get yourself up.\u2019 You don\u2019t want to give the opposition any thought that you might be weak or that they might be bullying you or have got the better of you. You just get back up and go again.\u201d That will be Pope\u2019s mantra against City, along with sticking to his guns. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be robotic. That\u2019s what they try to do now, they try to silence people. Anthony Joshua, when he\u2019s doing media, I think a lot of it is stage-managed and scripted to keep fans on side. With me, I\u2019ll just say what I think. If we\u2019ve had a 5-0 drubbing the media are always asking for me after because I\u2019ll be honest and not beat round the bush. I\u2019m not going to be silenced. There are a lot worse people on the planet than Tom Pope.\u201d",

The 19-year-old is expected to sign a three and a half year deal that contains an option of a one-year extension. Talks with Coventry have been going on since the start of the season and West Ham had grown concerned they would lose the midfielder, with clubs in the Championship and abroad expressing an interest. Frustration had mounted on both sides of the negotiating table and the standoff had raised the prospect of West Ham being forced to cash in on one of their most promising youngsters or risk him signing a pre-contract with a foreign side before departing in the summer. Coventry, who has made two substitute appearances for West Ham in the League Cup and been included on the bench for a handful of Premier League games, is now likely to be loaned out to gain experience for the rest of the season. A move to a League One side seen as his best chance of playing regularly. The teenager, who has been at West Ham since he was 10, is a Republic of Ireland Under-21 international and displayed his potential when he was named man of the match in a 0-0 draw against Italy last October. West Ham are unlikely to recall Grady Diangana from his loan spell at West Brom this month. The winger has excelled for West Brom, who are chasing automatic promotion to the Premier League, and there is a feeling on all sides that the 21-year-old is benefiting from playing regularly.

The right to philosophical and religious beliefs \u2013 or to no belief \u2013 is in effect a similar category of protection to that afforded to sex, race, disability or age under the Equalities Act 2010, according to Sarah Chilton, a partner at the law firm CM Murray. The act protects nine characteristics, with philosophical beliefs protected in the same way as religion, so that someone who expresses a belief in acting over climate change would be protected in the same way as someone who practises Christianity. How does a belief become protected? The Equality Act provides that beliefs can be protected if they satisfy certain criteria that have been set out in case law. In the case of Grainger plc v Nicholson, the court set out conditions for a protected belief. It must be genuinely held, it must be a belief rather than an opinion or point of view and it must be about a weighty and substantial aspect of human life. In this sense, Jordi Casamitjana\u2019s ethical veganism is distinguishable from other forms of veganism, such as that motivated by health, which might not necessarily be regarded as substantial enough to be given the status of a protected belief. \u201cFor this particular claimant, whose life and behaviour was impacted much more widely [by his belief], I think there\u2019s much more than just not eating animals,\u201d Chilton said. \u201cAll of his life was impacted by the belief.\u201d For a belief to be protected, the claimant must also show that it has cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance, meaning that it must fit together in the claimant\u2019s life as a coherent belief system, in much the same way as a religion.

Back in the late 90s, I was working in an Xtravision in Naas and my sister came in to say she was in the pub across the road with Niall. He invited everyone back to his house for drinks and I somehow ended up chatting with him in his living room. I told him I was studying accountancy and hated it because all I wanted to do was play music.

He said the club do not yet know the extent of the damage to the players thigh but it underlined the need for them to use this month\u2019s transfer window to reinforce.</strong></p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately Diogo is also not available. In the last game, the red card [challenge] from [Christian] Kabasele made, with no intention at all, strong impact so he\u2019s not available. He\u2019s being assessed, he\u2019s already done the MRI. It\u2019s not good, not good. We have to wait for all the blood that the impact caused to go down so the doctor can evaluate him better. After that we will have a proper diagnosis.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have a small squad and every time a player is not an option it causes you problems. But to problems we must find solutions and that\u2019s that we are looking for now. We need players [this month]. Now I think is the right moment to start working on that. The transfer window gives you the chance to bring things that can improve you. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking at. [We need to make] the right decisions that can improve us so that we can continue to compete well.\u201d</p> <p>Despite their need for players, including at centreback following the injury to Wily Boly, Nuno said the Spanish defender Jesus Vallejo, who joined on loan from Real Madrid last summer, will probably go back to his parent club this month. </p> <p>\u201cJesus Vallejo is probably going because he wants to play. He\u2019s a young and talented player who we brought here with high expectations but it didn\u2019t work out. So it\u2019s time for him to go and find a club so he can keep on progressing because the talent is there. We don\u2019t have much time so we have to move forward ... The reality is he had moments that he played, moments that he performed well and some moments that he didn\u2019t perform so well. That\u2019s the case of Vallejo.

The big new signing was Anthony Elding, who had scored the winner in the previous season\u2019s cup final. He got injured in the first game of the season and barely played afterwards. He was replaced in that match by O\u2019Sullivan, another new signing who was already past 30 and had a grand total of 2 League of Ireland games to his name. </p> <p>He led the line for the next two seasons, scoring 20 league goals but more importantly, working tirelessly every single game. He was also a neighbour of mine in a fairly ordinary housing estate in Cork, emphasising the fact that this really was just a normal guy. He helped the club to consecutive 2nd place finishes and a cup final, and ignited my passion for my local club.

      "bodyText": "Big Kane news, then, to finish our live blog. You can check in with our story on that right here: and keep abreast of every single transfer in Europe\u2019s top five leagues in our snazzy interactive: Thanks for reading and for your emails, tweets, comments and favourite footballer submissions. Enjoy the weekend\u2019s football. Bye! Tottenham have confirmed that Harry Kane\u2019s injury is a torn hamstring, and have not put a date on his return. You can scratch that comment about this potentially being good for England, then. Depending on the severity of the tear, Kane could be out for one to three months. Ouch. If you haven\u2019t listened to yesterday\u2019s Football Weekly Extra, do, if only to find out which manager had his interview in a chip shop. Let\u2019s just clear up some of the VAR stuff for tomorrow. It will be in use for the 13 ties being played at Premier League grounds in the third-round. The rest will just have to do without/enjoy a normal football match. Saturday 4 January AFC Bournemouth vs Luton Town Brighton &amp; Hove Albion vs Sheffield Wednesday Burnley vs Peterborough United Leicester City vs Wigan Athletic Manchester City vs Port Vale Southampton vs Huddersfield Town Watford vs Tranmere Rovers Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Manchester United Sunday 5 January Chelsea vs Nottingham Forest Crystal Palace vs Derby County Liverpool vs Everton Sheffield United vs AFC Fylde Monday 6 January Arsenal vs Leeds United At least AFC Fylde are excited. #armpits Daniel Farke, Norwich manager, has been speaking before his side\u2019s match at Preston in the FA Cup tomorrow. Farke said: \u201cTeemu Pukki is out for tomorrow, he has a little hamstring strain. He\u2019s struggling with his toe as well. I can\u2019t predict whether he\u2019s available for the Manchester United game.\u201d This is also from Norwich\u2019s official website: The City boss also confirmed that Josip Drmic (hamstring) and Dennis Srbeny (back) will miss the game, meaning it\u2019s almost certain that youngster Adam Idah will lead the line on Saturday. Idah, an 18-year-old from Cork, Ireland, made his Premier League debut in the 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace on New Year\u2019s Day. I actually think Kane\u2019s injury is excellent news for England. Without an enforced break, Kane would play a hell of a lot of games between now and the Euros in the summer. Provided it is not an ongoing injury, he can get some down-time, come back refreshed and motivated for the Champions League and hopefully play himself back into form. An email, from Paulo Biriani, regarding my earlier question about your fave footballers. Suddenly, I am very hungry. Pompey fan here. Peter Ellis was a god amongst men at Pompey from about 1976 till about 1980 i think. Strong, great header of the ball, positional sense as good as alan hansen. My school team won the portsmouth junior league and he came with a young alan knight to give us our medals. I worshipped him, wanted to be him and kept his autograph from that day. Pompey let him go and he had offers but said he couldn\u2019t play for any other team but Pompey. I wonder if Laporte knows the northern expression: \u201cPut wood in hole.\u201d Not very social media-friendly, though. Maybe I\u2019m late to this, or perhaps I\u2019m reading too much into this, but I\u2019ve just noticed that Laporte signed this tweet with a door emoji, a reference to \u2018la porte\u2019 and his French heritage. It\u2019s certainly better than the #inSan\u00e9 hashtag that Leroy San\u00e9 usually uses. Mentioned earlier, but here are a few more quotes from Guardiola on Laporte, who is apparently due to return to full training next week. That\u2019s massive news, as it sounds like he will be fully match-fit for Real Madrid and the Champions League last-16 in February. Yesterday was the first time he training 10-15 minutes with the team and today again. The rest individually and he is getting better. He feels good, i think next week he will complete all the training sessions with us. When will be available? I don\u2019t know. You think about it but i think he will dictate with how he feels, he has been out for four months and needs time so it is not like he can immediately play 90 minutes. What is important is he has not had any stepbacks during his time out - the same with Leroy - and that is incredibly good. I\u2019m grateful to the physios. Dean Smith, the Aston Villa manager, has issued a Football Manager-style \u2018hands-off warning\u2019 to any clubs regarding Jack Grealish. \u201cHe\u2019s having his record season goal scoring season, he\u2019s a top player and I\u2019ve waxed lyrical about him very often but as I\u2019ve said before, our owners are very ambitious about establishing us as a top Premier League football club and to do that you have to keep your best players. We will be keeping hold of Jack Grealish and people can keep looking but they can\u2019t touch.\u201d When asked would a bid be turned down, he added: \u201cYeah, without a shadow. We want to keep our best players and he\u2019s proving he\u2019s one of the best in the Premier League. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe [any offers have been made]. And I\u2019m sure if we did they would get a short shrift reply.\u201d Here is a story from Mark Grassick about Niall Quinn and not following your dreams: As an Arsenal fan, Tomas Rosicky will always hold a special place in my heart, but as an Irishman, my one and only will always be Niall Quinn. Back in the late 90s, I was working in an Xtravision in Naas and my sister came in to say she was in the pub across the road with Niall. He invited everyone back to his house for drinks and I somehow ended up chatting with him in his living room. I told him I was studying accountancy and hated it because all I wanted to do was play music. He said people told him he was mad for wanting to be a professional footballer and look how that worked out. So, the next day I dropped out of uni. The music career didn\u2019t totally pan out but I gave it a decent shot all because of Niall, the nicest professional footballer I\u2019ve ever met. My mother, however, has never forgiven him. You came here for hot FA Cup previews with injury and team news, odds, and details about the officials, didn\u2019t you? Michael has returned after his roast suckling pig and cous cous. Enjoy his company. Ian Holloway, minus political opinions. Nuno Espirito Santo has revealed that Diogo Jota will miss Saturday\u2019s FA Cup tie with Manchester United because of the injury he suffered during Wednesday\u2019s defeat at Watford. He said the club do not yet know the extent of the damage to the players thigh but it underlined the need for them to use this month\u2019s transfer window to reinforce. \u201cUnfortunately Diogo is also not available. In the last game, the red card [challenge] from [Christian] Kabasele made, with no intention at all, strong impact so he\u2019s not available. He\u2019s being assessed, he\u2019s already done the MRI. It\u2019s not good, not good. We have to wait for all the blood that the impact caused to go down so the doctor can evaluate him better. After that we will have a proper diagnosis.\u201d \u201cWe have a small squad and every time a player is not an option it causes you problems. But to problems we must find solutions and that\u2019s that we are looking for now. We need players [this month]. Now I think is the right moment to start working on that. The transfer window gives you the chance to bring things that can improve you. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking at. [We need to make] the right decisions that can improve us so that we can continue to compete well.\u201d Despite their need for players, including at centreback following the injury to Wily Boly, Nuno said the Spanish defender Jesus Vallejo, who joined on loan from Real Madrid last summer, will probably go back to his parent club this month. \u201cJesus Vallejo is probably going because he wants to play. He\u2019s a young and talented player who we brought here with high expectations but it didn\u2019t work out. So it\u2019s time for him to go and find a club so he can keep on progressing because the talent is there. We don\u2019t have much time so we have to move forward ... The reality is he had moments that he played, moments that he performed well and some moments that he didn\u2019t perform so well. That\u2019s the case of Vallejo. Clearly it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d David Hytner with more on Kane\u2019s injury issues. News from the Championship ... Ederson will once again be available for Manchester City following illness this weekend but Pep Guardiola could stick with Claudio Bravo for the clash with Port Vale. In even better news for City, Guardiola has confirmed Aymeric Laporte\u2019s return to training. Striker Olivier Giroud will only leave Chelsea this month if it is to the benefit of the club, according to Jody Morris. Asked if Giroud will be sold, Morris said: \u201cWell, he still plays for Chelsea. It\u2019s got to be for the benefit of the club. We can\u2019t just let people walk out the door if that means we\u2019re left short somewhere. \u201cYes, you have to look at the individual as well, but I\u2019ve got to say Giroud\u2019s been nothing but a class act and a top professional since he\u2019s been here, so I don\u2019t envisage any issues from him on that front.\u201d I will do some self-promotion, as I am quite tired after spending the night in Derby. Here is new Liverpool signing Takumi Minamino breaking the world high five record. You don\u2019t get this sort of hot content with Butler, do you?! Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is anticipating \u201cbad news\u201d regarding the full extent of Harry Kane\u2019s injury. The Spurs striker limped out of their defeat to Southampton with what looked like a muscle injury and will definitely miss the FA Cup clash against Middlesbrough but is expecting him to be out for longer. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet, maybe later today we have news but if you ask me just my feeling - good news or bad news - I am more on bad news than good news, that\u2019s my feeling,\u201d Mourinho revealed. \u201cWhat the player felt, Harry Kane leaving a match, the way he did it, he didn\u2019t think twice, it didn\u2019t take him two seconds to realise the severity of the situation. Some opinions from the medical department before the test results. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have good news. But the reason we\u2019re here is because of the beautiful FA Cup and in relation to that we can say that no Middlesbrough for Harry Kane.\u201d Erling Haaland is the biggest move of the January window. The Norway striker is now very much in Dortmund where someone seems to be measuring him up to become a waxwork. After a gruelling month or so, J\u00fcrgen Klopp has been left short of options for Liverpool\u2019s Merseyside derby FA Cup clash with Everton. The German only has 12 fit outfield players at his disposal, plus new signing Takumi Minamino. Needless to say, Klopp is not a fan of the schedule created for Liverpool by the Premier League, in addition to a trip to Qatar for the Club World Cup. \u201cPeople have told me already I wouldn\u2019t respect the cup. It\u2019s not true. But my first job is to respect the players,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to decide if it\u2019s allowed to play them again. It looks like federations around want to make it more tricky. How can you look at a situation like Newcastle - losing four players in one game - and not think \u2018This is crazy\u2019.\u201d Frank Lampard was replaced by Jody Morris at Chelsea\u2019s press conference today, as the Blues boss is suffering from a bug but will be OK to take charge this weekend. \u201cFrank\u2019s had a bit of a bug, he\u2019s had it for about a week to 10 days to be fair, and the older you get it\u2019s harder to shake!\u201d said Morris. \u201cHe\u2019ll be alright for the game on Sunday. \u201cFik (Tomori) trained today but he\u2019s still not feeling the best. He\u2019s got a bit of a bug himself, too. There\u2019s been a bit of it flying about anyway, so I\u2019m hoping it isn\u2019t going to get any worse than it was.\u201d What will Michael have for lunch? I am anticipating it will involve cous cous. Gonna pop out for some lunch. Will Unwin is your man for the next little bit. Pep Guardiola is \u201cconfident\u201d Fernandinho will be offered a fresh one-year deal in the summer though made clear it is a matter for Txiki Begiristain, Manchester City\u2019s sporting director. \u201cIt\u2019s for Txiki \u2013 not my issue,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI\u2019d like it to happen and confident too. I\u2019m delighted with the three years we\u2019ve had together. Of course like him to stay.\u201d Welcome to my Guardian Masterclass: how to endear yourself to football fans. Two messages from Canada: \u201cGot to be Glenn Hoddle for me,\u201d emails Redmond Grimes. \u201cJust effortless cool and scorer of one of the greatest goals ever vs Watford. I saw him play here in Toronto many moons ago in a charity match. He was retired by then, never broke into a jog, let alone a run, but was by far the best player on the pitch.\u201d Not the best 2019 for Danny: one league appearance in total (a 59-minute jaunt during a 4-1 defeat to Manchester City a month ago) and a drink driving offence in which he smashed his Range Rover through a wall. Really hope he can get back to playing soon, as he was a cracking player. He\u2019s still just 29, and has a lot to offer. Some news for Aston Villa fans, following the injury to striker Wesley. Villa are reportedly exploring the possibility of a loan for Chelsea\u2019s Michy Batshuayi. There\u2019s a lot to be said for players having a kickabout in the local street. Phil Foden can sometimes be seen knocking a ball around Stockport, while Wayne Rooney has recently said that he went for a game with his mates in the park an hour after scoring that goal against Arsenal in 2002. Then of course, there\u2019s Bobby Charlton, seen here getting back into gentle training with some young fans during his recuperating from injuries sustained in the Munich Air Crash. I assume we don\u2019t even have to discuss this one ... Roma have also reportedly shown at interest in the teenage defender Mohamed Simakan. But, then again, they gave Jack Rodwell a trial. This is a lovely email, from Daniel Herlihy. I\u2019m a Cork City fan, and my pick would have to be Mark O\u2019Sullivan. I was one of those Irish people who neglected their domestic league for too long, but when I was 16 a new manager took over and I decided to start following City properly. The big new signing was Anthony Elding, who had scored the winner in the previous season\u2019s cup final. He got injured in the first game of the season and barely played afterwards. He was replaced in that match by O\u2019Sullivan, another new signing who was already past 30 and had a grand total of 2 League of Ireland games to his name. He led the line for the next two seasons, scoring 20 league goals but more importantly, working tirelessly every single game. He was also a neighbour of mine in a fairly ordinary housing estate in Cork, emphasising the fact that this really was just a normal guy. He helped the club to consecutive 2nd place finishes and a cup final, and ignited my passion for my local club. We\u2019ve had players of a far better quality who have gone on to play in Britain and for the Irish national team, but there\u2019s been no-one quite like Sully. From Jamie Jackson: Tony Martial and Jesse Lingard are out of Manchester United\u2019s FA Cup tie with Wolves tomorrow. It will be interesting to see if they make it back for Tuesday\u2019s League Cup semi-final first leg with Manchester City. Suzanne Wrack has spoken to Manchester City and England\u2019s Keira Walsh. It\u2019s an interesting read. Our man in Southampton has been speaking to Ralph Husenhuttl. Meanwhile, it is very strange not to see the Austrian on the three-man shortlist for December\u2019s manager of the month. Southampton won four, drew one and lost two in that period, which has been transformative for the former relegation strugglers, who are now up to 12th. And here he is: This is a cracking gallery, for your consideration: Another reply, this time from Kieran McHugh. Every so often, usually at the end of a decade come to think of it, someone, somewhere on the internet will decide to ask the general public to name the best ever footballer. As a general rule inviting the general public to offer their opinion is a bad idea. However, not in this regard. In amongst the Alia Dia\u2019s, the Tony Adcock\u2019s and the Paolo Tremazzani\u2019s there is always a vote for Jean Tigana. My vote. I do not cast it lightly. I fell in love with the beautiful game many years ago watching the carre magique. Whilst many were seduced by Platini for the goals and the Gallic swagger I was rapt completely by the poise and exquisite elegance of Tigana. He never seemed to misplace a pass and always played upright, eyes and head up, seeking not only to direct play and break up the opposition, but also to instigate attack. Le Carr\u00e9 Magique is surely one of the greatest collective pronouns in the history of sport, alongside perhaps The Legion of Doom (Philadelphia Flyers 1995-97) or The Greatest Show on Turf (St Louis Rams 1999-2001). Herbie Kane, the 21-year-old Liverpool striker, joins on loan. He played under Hull manager Grant McCann last season at Doncaster as well, where he scored seven times in 49 games. In maverick style, he announces that \u201cIt was nice to come in this morning and meet the lads and it\u2019s great to be linking up with the gaffer again.\u201d Eddie Howe has been chatting this morning, before Bournemouth\u2019s FA Cup match against Luton. He says there has been no formal approach for Nathan Ake, with Arsenal and Chelsea thought to be chasing the \u00a340m-rated Dutchman. Arsenal particularly are in need of reinforcements after Calum Chambers\u2019s recent knee injury, which is going to keep him out until late 2020. Ake is still injured, and part of a lengthy list of absentees for Howe at the moment, including Josh King, Jack Stacey, Adam Smith, Arnaut Groeneveld, Charlie Daniels, Lloyd Kelly and David Brooks. I have to admit I\u2019d completely forgotten about Brooks in the last few weeks. What a player he could be. Not long after adding one Manchester City youngster on loan in Patrick Roberts, Middlesbrough and Jonathan Woodgate have signed another: Germany U-21 striker Lukas Nmecha, who joins until the end of the season. Our first submission, courtesy of Magnus. Frank was always good for a quote, particularly on a 2010 edition of Come Dine With Me alongside Razor Ruddock, Carlton Palmer and John Fashanu. #vinaigrette To counter the Lingard v Alexander-Arnold stat from earlier, Charlie Pite has emailed in with some much-needed context. \u201cIn the interests of not stoking fires, Alexander-Arnold has played roughly twice as many minutes of top-level football than Lingard (according to WhoScored). Additionally, are full-backs any less attacking or more defensive than midfielders under Klopp?\u201d Certainly the full-backs are one of Klopp\u2019s biggest weapons going forward, and Alexander-Arnold would have picked up many (if not most) or these goal contributions from set plays, whereas Lingard is largely shunned at the dead ball. Alexander Arnold is also helped by the fact that Liverpool finish his deliveries well: they\u2019ve scored more than 40 times from set-pieces in the league since the start of last season - the best tally of any team in the division. You probably missed this news, but David Dunn has been appointed to Blackpool\u2019s staff, under manager Simon Grayson. As a Blackburn Rovers fan, Dunny is my favourite ever footballer, mainly because he was born in the town, and brought some real style and flair to our side in the early 2000s. Oh, and also because of this goal, a 95th minute equaliser in 2013 against Burnley to extend the unbeaten run over the old enemy to 34 years. I laugh every time remembering Dunny doing the crying eyes celebration in front of the Burnley fans at full-time. Who is your favourite ever footballer, and why? I don\u2019t want the best you/your club has seen, but maybe a player that represented something else, on or off the pitch, that cemented them as your fave. Emails to michael.butler@theguardian.com, or tweet me @michaelbutler18. Thanks! Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been officially unveiled as a Milan player. The 38-year-old has signed a contract until the end of the season, with an option for a one-year extension. \u201cI left in 2012 without my will. Without my last OK. I had more offers now than when I was 28. I need new enemies. The old ones have become my fans.\u201d A couple more Liverpool tit bits. Alisson has become the first goalkeeper to win the Samba Gold prize for the best Brazilian player in Europe \u2013 an award selected by a combined poll of fans, journalists and former players \u2013 with 35.54% of the vote. He finished ahead of teammate Roberto Firmino, the 2018 winner, in second (23.48%) and Thiago Silva in third (10.46%). Liverpool midfielder Fabinho was fourth. I\u2019m a little surprised at that, to be honest. Thought Firmino would nick it. More hot World Club Cup badge news, in that Liverpool will again wear the gold crest on their shirts for this weekend\u2019s game against Everton - they can wear it in the FA Cup and Champions League, but not the Premier League (although they were granted it as a one-off against Wolves, just after their triumph in Qatar). Jesse Lingard is getting a lot of heat below the line this morning. Normally I wouldn\u2019t be one to stoke the fire like this, but here\u2019s a little stat: The former Everton, Manchester City and England player had a trial at Roma of all places (where he/Chris Smalling failed to convince them to sign) and most recently played last season for Blackburn Rovers, where he did OK in central midfield and quite well as a makeshift centre back. He\u2019s not going to reinvent the wheel in Yorkshire, but he\u2019s still just 28, and there is a Premier League footballer in there somewhere. Rodwell has been training with the Blades since last month and could make his debut during Sunday\u2019s FA Cup tie against AFC Fylde. To Madrid, where a certain Mr Zidane has been talking. Real sit two points off Barcelona at the top of La Liga, and play Getafe away from home tomorrow. Barcelona face local rivals Espanyol tomorrow evening. He is asked about Manchester United\u2019s Paul Pogba: How i can reply to that? Paul is a player at another team and the important thing for him - because I think he is injured - is to get back playing. I wish him the very best but we focus on what we have.\u201d On potential departures: \u201cThere are players that have not got minutes and that can be a problem but we speak with them like always. Between now and Jan 31 many things can happen.\u201d Meanwhile: Isco is showing he wants to play and fight for his place, like everyone. Every time you have the chance, you have to give everything, this is Real Madrid. I identify with Isco because of where he plays and I like him as a player.\u201d Real Madrid also play in the Spanish Super Cup next week, which has obviously been relocated to Saudi Arabia. The Spanish state broadcaster RTVE said in November it would not bid to broadcast the upcoming tournament due to human rights concerns. For what it\u2019s worth, Spain\u2019s football federation (RFEF) announced a three-year deal to play the revamped event in Saudi Arabia, with Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Valencia the four teams involved this year. Despite the recent winter break, Zidane has just said that Eden Hazard (foot injury) is not fit enough to play: He is recovering and we hope just after the Super Cup, little by little, we could see him back with us again.\u201d Morning all! It\u2019s a brave new world out there, but I\u2019ve had enough coffee to power Forest Green Rovers\u2019 new stadium for a year. Feeling more ready than James Milner right now. Back on United, they also feature prominently at the top of today\u2019s Rumour Mill. Keep scrolling for intriguing transfer links mooted for both West Ham and Nottingham Forest \u2026 Meanwhile, here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s story on the Pogba latest \u2026 Time for Michael Butler to take over here. Happy new year all, and enjoy the weekend\u2019s action. Here\u2019s our story on Villa\u2019s injury woes \u2026 another point it raises is that, in addition to missing the rest of his club\u2019s league campaign, Tom Heaton appears certain to be ruled out of Euro 2020 this summer. Another one for Lost In Translation Corner \u2026 Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r appears bemused by how reporters interpreted his comments regarding Paul Pogba\u2019s injury situation. This from PA Media: Manchester United were in full support of the decision which led to Paul Pogba undergoing surgery, manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has said. The Norwegian appeared to suggest after the New Year\u2019s Day defeat to Arsenal that Pogba\u2019s \u201cpeople\u201d had recommended the surgery, raising questions over how much input the club had in the decision. However Solskj\u00e6r was keen to play down any suggestion of a disagreement regarding this injury, and said: \u201cPaul came back after a long spell out, [featured in] a few games, had a reaction, didn\u2019t go to Burnley. He felt his ankle was sore, we did a scan. It\u2019s not the same injury \u2013 it\u2019s a different injury \u2013 of course when you get that scan you consult your own medical people as well, like I did. He wanted a second opinion and the advice was to have it done. It\u2019s not a major one and probably [he\u2019ll be out for] three or four weeks.\u201d When asked why he had suggested it was Pogba\u2019s \u201cpeople\u201d behind the decision to undergo surgery, he added: \u201cAs in when you consult your surgeon and the ones you trust. That\u2019s maybe my bad English \u2013 you have people you trust and you speak to. When I had my injuries, knee operations, I had my people in Norway and Sweden that I spoke to and Paul obviously has people as well that he trusts, and that\u2019s important.\u201d West Ham have underlined their determination not to lose their best young talents after finally agreeing a new deal with Conor Coventry, who was out of contract out in the summer and a target for a number of clubs this month. Talks with Coventry have been going on since the start of the season and West Ham had grown concerned that they would lose the midfielder, with clubs in the Championship and abroad expressing an interest in the 19-year-old. Coventry would have been available on a free transfer at the end of the season but an agreement was reached after a breakthrough in negotiations in the last month. He is set to sign a two-and-a-half-year deal, which contains an option of a one-year extension. Newcastle have injury problems of their own. Steve Bruce, whose side travel to Rochdale tomorrow, was forced to see his side play almost all of the second half against Leicester on New Year\u2019s Day with 10 men after Jetro Willems, Javier Manquillo and Jonjo Shelvey were substituted with injuries, but then Fabian Sch\u00e4r also limped off. Matt Ritchie, Jamaal Lascelles, Ciaran Clark and Paul Dummett were already on the club\u2019s injury list. Bruce told reporters this morning: I\u2019ve never known a 15 minutes like it. I did predict a month ago that the schedule was ridiculous and we don\u2019t have the resources to have huge rotation, so unfortunately when you keep asking players to play tired. Up until Saturday, our record for this season was far better than last year in terms of injuries, especially soft tissue injuries. \u201cMatt Ritchie and Lascelles in particular were impacts \u2013 there\u2019s not much you can do about that \u2013 and the one thing you want to be doing with the sports science that we have today is the prevention of injuries and especially soft tissue injuries. It\u2019s just the number of games in a short period of time and asking footballers to play tired, and unfortunately we\u2019ve picked up the consequences of it, so it is what it is. We have to accept it and move on.\u201d Some grim news for Villa as they prepare to host Fulham tomorrow. The club had been fearing the worst after goalkeeper Tom Heaton and forward Wesley both suffered injuries during the New Year\u2019s Day victory at Burnley, a game in which Wesley opened the scoring. These fears are now confirmed, with both having sustained \u201csignificant knee ligament damage\u201d. ICYMI btw etc \u2013 here\u2019s our 10 things to look out for on this FA Cup weekend. Rooney! Fylde! Millwall! Together at last \u2026 Let\u2019s try and stop the \u201c12.31? 3.01? 5.31?\u201d comments before they start. A short film will be played before the start of all FA Cup matches, encouraging all fans to \u201ctake a minute\u201d to think about mental health. From the FA: While the conversation around mental health has grown significantly in recent years, mental health problems remain one of the biggest issues in society today. Suicide is the biggest killer of men under the age of 45 and it\u2019s time this changed. We can all take simple actions to look after our mental health and it only takes a minute to get started, whether that\u2019s looking after your own wellbeing or reaching out to support a friend or family member. This is why, as part of the Heads Up campaign, all Emirates FA Cup third round games will be delayed by one minute to encourage fans to \u2018Take A Minute\u2019 to think about mental health. Here\u2019s our story explaining further. Quibbles below the line regarding Sunday 6.15pm kick-offs are absolutely permitted btw. Mmm. That Cupset smell. Can\u2019t you just feel it?

      "bodyText": "Debenhams will begin a make-or-break year with 19 store closures this month that will result in 660 job losses on the UK\u2019s fragile high streets. The struggling department store chain will close the sites in the space of a fortnight as it presses ahead with a rescue plan announced last year. The closures starting on 11 January are spread across the country, from Kirkcaldy in Scotland to Eastbourne on the south coast. This is just the first wave of shutdowns, as the retailer intends to pull down the shutters on a total of 50 of its worst-performing stores. Debenhams was taken over by a group of financial investors last year and is using an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cull unprofitable sites and cut the rent on many of its remaining 163 shops. History shows that the retailer will face a tough road to recovery as more than half of all retailers that have resorted to a CVA have gone on to fail. A recent report highlighted that UK high streets shed more than 140,000 jobs in 2019 due to store closures and cost-cutting as the high street suffered as a result of the shift to online shopping. The problems of department stores reflect this upheaval. As more people buy goods on their phones or laptops, the number of visitors to high streets is falling, while the cost of running large stores is rising. Shoppers have also reined in spending on clothing and household goods due to the squeeze on spare cash and a shift towards renting rather than owning homes. The 19 stores on Debenhams\u2019 closure list add up to about 1.3m sq ft of retail floor space, roughly a tenth of Debenhams\u2019 total of 14.3m sq ft, according to analysts at Radius Data Exchange.

And he\u2019s right. Those are two very important metrics.</p> <p>At which point it is tempting to write a classic sport-style column about this. The standard form is to declare that sport really must do something, that sport must set an example, carry the message, become a model of sustainability. Presumably it was once credible to talk like this, to suggest professional sport might be some kind of force for collectivism and universal good. It might even have been true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71291c8834f05d942404ca65c685a1d85bbf2155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71291c8834f05d942404ca65c685a1d85bbf2155/0_0_4381_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australia\u2019s Tim Paine speaks to Ku-ring-gai Fire Brigade volunteer John Corry at the third Test against New Zealand at the SCG.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia\u2019s Tim Paine speaks to Ku-ring-gai Fire Brigade volunteer John Corry at the third Test against New Zealand at the SCG.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It isn\u2019t true now.

Sam Stosur will give $200 to the fire relief fund for every ace she serves this summer (all the while flying around the world on the absurdly carbon-heavy tennis circuit).</p> <p>But in reality sport cares only about growth, profit and consumption. There will be platitudinous noises and pledges. But at the elite level sport is run, funded and used as a reputation-garnish by the world\u2019s greatest carbon-gorgers.

Right now there are fears the third Test between Australia and New Zealand at the SCG might be threatened, with temperatures due to hit 45C on Saturday afternoon and a suggestion play may be halted if the air quality index rises above a reading of 150. \u201cThis is a challenge on two metrics: visibility and breathing,\u201d a Cricket Australia spokesperson has said. And he\u2019s right. Those are two very important metrics. At which point it is tempting to write a classic sport-style column about this. The standard form is to declare that sport really must do something, that sport must set an example, carry the message, become a model of sustainability. Presumably it was once credible to talk like this, to suggest professional sport might be some kind of force for collectivism and universal good. It might even have been true. It isn\u2019t true now. Let\u2019s face it, Big Sport simply isn\u2019t concerned with issues like this. There are nice people and nice gestures within it. Various Aussie cricketers have already promised help and donations. Sam Stosur will give $200 to the fire relief fund for every ace she serves this summer (all the while flying around the world on the absurdly carbon-heavy tennis circuit). But in reality sport cares only about growth, profit and consumption. There will be platitudinous noises and pledges. But at the elite level sport is run, funded and used as a reputation-garnish by the world\u2019s greatest carbon-gorgers. There will be no rainbow coalition of Fifa-ICC-IOC junketers holding hands to save the planet, not unless the people of the earth can crowdfund a sufficiently tempting \u201cspecial payments\u201d fund. So what can we do about this now? Send our love, support and hard currency to one of the relief funds, and of course to the firefighting services charged with containing the revenge of nature. As Nathan Lyon said this week: \u201cWe just play a game, the real heroes are the firefighters out there fighting fires\u201d \u2013 which is of course arguable from the GOAT. How many firefighters have taken a Test seven-for? How many firefighters have chased down a score on a crumbling Dubai deck in front of 300 Pakistani taxi drivers? But you can and should still give to them here. As for sport, it is still pretty useful as a way of shining some light. For one thing, here we are talking about climate emergency and destruction of the natural world because the Test match might be affected. There are details here you can grasp. That thing you love is in peril. Plus there is something painful and indeed strangely beautiful in the fact cricket is caught up in this, if only because cricket is so vital to the way Australia perceives itself: those dreamy white figures out there in all that pastoral green, a vision of Australia\u2019s own youth and strength and righteousness. For now that great outdoors has become strange, licked by flames and fogged with smoke. The shadow is beginning to clarify. One thing is certain. We will, from here, have a front-row seat.",

      "body": "<p>Since the end of the second world war and the enactment of its pacifist constitution, Japan has deployed its forces overseas mostly on peacekeeping operations under UN auspices \u2013 and almost never to places where its troops are in harm\u2019s way.

On what is being described as an intelligence-gathering mission, the warship will patrol the Gulf of Oman, the northern part of the Arabian sea and a portion of the Bab el-Mandeb strait, following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/13/oil-tankers-blasts-reports-gulf-of-oman-us-navy\" title=\"\">series of attacks on oil tankers</a> in the region \u2013 including one that was Japanese-operated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2015, Abe passed unpopular legislation allowing Japan to exercise the right of collective self-defence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last month\u2019s decision by prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s cabinet to send the destroyer is a curious one. Japan imports 90% of its oil from the Middle East and 80% passes through the strait of Hormuz, where ships are now being escorted by a US-led naval coalition. The Japanese warship will not patrol this crucial chokepoint, but it will still be in the vicinity \u2013 and if fighting breaks out, which looks more likely in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions\" title=\"\">the assassination</a> of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, the mission could easily morph into armed support of the coalition.</p> <p>This possibility of mission creep is precisely what the Japanese public worries about: <a href=\"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/12/2f8765a6d12f-urgent-japan-oks-msdf-dispatch-to-middle-east-to-ensure-safe-sea-lane.html\" title=\"\">a poll taken last month</a> suggests 52% oppose the deployment while just 34% are in favour. Abe will be crossing his fingers that he is not forced to fight, as he is anxious not to stoke opposition to his plans to revise the country\u2019s pacifist constitution in 2020. Japanese casualties would almost certainly nix any chances of revision, reinforcing public unease that at Washington\u2019s behest Japan could be dragged into a conflict under the terms of <a href=\"https://www.mod.go.jp/e/d_act/anpo/shishin_20150427e.html\" title=\"\">the US-Japan defence guidelines</a> enacted in 2015. These guidelines significantly expand what Japan is committed to do militarily in support of the US.</p> <p>Abe is walking a tightrope. He has bowed to US pressure not to leave all the heavy lifting on security to Uncle Sam. But he is also wary of antagonising Iran, which has been blamed by Washington for the attacks on oil tankers. Japan has longstanding good ties with Tehran \u2013 a week before the naval deployment was announced, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-japan-iran-abe/japan-briefs-iran-on-plan-to-send-forces-to-middle-east-idUKKBN1YO11J\" title=\"\">Abe hosted Hassan Rouhani</a>, the Iranian president \u2013 and is keen to convince Iran to maintain its commitment to renounce nuclear weapons despite Donald Trump pulling the plug on the deal. Tokyo defers to Washington on security matters, but believes the deal is the best option and quietly disagrees with Trump\u2019s decision, as do almost all US allies and strategic partners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11b8994bce9ab89ea2de680a1c0e6e9fa9eb139d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b8994bce9ab89ea2de680a1c0e6e9fa9eb139d/0_99_4586_2751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shinzo Abe and Iranian president Hassan Rouhani in Tokyo last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Japan\u2019s minimalist deployment in the Middle East mollifies Iran.\u2019 Shinzo Abe and Hassan Rouhani in Tokyo last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump is less popular in Japan than any US president before him. His unseemly bullying and crass behaviour go down badly. His erratic diplomacy and demands that Japan pay more for hosting US bases have only reinforced the government\u2019s belief that in order to keep the US engaged militarily in the region, Japan has to step up. <a href=\"https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/08/30/purchases-of-american-weapons-drive-japans-defense-spending-hike/\" title=\"\">Big ticket purchases</a> of military hardware from US manufacturers and a trade deal that will boost US agricultural exports to Japan are key elements of Abe\u2019s damage-control strategy, but against the backdrop of a $60bn US trade deficit, probably only the start.</p> <p>Japan\u2019s minimalist deployment in the Middle East is less than the US wants, but it mollifies Iran and, perhaps more importantly, the Japanese public. Many in Japan are already concerned about Abe\u2019s efforts to revise the constitution\u2019s war-renouncing article 9, which imposes curbs on its military forces, so the country can take on a more assertive security role.</p> <p>For most of its 65-year history, Abe\u2019s conservative Liberal Democratic party consistently maintained that Japan could only use its military to defend itself. But in 2015, he passed unpopular legislation allowing the country to exercise the right of collective self-defence. This means Japan can now fight in support of the US and other strategic partners, dispatching troops into conflict zones overseas if the prime minister deems this essential, although it hasn\u2019t yet done so. Aside from easing US frustrations about a one-sided security alliance, Abe and his supporters see article 9 as a symbol of Japan\u2019s subordination to the US and seek revision as a matter of both national pride and national security.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/28/how-japan-has-fared-in-30-years-since-the-stock-market-bubble-burst\">How Japan has fared in 30 years since the stock market bubble burst</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abe and others on the right worry that Washington is fed up with Japan not doing more on security at a time when the neighbourhood is getting more dangerous, with threats including China\u2019s hegemonic ambitions and North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme.

      "bodyText": "Since the end of the second world war and the enactment of its pacifist constitution, Japan has deployed its forces overseas mostly on peacekeeping operations under UN auspices \u2013 and almost never to places where its troops are in harm\u2019s way. But next month, the country will send a naval destroyer to the Middle East. On what is being described as an intelligence-gathering mission, the warship will patrol the Gulf of Oman, the northern part of the Arabian sea and a portion of the Bab el-Mandeb strait, following a series of attacks on oil tankers in the region \u2013 including one that was Japanese-operated. Last month\u2019s decision by prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s cabinet to send the destroyer is a curious one. Japan imports 90% of its oil from the Middle East and 80% passes through the strait of Hormuz, where ships are now being escorted by a US-led naval coalition. The Japanese warship will not patrol this crucial chokepoint, but it will still be in the vicinity \u2013 and if fighting breaks out, which looks more likely in the wake of the assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, the mission could easily morph into armed support of the coalition. This possibility of mission creep is precisely what the Japanese public worries about: a poll taken last month suggests 52% oppose the deployment while just 34% are in favour. Abe will be crossing his fingers that he is not forced to fight, as he is anxious not to stoke opposition to his plans to revise the country\u2019s pacifist constitution in 2020. Japanese casualties would almost certainly nix any chances of revision, reinforcing public unease that at Washington\u2019s behest Japan could be dragged into a conflict under the terms of the US-Japan defence guidelines enacted in 2015. These guidelines significantly expand what Japan is committed to do militarily in support of the US. Abe is walking a tightrope. He has bowed to US pressure not to leave all the heavy lifting on security to Uncle Sam. But he is also wary of antagonising Iran, which has been blamed by Washington for the attacks on oil tankers. Japan has longstanding good ties with Tehran \u2013 a week before the naval deployment was announced, Abe hosted Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president \u2013 and is keen to convince Iran to maintain its commitment to renounce nuclear weapons despite Donald Trump pulling the plug on the deal. Tokyo defers to Washington on security matters, but believes the deal is the best option and quietly disagrees with Trump\u2019s decision, as do almost all US allies and strategic partners. Trump is less popular in Japan than any US president before him. His unseemly bullying and crass behaviour go down badly. His erratic diplomacy and demands that Japan pay more for hosting US bases have only reinforced the government\u2019s belief that in order to keep the US engaged militarily in the region, Japan has to step up. Big ticket purchases of military hardware from US manufacturers and a trade deal that will boost US agricultural exports to Japan are key elements of Abe\u2019s damage-control strategy, but against the backdrop of a $60bn US trade deficit, probably only the start. Japan\u2019s minimalist deployment in the Middle East is less than the US wants, but it mollifies Iran and, perhaps more importantly, the Japanese public. Many in Japan are already concerned about Abe\u2019s efforts to revise the constitution\u2019s war-renouncing article 9, which imposes curbs on its military forces, so the country can take on a more assertive security role. For most of its 65-year history, Abe\u2019s conservative Liberal Democratic party consistently maintained that Japan could only use its military to defend itself. But in 2015, he passed unpopular legislation allowing the country to exercise the right of collective self-defence. This means Japan can now fight in support of the US and other strategic partners, dispatching troops into conflict zones overseas if the prime minister deems this essential, although it hasn\u2019t yet done so. Aside from easing US frustrations about a one-sided security alliance, Abe and his supporters see article 9 as a symbol of Japan\u2019s subordination to the US and seek revision as a matter of both national pride and national security. Abe and others on the right worry that Washington is fed up with Japan not doing more on security at a time when the neighbourhood is getting more dangerous, with threats including China\u2019s hegemonic ambitions and North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. The Japanese public, in turn, worries where the hawkish Abe will lead them and even most supporters of revising the constitution oppose it on his watch. Facing such resistance, he has incrementally whittled down his proposal for revision of article 9 to merely declaring the self defence forces constitutional, an uncontroversial proposition. Abe is taking a big political risk, which has grown considerably with Suleimani\u2019s assassination. His government has been criticised for basing this deployment on an obscure, vaguely worded law permitting \u201cinvestigation and research\u201d, which grants the defence minister sweeping discretionary powers not subject to parliamentary oversight. Even though Japan has asserted that there is no imminent danger, it says it is prepared for military action if the situation escalates. But if anything goes wrong, don\u2019t expect a burst of patriotism \u2013 there is a far higher chance of a strong domestic backlash.

Under EU law, sound recordings are covered by copyright for the first 50 calendar years after they were made \u2013 unless they have been \u201clawfully communicated to the public\u201d, in which case the copyright term extends a further 20 years. At the end of 2019, then, ABKCO would have faced a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d conundrum: if it did not publish the tracks it held, it would find it difficult to monetise them in the future, as the copyright for the recordings (though not the compositions) would lapse. Some publishers, faced with similar issues, have released collections of recordings \u2013 of interest to super-fans only \u2013 such as the Beatles\u2019 2013 album Bootleg Recordings 1963. Others, perhaps less eager to share early, unfinished versions of songs with the world, have pushed what it means to \u201cpublish\u201d tracks: a Bob Dylan compilation, literally published as \u201cThe Copyright Extension Collection, Volume 1\u201d, was also released in 2013 in an edition of 100, and only sold in Europe. But this would be the first time a label has taken such a minimalist approach to publication. Even while the Stones tracks were available on YouTube, they were reportedly tampered with to make them less appealing to fans who might rip them and share them elsewhere. \u201cThe rarest recordings \u2013 ie the ones not previously available on bootlegs \u2013 have a dial-tone-like sound as loud as the music,\u201d reported Variety\u2019s Jem Aswad, making them \u201ca truly miserable listening experience\u201d. It remains unclear whether a publication of a single day, on one internet video platform, will be enough to satisfy European judges that the tracks were indeed \u201clawfully communicated to the public\u201d. ABKCO declined to comment.",

The coming months will see a battle over what the party is prepared to sacrifice along the way. \u2022 Chaminda Jayanetti is a journalist who covers politics and public services",

It\u2019s his <strong>second consecutive half-century</strong>, and it\u2019s been a classy, purposeful and selfless innings.</p> <p>\u201cI saw a lot of players expressed opinions on four-day Tests, and it\u2019s always good to see them expressing their views,\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cHowever, you\u2019d hope that would come after having achieved something in the longer format. Buttler should concentrate on keeping schtum &amp; improving drastically on his form in a role he doesn\u2019t deserve before pontificating on the future of Test cricket. His role here was get through to the new ball, not score like it was a Twenty20.\u201d<br></p> <p>I\u2019m not sure he trusted himself to do that, which is why he got as many as he could against the old ball. I can see both sides. But if Buttler doesn\u2019t get a score or two in this series, they surely <em>have </em>to turn to Foakes in Sri Lanka, especially as he\u2019s such a good player of spin. The era of Stokes/Bairstow/Buttler/Moeen promised so much, but it hasn\u2019t really worked out. Maybe it was the right middle-order at the right time, with the fast-bowling revival and pitches becoming more challenging. They could have scored a lot of runs in the early 2010s. Who knows.

It feels like the last Test of an Ashes winter: half the team injured, replacements flying in, wheels falling off. Two weeks ago it was South Africa who were in disarray. Now they\u2019re one up and feeling quietly pleased with themselves, while disarray, like a Greek god, has changed sides on a whim. England\u2019s luck has gone from bad to curse \u2013 first a flu epidemic, then Jofra Archer\u2019s bad elbow, now a football injury taking Rory Burns out of the whole series. If Alastair Cook was due at this game as a commentator, he\u2019d probably find himself playing in it. </p> <p>England\u2019s top three may well be Sibley, Crawley and Denly, who sound more like a set of adverbs than a source of runs. Sibley has played three Tests, Crawley one; Sibley has 74 Test runs, which is 73 more than Crawley. Denly, who\u2019s on 651, has at least found a way of making uncharacteristically dour fifties, but England may need a bit more than that here. Newlands, in Cape Town, is made for batting, almost as much as for taking pictures. </p> <p>South Africa are expected to bring in Pieter Malan, their third 30-something debutant of the series, in place of the injured Aiden Markram. England may be wishing they had a Malan too \u2013 Dawid Malan averages 35 in Tests away from home, and clearly has the temperament for the top, as well as some local knowledge. The way things are going, he could be on the next plane. </p> <p>Among the bowlers, Dom Bess is the most likely understudy for Archer, which is rather like replacing a sword with a Swiss Army knife. See you for the toss at 10am in Cape Town, 8am GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-02T22:56:40.917Z\">at 10.56pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That was South Africa\u2019s day, no doubt. They bowled really well, with Anrich Nortje outstanding, though they were helped by England\u2019s batsmen getting themselves out when well set. Ben Stokes was the most extreme example; he made a majestic 47 before losing concentration for the first and last time. Ollie Pope played stylishly to reach 56 not out, and his unbroken last-wicket partnership of 28 with Jimmy Anderson meant that England ended the day on a slightly less dispiriting note. If they bowl well tomorrow, they have a chance of winning the match. If not, they will be 2-0 down early next week. 89th over: England 262-9 (Pope 56, Anderson 3) Nortje ends the over with a maiden to Pope. We\u2019re one short despite the extra half hour. If only it was 98 overs a day. \u201cKeep seeing comments about how Pope will have to slog and sacrifice his average because of the collapse,\u201d says Dominic O\u2019Reilly. \u201cAs an example, when Thorpe shielded Hoggard against Sri Lanka and they put on 91 he didn\u2019t slog. Second, no one should blame the youngster when the old guard have failed. Or is the 1990s all over again?\u201d Have you been on social media since ever? 88th over: England 262-9 (Pope 56, Anderson 3) Funnily enough, the situation now demands a few T20 strokes from Pope. After uppercutting Rabada for four, he top-edges a hook and is caught at fine leg by Philander. Scratch that, replays show it was a no-ball. \u201cThe main problem with \u2018the era of Stokes/Bairstow/Buttler/Moeen\u2019 is that all of them, by rights, should have been batting at six,\u201d says Andy Shaw. \u201cTrying to play all of them in the same side meant too often that both the batting and the bowling ended up weaker than it should have been.\u201d Essentially I agree, although I\u2019d argue some of them were 6.5s at best. I think all of us were seduced by style. There\u2019s a decent \u2018sixes and sevens\u2019 line in there somewhere, but I can\u2019t quite make it work. Michael Holding, while praising Pope\u2019s batting, notes that he hasn\u2019t played for England in \u201cthat thing that bowlers bowl four overs in\u201d. Nobody does contempt like Mikey. It\u2019s a shame the ECB marketing department have committed to the Hundred, too. I\u2019d love to see them launch the brave new world of TTTBBFOI. 87th over: England 257-9 (Pope 52, Anderson 3) Nortje returns to the attack. Pope declines a single for his fifty - but he gets there later in the over, clouting Nortje through midwicket for three. It\u2019s his second consecutive half-century, and it\u2019s been a classy, purposeful and selfless innings. \u201cI saw a lot of players expressed opinions on four-day Tests, and it\u2019s always good to see them expressing their views,\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cHowever, you\u2019d hope that would come after having achieved something in the longer format. Buttler should concentrate on keeping schtum &amp; improving drastically on his form in a role he doesn\u2019t deserve before pontificating on the future of Test cricket. His role here was get through to the new ball, not score like it was a Twenty20.\u201d I\u2019m not sure he trusted himself to do that, which is why he got as many as he could against the old ball. I can see both sides. But if Buttler doesn\u2019t get a score or two in this series, they surely have to turn to Foakes in Sri Lanka, especially as he\u2019s such a good player of spin. The era of Stokes/Bairstow/Buttler/Moeen promised so much, but it hasn\u2019t really worked out. Maybe it was the right middle-order at the right time, with the fast-bowling revival and pitches becoming more challenging. They could have scored a lot of runs in the early 2010s. Who knows. I\u2019ll level with you, I haven\u2019t a clue. 86th over: England 254-9 (Pope 49, Anderson 3) Anderson, who is a better defensive batsman than Broad and should probably be promoted above him, digs out a yorker from Rabada and survives the rest of the over. He even takes two off the fifth delivery. \u201cRe: over 81,\u201d says Toby Hester. \u201cYou say it\u2019s no way to start a Test career, but there\u2019s a noble history of young, English talent blooded in hopeless situations in South Africa. Two for four, anyone?\u201d Chris Adams didn\u2019t have that great a career, honk honk. But yes, point taken. I was only really referring to the fact he has to farm the strike, and potentially do damage to his average, rather than just being able to bat in a bubble. 85th over: England 252-9 (Pope 49, Anderson 1) Anderson inside-edges his first ball for a single, which allows Pope to take strike. He lifts Philander over mid-off and mid-on for consecutive boundaries, the second a lovely stroke that takes him to 49. On an otherwise dismal day, he has played a really uplifting innings. \u201cI seem to remember the early days when Broad seemed to be an all-rounder - kind of like Freddie,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cWas the tailing off the result of that nose ball? Testimony to the power of confidence, I suppose.\u201d Yep, Varun Aaron in 2014. He was averaging 24 at that point. It\u2019s hard to be too critical, as it sounds like it was pretty traumatic. 84th over: England 243-9 (Pope 41, Anderson 0) That\u2019s a stunning stroke from Pope. Rabada dug in a bouncer outside leg stump, and Pope - who was originally shaping to sway out of the way - bent his back like a limbo dancer to glide it high over the cordon for four. He takes two off the last ball, a misjudgement that means Anderson will be on strike to Philander. \u201cIf I can dare to look at the positives, Rob: we have a decent 3-6 now, we have a settled opener and two tyros who could come good, and Bairstow is no longer in the team,\u201d says Gareth Wilson. \u201cOn the downside - Root can\u2019t captain and it\u2019s starting to feel like Broad or Anderson rather than AND.\u201d I know what you mean about the middle order, but it\u2019s not exactly Trott, Pietersen, Bell and AN Other (followed by Prior, Bresnan, Swann and Broad 1.0). I fear we are in for years rather than months of this mediocrity. They need a complete reset, as with the ODI team in 2015. 83rd over: England 235-9 (Pope 33, Anderson 0) It\u2019s been another memorable collapse from England, who have lost five wickets for 50 since Ben Stokes got himself out. And there are plenty more where that came from. Pope gives Anderson two balls to survive, and he manages it. In the last two years, incidentally, Broad has a Test batting average of 8. Once the new Garry Sobers, now the new Glenn McGrath. 82nd over: England 234-9 (Pope 32, Anderson 0) Broad\u2019s bat actually got stuck behind his back pad, although I doubt it made much difference. He was so far back, expecting the short ball, that he almost walked on his stumps. \u201cIf I was Pope, I\u2019d take a 35 not out,\u201d says Kevin Wilson. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have to bat stupidly because Broad and Anderson literally cannot be bothered to bat anymore.\u201d Pope is playing orthodox strokes for the time being, and takes a single off the penultimate delivery of Rabada\u2019s over. That means Broad has one ball to survive. Yeah, nice one. He\u2019s cleaned up by an excellent yorker. 81st over: England 233-8 (Pope 31, Broad 0) Ollie Pope is now in an impossible position, with only Broad and Anderson left at the other end. He either has to start slogging, and give his wicket away, or face criticism for being selfish. It\u2019s no way to build a Test career, this. \u201cI\u2019d often thought about finding out where exactly Martin McCague lived in Larne and making a pilgrimage, or even working on getting a blue plaque installed,\u201d says James Butler (see 49th over). Though given Albert Trott was denied one (despite being the only person to clear the Lord\u2019s pavilion) I might need to go down the route of lauding his Guinness-related achievements, rather than his cricket...\u201d How about a 9-84 commemorative plaque? One ball, that\u2019s all Philander needed with the second new ball. That was almost comically straightforward. Bess walked into a wide outswinger, which he didn\u2019t need to play, and snicked it through to de Kock. 80th over: England 231-7 (Pope 30, Bess 0) A maiden from Maharaj to Pope. It\u2019s time for the second new ball. 79th over: England 231-7 (Pope 30, Bess 0) 260, 517-1 dec., 620-5 dec., 187, 123, 513, 644. Did they even exist? \u201cGood thought about Adams keeping,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cI just feel that popping up to Formby to get Tatenda Taibu\u2019s signature might be easier than getting the prime minister of Pakistan\u2019s. Then again, given the bloody trains...\u201d Oh dear. The ball after lacing a drive for four, Curran offers no stroke to a good ball from Pretorius that jags back to hit the top of off. I told you he should have kept on counter-attacking. 78th over: England 227-6 (Pope 30, Curran 5) I fear Curran is getting a little carried away with counter-attacking. In his brilliant 2018, he averaged 37 in Tests with a healthy strike-rate of 58. In 2019, his average was 21 and his strike-rate 77. That\u2019s far too skittish. 77th over: England 225-6 (Pope 29, Curran 4) Curran gets off the mark with an inside edge past leg stump for four. Although England\u2019s score is under par, they certainly aren\u2019t out of this game. South Africa will have to bat last on a pitch that is already a bit cracked, and you\u2019d expect Anderson and Broad to utilise the cross-seam delivery like South Africa. They really need to get to 300, though. 76th over: England 221-6 (Pope 29, S Curran 0) For all the, a-hem, imperfections in England\u2019s batting, South Africa have bowled ever so well in this series. They have a lovely, balanced attack, with four very different right-arm seamers and an excellent spinner. 75th over: England 221-6 (Pope 29, S Curran 0) The new batsman is Sam Curran. He has been a little frisky with the bat of late. \u201cLovely work by Russell Jackson re: the bat,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cJust wanting to know if I\u2019m the only cricket tragic who immediately tried to work out the batting order of the signatories. Which I think is Gavaskar, Taylor, Chappell, Richards, Hughes, Yallop, Adams, wicket-keeper, Greig, Benaud and Walsh. Obviously a keeper who can bowl a bit would be useful, and the fact he has to have been captain makes the choice obvious, Zimbabwe\u2019s Tatenda Taibu, wicket keeper, captain, and 25 first class wickets. I think whoever buys the bat should pledge to get that signature. Now playing for Formby, so eminently possible.\u201d Or Jimmy Adams could keep wicket, which would make room for the prime minster of Pakistan. Heckuva tail, too: Benaud at No10. Buttler\u2019s exciting cameo of 29 from 27 balls is over. He walked down the pitch and thin-edged a very good delivery from Pretorius through to de Kock. That\u2019s a big bonus for South Africa with the new ball only a few overs away. It also means five England players have been dismissed between 29 and 47, which is not good on a first-day pitch. 74th over: England 215-5 (Pope 29, Buttler 23) \u201cRob,\u201d says Chris Mellor. \u201cOn the subject of Ben Stokes\u2019 tattoos, one says, \u2018Being the best that you can be is only possible if you desire to be a champion and your fear of failure is non-existent\u2019. The other arm says, \u2018May people respect you. Trouble neglect you. Angels protect you. Heaven accept you\u2019.\u201d Extra cover catch you. Actually, we shouldn\u2019t be too critical because he is still one of the best things in life right now. It\u2019s just frustrating that he keeps making brilliant - and they really are that good, until the moment of dismissal - thirties and forties. 73rd over: England 214-5 (Pope 29, Buttler 22) Dwaine Pretorius returns for a short spell before the second new ball. Pope drives pleasantly for a couple and then edges along the ground for four. Time for drinks. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Mark Berkeley. \u201cSurely we\u2019re missing the influence of Robert Ryman on Big Vern. A master in white whose variations are so subtle as to be unnoticeable until you\u2019re up close, by which time you\u2019re dazzled.\u201d I feel so damn ignorant right now. 72nd over: England 208-5 (Pope 23, Buttler 22) Buttler waves Maharaj lazily over mid-on for six to move to 22 from 14 balls. That went into a construction site, in fact. 71st over: England 202-5 (Pope 23, Buttler 16) This is another ferocious spell from Nortje. He\u2019s more than just a big, dumb quick, as he showed in the first innings at Centurion. It\u2019s only his third Test, so we shouldn\u2019t get carried away, but he looks like a serious prospect at first-change. England are really struggling to handle him. He\u2019s taken care of Root and Stokes, and Pope almost falls in that over when he edges a drive short of second slip. 70th over: England 202-5 (Pope 23, Buttler 16) Buttler premeditates a sweep for four off Maharaj. It looks England are going to try to get as many as they can before the second new ball. And why not? I\u2019ll tell you why not, because they might bloody throw it away! Buttler almost does so when he is dropped by the debutant Malan at silly mid-off. It was a difficult low chance, and it went through his fingertips. I forgot to post this at tea. Please look at this. 69th over: England 196-5 (Pope 22, Buttler 11) Buttler smacks Nortje for a couple of boundaries. The first was pinged through the covers, the second flicked off middle and leg stump as he moved across the crease. That was a weird stroke, certainly for somebody facing his fifth ball on day one of a Test. Pace gets the beans going, as Nasser Hussain says, and Nortje regularly bowls over 90mph. With Curran and Bess to come, Buttler should have the chance to build an innings properly rather than \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Paul Birrell. \u201cI like the idea of bringing Bairstow back into this England team (37th over) as an opening bat, as a counterpoint to Sibley and Denly. Do you think it might even work to switch him into keeping wicket at the drop of the opposition\u2019s eighth wicket to allow some time to get his eye in and assess any demons that may lie in the pitch? Is this the kind of rotation of which you may approve?\u201d I think that\u2019s too funky, even for a slap-bass champion like me. As for Bairstow, he needs a long break, not two Tests. I\u2019d give him the whole summer with Yorkshire (and the ODI team). I wouldn\u2019t write him off completely, because he has the ability to get big runs in Australia in 2021-22, but at the moment he\u2019s a complete mess. 68th over: England 187-5 (Pope 22, Buttler 2) KP, commentating on Sky, is effusive in his praise of Ollie Pope: \u201cIan Bell clone ... love his intensity ... very good player ... technically sound ... the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d 67th over: England 186-5 (Pope 22, Buttler 1) It\u2019s hard to convey how beautifully Stokes played for his 47 runs, but that was a really poor shot. It was the same in the first innings at Centurion. Though he is England\u2019s best batsman by a distance, his lack of concentration and ruthlessness are so frustrating. For a superhero, he has almost been a bit of a klutz. Stokes has thrown it away. He does this far too often for a player of his class. He tried to drive Nortje and got a slight leading edge to extra cover, where Dean Elgar took a tumbling catch. 66th over: England 184-4 (Stokes 47, Pope 21) Stokes played a majestic stroke earlier in the over, pulling Maharaj wristily for four. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cRe: the suggestion that Root was angry because wasn\u2019t ready for his dismissal ball and assuming no external distractions (crowd movement, field changes, nose picking umpire or whatever) then surely: a) that\u2019s his own fault; b) that\u2019s his own fault, and c) that\u2019s his own fault. \u201cIt was hardly a case of knocking it back to a spinner, still on the crease, who then takes two strides and bowls unexpectedly.\u201d Well, I should say that we don\u2019t know for certain he complained. But I do think that generally \u2013 more as a captain than batsman, to be fair \u2013 he has become dangerously fond of rationalising failure. It\u2019s always going to be different next time. Pope survives! It was umpire\u2019s call. He pushed around a delivery from Maharaj that pitched on middle and leg and straightened to hit the pad. It was given not out on the field by Kumar Dharmasena \u2013 and that was ultimately decisive, even though replays showed it was hitting a fair chunk of leg stump. South Africa review for LBW against Pope! This looks close but I reckon it will be umpire\u2019s call. 65th over: England 178-4 (Stokes 42, Pope 20) The impressive Anrich Nortje returns to the attack. That means a different type of interrogation for Pope - and he almost sings like a canary after only two balls! He was beaten for pace and clunked a pull just over the head of Philander mid-on. Stokes then does well to drop a nasty lifter to the turf, and even better to flash the next ball through the covers for four. That brings up an excellent fifty partnership from 104 balls. I suspect they will be many of those between Stokes and Pope in the next five years; they have a really nice chemistry at the crease. 64th over: England 172-4 (Stokes 37, Pope 19) Maharaj is teasing Stokes with subtle variations of flight, pace and line. Stokes takes his medicine for five balls - and then walks down to belt the most emphatic six over long-on. Brilliant batting. If Stokes had the concentration and ruthlessness of Steve Smith, he\u2019d average 55 in Test cricket. 63rd over: England 166-4 (Stokes 31, Pope 19) A maiden from Philander to Pope. \u201cFollowing on from James Byrne (59th over),\u201d begins David Murray, \u201chow is it that Philander is so deadly with the Kookaburra but our Jimmy Anderson usually so ineffective with it.\u201d I would disagree that Jimmy is ineffective. Much of it is familiarity \u2013 including practise, Philander will have bowled tens of thousands more overs with it. He also relies more on seam, where swing is Anderson\u2019s biggest weapon. But the success of Philander, and England\u2019s 85mph attack in the 2010-11 Ashes, does show that it\u2019s not all about pace with the Kookaburra. 62nd over: England 166-4 (Stokes 31, Pope 19) Stokes against Maharaj is always a good contest. Stokes is ahead on points, but Maharaj nailed him in victories at Trent Bridge in 2017 and Centurion last week. He\u2019s a crafty spinner who demands respect, probably South Africa\u2019s best spinner since readmission. And though Stokes is clearly keen to attack in that over, Maharaj\u2019s variety keeps him creasebound. A maiden. 61st over: England 166-4 (Stokes 31, Pope 19) Four more to Pope, timed sweetly through midwicket off Philander. He plays with such confidence for somebody who only turned 22 yesterday. In fact he\u2019s the most exciting young England batsman I\u2019ve seen since, okay, Haseeb Hameed. \u201cRoot pulls this \u2018I\u2019m not ready\u2019 stunt far too often,\u2019 says Gary Naylor. \u201cIt\u2019s his job to be ready. What is he standing there for?\u201d He keeps losing focus because he\u2019s trying to work out how four-day Test cricket is going to work. We never manage 90 overs a day, so let\u2019s see if we can do 98. 60th over: England 161-4 (Stokes 30, Pope 15) England have started positively after tea, Pope in particular, and they take three singles from Maharaj\u2019s over. \u201cThumbs up for both Adrian Armstrong\u2019s Philander/Barnett Newman comparison (51st over) and of his excellent art-geek pun,\u201d says Sam Collier. \u201cAlmost enough to take my mind of the impending apocalypse.\u201d 59th over: England 158-4 (Stokes 28, Pope 14) Vernon Philander\u2019s second ball seams beautifully past Pope\u2019s outside edge. Pope snapped his head round to follow the ball, which can be a sign that a batsman has edged it, but there was no appeal and nothing on UltraEdge. Pope\u2019s response is classy and authoratitive, a push-drive to the extra-cover boundary off the next delivery. A pair of twos complete an excellent over. He\u2019s got something, this kid, there\u2019s no point denying it for fear of cursing his entire career and life. \u201cI admit I\u2019m not a religious follower of all OBOs (yes, yes, I\u2019ll do my penance later ...) so I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m the first person to think and ask this question,\u201d begins James Byrne. \u201cBut if the Kookaburra ball is so bad for bowlers, then why do England still get bowled out for nothing all around the world, and have done since, well, forever?\u201d That\u2019s a dissertation idea, not an OBO email. There are a few reasons: pace, familiarity with the ball and conditions (for bowlers and batsmen), quality spin, reverse swing and England\u2019s inability to bat time. It hasn\u2019t always been thus, though: the 2010-11 Ashes winners, for example, batted 150 overs or more in four of their seven innings. Ultimately it comes down to the fact that this England team are rough-track bullies. 58th over: England 150-4 (Stokes 28, Pope 6) Maharaj starts after tea to Pope, who shovels the fifth ball off the pads for a single. He has started positively, as is his wont, but the bowling has been so accurate that he has only been able to make six from 29 balls. \u201cDoes anyone know what all that writing tattooed on Ben Stokes says?\u201d asks Max Bonnell. \u201cI\u2019d like to think it\u2019s wise old northern maxims like, \u2018Don\u2019t cut before lunch on the first day\u2019 or, \u2018If you think the score looks good, add two wickets\u2019, but perhaps not.\u201d I think one of them is Latin for \u2018FOOTBALL KILLS\u2019. Root\u2019s radge \u201cRoot was really upset when given out, possibly because he didn\u2019t think he was ready and the bowler started his run early,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cIn fairness, SA might claim that they thought England were taking too much time out of the game with delaying tactics, hence perhaps a bit of a hurry-up. Nobody seems to have been properly sporting about it, which is not nice.\u201d Teatime teasers That was another good session for South Africa. They picked up two Joes for the price of one, with both Root and Denly out in the thirties after promising starts, and England will have to bat pretty well to make a par score on what looks a pretty good pitch. 57th over: England 149-4 (Stokes 28, Pope 5) Stokes ends the afternoon session with a loose and unusual stroke, fiddling Rabada between second slip and gully for four. That\u2019s the kindf of shot Root normally plays. He\u2019s still there, which is the main thing for England, and will resume after tea. 56th over: England 143-4 (Stokes 22, Pope 5) South Africa have always loved a defensive fourth seamer, and the early impression is that Pretorious is fit for that particular purpose. He continues to hammer a tight line to Pope, who can\u2019t pierce the inner ring. Another maiden, Pretorius\u2019s fifth in seven overs. \u201cIn fairness,\u201d says my colleague Daniel Harris, \u201cthere\u2019s probably no one in the world who\u2019s given playing left-arm spin more thought than KP.\u201d And Daniel would know, having ghost-written the definitive insight into the mind of a genius. 55th over: England 143-4 (Stokes 22, Pope 5) There are only a few minutes to tea, so England aren\u2019t taking any risks. The result is a maiden from Rabada to Stokes. \u201cThe right-handed openers was also on Cricinfo this morning,\u201d says Chris Evans. \u201cIn 2016 against Sri Lanka Cook had to bat down the order, so Hales and Compton opened. As for ODIs - Bairstow and Roy.\u201d I KNOW IT WAS BAIRSTOW AND ROY, FOR HEAVEN\u2019S SAKE, IT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST DAYS OF MY SO-CALLED LIFE! Ah yes, I\u2019d forgotten about that Cook injury. The memory on you! 54th over: England 143-4 (Stokes 22, Pope 5) Dwaine Pretorius replaces the impressive Maharaj. And as is often the case when he bowls, nothing much happens. \u201cAccording to TalkSport2, Rabada made a special journey across the pitch to wish Root a happy new year on his way off, and Joe reacted by having a long chunter at the square-leg umpire followed by more chuntering in the dugout,\u201d says Tom Adam. \u201cDid you see anything?\u201d I didn\u2019t, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. There has always been a bit of needle between them. 53rd over: England 142-4 (Stokes 21, Pope 5) Stokes times a beautiful check drive through extra cover for four off Rabada. He is playing superbly. 52nd over: England 135-4 (Stokes 16, Pope 3) Pope gets off the mark with a confident stroke, dancing down the track to clip Maharaj through mid-on for three. He should, fitness permitting, get an extended run in the team over the next 12-18 months. \u201cSpot on Rob, well done!\u201d says Steve Castle of his quiz question in the 50th over. \u201cI got it, but only after basically listing England cricketers who are now pundits.\u201d I knew that year on the Wisden Diet would pay off one day. 51st over: England 131-4 (Stokes 15, Pope 0) Stokes is beaten by a beauty from Rabada that lifts extravagantly outside off stump, but slams an emphatic pull for four later in the over. He looks good. He always looks good these days, and the only things he lacks as a Test batsman are concentration and ruthlessness. Shaun Pollock, commentating on Sky, notes that South Africa have bowled a lot of cross-seam deliveries in an attempt to get some variable bounce, including the Nortje snorter that dismissed Root. \u201cSurely Philander is Barnett Newman (25th over)?\u201d says Adrian Armstrong. \u201cThe foremost exponent of wicket-to-wicket Abstract Expressionism. Newman maybe had more zip than Philander, though.\u201d 50th over: England 127-4 (Stokes 11, Pope 0) Pope has started watchfully against Maharaj, who is bowling with challenging accuracy. Another maiden. \u201cI\u2019m currently battling with an absolute belter of a trivia question sent by a mate to torment/entertain me through the rest of this day...\u201d says Steve Castle. \u201cWhen did England last field two right-handed opening batsmen and who were they?\u201d We were chatting about this earlier. In a Test, I think it was Rob Key and Michael Vaughan at Headingley in 2002. In a one-day international, no idea. 49th over: England 127-4 (Stokes 11, Pope 0) Rabada replaces Nortje, who blew the bloody doors off the England innings with that spell to Denly and Root, and starts with a maiden to Stokes. England have a bit more batting to come than in the first Test, with Dom Bess at No9, but they are still in a precarious position. While I don\u2019t think the pitch is quite the belter some have suggested, England will want at least 350. \u201cHappy new year - and hello from sunny Larne, Northern Ireland,\u201d says James Butler. \u201cA New Year\u2019s quiz question for you...what is the connection between Larne and Test cricket?\u201d I\u2019ve waited my whole cricket-writing life for somebody to ask that question. I\u2019m in tears over here. 48th over: England 127-4 (Stokes 11, Pope 0) This, I\u2019m here to tell you, is not a 127 for four pitch. Ollie Pope is the new batsman, and that\u2019s good news for lovers of the future. Groundhog Denly. A solid start to the innings, with loads to admire, and then a soft dismissal for a nothing score. He pushed defensively outside the line at an arm ball from Maharaj that went through the gate and pegged back the off stump. Ach! 47th over: England 125-3 (Denly 37, Stokes 10) Stokes tries to pull Nortje but is beaten for pace and hit on the bicep. Or biceps, I forget what we decided during the last Test. Denly plays a more confident pull for a single. He is back in the nervous nothingscores. Only three of his 22 Test innings have ended in single figures; only three have exceeded 53. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019ll find it ironic,\u201d says Mike Daniels, \u201cthat Kevin Pietersen is giving advice on how to play left-arm spin.\u201d Next up: KP on the joy of self-awareness. 46th over: England 120-3 (Denly 33, Stokes 9) Maharaj continues, two from the over, blah blah blah. More Nortje to Stokes please! True, although even Virat was bounced out by Shannon Gabriel last year. He wasn\u2019t in, I suppose. 45th over: England 118-3 (Denly 32, Stokes 8) Stokes is not the same hyper-aggressive batsman who slaughtered 258 on this ground, but there is still scope for a bit of testosterone cricket when he faces Nortje. After a single earlier in the over, he crunches a drive through Philander at mid-off for four. Have some popcorn to hand, just in case. 44th over: England 111-3 (Denly 31, Stokes 2) A quiet over from Maharaj, one from it. But he rushes through the over so that we can all get another hit of Nortje. \u201cI remember Boycs dismissing Denly earlier this year on TMS with words to the effect of \u2018just James Vince with a better brain\u2019,\u201d says Name Redacted. \u201cSurely that\u2019s not a bad old thing to be? I\u2019m probably giving him the kiss of death, but I\u2019m desperate for Denly to do well. Seems a good bloke.\u201d He does. There\u2019s an honesty and equanimity to his post-play interviews, not to mention a resourcefulness to his batting, that is very likeable. I think he\u2019s a modern-day David Steele. He hasn\u2019t made as many runs as Steele, but he\u2019s played on much tougher pitches and, like Steele, has dealt with some ferocious pace attacks. I plan to keep banging on about The Pretty Boy Who Went To War until it starts trending alongside WWIII. Thanks Tim, hello everyone. Happy new decade! It\u2019ll be different this time, you know it won\u2019t. England were threatening to start the new year by making 400 in the first innings for the second time in three Tests, but a spectacular spell of fast bowling from Anrich Nortje has made that less likely. He bounced out Joe Root, who was playing like the old Joe Root, and has also hit Joe Denly on the head. We shouldn\u2019t get too excited about anything, given that \u2018WWIII\u2019 trending, but Nortje is a revelation. 43rd over: England 110-3 (Denly 31, Stokes 1) Stokes, England\u2019s best batsman in 2019, opens his account for 2020 with a pull for a single, from outside off. And that\u2019s drinks, with South Africa on top and England in an all too familiar posture: teetering. Time for me to hand over to Rob Smyth. Thanks for your company, your comments and especially your art expertise. 42nd over: England 109-3 (Denly 31, Stokes 0) Maharaj continues to Denly, who picks up four from a leg glance. Kevin Pietersen, commentating, is not happy with Denly\u2019s technique against the spinner. \u201cHe\u2019s only going forward, so he\u2019s got nowhere else to score but there. He needs to go into the nets with his captain.\u201d First, though, he needs to hang in there and make the hundred that was beckoning to Root. 41st over: England 105-3 (Denly 27, Stokes 0) The dropped catch will be chalked down to van der Dussen, at first slip, but it was more the fault of de Kock, who shaped to go for it, then stopped. So he was mighty pleased to snaffle Root a couple of balls later. Keeper and first slip ended up in each other\u2019s arms. The big one! Nortje\u2019s pace makes all the difference as he has Root dropped at first slip, then caught behind fending unhappily at a bouncer. What a blow for England \u2013 Root was in his best form for ages, scoring much faster than anyone else today. 40h over: England 101-2 (Denly 27, Root 31) Maharaj gets just enough turn to lure Denly into a leading edge, but he\u2019s got his weight over the ball and it doesn\u2019t pop up. Time for a little more art. \u201cHi Tim,\u201d says Tom Morgan. \u201cI\u2019m in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.\u201d Classy. \u201cThe old Flemish/Dutch masters have superlative techniques and get better over time. So, the exact opposite of Bairstow.\u201d Harsh but funny. 39th over: England 101-2 (Denly 27, Root 31) A dab to third man by Root brings up the hundred (dread words). The average first-day score at this ground is 280-8 and England are on course for that. The trouble is, they always have a collapse up their sleeve. Denly is rapped on the helmet by Nortje, ducking into a lowish bouncer, so there\u2019s a delay for a concussion check, but he seems fine. 38th over: England 99-2 (Denly 27, Root 30) Root sweeps Maharaj for four, then sweeps again, and gets away with a top edge as fortune favours the bold. From memory, that\u2019s his first false shot since he got off the mark. \u201cWhisper it,\u201d says Sachin Paul, \u201cbut this Joe Denly bloke certainly looks the part, doesn\u2019t he? With Burns and him doing their best impressions of Cook and Trott, do you think it\u2019s worth a punt asking the aggressive Bairstow to open and have fun at the top? We tried it with Roy but an in-form Bairstow is several leagues of class above Roy.\u201d Good point \u2013 Silverwood\u2019s preference for blockers at the top of the order doesn\u2019t suit this England team. And the answer might even be Roy, who still has it in him to do a David Warner. 37th over: England 94-2 (Denly 27, Root 25) England have seen off Philander for the moment. They celebrate by cashing in against Nortje \u2013 a two and a three to Root, a two to the reborn Denly. 36th over: England 87-2 (Denly 25, Root 20) Hallelujah! After four more dots, to make 48 in a row, Denly gets a freebie from Maharaj. It\u2019s short, it\u2019s wide, and it\u2019s cut for four as if the previous 48 balls had never happened. If he doesn\u2019t quite make the grade as a Test cricketer, it won\u2019t be for lack of a good temperament. 35th over: England 82-2 (Denly 21, Root 19) Same old story: one to Root, none to Denly, whose frustration shows, off the last ball of the over, as he nearly chips Philander to mid-off. Still, he has a fan in Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cUnexpectedly called up to the Test side with the USP of being a part-time leggie. Widely criticised after their first few outings, but teams stuck by them and now they\u2019ve secured the No3 spot for themselves. Is Joe Denly the poor man\u2019s Labuschagne?\u201d 34th over: England 81-2 (Denly 21, Root 18) Another brisk single to Root, pushing Maharaj into the covers, but Denly has become alarmingly becalmed. He plays out five dots, which makes at least 29 in a row now. 33rd over: England 80-2 (Denly 21, Root 17) Another single to Root, with a glance, or possibly inside edge, off Philander, who\u2019s been exacting, as ever. Time to resume the art class. \u201cPhilander, strictly speaking,\u201d says Jeff Docherty, \u201cis more of a minimalist in the Sol LeWitt mode, his trick was the subtle variations in line and length.... for the uninitiated, he just drew long flowing lines on walls!\u201d 32nd over: England 79-2 (Denly 21, Root 16) Root, staying positive, sweeps Maharaj for a single. Catching up with some correspondence, I find this from Guy Hornsby, just before lunch. \u201cMorning Tim, happy new year. I want to say this is turning into a better session for England but such is the jinx potential I\u2019m just going to say we\u2019re only a few balls away from digging ourselves a mighty hole. I actually quite like this XI, but once you remove the two elder statesmen from the attack, it looks worryingly thin. With Wood not yet back, Stone injured, Roland-Jones a seeming past tense, where\u2019s the next in the dynasty, Archer aside? Curran is a fighter, but he\u2019d be flayed in Australia too, Woakes ineffective away from home. Yours, A Pessimist.\u201d Ha. My impression is that the kids are all right \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of raw pace around the counties. Point taken, though, about the near future. England badly need the Archer of last summer, and the Wood of that one great day in the Caribbean, to take the baton from Broad and Anderson. 31st over: England 78-2 (Denly 21, Root 15) Root is in the mood. He eases Philander to the boundary with that trademark back-foot drive, which prompts Faf to post a cover sweeper, surely an over-reaction at this stage. Root then dabs for a quick single, so he has 15 off 19 balls. Mind you, Sibley and Denly both got off to quick starts before becoming bogged down. 30th over: England 73-2 (Denly 21, Root 10) Maharaj continues, after that mouthwatering last ball before lunch. He drops marginally short and Root plays a beautiful late cut. Never mind Denly, Root is England\u2019s best candidate for a hundred today, even in the rather mediocre form of the past year. 29th over: England 68-2 (Denly 21, Root 5) Root is watchful, as he should be, but after a few blocks he gets a single with that back-foot force of his, thanks to a half-stop at backward point. Philander then lures Denly into a play and a miss. There\u2019s a long way to go to 300, never mind 400. The players are back out there, a little late it seems, and England are about to face a stern examination: another spell from Philander, who was uncharacteristically expensive this morning (6-2-13-1). \u201cWhat\u2019s a par score?\u201d asks Gary Naylor. \u201cThe commentators are determined to tell us that it\u2019s a good batting pitch, but it\u2019s doing plenty already in the air and off the seam and now it\u2019s turning too. I\u2019d be happy with 300 here and a chase of 150+ in the fourth innings will be tough.\u201d Agreed, though Joe Root will surely be hoping for 400. His attack looks the more toothless of the two, unless Anderson can scrape off the rust and match Philander leg-cutter for leg-cutter. This ground should inspire him: it\u2019s where Anderson once swung the ball round corners, at pace, to rip through Pakistan\u2019s top order. I was there with my nine-year-old son, who\u2019s now a grown man of 25. Jimmy, then a 20-year-old tearaway, is now an old lag of 37, but he surely has one last hurrah in him. We interrupt this break to bring you a good cause. \u201cHappy new year from Accra, enjoying your blog,\u201d says my colleague Daniel Harris. \u201cWould you mind sticking this in when you\u2019ve a sec please?\u201d Not at all. Those poor Aussies: dreadful fires and, it seems from here, a useless prime minister. Not that a Pom can be at all smug on that front. 28th over: England 67-2 (Denly 21, Root 4) Faf goes back to spin for the last over of the morning. Maharaj is accurate but not remotely threatening until the last ball, which turns enough to beat Denly\u2019s forward lunge, and may have Dom Bess dreaming of glory in the fourth innings. That\u2019s lunch, with South Africa on top, but England hanging in there after going in with a hopelessly inexperienced opening pair. Time for some fresh air and my morning ritual, a trip to the newsagent. Yes, I know it\u2019s old-school. 27th over: England 67-2 (Denly 21, Root 4) Scrub that \u2013 Root isn\u2019t settling yet. The first ball of Rabada\u2019s over, short and angled in, raps him on the sternum as he makes an unwise, and uncharacteristic, decision to duck. The second, much fuller, beats him outside off. But when Rabada goes short again, Root finds himself with his favourite back-foot punch. That\u2019s a fine recovery. 26th over: England 63-2 (Denly 21, Root 0) Yet another maiden from Pretorius, as Denly gives Joe Root a chance to settle in at the non-striker\u2019s end. 25th over: England 63-2 (Denly 21, Root 0) Credit to Faf du Plessis there, for bringing Rabada back, at the other end. And perhaps some grudging credit to Pretorius for drying up the runs. Meanwhile Sam Collier (20th over) is back for more. \u201cBut on a less snarky note, I would have Philander as a Frank Stella (early period) \u2013 precise, repeating, minimal and whose work is brought to life with just enough subtle variation.\u201d Only on the OBO. Sibley plays and misses as he fences at a short one outside off, then instantly repeats the error, getting a nick this time. England\u2019s next injury may come from a young man kicking himself. 24th over: England 61-1 (Sibley 32, Denly 21) Pretorius is still looking to bore the batsmen out, and the boring bit is working: his figures are 4-2-5-0. 23rd over: England 61-1 (Sibley 32, Denly 21) Rabada replaces Nortje and immediately has Sibley wafting outside off. It would be a comfortable catch for a fourth slip, but it goes to gully\u2019s left, away for four. That\u2019s Sibley\u2019s highest Test score \u2013 the second of the day, following Crawley\u2019s triumphant 4 \u2013 and also the fifty partnership. Sibley is then beaten outside off, but he survives. In county cricket, he is good at converting 30 into 230, but can he do it on the big stage? 22nd over: England 57-1 (Sibley 28, Denly 21) At the other end, Pretorius is pitching it up, because de Kock is standing up to the stumps, so du Plessis has found a way of creating contrasting challenges. Denly plays out a maiden. 21st over: England 57-1 (Sibley 28, Denly 21) After a single off his hip from Denly, Nortje electts to go round the wicket to make something happen to Sibley. And something does happen \u2013 a bouncer goes for four byes as the ball trampolines over the keeper. 20th over: England 52-1 (Sibley 28, Denly 20) Some action at last as Pretorius bowls just where Sibley likes it, on his legs, and is clipped for four. That\u2019s the fifty up, and England would have taken it with only one wicket down. \u201cMorning Tim!\u201d Morning, Sam Collier. \u201c09:26 \u2013 Sandy Fyfe very much marking himself out as the Geoffrey Boycott of art criticism there.\u201d 19th over: England 47-1 (Sibley 24, Denly 19) Denly pulls Nortje, but only gets a single. The game has gone to sleep, which seems a little premature. Paul Speller is back with a riposte to my point from the 15th over. \u201cIf it\u2019s a concern that Parkinson was expensive in warm-up that caused him to be overlooked in favour of someone who was not in original squad, didn\u2019t a certain Mr Warne take something like 1-150 on debut? Not comparing, but if Warne had been playing under a set-up like England\u2019s he\u2019d have probably been discarded with immediate effect, never to return.\u201d That is perfectly possible. 18th over: England 46-1 (Sibley 24, Denly 18) Faf decides that the Maharaj ploy isn\u2019t paying off and brings on Dwaine Pretorius for some military medium. He starts with a maiden to Sibley, who, after that busy start, has only seven off his last 31 balls. 17th over: England 46-1 (Sibley 24, Denly 18) Denly uses Nortje\u2019s pace and bounce to glance for four to fine leg\u2019s right. He\u2019s started more briskly than usual, which bodes well for that elusive hundred. 16th over: England 42-1 (Sibley 24, Denly 14) Yet another one-run over, as Maharaj settles into a groove. 15th over: England 41-1 (Sibley 24, Denly 13) Another over, another nudge for a single. Nortje seems to be pronounced Norkia, is that right? Like the Queen telling you her preferred brand of phone. On Twitter, Paul Speller isn\u2019t happy. \u201cTreatment of Matt Parkinson is shocking, esp as Eng camp, in traditional style, have been leaking plan for days. Selecting a not yet fit quick for tour not v clever, either.\u201d Fair point about Wood, and yes some sympathy for Parkinson, but with Woakes unwell and the tail flopping at Centurion, Bess\u2019s batting is clearly needed. 14th over: England 40-1 (Sibley 24, Denly 12) du Plessis turns to spin, in the shape of Keshav Maharaj, probably because Sibley gave him that return catch in the first Test. Denly strokes a single past the bowler and Sibley gets a gift on his pads, which he duly flicks for four. That\u2019s drinks, with honours evenish but England doing not too badly, all things considered. 13th over: England 35-1 (Sibley 20, Denly 11) A rest for Philander as Nortje comes on. He is quicker but less threatening, and Sibley picks up two more with a push into the covers. He\u2019s getting a taste for the off side now. 12th over: England 33-1 (Sibley 18, Denly 11) A single to Sibley, nudging off his pads. \u201cIt occurs to me,\u201d says Sandy Fyfe, \u201cif Philander is an artist, as you suggest in the 7th over, he would be an elegant impressionist whose quality and skills stand the test of time and are obvious for all to see. A Monet perhaps? Or Degas? \u201cJonny Bairstow on the other hand would be Martin Creed, unashamedly trying to pass off crumpled up pieces of paper as art. A bit like he has tried to pass off his batting technique as Test standard for some time now!\u201d Know what you mean, but Bairstow\u2019s technique was good enough to make him a successful Test player for a few years. Then he started missing straight balls in Tests \u2013 while lording it in one-day cricket and the County Championship. You\u2019d think that a good batting coach would be itching to work with him. 11th over: England 32-1 (Sibley 17, Denly 11) Denly decides to stand outside his crease to cut down on Philander\u2019s movement away from the bat. Philander tries a bouncer to push him back, but Denly is ready for it and hooks, authoritatively, for four. Good contest. 10th over: England 28-1 (Sibley 17, Denly 7) A nudge for a single by Denly off Rabada, and a row of dots for Sibley, who deals easily with a rare bouncer. \u201cGood morning,\u201d says Damian Ainsworth. \u201cJust tuned in, noticed Bairstow\u2019s absence and am left wondering how the Guardian\u2019s OBO warriors will occupy their time without him to discuss (criticise). Root\u2019s captaincy perhaps? Yours, a cussed Yorkshireman.\u201d Ha. So do you believe Root is a good captain? 9th over: England 27-1 (Sibley 17, Denly 6) In his first Test innings at Mount Maunganui, Sibley made 22 without troubling the scorers once on the off side. But now he manages to hit a cover drive for four, off Philander of all people. Maybe he\u2019s less limited than he looked in New Zealand. He\u2019s certainly been positive today, making his 17 off only 25 balls. 8th over: England 23-1 (Sibley 13, Denly 6) This time Denly\u2019s square drive is a touch later, which takes it away to cover\u2019s left, for four. He gets a couple more in the same direction with more of a prod. After all those solid fifties, today would be a great day to get his first Test hundred. \u201cI\u2019ve just woken up to see the line-up,\u201d says Adam Levine, \u201cand with all these callow batsmen and medium pacers, it feels like I\u2019ve had a bump on the head and come to in some sort of 90s cricketing equivalent of Life on Mars, with Chris Silverwood in the attack rather than the dressing room. I\u2019m half expecting to see Jason Gallian opening and Mark Lathwell and Hugh Morris jog to the crease at some point. Hoping to see Martin McCague come into the attack and also hoping that the \u2018new Botham\u2019, Ronnie Irani, lives up to the hype. All soundtracked by Supergrass and the Fugees natch. Have fun OBO\u2019ing this impending train wreck of a Test match.\u201d 7th over: England 17-1 (Sibley 13, Denly 0) Philander offers a rare freebie and Sibley helps himself to a clip through square leg to move into double figures. Irritated, Philander beats his outside edge with a lovely leg-cutter, then beats his inside edge with the nip-backer into the pads. The man is an artist. 6th over: England 13-1 (Sibley 9, Denly 0) Joe Denly, a spectator so far, faces a full over from Rabada, and it\u2019s a good contest. Rabada is more accurate and Denly, as is his wont at the start of a Test innings, is obdurate. He does produce one elegant square drive, but it goes straight to the man at cover point. 5th over: England 13-1 (Sibley 9, Denly 0) Sibley plays out a maiden from Philander, who has picked up precisely where he left off at Centurion. His figures are 3-2-1-1, while Rabada has 2-0-12-0. 4th over: England 13-1 (Sibley 9, Denly 0) And now Sibley edges Rabada, through the gap at fourth slip, for four. Hard to see why Faf du Plessis hasn\u2019t gone for a full cordon. 3rd over: England 8-1 (Sibley 4, Denly 0) These teams are a funny mixture of old and young, and in that over Philander\u2019s experience easily overpowered Crawley\u2019s youthful promise \u2013 helped by a fine diving catch from another senior player, Quinton de Kock. And England\u2019s decision to go with Crawley over Jonny Bairstow has backfired already. \u201cOptimism?\u201d says Colum Farrelly. \u201cThis is really a variation on Tom van der Gucht\u2019s second reason [8:31]. England play awful rubbish when they\u2019re cocky. This team won\u2019t be afflicted by arrogance and will focus admirably. (I hope I\u2019m not too late with this, and they\u2019re 0-2 after 1 over.)\u201d Not far off. Nerveless or not, Crawley\u2019s missed a couple outside off and now he nicks one, coming down with a crooked bat as Philander finds that immaculate outswinger of his. Shame. 2nd over: England 8-0 (Crawley 4, Sibley 4) Kagiso Rabada goes very full to Crawley, who leaves one tempting half-volley outside off, then pushes the next into the covers for a comfy three. Dom Sibley gets off the mark as Rabada stays full and strays onto the pads, the one place where you don\u2019t bowl to Sibley. This pair may lack experience, but they don\u2019t seem cowed. 1st over: England 1-0 (Crawley 1, Sibley 0) Philander is not a man who needs a loosener and, sure enough, he beats Zak Crawley, fourth ball, with a jaffa. Then he gets too straight and Crawley is able to flick him away for a single, which is greeted by the England fans as if it was a six from Ben Stokes. Mike Atherton reckons the crowd is 70% English. Play! It\u2019s going to be Vernon Philander to open the bowling in his farewell series. In the first Test, he was not so much Big Vern as Absolutely Immense Vern. Time for some rampant optimism. \u201cIt might be because this is the last weekday of my Christmas holidays,\u201d says Tom van der Gucht, \u201cand I\u2019m on a sugar high after eating a Toblerone for breakfast, but my money is firmly on an England win, for the following reasons. 1. South Africa haven\u2019t lost here for ages, except against Australia (according to Simon Wilde on Twitter) and are therefore due a loss. 2. England\u2019s bounce-back-ability, they often follow up a shambolic loss with an unlikely win 3. South Africa are no longer the underdogs and therefore are likely to choke. 4. Nearly all of England\u2019s batsmen are due a big score \u2013 hopefully they\u2019ll cash in today with a double ton for one of them. 5. England might have a more balanced side if they have a spinner... Er, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\u201d A word from the Cape. \u201cGood morning from a sunny but windy Cape Town Tim,\u201d says Trevor Tutu. \u201cI would be going to the ground, but have given my tickets to my son, as he says he and his mates are going to barrack the Barmy Army.\u201d Good luck with that. And here\u2019s John Starbuck, sorting out my Greek theology for me. \u201cGood morning. The Greek god of disarray [Preamble, below] is really a goddess: Eris, the one with the golden apple who started the Trojan war. Mischief incarnate, her.\u201d Well, there are times when Tests at Cape Town seem to be going on for ten years. The first email of the day comes from John Phaceas, who sees my line about England\u2019s top three and goes one better. \u201c \u2018Sibley, Crawley and Denly, who sound more like a set of adverbs than a source of runs.\u2019 Nice turn of phrase Tim. Though the image that sprang to my mind was of competing Bradford rag-and-bone men.\u201d As expected, it\u2019s Zak Crawley in for the injured Rory Burns, Ollie Pope for Jonny Bairstow, and Dom Bess doing his utmost to stand in for Jofra Archer. The bowling could be all too medium-fast. South Africa, in a much calmer place, make only one change, Pieter Malan for the injured Aiden Markram. They, like England, have three players in the top six with fewer than five Test caps apiece. England 1 Sibley, 2 Crawley, 3 Denly, 4 Root (capt), 5 Stokes, 6 Pope, 7 Buttler (wkt), 8 Curran, 9 Bess, 10 Broad, 11 Anderson. S Africa 1 Elgar, 2 Malan, 3 Hamza, 4 du Plessis (capt), 5 van der Dussen, 6 de Kock (wkt), 7 Pretorius, 8 Philander, 9 Maharaj, 10 Rabada, 11 Nortje. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bat first,\u201d says Joe Root. And that big smile is back on his face. Morning everyone and welcome to England\u2019s first Test of the 2020s. It feels like the last Test of an Ashes winter: half the team injured, replacements flying in, wheels falling off. Two weeks ago it was South Africa who were in disarray. Now they\u2019re one up and feeling quietly pleased with themselves, while disarray, like a Greek god, has changed sides on a whim. England\u2019s luck has gone from bad to curse \u2013 first a flu epidemic, then Jofra Archer\u2019s bad elbow, now a football injury taking Rory Burns out of the whole series. If Alastair Cook was due at this game as a commentator, he\u2019d probably find himself playing in it. England\u2019s top three may well be Sibley, Crawley and Denly, who sound more like a set of adverbs than a source of runs. Sibley has played three Tests, Crawley one; Sibley has 74 Test runs, which is 73 more than Crawley. Denly, who\u2019s on 651, has at least found a way of making uncharacteristically dour fifties, but England may need a bit more than that here. Newlands, in Cape Town, is made for batting, almost as much as for taking pictures. South Africa are expected to bring in Pieter Malan, their third 30-something debutant of the series, in place of the injured Aiden Markram. England may be wishing they had a Malan too \u2013 Dawid Malan averages 35 in Tests away from home, and clearly has the temperament for the top, as well as some local knowledge. The way things are going, he could be on the next plane. Among the bowlers, Dom Bess is the most likely understudy for Archer, which is rather like replacing a sword with a Swiss Army knife. See you for the toss at 10am in Cape Town, 8am GMT.",

At a recent conference called The Art of the Lost at Canterbury cathedral, I discussed a series of ecclesiastical textiles designed by major gothic revival architects.

These ritualistic items were made from richly embroidered silks, embellished with patterns, threads and dyes from India.</p> <p>Ongoing post-doctoral research has revived an interest in these beautiful things. They were created by highly skilled men and women of the local community. The same craft workers, as members of congregations, helped to fund the costly materials. They were available for all to enjoy on a daily basis alongside wall paintings, stone carvings and stained glass windows made by the finest designers and makers of the era.</p> <p>Some of the textiles are now resting so are literally \u201cnot in service\u201d. A number of churches display their Leek embroideries, which attract many visitors. They are a source of surprise when their histories are revealed.</p> <p>Many are now over 100 years old and in need of conservation but parish churches will need help to afford this. Decisions need to be made over which of these items can be saved, as not all are viable in the long term. As so many churches are closing, surely it is the responsibility of many of us to ensure the survival of the diverse histories embedded in these pieces.<br><strong>Dr Brenda </strong><strong>King</strong><br><em>(Chair, the Textile Society), Bollington, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins writes that some former churches are already branching out as new venues, adding that \u201cnone to the best of my knowledge is a pub\u201d. He should come back to Chichester some time, where we do have one (conveniently opposite the cathedral with its stunning collection of both permanent and temporary art installations). Two former churches also operate as offices, one as a bookshop, one as an art gallery, one as a recitals venue, and one (roofless) as a garden. Perhaps what is needed is a survey by Historic England or another august body of the current state of play across England?<br><strong>Greg and Katherine Slay</strong><br><em>Chichester, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 I agree with Simon Jenkins that churches need to learn from cathedrals by being places where \u201cwe don\u2019t bang on about God\u201d. But his analysis of the problem is not entirely correct, and his proposed solution contradicts his own argument.</p> <p>He says: \u201cA quarter of the 15,000 Anglican parish churches now have fewer than 16 worshippers.\u201d But this means that three-quarters have more than that number. In one of the rural churches under my care, the average congregation of 9-12 represents about 10% of the population of the parish. Small can be beautiful; a satsuma is not a failed orange.</p> <p>He argues that \u201cmost English cathedrals are doing fine\u201d, in part because they offer \u201cvicarious religion\u201d. He concludes that churches must \u201cmove into the control of parochial councils, trusts or social enterprises\u201d and \u201chave a primarily secular future\u201d. But cathedrals are attractive in the way he describes precisely because they remain, primarily, places of worship.</p> <p>Simon Jenkins should let go of the simplistic idea that the problems facing parish churches can be solved by off-loading their care on to secular bodies. He needs to learn from examples of good practice at parish level, where the church council works with other bodies, both to retain the church\u2019s primary function as a place of worship, and to diversify its use for the wider community.<br><strong>The Rev</strong><strong> Canon Dr Rob Kelsey</strong><br><em>Norham, </em><em>Northumberland</em></p> <p>\u2022 In Simon Jenkins\u2019s article the word \u201cchurch\u201d is used only to mean a building. In the New Testament the word <em>ekklesia</em> (translated \u201cchurch\u201d) is a body of people who follow Jesus. Over the centuries, the authorities of churches have limited their membership to those who are \u201corthodox\u201d, that is, those who commit to the \u201cright\u201d set of beliefs about God, Jesus, the organisation of the church, and so on. I believe that this has been a big mistake, and we should pay more attention to orthopraxis \u2013 a lifestyle that reflects what Jesus taught about loving our neighbours.</p> <p>Simon calls for local church buildings to be used as centres of their communities, more flexibly and with fewer restrictions. I agree, but they will only survive if the building houses a lively church, which reflects the key messages of the Gospel and of Jesus, who came to bring good news to the poor, release for the prisoners, healing for the sick and freedom for the oppressed (Luke 4:18 quoting Isaiah 61:1). Our church communities must welcome anyone who is inspired by these values, whether or not they can endorse all the doctrines that have been developed over the centuries. Personally I can accept almost all of them, but we should embrace others joyfully.<br><strong>Robert Dimmick</strong><br><em>Caversham, Reading</em></p> <p>\u2022 Like Simon Jenkins, I am not a churchgoer. As a rambler, I have a different experience of the Anglican real estate, frequently eating sandwiches with friends in the porch of isolated churches that provide a haven for weary walkers. Often there is a prominent sign encouraging visitors to come on in to take a look around, with believers and non-believers equally intrigued by the building and the stories it tells of the locality. Should Simon venture out of bigger settlements he would see the church as a focus for decidedly non-religious activities: just a couple of weeks ago a group of us stumbled on a church running a craft fair \u2013 on a Sunday morning; and I have also attended many decidedly secular folk music gigs in churches.<br><strong>Les Bright</strong><br><em>Exeter, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 \u201cThe church has become home to the flower-arranging few\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/the-guardian-view-on-pubs-the-heart-of-the-community\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 30 December) is a lazy comment unworthy of a newspaper which counts honesty and fairness among its values. Inspired by their faith, churches support and run a wide range of social action projects that serve the most vulnerable in society, including food banks, language classes, debt counselling and lunch clubs.

Rovers, who haven\u2019t been past the third round since their memorable run to the quarter-finals in 2007-08, come into the game having picked up two points and scored one goal in four matches. Coventry have won three on the bounce, with striker Matt Godden having scored back-to-back hat-tricks. <strong>John Ashdown</strong></p> <h2>Burton Albion v Northampton</h2> <p><strong>Sunday </strong>2.01pm <strong>Venue </strong>Pirelli Stadium<br><strong>Referee </strong>Jeremy Simpson <strong>VAR</strong> No <strong>Odds </strong>H 1-2 A 5-1 D 3-1</p> <p>The Cobblers have been past the third round just once in 30 years (in 2003-04) but they still have a better record than Burton, who have reached the fourth round only once in their entire history. Albion have every chance here though \u2013 they have lost once at home in the league since August, while Northampton\u2019s League Two promotion push has been hampered by their indifferent away form. <strong>John Ashdown</strong></p> <h2>Charlton v West Brom</h2> <p><strong>Sunday </strong>2.01pm <strong>Venue </strong>The Valley<br><strong>Referee </strong>David Webb <strong>VAR</strong> No <strong>Odds </strong>H 4-1 A 4-6 D 3-1</p> <p>With East Street Investments completing their takeover of Charlton this week, there is finally some positivity at The Valley \u2013 although Thursday\u2019s defeat at Swansea was a reminder that Championship survival remains the priority this season. The Addicks manager, Lee Bowyer, says he will not make wholesale changes for the match against another team whose focus may be elsewhere. West Brom are currently second in the table and on course for a return to the Premier League under Slaven Bilic. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> <h2>Chelsea v Nottingham Forest</h2> <p><strong>Sunday </strong>2.01pm <strong>Venue </strong>Stamford Bridge<br><strong>Referee </strong>Peter Bankes <strong>VAR</strong> Yes <strong>Odds </strong>H 2-11 A 18-1 D 7-1</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e99c5758cda8af8914f01b3240f4debaf1b12c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e99c5758cda8af8914f01b3240f4debaf1b12c6/136_104_5432_3259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea assistant Jody Morris took care of pre-match media duties\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea assistant Jody Morris took care of pre-match media duties, with Frank Lampard recovering from a virus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A bug has swept through Chelsea before Sunday\u2019s game, and even Frank Lampard has been struck down \u2013 the manager left the pre-match media duties to his assistant, Jody Morris. Lampard should be on the touchline on Sunday afternoon and he will want to see a ruthless performance from his inconsistent team, who have lost their last three home games in the league. Forest, fourth in the Championship, will hope to see heavy rotation from Chelsea as they bid to avoid a second straight third-round exit at the Bridge. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <h2>Crewe v Barnsley</h2> <p><strong>Sunday </strong>2.01pm <strong>Venue </strong>Alexandra Stadium<br><strong>Referee </strong>James Linington <strong>VAR</strong> No <strong>Odds </strong>H 9-5 A 7-5 D 12-5</p> <p>This is a League Two v Championship cup tie that could well be a League One fixture next season. It could also prove an awkward assignment for second-tier Barnsley, who have at least given themselves a shot at survival after a recent upturn in form. Crewe, meanwhile, have every chance of promotion out of League Two and have lost at home only once since September. <strong>John Ashdown</strong></p> <h2>Crystal Palace v Derby</h2> <p><strong>Sunday </strong>2.01pm <strong>Venue </strong>Selhurst Park<br><strong>Referee </strong>Michael Oliver <strong>VAR</strong> Yes <strong>Odds </strong>H 4-6 A 4-1 D 5-2</p> <p>Wayne Rooney pays a visit to his former England manager, Roy Hodgson, having given pointers \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/02/derby-barnsley-championship-match-report\">and plenty of actual pointing</a> \u2013 towards his new midfield role in Thursday\u2019s win over Barnsley. The Derby player-coach\u2019s display raised questions over his ability to play twice in four days, but the rare chance to be a giant killer may prove hard to resist. Hodgson says Connor Wickham will feature, buoyed by his first league goal in more than three years, but several regulars will be rested. A third run to Wembley after defeats in 1990 and 2016 does not seem high on Hodgson\u2019s to-do list. <strong>Stuart Goodwin</strong></p> <h2>Middlesbrough v Tottenham</h2> <p><strong>Sunday </strong>2.01pm <strong>Venue </strong>Riverside Stadium <em>BT Sport 1</em><br><strong>Referee </strong>Stuart Attwell <strong>VAR</strong> No <strong>Odds </strong>H 9-2 A 4-7 D 3-1</p> <p>Jonathan Woodgate, the Boro manager and former Spurs centre-half, had plenty of disagreements with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s good friend, Aitor Karanka, during his tenure at the Riverside, so the body language between the two technical areas could prove interesting. Boro enjoyed four straight wins and three clean sheets over the festive period, and will aim to darken the mood Mourinho left St Mary\u2019s in after the New Year\u2019s Day loss to Southampton. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f227228ad1289659b718f6211e779e78fa6cf3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f227228ad1289659b718f6211e779e78fa6cf3d/0_0_4992_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Middlesbrough players celebrate a goal against Preston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Middlesbrough have found form over the Christmas period, with four wins in their last four games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Varley Picture Agency/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>QPR v Swansea</h2> <p><strong>Sunday </strong>2.01pm <strong>Venue </strong>Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium<br><strong>Referee </strong>Stephen Martin <strong>VAR</strong> No <strong>Odds </strong>H 5-4 A 9-5 D 5-2</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s 6-1 victory over Cardiff will give QPR a confidence boost as they take on a team nine places above them in the Championship table. Mark Warburton\u2019s side may need it. They have a bleak recent record in the competition, with last season\u2019s run to the fifth round their first since 1997. The Swans ran eventual winners Manchester City very close in the quarter-finals last season, but Steve Cooper and his young squad will not be looking so far ahead this term, with ambitions of a top-six finish. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> <h2>Sheffield United v AFC Fylde</h2> <p><strong>Sunday </strong>2.01pm <strong>Venue </strong>Bramall Lane<br><strong>Referee </strong>Jarred Gillett <strong>VAR</strong> Yes <strong>Odds </strong>H 1-10 A 28-1 D 7-1</p> <p>This is the first time the semi-professionals of Fylde, currently embroiled in a National League relegation skirmish, have played a Premier League side. Yet with Chris Wilder having pledged to make \u201c11 changes\u201d in order to rest players fatigued by the Christmas schedule, a repeat of the embarrassing home defeat to Barnet last term is not out of the question. One lesser-spotted player expected to be on view for the home side is midfielder Jack Rodwell, who has agreed a short term contract with United. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <h2><strong>Liverpool v Everton</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sunday </strong>4.01pm <strong>Venue </strong>Anfield <em>BBC One</em><br><strong>Referee </strong>Jonathan Moss <strong>VAR</strong> Yes <strong>Odds </strong>H 4-6, A 7-2, D 3-1</p> <p>With J\u00fcrgen Klopp looking to sustain momentum and Carlo Ancelotti trying to generate it, both managers kept rotation to a minimum during the festive programme. This fixture will probably be where the changes come, with new signing Takumi Minamino likely to be among the \u201cfresh legs\u201d promised by Klopp. Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who started all nine of his side\u2019s games in December, may get a rest with Moise Kean stepping in. Everton\u2019s last win at Anfield came in September 1999 \u2013 five months before the Italian forward was born. <strong>Alex Hess</strong></p> <h2>Gillingham v West Ham</h2> <p><strong>Sunday </strong>6.16pm <strong>Venue </strong>Priestfield <em>BT Sport 1</em> <br><strong>Referee </strong>Andrew Madley <strong>VAR</strong> No <strong>Odds </strong>H 9-2, A 3-5, D 3-1</p> <p>West Ham have made a perfect start to the second coming of David Moyes, thrashing Bournemouth on New Year\u2019s Day, and they will be keen to keep spirits high here. Moyes could do with a good FA Cup run, after Manuel Pellegrini suffered a couple of memorable humiliations against lower league opponents. The Hammers were dumped out of the competition by Wimbledon last year, and thumped 4-0 by Oxford in the Carabao Cup earlier this season. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <h2>Arsenal v Leeds United</h2> <p><strong>Monday </strong>7.56pm <strong>Venue </strong>Emirates Stadium <em>BBC One</em><br><strong>Referee </strong>Anthony Taylor <strong>VAR</strong> Yes <strong>Odds </strong>H4-6, A 4-1, D 3-1</p> <p>Mikel Arteta knows first-hand the joys of being an FA Cup winner with Arsenal and is hoping to repeat the trick from the dugout. \u201cWe have to be challenging for the cups,\u201d he said this week, and he hopes to field a strong side against Leeds in an attempt to perpetuate the good feeling around the club. There is only limited scope for rotation given a lengthy injury list, although Dani Ceballos could return. Whatever side Arteta puts out, Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Championship leaders will fancy their chances of springing a surprise. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Democratic presidential candidates have condemned the targeted killing of Iran\u2019s top general in a US airstrike in Iraq as reckless, with frontrunner Joe Biden accusing Donald Trump of having \u201ctossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox\u201d. The former vice-president joined other White House hopefuls in criticizing the president\u2019s order, saying it could leave the US \u201con the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East\u201d. Republicans in Congress largely backed the move. The Pentagon said the US military killed Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s elite Quds force, in Baghdad at the direction of Trump. The attack is expected to draw severe Iranian retaliation against Israeli and American interests. The defense department said Suleimani \u201cwas actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region\u201d. Most Democratic lawmakers criticized Trump\u2019s authorization of the Suleimani strike on the basis that the president did not seek congressional approval and acted without serious consideration of the potential consequences. Bernie Sanders released a statement saying: \u201cTrump\u2019s dangerous escalation brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East that could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars.\u201d Democrats acknowledged the threat posed by Suleimani, with the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren calling him \u201ca murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans\u201d. However, she added, Trump\u2019s \u201creckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict\u201d. Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg warned of the \u201cimmediate and very real dangers to American citizens in and out of uniform in the Middle East\u201d. \u201cThere is no question that Qassim Suleimani was a threat to that safety and security, and that he masterminded threats and attacks on Americans and our allies, leading to hundreds of deaths,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cBut there are serious questions about how this decision was made and whether we are prepared for the consequences.\u201d The former Indiana mayor concluded his statement by warning against the possibility of \u201canother endless war\u201d and implicitly criticizing Trump, who was actively defending his decision on Twitter on Friday, saying he \u201cshould have been taken out many years ago\u201d. \u201cAs we learn more in the coming days and weeks, one thing is clear: this must not be the start of another endless war,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe must act wisely and deliberately, not capriciously or through Twitter.\u201d Entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted: \u201cWar with Iran is the last thing we need and is not the will of the American people. We should be acting to deescalate tensions and protect our people in the region.\u201d The attack, which came just days into a tense American election year, also drew criticism from Democrats who aren\u2019t running for president. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, said the administration conducted the airstrike without consultation of Congress or an authorization for use of military force against Iran. She said it \u201crisks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence\u201d. The White House traditionally gives warning to senior members of both parties in the Senate and House of Representatives ahead of major military action. Some Democrats, including the Massachusetts congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, began accusing Trump of choosing to attack Suleimani because he believed it would help his chances in this year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cThe Occupant [of the White House] was JUST impeached for abuse of power for political gain &amp; now he is leading us to the brink of war because he believes it will help his re-election,\u201d Pressley wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe are sick of endless wars.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed that she was not given prior warning. She said in a statement that the deadly strike \u201cwas taken without the consultation of Congress.\u201d \u201cThe full Congress must be immediately briefed on this serious situation and on the next steps under consideration by the administration, including the significant escalation of the deployment of additional troops to the region,\u201d Pelosi said. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said the lack of consultation with Congress can lead to \u201chasty and ill-considered decisions\u201d, and warned that the administration would need congressional approval before going to war with Iran. \u201cWhen the security of the nation is at stake, decisions must not be made in a vacuum,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIt is paramount for administrations to get an outside view to prevent groupthink.\u201d But speaking to Fox News, the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally who was seen at Mar-a-Lago earlier in the week, said he \u201cwas briefed about the potential operation when I was down in Florida\u201d. \u201cThis was a pre-emptive defensive strike that planned to take out the organizer of attacks yet to come. The intelligence was very strong that Soleimani was orchestrating chaos in Iraq at our expense and throughout the region.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to the death of General Soleimani, there is no one to blame but himself,\u201d Graham said on Twitter. \u201cHe effectively signed his own death warrant by planning massive attacks against US personnel in Iraq and throughout the Middle East.\u201d He continued: \u201cAs to what happens next: it should be clear to Iran that President Trump will not sit idly by if our people and interests are threatened.\u201d The Oklahoma senator Jim Inhofe, the Republican chairman of the Senate armed services committee, said: \u201cAmerica does not and should not seek war, but it will respond in kind to those who threaten our citizens, soldiers and friends \u2013 as the president has long promised. De-escalation is preferable and possible \u2013 but only if our adversaries choose it.\u201d",

You\u2019re very happy in your relationship, but you\u2019re not satisfied. I think there are a few issues going on.

(I want to make it clear that neither Blumenthal, nor I, are justifying or condoning sex work, but instead coming at this as neutrally as possible in order to help you.)</p> <p>We talked, at length, about why people pay for sex, and how this differs from, say, picking up a stranger for a one-night stand. The handing over of money is important, because it makes the person paying feel in control, not just of the sex, but of the emotional side. It is controlled and fake intimacy, and it may stop the person feeling overwhelmed by another\u2019s feelings. In your letter you also mention your well-paid job. This is important, too. Simply put: money equates to freedom, independence and autonomy. There is probably something far in your past that means this has become important. To you, independence and detachment means safety.</p> <p>Blumenthal thought your hint at a difficult childhood was interesting; \u201cespecially the link between your recent past (the money and escorts), and the distant past (the anxiety and depression)\u201d. He went on to explain that seeing escorts enabled you to overcome your difficult past, and learn to form a relationship and have sex with a woman whom you didn\u2019t pay.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/29/birth-mother-doesnt-want-to-know-me\">My birth mother doesn\u2019t want to know me.

But for you this has an extra layer. As Blumenthal explained: \u201cIn this new relationship, as it gets more serious and heads towards [further] commitment, inevitably past patterns of behaviour are activated.\u201d</p> <p>In your case, what is being reactivated is the part of your past that you are running away from, and for which the escorts were a coping mechanism. But this time, escorts cannot be the answer, because you risk losing your relationship.</p> <p>How you get \u201cunstuck\u201d is by understanding more about what those childhood difficulties were, and what caused these anxieties.

(I want to make it clear that neither Blumenthal, nor I, are justifying or condoning sex work, but instead coming at this as neutrally as possible in order to help you.) We talked, at length, about why people pay for sex, and how this differs from, say, picking up a stranger for a one-night stand. The handing over of money is important, because it makes the person paying feel in control, not just of the sex, but of the emotional side. It is controlled and fake intimacy, and it may stop the person feeling overwhelmed by another\u2019s feelings. In your letter you also mention your well-paid job. This is important, too. Simply put: money equates to freedom, independence and autonomy. There is probably something far in your past that means this has become important. To you, independence and detachment means safety. Blumenthal thought your hint at a difficult childhood was interesting; \u201cespecially the link between your recent past (the money and escorts), and the distant past (the anxiety and depression)\u201d. He went on to explain that seeing escorts enabled you to overcome your difficult past, and learn to form a relationship and have sex with a woman whom you didn\u2019t pay. After two years, this relationship is getting serious, and you may be thinking: \u201cWhat next?\u201d The gloss of the new may also be going, which is what happens with real relationships. But for you this has an extra layer. As Blumenthal explained: \u201cIn this new relationship, as it gets more serious and heads towards [further] commitment, inevitably past patterns of behaviour are activated.\u201d In your case, what is being reactivated is the part of your past that you are running away from, and for which the escorts were a coping mechanism. But this time, escorts cannot be the answer, because you risk losing your relationship. How you get \u201cunstuck\u201d is by understanding more about what those childhood difficulties were, and what caused these anxieties. You\u2019ve realised on some level that your past coping mechanisms don\u2019t work in your current situation, so you have to find new ones. I think some really focused therapy would pay dividends for your future now. \u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com. Annalisa regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence.",

That was against expectations for 2,000 Bank of England data showed consumer credit grew 5.7% year on year in November, which was the smallest increase since June 2014 and signalled a further slowdown in consumer borrowing. There was also a net repayment of credit cards for the first time since July 2013 Figures released by IHS Markit/CIPS showed that the UK construction sector suffered another sharp reduction in output last month, due to political uncertainty and subdued demand ahead of the December general election German inflation for the final month of 2019 came in at 1.5% year on year, according to preliminary figures, higher than economist predictions for a reading of 1.4% That\u2019s all for today. We\u2019ll be back on Monday. KM Nationwide house prices figures are also out today. They showed that house prices ended 2019 1.4% higher than at the start of the year at an average of \u00a3215,282 in December. It\u2019s the first time the rate of growth has been above 1% for 12 months. Property values edged up by 0.1% month on month. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: Indicators of UK economic activity were fairly volatile for much of 2019 but the underlying pace of growth appeared to slow through the year as a result of weaker global growth and an intensification of Brexit uncertainty.\u201d Scotland was the strongest performer, with prices up by 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with a year earlier. It was the first time since 2008 that Scotland ended the year as the top performer, Nationwide said. American stock markets are open for trading and have followed Asian and European shares into the red. Here\u2019s how the major indices have started the session: Nasdaq: down -1.2% Dow: down -1.1% S&amp;P 500: down -1% It\u2019s a stark reverse after US stocks hit fresh highs during Thursday\u2019s session. For those of you following the Carlos Ghosn saga, my colleague Rob Davies has the latest: A Turkish private jet company has claimed it was duped into hiring the aircraft used to help the fugitive automotive boss Carlos Ghosn make a daring escape from Japan. MNG Jet said it leased two private jets it believed were for two separate clients, one flying from Dubai to Osaka in Japan and then on to Istanbul, and another flying from Istanbul to Beirut. The company said it had since discovered the planes were not leased for the named passengers but were instrumental in Ghosn\u2019s escape to Lebanon from Japan, where the former Nissan chairman was facing trial over allegations of financial misconduct. He has consistently denied the charges. You can read more here: German inflation for the final month of 2019 came in at 1.5% year on year, according to preliminary figures. That marks an acceleration from 1.1% in November and is higher than economist predictions for a reading of 1.4%. It\u2019s also the highest level since June 2019 and came on the back of higher prices for food, clothing and leisure. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for ING Germany said: The price increases for consumer goods should be of particular interest to the European Central Bank. For the time being, this increase could be related to special Christmas factors, with retailers and producers trying to use the festive season for significant mark-ups. However, it could also be the first sign that inflation is not entirely dead. It is still unclear how the general election and the upcoming 31 January Brexit date will end up affecting consumer behaviour across the UK. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club has weighed in following the consumer credit data release: There had been signs in the latter months of the year that consumers had become more concerned by the combination of a struggling domestic economy as well as heightened domestic political and Brexit uncertainties. Up until then, consumers had seemingly been prepared to brush off Brexit and other uncertainties and keep spending at a reasonable pace \u2013 helped by improved purchasing power and recent record high employment. He adds: The fundamentals for consumers may well have peaked around mid-2019, although they are likely to remain relatively decent. The latest Bank of England\u2019s credit condition survey indicated that lenders reduced the amount of unsecured credit available to consumers in the third quarter of 2019 for an 11th successive quarter. It was expected to decline further in the fourth quarter. Additionally, lenders were reported to have further tightened their lending standards for granting unsecured consumer loan applications in the third quarter of 2019. This was a 12th successive quarter of tightening standards. A further and even more significant tightening of lending standards was anticipated over the fourth quarter of 2019. My colleague Richard Partington reminds us that despite today\u2019s Brent crude spike, the price of oil remains below a peak of about $75 a barrel recorded in April last year. Several major nations have become less dependent on Middle Eastern oil in recent years, including the US, which has ramped up domestic shale production. You can read his full story here: The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s new affordability rules may provide some explanation of net repayment of credit cards in November. Credit card companies have been chasing customers who are deemed to be in persistent debt and who have made a habit of making minimum payments. They are being told to raise their payments or risk having their credit card suspended. This may have spurred more customers to increase their payments. Some customers are also being offering ways of repaying their debts more quickly, say by transferring a credit card balance to a personal loan with lower interest to be paid over three to four years. Those transfers may also be part of the story. The FCA\u2019s regulations are targeted at customers in persistent debt for at least 36 months, who end up paying more in interest fees and charges than the original amount they borrowed. Most have made a long-term habit of only making minimum payments each month, masking underlying financial troubles. We wrote more about the affordability rules over Christmas. Take a look: This handy bar chart illustrates consumer credit flows across the UK since 2013 \u2013focused specifically on credit card data. It should give you a sense of how rare it actually is to see the kind of net repayment of credit cards that was logged in November. Rising tensions between the US and Iran could end up pushing UK inflation above the 2% target \u2013 though it would require a sustained uptick in crude prices over the coming months. That\u2019s the view of Professor Costas Milas from the the University of Liverpool\u2019s who has written in this morning. He said: The Bank of England\u2019s latest Inflation Report forecasts CPI inflation to drop from 1.65% in 2020 Q1 to 1.16% in 2020 Q2, and UK GDP growth to pick up from a very weak annual growth of 0.66% in 2020 Q1 to 1.30% in 2020 Q2. These forecasts are based on the assumption that Brent oil prices will stay at $59 per barrel throughout 2020. Oil prices are currently trading at the much higher value of $69. Rising tensions between the US and Iran have the potential of triggering a further hike in oil prices which will push inflation above the 2% and derail the already anaemic economic performance. Oil prices have continued their ascent, with Brent crude now up more than 4.5% at $69.20 following the US attack that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. That is the first time that Brent crude prices have crossed the $69 since September, when an attack was launched on two Saudi oil facilities. This chart from the Bank of England\u2019s latest statistical release shows the steady decline in consumer credit growth since 2017. Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, suggests the slowdown in unsecured consumer lending (read: credit cards, student loans and personal loans) is \u201cnothing overly concerning.\u201d Max Jones, a relationship director in Lloyds Bank\u2019s infrastructure and construction team, says the construction PMI data caps a difficult year for the sector. The industry will hope that 2020 brings more clarity which will help boost confidence. Whether this happens or not is still to be seen, but either way the onus will continue to be on firms to invest. Those doing so now are more likely to reap the rewards further down the line when the sector returns to growth. A renewed commitment to major infrastructure projects, where a noticeable drop off in new work has been reported, would go a long way to offering longer-term stability to order books. On the commercial side, investment levels should naturally increase if the economy is buoyed by the political certainty, even if further clarity is needed in regards to Brexit. Figures released by IHS Markit/CIPS show that the UK construction sector suffered another sharp reduction in output last month, due to political uncertainty and subdued demand ahead of the December general election. The figure came in at 44.4 in December, down from 45.3 in November, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction for the sector. Tim Moore, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey said: December data suggested that the UK construction sector limped through the final quarter of 2019, with output falling in all three major categories of work. Brexit uncertainty and spending delays ahead of the General Election were once again the most commonly cited factors highlighted by firms experiencing a drop in construction activity. Civil engineering saw its sharpest decline for more than ten years and remained the worst-performing area of construction work, followed by commercial development. House building has been the most resilient category in recent months, but still declined overall during December. The forward-looking survey indicators provide some hope that the construction sector malaise will begin to recede in the coming months. Latest data indicated that the downturn in order books remains much less severe than the low point seen last August, which has already helped to bring employment numbers closer to stabilisation. The Bank of England has released figures on the mortgage market, showing the number of approvals totalled 64,994 in November compared to 64,662 in October. That was also higher than a Reuters poll for 64,450. Mortgage lending totals fell slightly, however, to \u00a34bn in November from \u00a34.3bn a month earlier. However, that still exceeded forecasts for \u00a33.9bn. Separately, consumer credit grew 5.7% year on year in November, versus a 6.1% rise in October. That was the smallest increase since June 2014 and signals a further slowdown in consumer borrowing. The Bank of England also reported a net repayment of credit cards in November for the first time since July 2013. The rising share price of oil majors has kept the FTSE 100 from falling further into the red on the back of the US air strike. London\u2019s blue chip index is currently down just shy of 0.5%. Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at SpreadEx, explains: Though Suleimani may be unknown by many in the West, some political analysts have likened him to a US vice president in terms of profile, while he has previously been described as the \u2018single most powerful operative in the Middle East\u2019. Important to bear in mind when considering the kind of response that could be expected from Iran (a nation, remember, that has major ties to Russia and China). The markets were quick to react, with the DAX and CAC losing 0.9% and 0.6% respectively (not quite all of yesterday\u2019s gains, but still a decent chunk). The Dow Jones, meanwhile, is set to drop 0.9% when the bell rings on Wall Street, though that figure could very easily change dependent on what happens between now and then. In contrast to its US and Eurozone peers, the FTSE was only down 0.4%. That\u2019s because Brent Crude rose 3.3% after the drone strike, lifting BP and Shell up around 1.3-1.4% in the process. New figures from Germany\u2019s Federal Labour Office show that the number of people out of work across the country rose by 8,000 to 2,279,000 in December, on a seasonally adjusted basis. That is higher than a Reuters polls that expected a rise of just 2,000 and is the latest piece of poor data to come out of Europe\u2019s largest economy. However, the jobless rate held at 5.0%. It follows weak factory data, with manufacturing PMI coming in at 43.7 in December, down slightly from November\u2019s five-month high of 44.1. A reading below 50 signals a contraction. Oil stocks are some of the biggest gainers on the London stock exchange, following the spike in crude prices. BP is up 1.4% Royal Dutch Shell is up 1.2% Tullow Oil is up 5.9% Premier Oil is up 4.4% Traders are flocking to safe haven assets, including bonds and gold. Spot gold prices are nearing four month highs, up 0.9% at $1,543. US Treasury yields, which move inversely to the price, hit their lowest level in three weeks. Meanwhile, the price UK gilts and German bunds have also jumped. There is an interesting comment in this FT piece (\u00a3) written by the head of the FastFT blog Adam Samson, suggesting traders will be holding emergency meetings to assess the investment risks arising from fresh political tensions. The article quotes Olivier Jakob, managing director of oil consultants Petromatrix, saying: The killing of Soleimani calls for a serious increase of the geopolitical risk premium. This was supposed to be a holiday week for many traders. Many will be cutting the holidays short and call-in for an emergency risk meeting. European stock markets have opened lower as expected, reversing yesterday\u2019s gains. FTSE 100: down -0.5% German DAX: down -0.9% French CAC 40: down -0.6% FTSE MIB: down -0.5% Spain\u2019s IBEX: down -0.8% France\u2019s embassy in Iran has advised all of its citizens to stay away from any public gatherings in Iran, according to Reuters. But warnings are extending beyond Iran, with the US embassy in Baghdad urging citizens to leave Iraq immediately, AFP reports: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. News of US air strikes having killed a top Iranian general have spooked markets, with traders now fearing fresh conflict between Washington and Tehran. The White House said US president Donald Trump ordered the strike which killed Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad in the early hours of Friday. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has since ordered three days of mourning and vowed that the US would face \u201csevere revenge\u201d for the killing. The target killing caused oil to spike, with renewed geopolitical tensions threatening to put oil supplies at risk. Brent crude rose by nearly $3 overnight to reach $69.11, and continues to trade higher by around 3% at $68.25. Conflict fears also took the shine off global stocks, just hours after shares rallied in Europe and set record highs on Wall Street on the back of stimulus measures in China. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.76% and the Shanghai Composite was flat. Stephen Innes chief Asia market strategist at AxiTrader said: This is more than just bloodying Iran\u2019s nose. This is an aggressive show of force and an outright provocation that could trigger another middle east war. Indeed we are waking up to a less safe world than it was only hours ago especially if we combine this with simmering tension in the Korean peninsula. Innes warns traders: Get the defensive strategy took kit ready as you will likely need it through the day. Elsewhere we have The agenda: 8:55am GMT: German unemployment for December 9:30am GMT: UK construction PMI for December 9:30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals &amp; consumer credit for November 1:00pm GMT: German inflation for December (preliminary)",

But by claiming it will only respect a renewed Holyrood mandate for a referendum that it opposes, Scottish Labour is implicitly telling its pro-independence target voters to opt for the SNP or Scottish Greens in 2021.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration\u2019s assassination on Thursday of General Qassem Suleimani could turn out to be its biggest foreign policy blunder. The killing could lead to a war with Iranian proxies across the Middle East, belying Trump\u2019s supposed desire to extricate the US from its endless conflicts. But its most likely immediate effect will be to ratchet up pressure on the Iraqi government to expel US troops from Iraq. And that would mean Iran extending its already substantial influence over Iraqi government and society. The Trump administration was quick to portray the assassination as a pre-emptive strike, saying Suleimani had been \u201cactively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.\u201d Earlier on Thursday, the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, had warned from Washington, \u201cThe game has changed\u201d. But Trump has consistently increased tensions and courted confrontation with Iran. Since he took office in January 2017, he has wavered on many foreign policy issues, but he has been dependable on one thing: he considers Iran the greatest threat to US interests in the Middle East, and the world\u2019s biggest state sponsor of terrorism. The current conflagration has its roots in a burgeoning protest movement in Iraq that has demanded that both Iran and the US stop interfering in the country\u2019s affairs.

      "bodyText": "An employment tribunal has ruled that ethical veganism is a philosophical belief that is protected by law against discrimination. The ruling came in a case brought by Jordi Casamitjana, who claims he was unfairly sacked by the League Against Cruel Sports (LACS), an animal welfare charity, after he raised concerns with colleagues that its pension fund invested in companies involved in animal testing. The ruling by a tribunal in Norwich does not settle Casamitjana\u2019s claim to have been unfairly dismissed, but lays the ground for a substantive hearing. He said he was extremely happy with the outcome \u201cand for the words of the judge, who clearly understood what ethical veganism is\u201d. Ethical vegans, like dietary vegans, eat a plant-based diet, but ethical vegans also try to avoid contact with products derived from any form of animal exploitation. It includes not wearing clothing made of wool or leather and not using products tested on animals. \u201cI am not alone. Many people have supported me because they, or their friends, have experienced discrimination for being ethical vegans,\u201d Casamitjana said after the ruling. \u201cHopefully, from my dismissal, something positive will come by ensuring other ethical vegans are better protected in the future.\u201d Judge Robin Postle ruled in a short summary judgment that ethical veganism satisfied the tests required for it to be a philosophical belief protected under the Equality Act 2010.

Casamitjana\u2019s solicitor, Peter Daly, an employment lawyer from Slater and Gordon, said ethical veganism was \u201ca philosophical belief held by a significant portion of the population in the UK and around the world\u201d. \u201cThis was the first of a two-part employment tribunal,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the question of ethical veganism has been determined by the judge, the litigation will move on to determine the lawfulness of Jordi\u2019s treatment by the League Against Cruel Sports. \u201cThe recognition of ethical veganism as a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010 will have potentially significant effects on employment and the workplace, education, transport and the provision of goods and services.\u201d Rhys Wyborn, an employment partner at Shakespeare Martineau, who acted for the LACS, downplayed the significance of the ruling. \u201cAlthough an interesting point of law, this hearing was preparation for the real crux of the matter: why Jordi Casamitjana was dismissed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn view of its animal welfare value, the league did not contest the issue of whether ethical veganism itself should be a protected belief, with the league maintaining that it\u2019s irrelevant to the core reason for the dismissal. \u201cThe league is now looking ahead to the substantive hearing in this case and to addressing the reason for Mr Casamitjana\u2019s dismissal, which it maintains was due to his misconduct and not the belief he holds.\u201d Dr Jeanette Rowley, a legal expert with the Vegan Society, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic day for animals and it\u2019s a fantastic day for vegans who should get more institutional support [whether] in hospitals or in schools \u2026 The outcome is the right decision logically, sensibly, and it\u2019s the only rational decision that we could have had.\u201d Any precedent set by the ruling could prove difficult for businesses, according to Helen Crossland, a partner at Seddons, who was not involved in the case. \u201cEmployers always run the risk of an employee claiming that discrimination is a factor in their dismissal, such as here,\u201d she said. \u201cUnless overturned on appeal, employers should expect to see legal protection extended to other beliefs, particularly as they become more established in society.\u2019",

Ana de Armas is really good in Knives Out, but again I have to say in terms of real comedy \u2013 not comedy-drama, not drama with bittersweet comic touches, but actual comedy \u2013 Feldstein is streets ahead of anyone here. One person who deserved to be on this list is that great singer and actor Jessie Buckley for her full-throated performance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/14/wild-rose-review-jessie-buckley\" title=\"\">Wild Rose</a>, the story of a Scottish woman yearning to be a country music star.</p> <p><strong>Will win:</strong> Awkwafina.</p> <p><strong>Should win:</strong> Beanie Feldstein.</p> <p><strong>Shoulda been a contender:</strong> Jessie Buckley.</p> <h2><strong>Best supporting actor</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d2b7ed119581958b55afe8876cf81aa40e8bce4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d2b7ed119581958b55afe8876cf81aa40e8bce4/686_1_2802_1681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frontruner: Joe Pesci as Russell Bufalino in The Irishman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frontrunner: Joe Pesci as Russell Bufalino in The Irishman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are some big names and revered silverback gorillas in this list \u2013 all of whom are doing an excellent job, although I couldn\u2019t help wondering if the Hollywood Foreign Press Association could cast its net a little wider? For opaque reasons, Anthony Hopkins has a best supporting actor nomination, despite being of equal importance to Pryce in The Two Popes. Tom Hanks\u2019s performance as the American TV legend Fred Rogers is causing critics to gibber with awestruck delight, although Brad Pitt may pinch it with his wonderfully mature performance in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, which showcases his marvellous Gary-Cooper-like ease.</p> <p>But the frontrunners have to be Al Pacino and Joe Pesci for their fantastic performances as the Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa and the coolly understated mobster Russell Bufalino in The Irishman. I reckon Pesci will get it \u2013 to a roar of pleasure from the assembled crowd. </p> <p><strong>Will win:</strong> Joe Pesci.</p> <p><strong>Should win:</strong> Joe Pesci.</p> <p><strong>Shoulda been a contender:</strong> Wesley Snipes (Dolemite Is My Name).</p> <h2><strong>Best supporting actress</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac1cfe9ff6341ad953345ff26337fd71a9e9b88b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac1cfe9ff6341ad953345ff26337fd71a9e9b88b/0_129_2376_1425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Worthy winner: Laura Dern, left, and Scarlett Johansson in Marriage Story.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worthy winner: Laura Dern, left, and Scarlett Johansson in Marriage Story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilson Webb/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jennifer Lopez started as an actor; do not rule out the possibility that she will be rewarded for her performance in the widely enjoyed raunchfest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/07/hustlers-review-j-lo-strippers-candace-wu\" title=\"\">Hustlers</a>, as the mentor-stripper who takes Constance Wu under her wing. Yet the Globe might well go Kathy Bates for her part as the everyman-hero\u2019s mother in Clint Eastwood\u2019s biopic drama Richard Jewell. Elsewhere, there is Margot Robbie for her (fictional) role in Bombshell; very uninhibited performance, and Robbie is not hampered like her co-stars by having to produce a quasi-impersonation of a real-life person. Annette Bening gives an intelligent, careful but uninspired performance in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/17/the-report-review-adam-driver-annette-bening\" title=\"\">The Report</a>.

At any rate, there are some heavy-hitters here: Mendes has a well-deserved nod for his superlative 1917, as do Scorsese and Tarantino.

      "bodyText": "Best film (drama) The best film category is dominated \u2013 just like everything else in the cultural conversation around movies \u2013 by Netflix, which has the majority of the nominees: Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, Noah Baumbach\u2019s Marriage Story and Fernando Meirelles\u2019s The Two Popes. The other two are Sam Mendes\u2019s 1917 and Todd Phillips\u2019s box-office smash Joker. This is a really good list, in my view, with one exception: I am unconvinced that Joker is anything other than an amazingly crass, boorish and shallow movie, stridently but incorrectly congratulating itself on its own supposed supercoolness: there is a decent, but overrated performance from Joaquin Phoenix. 1917 is one from the heart, a one-shot nightmare that succeeds in being tremendous, exhilarating and affecting.

Marriage Story is a gorgeous, beguiling film \u2013 desperately sad, and yet with a persistent heartbeat of romance. The Two Popes is the kind of undemanding middleweight biopic that tends to be rewarded during awards season: an imagined dramatic account of the confrontation between Pope Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins) and the cardinal who succeeds him: Francis (Jonathan Pryce). I regretted the absence of Claire Denis\u2019s sci-fi High Life \u2013 and even more the snub to Greta Gerwig\u2019s wonderful new version of Little Women. Will win: Marriage Story. Should win: The Irishman. Shoulda been a contender: Little Women. Best musical or comedy This category is traditionally where the often-mocked Globes scores, because it makes space for the crowd-pleasers at which most awards bodies turn up their noses. It is a lively list this year, although I am astonished at the way pundits have rolled over for the fatuous and pointless Jojo Rabbit. It strikes a very queasy series of false notes. Dexter Fletcher\u2019s Rocketman is a rousing and entertaining account of the early life of Elton John with a great (singing) performance from Taron Egerton, although it is clearly the authorised version permitted by Sir Elton himself. My favourite on this list is Quentin Tarantino\u2019s dizzying, dazzling Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, a black comedy about late-60s Los Angeles which is brilliantly conceived and designed. Rian Johnson\u2019s Christie-esque whodunit, Knives Out, has been much praised, although I have to admit to being the tiniest bit disappointed with the big reveal. Eddie Murphy\u2019s Dolemite Is My Name is a hilarious Blaxploitation biopic comedy, and thoroughly deserves its nomination. But where on Earth was Booksmart? That really was an out-and-out comedy, without any pretensions to anything other than getting laughs. Will win: Knives Out. Should win: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Shoulda been a contender: Booksmart. Best actor (drama) Here is where this year\u2019s Globes look a little bit under par. It is great to see Adam Driver get his nomination for Marriage Story, while Antonio Banderas establishes a gold-standard with his great performance in Pedro Almdod\u00f3var\u2019s autofictional movie Pain and Glory. But I found Christian Bale\u2019s mannered and twitchy performance as the hot-tempered racing-car genius in the middling Ford v Ferrari almost insufferable (the same goes for Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Joker). Jonathan Pryce does an honest, good-natured job with the role of Pope Francis in The Two Popes. It is very surprising that Robert De Niro somehow didn\u2019t get a nod for his gloomy hitman in The Irishman, Brad Pitt probably deserved something for his troubled spaceman in James Gray\u2019s Ad Astra. Will win: Adam Driver. Should win: Antonio Banderas. Shoulda been a contender: Robert De Niro. Best actress (drama) Cynthia Erivo brought sheer passionate commitment, charisma and verve to the role of the anti-slavery campaigner Harriet Tubman; her closest competitor is Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who won hearts and minds with her very intelligent and heartfelt portrayal of Judy Garland. It is a good performance, although the film itself puts a sugary soft focus on the wrenching agony of Garland\u2019s decline. Saoirse Ronan is characteristically forthright and excellent in the role of Jo in Gerwig\u2019s terrific new version of Little Women. Scarlett Johansson is also very good in Marriage Story, with flashes of passion, anguish and rage that are all the more powerful for bursting out of that kind of opaque reserve that she habitually creates. I am very unconvinced by Charlize Theron\u2019s mannered and odd impersonation of Fox News star Megyn Kelly in Bombshell; the film\u2019s confusion over the fact that Kelly is no feminist shows up in her performance. Perhaps the Globes should have looked outside Hollywood and rewarded Yong Mei for her heartwrenching turn as the grieving mother in Wang Xiaoshuai\u2019s So Long, My Son. Will win: Ren\u00e9e Zelleweger. Should win: Cynthia Erivo. Shoulda been a contender: Yong Mei.

It is a bit dismaying to see Roman Griffin Davis in here for his moderate child-actor moppet turn in the worryingly overindulged Jojo Rabbit. I would have liked to see Robert Downey Jr nominated for his very distinctive and personal performance as Tony Stark in Avengers: Endgame. Will win: Taron Egerton. Should win: Leonardo DiCaprio. Shoulda been a contender: Robert Downey Jr. Best actress (musical or comedy) My feeling is that Awkwafina has this sewn up for her starring turn in The Farewell, a heart-rending and sweet movie about the Chinese-American experience. Cate Blanchett can never be anything other than a potent and intelligent screen presence, and her performance as the agoraphobic architect who goes missing in Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette? has been much admired. As for Emma Thompson, she has been nominated for her role as an acid-tongued British talk-show host in Late Night \u2013 a good performance although, oddly, she is more obviously funny in a far inferior film, the box-office smash Last Christmas, in which she was the grumpy Croatian mum. Ana de Armas is really good in Knives Out, but again I have to say in terms of real comedy \u2013 not comedy-drama, not drama with bittersweet comic touches, but actual comedy \u2013 Feldstein is streets ahead of anyone here. One person who deserved to be on this list is that great singer and actor Jessie Buckley for her full-throated performance in Wild Rose, the story of a Scottish woman yearning to be a country music star. Will win: Awkwafina. Should win: Beanie Feldstein. Shoulda been a contender: Jessie Buckley. Best supporting actor There are some big names and revered silverback gorillas in this list \u2013 all of whom are doing an excellent job, although I couldn\u2019t help wondering if the Hollywood Foreign Press Association could cast its net a little wider? For opaque reasons, Anthony Hopkins has a best supporting actor nomination, despite being of equal importance to Pryce in The Two Popes. Tom Hanks\u2019s performance as the American TV legend Fred Rogers is causing critics to gibber with awestruck delight, although Brad Pitt may pinch it with his wonderfully mature performance in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, which showcases his marvellous Gary-Cooper-like ease. But the frontrunners have to be Al Pacino and Joe Pesci for their fantastic performances as the Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa and the coolly understated mobster Russell Bufalino in The Irishman. I reckon Pesci will get it \u2013 to a roar of pleasure from the assembled crowd. Will win: Joe Pesci. Should win: Joe Pesci. Shoulda been a contender: Wesley Snipes (Dolemite Is My Name). Best supporting actress Jennifer Lopez started as an actor; do not rule out the possibility that she will be rewarded for her performance in the widely enjoyed raunchfest Hustlers, as the mentor-stripper who takes Constance Wu under her wing. Yet the Globe might well go Kathy Bates for her part as the everyman-hero\u2019s mother in Clint Eastwood\u2019s biopic drama Richard Jewell. Elsewhere, there is Margot Robbie for her (fictional) role in Bombshell; very uninhibited performance, and Robbie is not hampered like her co-stars by having to produce a quasi-impersonation of a real-life person. Annette Bening gives an intelligent, careful but uninspired performance inThe Report. But the winner here is surely Laura Dern, for her hilarious portrayal of a cunning divorce lawyer in Marriage Story. Will win: Laura Dern. Should win: Laura Dern. Shoulda been a contender: Julia Butters (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Best director What on earth happened to Gerwig for Little Women? Or indeed Alma Har\u2019el for Shia LaBeouf drama Honey Boy? At any rate, there are some heavy-hitters here: Mendes has a well-deserved nod for his superlative 1917, as do Scorsese and Tarantino. Perhaps the most notable nominee is the Korean film-maker Bong Joon-ho for his fascinating social satire Parasite; fast becoming the talking point of the 2020 awards season. Will win: Martin Scorsese. Should win: Martin Scorsese. Shoulda been a contender: Greta Gerwig.",

They\u2019re not just from Soviet cities such as Tashkent or Novosibirsk, but Baghdad, Havana, Tripoli. The UK-based Polish architectural historian \u0141ukasz Stanek\u2019s book explains why this is so. A generation of eastern Europeans travelled across the \u201cnon-aligned\u201d countries between the 1950s and the 80s \u2013 and they were there to build. In the process, the urbanisation of what was then called the \u201cthird world\u201d was carried out by architects, planners, engineers and workers from the \u201csecond world\u201d of eastern Europe. While they were there, they promised to do things differently. \u201cI remember well these eastern European architects,\u201d recalls a Ghanaian at the start of this book, \u201cbecause it was the first and the last time that a white man had an African boss in Ghana.\u201d</p> <p>This is one of those books that turns a discipline upside down \u2013 the cold war, state socialism, eastern Europe and 20th-century architecture all look different in the light of its findings. Based on multilingual research, it concentrates on how the development of several postcolonial cities \u2013 mainly, but not exclusively, Accra, Lagos, Baghdad, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait City \u2013 were in large part the product of architects and planners from the USSR, Yugoslavia, Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. It sketches in a strange geography, where an architect couldn\u2019t legally go from one end of Berlin to the other, but could travel across the world and reconstruct it. Each state\u2019s foreign trade organisation kept a close eye on travelling architects \u2013 and took as much as a third of salaries in hard cash \u2013 but the notion of state socialist insularity and autarchy is blown to pieces. So too is the idea of total Soviet control, both over its satellites and its postcolonial \u201cproxies\u201d. Each of the countries discussed here was in the Non-Aligned Movement set up in the 50s by India, Indonesia and Yugoslavia; they ranged from the statist developmentalism of Kwame Nkrumah\u2019s Ghana and Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr\u2019s Iraq to the rentier capitalism of 70s Nigeria, ending in the oil monarchies of the Gulf. Most of these governments harshly repressed their local communists, but welcomed foreign ones to plan and build their towns and industries \u2013 in the age of Sputnik, they gambled that the Soviet path to modernity would be faster and fairer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6f80a753a494cba16fdd0a4ffc46bebf59f2af6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6f80a753a494cba16fdd0a4ffc46bebf59f2af6/0_344_5248_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nikita Khrushchev (in pale suit) and President Sukarno (in cap) inspect the model of the National Stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1960.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nikita Khrushchev (in pale suit) and President Sukarno (in cap) inspect the model of the National Stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private archive of Igor Kashmadze/courtesy of Mikhail Tsyganov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We now rightly see that path as a failure, but Stanek takes what Soviet economists called the \u201cworld socialist system\u201d seriously, as \u201cneither an ideological smokescreen nor a utopian vision\u201d, but \u201can existing reality of foreign trade\u201d. Within that system, there was much contestation. The communist trading bloc <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1984/oct/30/cuba\" title=\"\">Comecon </a>was intended to create a national \u201cdivision of labour\u201d, but Balkan countries refused their Soviet-allotted place as breadbaskets and insisted on setting up their own hi-tech industries. The system rested on gifts \u2013 donations of schools and public buildings from the USSR to Ghana and Mali, for instance \u2013 and most often, barter, especially for crude oil after 1973. Under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/sep/21/khrushchev-visit-usa-disneyland-archive-1959\" title=\"\">Khrushchev</a>, it was a point of pride to make deals with such countries as Ghana on extremely favourable terms to the postcolonial countries, but by the \u201880s, trade had become much more hard-nosed.</p> <p>By the 70s, as east European countries acquired huge debts, these foreign endeavours became more pragmatic. Harsh divisions of labour emerged in Libya, for instance, where technologically complex East German plans were translated into the realities on the ground by Romanian designers and built by a working-class Romanian workforce living in barracks. In the 80s, meanwhile, Bulgarian and Polish architects in the Gulf were already participating in global capitalism. Bulgarian firms in Abu Dhabi competed well with American and British rivals on quality and technology, whereas Polish designers in Kuwait used the experience of daily interactions with western architects and easy access to the western press to move into postmodern architecture, here expressed in peculiar shopping mall-like souks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3a71aa142ed0763f3e5b4e6e3d39d13bc6c612c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a71aa142ed0763f3e5b4e6e3d39d13bc6c612c/0_41_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The main bus station in Abu Dhabi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The main bus station in Abu Dhabi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philipus/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s hard to countenance this 80s work \u2013 building Babylonian monuments to Saddam or luxury hotels for Gulf millionaires \u2013 as a great socialist or anti-imperialist project.

Stanek\u2019s book is no \u201cAmazing Brutalist Cold War Monuments of the Third World\u201d picture book.

It is not without flaws \u2013 though Stanek stresses African and Arab direction of the east Europeans rather than vice versa, it is the Europeans who remain the focus. But what he achieves here is enormous: a book that rewrites not only the history of the cold war, but also the history of globalisation and global urbanisation, which turns out to have been driven from Sofia or Belgrade almost as often as from New York, London and Moscow. Whether that meant a better globalisation is beyond his remit. Yet we now know that global cities as they currently exist are not the only ones possible.</p>",

The funniest thing that shouldn\u2019t be funny \u2026 Kilroy Loops on YouTube. It\u2019s a video made from all of Robert Kilroy-Silk\u2019s introductions to his TV show edited together. That\u2019s it. About the two-minute mark you\u2019ll find yourself entering a sort of trance-like hysteria. John-Luke Roberts: After Me Comes the Flood (But in French) tours 18 January to 14 March",

      "bodyText": "Vogue Italia will not feature any photoshoots in its January 2020 issue in a bid to make a statement about sustainability. The move is intended to highlight the environmental impact of photoshoots in print magazines. In his editor\u2019s letter, Emanuele Farneti listed some of the resources it took to fill the September 2019 issue, the biggest of the year, with original photographs: \u201cOne hundred and fifty people involved. About 20 flights and a dozen or so train journeys. Forty cars on standby. Sixty international deliveries. Lights switched on for at least ten hours nonstop, partly powered by gasoline-fuelled generators. Food waste from the catering services. Plastic to wrap the garments. Electricity to recharge phones, cameras \u2026 \u201d The eight illustrated covers for the issue, which will hit newsstands on 7 January, will feature work by different artists depicting real-life models wearing Gucci. Each one will read: \u201cNo photoshoot production was required for the making of this issue.\u201d On one cover the Mozambican-US painter Cassi Namoda has painted the model Ambar Cristal Zarzuela crying, a mosquito dripping with blood buzzing near her head. The Dutch model Felice Nova Noordhoff is shown on a cover by the Italian artist Paolo Ventura as wearing a fringed pink and metallic gold top and green eyeshadow, while Japanese artist and character designer Yoshitaka Amano has drawn model Lindsey Wixson in a thick black choker. Vanessa Beecroft, an Italian conceptual performance artist and Kanye West collaborator, has depicted a model wearing organza, and the comic book artist Milo Manara shows the model Olivia Vinten in strappy lingerie and latex gloves.

He told the New York Times that while there was discussion about whether it was right to \u201cbring back eroticism on the cover of a women\u2019s magazine \u2026 at the end, we decided that the girl is so in control\u201d.

The Clapper was consistently the league\u2019s most uninspiring coach. No one did less with more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/03/nfl-wild-card-predictions-patriots-saints-eagles-seahawks\">NFL wildcard weekend picks: Saints to march on, Bills to upset Texans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether Jason Garrett is reallocated or terminated remains to be seen. The latest reports indicate that after a face to face meeting this week, the Cowboys are letting Garrett\u2019s contract run out on 17 January rather than firing him outright. Why that distinction matters is anyone\u2019s guess. The result is the same:<a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/28412867/cowboys-move-jason-garrett-source-says\"> Garrett is out, and the search for a new coach is already underway</a>.</p> <p>The Cowboys haven\u2019t won a Super Bowl since January 1996, and yet they remain the most talked about team in the league. They are the most valuable franchise in American sports. To some, that comes with unusual pressures. Jerry Jones is cast as a villainous figure who wants to win <em>now, </em>restore the Cowboys as America\u2019s Team and in doing so claim some of the plaudits for himself.</p> <p>But are those expectations any different than with other franchises? Would you rather work for Jones, who flashes competence but speaks to the media multiple times a week, or the silent Daniel Snyder, who only ever opens his mouth to remind us just how dumb he is?</p> <p>How you respond that goes a long way to determining whether the Dallas opening is the best on the market or the worst.</p> <p>Rarely are coaches as good or bad as they are in the moment. Garrett could argue that he\u2019s been hard done by, that the expectations set for him were unrealistic, based as much on the team\u2019s history (built in an era before the salary cap) than anything else. In the past five seasons, the Cowboys are 44-36, a solid if unspectacular record. In the Dak Prescott era, the team is 40-24, a remarkable record. Dig deeper and the numbers are more impressive: Dallas has had a top 10 unit (offense or defense) each of the past four seasons, with the offense topping out as the second-best in the league, and the defense as the ninth best. Only the Patriots and Seahawks can match that.</p> <p>Talent is littered throughout the roster. And that, more than the overall record, is why Garrett is out. The talent has been there. But something about their deployment has always felt stodgy, outdated, unimaginative.</p> <p>2019 was a season too far. It was the umpteenth consecutive year the Cowboys preached cultural and stylistic change and the umpteenth consecutive year in which they finished with one of the league\u2019s most predictable records. Good, but not good enough \u2013 talent dragging Garrett and his staff to a blah record.</p> <p>Where they turn next is an interesting question. Across the NFL it seems we are seeing a correction to last year\u2019s overreach for young offensive assistants. More guys with head-coaching experience are being considered, and defensive coaches aren\u2019t being dismissed. The one hire confirmed so far (Ron Rivera in Washington) is proof of both. More are coming.</p> <p>College hotshots Lincoln Riley (Oklahoma), Matt Rhule (Baylor), and Urban Meyer (ex-Ohio State and Florida) have been mooted as fits in Dallas, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be much traction. They could look internally again, with defensive coordinator Kris Richard an ever-present name on the soon-to-be-head-coaches lists, and Kellen Moore, the young pup offensive coordinator who dazzled early in the year with an offense built around motions and shifts, both alien concepts under Garrett. Dallas is expected to interview all of the NFL assistants who\u2019ve been tagged with this year\u2019s \u201cguru\u201d label \u2013 offensively and defensively.</p> <p>Will coaches with such resumes be drawn to Dallas? Or somewhere where they\u2019re given more influence, real or perceived?</p> <p>To answer those, you have to answer two further questions: Does Jerry Jones really interfere? And if he does, has it been so bad?</p> <p>Jones has routinely claimed he does not overrule his coaches, a claim we take about as seriously as OJ Simpson\u2019s pledge to find the real killers. In Jones\u2019 world, he acts like any other general manager: he picks the players, makes suggestions, and lets his coaching staff go to work.

      "bodyText": "Jason Garrett is finally, mercifully out as the Dallas Cowboys head coach. Make no mistake, this is a lifetime achievement award, not a reaction to the team\u2019s disappointing 8-8 season. The Clapper was consistently the league\u2019s most uninspiring coach. No one did less with more. Whether Jason Garrett is reallocated or terminated remains to be seen. The latest reports indicate that after a face to face meeting this week, the Cowboys are letting Garrett\u2019s contract run out on 17 January rather than firing him outright. Why that distinction matters is anyone\u2019s guess. The result is the same: Garrett is out, and the search for a new coach is already underway. The Cowboys haven\u2019t won a Super Bowl since January 1996, and yet they remain the most talked about team in the league. They are the most valuable franchise in American sports. To some, that comes with unusual pressures. Jerry Jones is cast as a villainous figure who wants to win now, restore the Cowboys as America\u2019s Team and in doing so claim some of the plaudits for himself. But are those expectations any different than with other franchises? Would you rather work for Jones, who flashes competence but speaks to the media multiple times a week, or the silent Daniel Snyder, who only ever opens his mouth to remind us just how dumb he is? How you respond that goes a long way to determining whether the Dallas opening is the best on the market or the worst. Rarely are coaches as good or bad as they are in the moment. Garrett could argue that he\u2019s been hard done by, that the expectations set for him were unrealistic, based as much on the team\u2019s history (built in an era before the salary cap) than anything else. In the past five seasons, the Cowboys are 44-36, a solid if unspectacular record. In the Dak Prescott era, the team is 40-24, a remarkable record. Dig deeper and the numbers are more impressive: Dallas has had a top 10 unit (offense or defense) each of the past four seasons, with the offense topping out as the second-best in the league, and the defense as the ninth best. Only the Patriots and Seahawks can match that. Talent is littered throughout the roster. And that, more than the overall record, is why Garrett is out. The talent has been there. But something about their deployment has always felt stodgy, outdated, unimaginative. 2019 was a season too far. It was the umpteenth consecutive year the Cowboys preached cultural and stylistic change and the umpteenth consecutive year in which they finished with one of the league\u2019s most predictable records. Good, but not good enough \u2013 talent dragging Garrett and his staff to a blah record. Where they turn next is an interesting question. Across the NFL it seems we are seeing a correction to last year\u2019s overreach for young offensive assistants. More guys with head-coaching experience are being considered, and defensive coaches aren\u2019t being dismissed. The one hire confirmed so far (Ron Rivera in Washington) is proof of both. More are coming. College hotshots Lincoln Riley (Oklahoma), Matt Rhule (Baylor), and Urban Meyer (ex-Ohio State and Florida) have been mooted as fits in Dallas, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be much traction. They could look internally again, with defensive coordinator Kris Richard an ever-present name on the soon-to-be-head-coaches lists, and Kellen Moore, the young pup offensive coordinator who dazzled early in the year with an offense built around motions and shifts, both alien concepts under Garrett. Dallas is expected to interview all of the NFL assistants who\u2019ve been tagged with this year\u2019s \u201cguru\u201d label \u2013 offensively and defensively. Will coaches with such resumes be drawn to Dallas? Or somewhere where they\u2019re given more influence, real or perceived? To answer those, you have to answer two further questions: Does Jerry Jones really interfere? And if he does, has it been so bad? Jones has routinely claimed he does not overrule his coaches, a claim we take about as seriously as OJ Simpson\u2019s pledge to find the real killers. In Jones\u2019 world, he acts like any other general manager: he picks the players, makes suggestions, and lets his coaching staff go to work. That he\u2019s also the man who controls whether or not a coach can pay his mortgage seems lost on Jones, though not his staff. But Jones does cede some control. Like any owner, he signs off on a franchise\u2019s biggest decisions \u2013 top draft picks, free agents, contract extensions \u2013 but vice president of player personnel Will McClay handles the day-to-day running of the team. Jerry is not scouring the tape of potential practice squad candidates. And the Cowboys recent dips into the draft and trade markets have been excellent.

The move by Washington came after supporters of the Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah militia, founded by the 66-year-old Muhandis, laid siege to the US embassy in Baghdad. The career of Muhandis, who like Suleimani eschewed public attention, traced a familiar path through Iraq\u2019s convoluted Shia politics, in particular the strand that came under the direct tutelage of Tehran, beginning in Saddam Hussein\u2019s dictatorship. Born in Iraq\u2019s arid southern second city of Basra in 1953, to an Iraqi father and an Iranian mother, Muhandis joined the Shia opposition Dawa party while still at school before fleeing Iraq in 1980, the year of the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war. Sentenced to death in Kuwait for his involvement in the 1983 bomb attacks on US and French embassies there, he joined the Iran-based Iraqi Islamic supreme council and become a soldier in the elite Badr corps of Iraqi exiles fighting for Iran, where he served as a commander until the late 1990s. Returning to Iraq in 2003 after the US-led invasion that deposed Saddam, Muhandis quickly became one of Iran\u2019s key placemen, organising both to extend Tehran\u2019s influence in the turbulent years that followed the invasion and, as Iran sought to counter Washington\u2019s attempts to shape Iraq\u2019s future, briefly serving as an MP and a security adviser. \u201cMuhandis was demonstrative of how Iran built its network of proxies in Iraq,\u201d said Phillip Smyth, a US-based researcher focused on Shia armed groups. But it is more recent activities that put Muhandis\u2019s efforts for Iran, and particularly on behalf of Suleimani, for whom he worked as an adviser, in America\u2019s crosshairs. He was credited with being a key leader in the Shia militias, the Popular Mobilisation Forces, known as the Hashed (al-Shaabi), employed as shock troops in the bloody fight against Islamic State in Iraq. Although he worked under Faleh al-Fayyadh, Iraq\u2019s national security adviser, Muhandis was widely recognised as the Hashed\u2019s real leader. And equally, if not more, important was his involvement in founding and leading the Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah militia, part of the Hashed. Listed by the US as a terrorist group, Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah was regarded by Washington as a hardline pro-Iranian faction blamed for targeting US troops, with Muhandis himself accused of running \u201cweapons smuggling networks and participat[ing] in bombings of western embassies and attempted assassinations in the region\u201d. Indeed it was an attack launched by Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah killing a US contractor that triggered the sequence of events that led to US airstrikes on its bases in Iraq and Syria, which in turn sparked the violent demonstrations at the US embassy in Baghdad and, now, the assassination of Muhandis and Suleimani. He was \u201cthe most inveterate opponent of the United States,\u201d said Michael Knights, an expert at the Washington Institute, adding that while some of the PMF [Hashed] units had been incorporated under Iraqi military command, Muhandis had kept the militias at arm\u2019s length. \u201cMuhandis worked assiduously to develop the Hashed into an organisation that was neither subject to full prime ministerial command nor subordinate to the conventional security forces,\u201d said Knights. The only question now is who will replace Muhandis in Iraq as a representative of Tehran\u2019s interests. And while he may have been one of the most high profile and effective graduates of the Badr corps to return to Iraq after 2003, he is far from the only one.",

      "body": "<p>The new year honours list is a reliable source of controversy, with perennial outrage about the worthiness of the recipients.</p> <p>But the knighthood given to the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has been particularly unpopular, with more than 237,000 people <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/uk-government-and-parliament-we-object-to-iain-duncan-smith-receiving-a-knighthood\">signing a petition</a> objecting to the award for a man \u201cresponsible for some of the cruellest, most extreme welfare reforms this country has ever seen\u201d.</p> <p>One person with decades of experience adjudicating on the benefits system was especially appalled. \u201cAs a retired social security commissioner and upper tribunal judge, I spent a lifetime hearing thousands of appeals of decisions made by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/30/theres-no-honour-in-it-for-iain-duncan-smith\">wrote Stephen Pacey</a> in a letter to the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the Conservatives, the already dysfunctional system became ever more punitive and of increasingly byzantine complexity. Universal credit has been an abject failure, and if Iain Duncan Smith had the merest inkling of the harm his changes had caused, he ought in honour and simple honesty to have declined the award.\u201d</p> <p>The letter went viral as anger mounted, with at least one former MBE recipient announcing they were going to <a href=\"https://www.greatyarmouthmercury.co.uk/news/iain-duncan-smith-knighthood-great-yarmouth-councillor-protest-1-6446028\">give their honour back</a>, wanting no association with a system \u201cthat rewards social cruelty above social conscience\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking from his home in North Muskham, Nottinghamshire, Pacey explained why he was so disgusted by Duncan Smith. Now retired after more than 30 years in the judiciary, mostly ruling on appeals against DWP decisions, he is free to speak his mind. He seems happy to show his political colours, serving up tea in a mug bearing the legend \u201csocialist\u201d, with a copy of Terry Eagleton\u2019s Why Marx Was Right on his desk.</p> <p>\u201cTo my mind and to many people\u2019s minds, Iain Duncan Smith will always be Mr Universal Credit,\u201d said Pacey. \u201cI think the whole thing has been such a dismal failure that to give him a knighthood is a slap in the face, not just to universal credit claimants but benefits claimants generally. It\u2019s just an inept thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>Pacey, the grandson of Nottinghamshire miners and the son of factory workers, is perhaps unusual among the judiciary in that he has claimed benefits, having briefly signed on for jobseeker\u2019s allowance when searching for a solicitor contract early in his career.</p> <p>Receiving welfare did not carry the same stigma then. \u201cIn those days, it was an easy system. Not easy to manipulate and fraud or con people, but it wasn\u2019t subject to the ifs and buts and what have you that you get nowadays. I don\u2019t think it was as stigmatised as much,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Pacey, 70, became a tribunal judge in 1984 and spent the final 16 years of his full-time career hearing appeals in the upper tribunal \u2013 the administrative appeals chamber of the high court \u2013 against benefits decisions by both claimants and the DWP. He noticed a system becoming ever more prescriptive and burdensome, which sometimes lacked heart.</p> <p>He recalled a \u201cdesperately sad\u201d case involving a man who had helped his terminally ill wife to die and had his widower benefits stopped as a result.

      "bodyText": "The new year honours list is a reliable source of controversy, with perennial outrage about the worthiness of the recipients. But the knighthood given to the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has been particularly unpopular, with more than 237,000 people signing a petition objecting to the award for a man \u201cresponsible for some of the cruellest, most extreme welfare reforms this country has ever seen\u201d. One person with decades of experience adjudicating on the benefits system was especially appalled. \u201cAs a retired social security commissioner and upper tribunal judge, I spent a lifetime hearing thousands of appeals of decisions made by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),\u201d wrote Stephen Pacey in a letter to the Guardian. \u201cUnder the Conservatives, the already dysfunctional system became ever more punitive and of increasingly byzantine complexity. Universal credit has been an abject failure, and if Iain Duncan Smith had the merest inkling of the harm his changes had caused, he ought in honour and simple honesty to have declined the award.\u201d The letter went viral as anger mounted, with at least one former MBE recipient announcing they were going to give their honour back, wanting no association with a system \u201cthat rewards social cruelty above social conscience\u201d. Speaking from his home in North Muskham, Nottinghamshire, Pacey explained why he was so disgusted by Duncan Smith. Now retired after more than 30 years in the judiciary, mostly ruling on appeals against DWP decisions, he is free to speak his mind. He seems happy to show his political colours, serving up tea in a mug bearing the legend \u201csocialist\u201d, with a copy of Terry Eagleton\u2019s Why Marx Was Right on his desk. \u201cTo my mind and to many people\u2019s minds, Iain Duncan Smith will always be Mr Universal Credit,\u201d said Pacey. \u201cI think the whole thing has been such a dismal failure that to give him a knighthood is a slap in the face, not just to universal credit claimants but benefits claimants generally. It\u2019s just an inept thing to do.\u201d Pacey, the grandson of Nottinghamshire miners and the son of factory workers, is perhaps unusual among the judiciary in that he has claimed benefits, having briefly signed on for jobseeker\u2019s allowance when searching for a solicitor contract early in his career. Receiving welfare did not carry the same stigma then. \u201cIn those days, it was an easy system. Not easy to manipulate and fraud or con people, but it wasn\u2019t subject to the ifs and buts and what have you that you get nowadays. I don\u2019t think it was as stigmatised as much,\u201d he said. Pacey, 70, became a tribunal judge in 1984 and spent the final 16 years of his full-time career hearing appeals in the upper tribunal \u2013 the administrative appeals chamber of the high court \u2013 against benefits decisions by both claimants and the DWP. He noticed a system becoming ever more prescriptive and burdensome, which sometimes lacked heart. He recalled a \u201cdesperately sad\u201d case involving a man who had helped his terminally ill wife to die and had his widower benefits stopped as a result. Pacey reversed the decision on the grounds of \u201chumanity \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a lot of law involved in that particular case. It was an exercise in discretion. I thought it would have been cruel to penalise him. The poor chap had suffered enough already.\u201d He believes the media have played a role in demonising claimants over the past 20 years. \u201cI think the attitudes of some sections of the press changed, along with certain politicians, who took a much harder line and the public fed on that,\u201d Pacey said. He would like to see a change to the way in which politicians and the media talk about welfare: \u201cI want to see proper, reasoned, civilised language about the benefits system so that people aren\u2019t demonised.\u201d People do not claim benefits as a lifestyle choice, he insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen tens of thousands of cases and in any system devised, operated and accessed by human beings, there will be abuse at one end of the scale \u2026 But my feeling is that the vast majority of cases that I saw were just ordinary people who had fallen on hard times. There but for the grace of God go we all,\u201d Pacey said.",

      "bodyText": "Next year is set to be pretty packed out when it comes to 20th anniversaries celebrating so-called classic albums. You\u2019re soon going to get really sick of reading overly reverential tributes to Radiohead\u2019s Kid A and D\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo, though, so here\u2019s a reminder of the records from 2000 you thought you\u2019d forgotten, but that say more about 2020 than we could ever have imagined \u2026 Oasis: Standing on the Shoulder of Giants Back in 2011, Noel Gallagher said the band should have never made their fourth album, explaining: \u201cAt the time, I had no reason or desire to make music.\u201d But make it they did and it casually set the wheels in motion for Liam\u2019s hugely successful solo career two decades later, thanks to Gallagher Jr\u2019s first writing credit on the wafty Little James. Funnily enough, Liam didn\u2019t do the song at his recent arena tour, but he did give the album\u2019s Noel-penned Gas Panic! a whirl. Noel must be absolutely livid. Robbie Williams: Sing When You\u2019re Winning Here, Robbie Williams assumed his final form as a consummate, wild-eyed showman. He quit trying to be a knockoff Britpop lad and instead embraced end-of-the-pier charm, chucking in some Ian Dury swagger on Rock DJ and an attempt to rut Kylie on Kids. The former boyband tearaway was now \u2013 and still is \u2013 the nation\u2019s somewhat unhinged sweetheart. Anastacia: Not That Kind The influence of Anastacia can be most strongly felt in 2020\u2019s look. It\u2019s now pretty much impossible to buy a pair of sunglasses that haven\u2019t been inspired by the severe Matrix-style specs the singer sported on the cover of 2000\u2019s Not That Kind. Brilliantly, Anastacia actually had laser eye surgery in 2005, but continues to wear glasses because otherwise nobody knows who the hell she is. Limp Bizkit: Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water It is strange to think of how big Limp Bizkit actually were in the early 2000s. They headlined festivals and people willingly watched them play. Fred Durst dated Paris Hilton. They invented the dreadful genre \u201csports metal\u201d, now being revived by the likes of Poppy and Rina Sawayama. And this album, with a title that referenced both bumholes and urine (they said it couldn\u2019t be done!) became the fastest-selling rock album ever in the US. Proof that people cannot be trusted. Alice Deejay: Who Needs Guitars Anyway? How were the Dutch trance stars to know that, just a year down the line, the Strokes et al would arrive to remind everyone that, yes, sometimes we really do need guitars. It wasn\u2019t a total waste of time, however, as we\u2019re pretty certain Alice Deejay is responsible for Grimes.

She is a phenomenal player to watch, having started her youth football as a right-footed left-back (she\u2019s not sure why) and playing alongside boys, before being encouraged to switch positions while in Blackburn Rovers\u2019 academy.

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s World Cup semi-final exit hit hard and the hangover has been lengthy for everyone involved. For Manchester City\u2019s Keira Walsh, being at the sharp end of criticism after a tough tournament, it went even further: the whole experience left her doubting whether she wanted to play football at all. \u201cI probably underestimated how much attention was going to be on the games,\u201d says Walsh, sitting in the canteen of City\u2019s clean and crisp Academy Stadium. \u201cI\u2019d played in the FA Cup final, Champions League semi-finals, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she had thought when players had warned her the pressure would be ramped up. \u201cBut I really did struggle with the criticism off the back of it. There were times when I thought: \u2018Is this actually for me? Do I want to play football any more?\u2019\u201d Charged with anchoring the Lionesses midfield, Walsh was heading to France after a domestic cup double with her club, a title challenge and an unbeaten run that held until the final game of the season. She is a phenomenal player to watch, having started her youth football as a right-footed left-back (she\u2019s not sure why) and playing alongside boys, before being encouraged to switch positions while in Blackburn Rovers\u2019 academy. She has been transformed into a player so technically astute that her club manager, Nick Cushing, has said she is the most intelligent he has worked with, though she says he deserves more of the credit for an attention to detail and a \u201cfocus on the technical and tactical side so much that technical players thrive under a coach like him\u201d. It is an eye for the perfect pass, and five years of growing into her defensive midfield role while City earned trophy after trophy, that perhaps pushes you to forget that she is only 22 and also makes the fact she has been left questioning her place in the game really quite crushing. \u201cI think people forget that it was my first tournament,\u201d she says. \u201cLeah [Williamson], Georgia [Stanway], they\u2019ve all been to tournaments with England youth age groups. I got picked for one, at 15, and I never got picked again. I\u2019ve never really been to anything like the World Cup before and I was in and out of the team up until that point.

Sometimes people are very critical of me, which is fine, I can learn to deal with it, but people do tend to forget that I\u2019ve still got time to improve and this isn\u2019t the finished product by any means.\u201d She looked a shadow of herself in England\u2019s opening games, but the fact that Phil Neville kept picking her, much to the chagrin of those unfamiliar with her game, showed how valuable she is to the future of England\u2019s midfield. Where others grew up idolising strikers and superstars, her father encouraged a love of passers of the ball such as David Silva and Sergio Busquets.

With no doubt, Iran and other freedom-seeking countries in the region will take his revenge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Iran\u2019s foreign minister<strong>, </strong>Mohammad Javad Zarif, said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1212946202280579073\">on Twitter</a>: \u201cThe US\u2019 act of international terrorism, targeting &amp; assassinating General Suleimani \u2013 THE most effective force fighting Daesh (ISIS), Al Nusrah, Al Qaeda et al \u2013 is extremely dangerous &amp; a foolish escalation. The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tehran\u2019s Lebanon-based ally Hezbollah also promised to avenge the killing.

The Pentagon statement accused the Quds force of being responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US service members and the wounding of thousands more.</p> \n<p>Many consider Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind Khamenei, and arguably ahead of Rouhani. Through a mix of security operations and diplomatic coercion, he has been more responsible than anyone else for projecting Iran\u2019s influence in the region. This has been led in Iraq, but also by establishing a seemingly permanent military foothold in war-torn Syria, linking Tehran to the Mediterranean and a land border with Israel.</p> \n<p>Hours after his death on Friday, Suleimani\u2019s position was filled by a deputy commander, Brig Gen Esmail Ghaani, Iranian media reported.</p> \n<p>The assassination had followed a tit-for-tat series of strikes by the US and Iran, protagonists in Iraq since late 2006. Suleimani had been central to almost all that Iran did and senior officials under Barack Obama considered him close to untouchable.</p> \n<p>The strike came at a time when Iraq was already on the brink of an all-out proxy war, and hours after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/iraq-riots-embassy-expose-america-weaker-fewer-options\">two-day siege</a> of the US embassy in Baghdad by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/us-embassy-stormed-in-baghdad\">mob of PMF militants</a> and their supporters.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump ordered an airstrike that killed Iran\u2019s most powerful general in the early hours of Friday, in a dramatic escalation of an already bloody struggle between Washington and Tehran for influence across the region. Qassem Suleimani was hit by the drone strike while local allies from the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) drove him from Baghdad airport. The de facto leader of the PMF, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a close Suleimani associate, was also killed in the attack. \u201cGeneral Suleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,\u201d a Pentagon statement said. \u201cThis strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.\u201d Minutes before the announcement, Trump tweeted a US flag without comment. Later, the White House put out a statement saying the strike was a \u201cdecisive defensive action\u201d carried out \u201cat the direction of the president\u201d. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said in a statement: \u201cSuleimani\u2019s martyrdom will make Iran more decisive to resist America\u2019s expansionism and to defend our Islamic values. With no doubt, Iran and other freedom-seeking countries in the region will take his revenge.\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Twitter: \u201cThe US\u2019 act of international terrorism, targeting &amp; assassinating General Suleimani \u2013 THE most effective force fighting Daesh (ISIS), Al Nusrah, Al Qaeda et al \u2013 is extremely dangerous &amp; a foolish escalation. The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism.\u201d Tehran\u2019s Lebanon-based ally Hezbollah also promised to avenge the killing. In Iraq, Hadi al-Ameri, a Iran ally and head of the paramilitary Badr Organization, called on all Iraqi factions to expel foreign troops. No Iranian official detailed what type of retaliation was being planned or for when. Washington and its regional allies Israel and Saudi Arabia, who also see Tehran as an arch-foe, all braced for potential reprisals. The US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, said Trump had \u201ctossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox\u201d. His fellow Democratic hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders warned the attack could spark a disastrous new war in the Middle East. Suleimani was commander of the Quds force, the elite, external wing of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, which the Trump administration designated a terrorist organisation in April last year. The Pentagon statement accused the Quds force of being responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US service members and the wounding of thousands more. Many consider Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind Khamenei, and arguably ahead of Rouhani. Through a mix of security operations and diplomatic coercion, he has been more responsible than anyone else for projecting Iran\u2019s influence in the region. This has been led in Iraq, but also by establishing a seemingly permanent military foothold in war-torn Syria, linking Tehran to the Mediterranean and a land border with Israel. Hours after his death on Friday, Suleimani\u2019s position was filled by a deputy commander, Brig Gen Esmail Ghaani, Iranian media reported. The assassination had followed a tit-for-tat series of strikes by the US and Iran, protagonists in Iraq since late 2006. Suleimani had been central to almost all that Iran did and senior officials under Barack Obama considered him close to untouchable. The strike came at a time when Iraq was already on the brink of an all-out proxy war, and hours after a two-day siege of the US embassy in Baghdad by a mob of PMF militants and their supporters. The Pentagon accused Suleimani of having masterminded the mob attack. That siege followed US airstrikes on camps run by a PMF-affiliated militia particularly closely aligned with Tehran, which in turn was a reprisal for that militia\u2019s killing of a US contractor in an attack on an Iraqi army base on Friday. The US has deployed 750 airborne troops to Kuwait as a rapid reaction force available for use in Iraq, and officials have said up to 3,000 could be sent in the coming days. The defence secretary, Mark Esper, said on Thursday that more militia attacks were expected and the US reserved the right to take pre-emptive action to stop them. \u201cThere are some indications out there that they may be planning additional attacks,\u201d Esper said. \u201cIf we get word of attacks, we will take pre-emptive action as well to protect American forces, protect American lives. The game has changed.\u201d After the targeted killing, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, posted a video he said showed Iraqis dancing in the street \u201cthankful that General Suleimani is no more\u201d. However, Suleimani\u2019s death leaves Iraq and the region on the brink of a new upsurge in violence, with Trump\u2019s and Khamenei\u2019s moves and counter-moves hard to predict. Trump authorised the strike at a time when the US Congress was in recess, and the White House framed the action as an act of self-defence in the context of counter-terrorism operations. But Democrats and perhaps some Republicans in Congress will see it as an usurpation of the legislature\u2019s authority to decide matters of war and peace. \u201cOne reason we don\u2019t generally assassinate foreign political officials is the belief that such action will get more, not less, Americans killed,\u201d Democratic senator Chris Murphy said on Twitter. \u201cThat should be our real, pressing and grave worry tonight.\u201d",

It shows that much more must be done to intervene early and provide intensive support in the community.</p> <p>One of the main problems patients face is that for many, their eating disorders are simply not taken seriously enough. Eating disorders are complex mental illnesses with the potential to be incredibly damaging. They are not a \u201cdiet gone wrong\u201d\u2019 \u2013 in fact, anorexia nervosa has the <a href=\"https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/media-centre/eating-disorder-statistics\" title=\"\">highest mortality rate</a> of any mental illness. They often cause major physical health problems and without the right support people with eating disorders often become isolated: cut off from education, work or a social life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/02/sharp-rise-in-nhs-hospital-admissions-for-eating-disorders\">Sharp rise in NHS hospital admissions for eating disorders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>NHS data shows that hospital admissions for those with eating disorders increased from about 14,000 in 2016-17 to just over 19,000 in 2018-19. This in itself is very worrying \u2013 hospital admission is typically reserved for the most severely ill patients, which suggests that too often, people with eating disorders are not being identified and supported to access help until they have reached crisis point. <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69\" title=\"\">Guidelines from Nice</a> recommend that, where possible, outpatient treatment should be offered in the first instance. Getting rapid access to high-quality treatment and support in the community can prevent people with eating disorders from deteriorating to a point where hospital admission is required and provides the best chance of recovery.</p> <p>Some are quick to blame <a href=\"https://www.priorygroup.com/blog/the-dangers-of-social-media-and-advice-on-eating-disorders\" title=\"\">social media</a> or celebrities, but this is too simplistic. There is a lot to learn about what causes eating disorders, mainly because research in this area has been woefully underfunded. But recent advances in <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/anorexia-may-be-linked-to-metabolism-a-genetic-analysis-suggests/\" title=\"\">the study of genetics</a> suggest that some people are likely to be at a much greater risk of developing an eating disorder when exposed to various life experiences \u2013 such as stress, bullying or traumatic events. More research will be key if we are to achieve the ultimate aim of preventing eating disorders from developing in the first place.</p> <p>But what needs to be done to ensure that everyone with an eating disorder gets the help they need? Since 2016 there has been a big step forward in access to specialist NHS treatment for under-18s in England. This progress was driven by the introduction of an ambitious national standard that <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/mental-health/cyp/eating-disorders/\" title=\"\">evidence-based treatment</a> should start within four weeks and additional investment, staff recruitment and training. However, we know that this progress has not been even, with some areas being left behind. The government and the NHS in England must ensure that the additional funding that they have pledged for these services in the <a href=\"https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/publication/nhs-long-term-plan/\" title=\"\">NHS Long Term Plan</a> reaches the front line, and that national standards are met in every area.</p> <p>Adult eating disorder services are severely underresourced, having been overlooked in the preceding NHS mental health strategy. In 2017 the parliamentary and health service ombudsman published a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/08/clear-failures-of-care-scathing-report-into-students-anorexia-death\" title=\"\">damning report</a> that highlighted the need for greater investment in these services to prevent further lives being lost. Beat\u2019s recent research illustrated how adults with eating disorders in England face a <a href=\"https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/news/beat-news/postcode-lottery-lives-at-risk\" title=\"\">postcode lottery</a> to access specialist treatment. We now need to see the government and the NHS apply the same level of ambition for adult eating disorder services as they have for under-18s. This would mean introducing a fully funded access and waiting time standard for adult eating disorder services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/16/anorexia-genetic-eating-disorder-mind-illness-study\">This genetic breakthrough on anorexia should transform how the disease is seen | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We also need more innovation in care. In much of the country if you do not meet the thresholds to access an inpatient bed, but you need more support than outpatient care, there is nothing available. Intensive day care or home-based treatments can minimise the need for inpatient admissions, reduce length of stay and provide a step down from inpatient care to living back in the community.</p> <p>Investing in specialist services is crucial but will not be enough on its own. On average it takes three years before seeking help. We need a more comprehensive effort to reduce this gap. Too often an eating disorder is only suspected when the individual has already reached crisis point. GPs, hospital doctors, nurses, education staff, employers and others, if properly trained, are well-placed to spot the early signs of an eating disorder and to support referral to a specialist.</p> <p>On average UK medical schools provide <a href=\"https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/news/doctors-lack-training-eating-disorders-lives-at-risk\" title=\"\">less than two hours\u2019 teaching</a> about eating disorders, with one in five providing no teaching at all. Opportunities for junior doctors to benefit from clinical experience are extremely limited. The General Medical Council (GMC), which sets standards for medical training, has committed to work with medical schools and others to ensure that tomorrow\u2019s doctors are properly trained in how to identify, safely manage and refer patients with eating disorders. In 2019 the GMC acknowledged the need for medical training in this area to improve and took some encouraging steps. We hope that we can support this work further in 2020.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>If you are worried about yourself or </em><em>someone else you can call </em><em>Beat\u2019s helpline on 0808 801 0677 12pm \u2013 8pm on weekdays and 4pm-8pm on weekends.</em></p> <p>\u2022 Tom Quinn is director of external affairs at Beat, the UK\u2019s eating disorder charity</p>",

      "bodyText": "The rise in hospital admissions for people with eating disorders reported on Thursday is very concerning. It shows that much more must be done to intervene early and provide intensive support in the community. One of the main problems patients face is that for many, their eating disorders are simply not taken seriously enough. Eating disorders are complex mental illnesses with the potential to be incredibly damaging. They are not a \u201cdiet gone wrong\u201d\u2019 \u2013 in fact, anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. They often cause major physical health problems and without the right support people with eating disorders often become isolated: cut off from education, work or a social life. NHS data shows that hospital admissions for those with eating disorders increased from about 14,000 in 2016-17 to just over 19,000 in 2018-19. This in itself is very worrying \u2013 hospital admission is typically reserved for the most severely ill patients, which suggests that too often, people with eating disorders are not being identified and supported to access help until they have reached crisis point. Guidelines from Nice recommend that, where possible, outpatient treatment should be offered in the first instance. Getting rapid access to high-quality treatment and support in the community can prevent people with eating disorders from deteriorating to a point where hospital admission is required and provides the best chance of recovery. Some are quick to blame social media or celebrities, but this is too simplistic. There is a lot to learn about what causes eating disorders, mainly because research in this area has been woefully underfunded. But recent advances in the study of genetics suggest that some people are likely to be at a much greater risk of developing an eating disorder when exposed to various life experiences \u2013 such as stress, bullying or traumatic events. More research will be key if we are to achieve the ultimate aim of preventing eating disorders from developing in the first place. But what needs to be done to ensure that everyone with an eating disorder gets the help they need? Since 2016 there has been a big step forward in access to specialist NHS treatment for under-18s in England. This progress was driven by the introduction of an ambitious national standard that evidence-based treatment should start within four weeks and additional investment, staff recruitment and training. However, we know that this progress has not been even, with some areas being left behind. The government and the NHS in England must ensure that the additional funding that they have pledged for these services in the NHS Long Term Plan reaches the front line, and that national standards are met in every area. Adult eating disorder services are severely underresourced, having been overlooked in the preceding NHS mental health strategy. In 2017 the parliamentary and health service ombudsman published a damning report that highlighted the need for greater investment in these services to prevent further lives being lost. Beat\u2019s recent research illustrated how adults with eating disorders in England face a postcode lottery to access specialist treatment. We now need to see the government and the NHS apply the same level of ambition for adult eating disorder services as they have for under-18s. This would mean introducing a fully funded access and waiting time standard for adult eating disorder services. We also need more innovation in care. In much of the country if you do not meet the thresholds to access an inpatient bed, but you need more support than outpatient care, there is nothing available. Intensive day care or home-based treatments can minimise the need for inpatient admissions, reduce length of stay and provide a step down from inpatient care to living back in the community. Investing in specialist services is crucial but will not be enough on its own. On average it takes three years before seeking help. We need a more comprehensive effort to reduce this gap. Too often an eating disorder is only suspected when the individual has already reached crisis point. GPs, hospital doctors, nurses, education staff, employers and others, if properly trained, are well-placed to spot the early signs of an eating disorder and to support referral to a specialist. On average UK medical schools provide less than two hours\u2019 teaching about eating disorders, with one in five providing no teaching at all. Opportunities for junior doctors to benefit from clinical experience are extremely limited. The General Medical Council (GMC), which sets standards for medical training, has committed to work with medical schools and others to ensure that tomorrow\u2019s doctors are properly trained in how to identify, safely manage and refer patients with eating disorders. In 2019 the GMC acknowledged the need for medical training in this area to improve and took some encouraging steps. We hope that we can support this work further in 2020. \u2022 If you are worried about yourself or someone else you can call Beat\u2019s helpline on 0808 801 0677 12pm \u2013 8pm on weekdays and 4pm-8pm on weekends. \u2022 Tom Quinn is director of external affairs at Beat, the UK\u2019s eating disorder charity",

      "body": "<p>First published in France in 2013, <em>The Living Days</em> is the 12th novel by the Mauritian author Ananda Devi. Set in London, it tells of the sexual abuse of a 13-year-old black boy by a 75-year-old white woman. Mary has lived a loveless life ever since losing her virginity to a soldier during the war: he went away to fight and didn\u2019t come back, and she never moved on. Jeremiah, who goes by the nickname Cub, lives on a council estate in Brixton. His mother is very hard up, so he skips school to earn money doing odd jobs at Mary\u2019s house in Notting Hill. Mary becomes obsessed with Cub; he starts sleeping in her bed, and things get worse from there.</p> <p>Devi is not the first contemporary novelist to depict a female paedophile, but whereas novels such as Alissa Nutting\u2019s <em>Tampa</em> (2013) and AM Homes\u2019s <em>The End of Alice</em> (1996) foregrounded the psychopathology of sexual predation, the emphasis here is more social than psychological. The abuse scenario recounted in <em>The Living Days</em> prompts a meditation on urban inequality, in which the politics of race and class loom large. We learn that Cub had idealised white women: \u201cHe envied them their elegance, their affluence. Their modulated voices, their discreet accents so unlike the shrill shrieks of the neighbourhood girls \u2026 At night, he dreamed of them \u2026 They\u2019ll be my way out of Brixton.\u201d Mary\u2019s adoration of Cub is described by Devi\u2019s third-person narrator in startlingly dehumanising terms: Mary wonders at \u201cthis pure, animalistic marvel of his body\u201d; he is \u201ca glorious monster\u201d and \u201cthe most elusive of creatures\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The abuse scenario in the book prompts a meditation on urban inequality \u2013 the politics of race and class loom large</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This fetishistic language underlines the essentially neocolonial nature of their relationship: in its sordid and exploitative dynamic, it symbolically evokes the history of social relations between white and black, between metropole and empire \u2013 the legacy of which, Devi suggests, persists in the violence of 21st-century city life. The story is set in 2003 and features several allusions to violent crimes from the 1990s and early 2000s, including the murders of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bulger\" title=\"\">Jam</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bulger\" title=\"\">es Bulger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/damilola-taylor\" title=\"\">Damilola Taylor</a>; these are pointedly juxtaposed with references to George W Bush\u2019s wars and the horrors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/06/iraq-prisoner-abuse-court\" title=\"\">Abu Ghraib</a> to paint a picture of a world mired in cruelty. In addition to being abused by Mary, Cub is set upon by a gang of white fascists in an attack reminiscent of the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence\" title=\"\">Stephen Lawrence</a>.</p> <p>Devi has lived in France for the past 30 years, writing novels heavily influenced by feminist and post-colonial thought. The French literary establishment is notoriously conservative in its tastes, but Devi\u2019s profile has benefited from several government-funded initiatives to promote francophone culture globally, most notably winning the prestigious Prix des cinq continents de la francophonie for her 2006 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/30/eve-out-of-her-ruins-ananda-devi-review\" title=\"\">Eve Out of Her Ruins</a></em>, published by Les Fugitives in 2016. To the extent that such programmes can be said to be implicitly neocolonial \u2013 seeking to sustain national influence through transnational cultural outreach \u2013 there is a kind of poetic justice here: the husk of empire, sorrily bankrolling its own damnation.</p> <p>Devi\u2019s talents were impressively showcased in <em>Eve Out of Her Ruins</em>, which explored everyday violence and misogyny in the slum districts of the Mauritian capital, Port-Louis, with a smart blend of lyricism and sociological insight. <em>The Living Days</em> is a somewhat disappointing follow-up, comparatively lacking in subtlety and trading rather too heavily on shock value. There is a conspicuous strain of Victorian paternalism in Devi\u2019s ruminations on the nexus between poverty and violence, which occasionally lapse from well-meaning solicitude into crass condescension. There\u2019s a surprise cameo from Anne Robinson, whose brutal treatment of contestants on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2017/jul/23/how-i-won-the-weakest-link-anne-robinson\" title=\"\">The Weakest Link </a></em>is cited as a symptom of a society in which compassion and empathy have run dry.</p> <p>These tonally awkward moments diminish the novel\u2019s moral force, as does the abundance of cliches in Devi\u2019s prose: some allowance must be made for the ambiguities of translation, but the surfeit of corny phrases such as \u201cthe dregs of humanity\u201d and \u201cthe ravages of time\u201d is cloying. While Mary\u2019s loneliness is rendered with a certain degree of conviction \u2013 her home, with its \u201ccurtains pock-marked by mites, the carpet reeking of urine\u201d, is a picture of pitiful self-neglect \u2013 the character of Cub is two-dimensional: we are told that he listens to Bob Marley (of course!) and that his \u201cheart still belonged to those shadows from which he had emerged\u201d.

      "bodyText": "First published in France in 2013, The Living Days is the 12th novel by the Mauritian author Ananda Devi. Set in London, it tells of the sexual abuse of a 13-year-old black boy by a 75-year-old white woman. Mary has lived a loveless life ever since losing her virginity to a soldier during the war: he went away to fight and didn\u2019t come back, and she never moved on. Jeremiah, who goes by the nickname Cub, lives on a council estate in Brixton. His mother is very hard up, so he skips school to earn money doing odd jobs at Mary\u2019s house in Notting Hill. Mary becomes obsessed with Cub; he starts sleeping in her bed, and things get worse from there. Devi is not the first contemporary novelist to depict a female paedophile, but whereas novels such as Alissa Nutting\u2019s Tampa (2013) and AM Homes\u2019s The End of Alice (1996) foregrounded the psychopathology of sexual predation, the emphasis here is more social than psychological. The abuse scenario recounted in The Living Days prompts a meditation on urban inequality, in which the politics of race and class loom large. We learn that Cub had idealised white women: \u201cHe envied them their elegance, their affluence. Their modulated voices, their discreet accents so unlike the shrill shrieks of the neighbourhood girls \u2026 At night, he dreamed of them \u2026 They\u2019ll be my way out of Brixton.\u201d Mary\u2019s adoration of Cub is described by Devi\u2019s third-person narrator in startlingly dehumanising terms: Mary wonders at \u201cthis pure, animalistic marvel of his body\u201d; he is \u201ca glorious monster\u201d and \u201cthe most elusive of creatures\u201d. This fetishistic language underlines the essentially neocolonial nature of their relationship: in its sordid and exploitative dynamic, it symbolically evokes the history of social relations between white and black, between metropole and empire \u2013 the legacy of which, Devi suggests, persists in the violence of 21st-century city life. The story is set in 2003 and features several allusions to violent crimes from the 1990s and early 2000s, including the murders of James Bulger and Damilola Taylor; these are pointedly juxtaposed with references to George W Bush\u2019s wars and the horrors of Abu Ghraib to paint a picture of a world mired in cruelty. In addition to being abused by Mary, Cub is set upon by a gang of white fascists in an attack reminiscent of the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Devi has lived in France for the past 30 years, writing novels heavily influenced by feminist and post-colonial thought. The French literary establishment is notoriously conservative in its tastes, but Devi\u2019s profile has benefited from several government-funded initiatives to promote francophone culture globally, most notably winning the prestigious Prix des cinq continents de la francophonie for her 2006 novel Eve Out of Her Ruins, published by Les Fugitives in 2016. To the extent that such programmes can be said to be implicitly neocolonial \u2013 seeking to sustain national influence through transnational cultural outreach \u2013 there is a kind of poetic justice here: the husk of empire, sorrily bankrolling its own damnation. Devi\u2019s talents were impressively showcased in Eve Out of Her Ruins, which explored everyday violence and misogyny in the slum districts of the Mauritian capital, Port-Louis, with a smart blend of lyricism and sociological insight. The Living Days is a somewhat disappointing follow-up, comparatively lacking in subtlety and trading rather too heavily on shock value. There is a conspicuous strain of Victorian paternalism in Devi\u2019s ruminations on the nexus between poverty and violence, which occasionally lapse from well-meaning solicitude into crass condescension. There\u2019s a surprise cameo from Anne Robinson, whose brutal treatment of contestants on The Weakest Link is cited as a symptom of a society in which compassion and empathy have run dry. These tonally awkward moments diminish the novel\u2019s moral force, as does the abundance of cliches in Devi\u2019s prose: some allowance must be made for the ambiguities of translation, but the surfeit of corny phrases such as \u201cthe dregs of humanity\u201d and \u201cthe ravages of time\u201d is cloying. While Mary\u2019s loneliness is rendered with a certain degree of conviction \u2013 her home, with its \u201ccurtains pock-marked by mites, the carpet reeking of urine\u201d, is a picture of pitiful self-neglect \u2013 the character of Cub is two-dimensional: we are told that he listens to Bob Marley (of course!) and that his \u201cheart still belonged to those shadows from which he had emerged\u201d. When the narrator remarks that Cub \u201cseemed to have come from nowhere, as if he had been created out of nothing with no obligation to anyone\u201d, the reader can only nod in agreement. \u2022 The Living Days by Ananda Devi, translated by Jeffrey Zuckerman, is published by Les Fugitives (\u00a311.99).",

Gervais might not be the Golden Globes host we want \u2013 in an ideal world, it would be someone who takes about 70% less delight in how naughty they are being \u2013 but he is the one we deserve.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to remember but, not so long ago, the Golden Globes were an afterthought. Untelevised on a regular basis until the early 1980s and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/golden-globe-awards-tarnished-by-allegations-of-corruption-2185198.html\" title=\"\">besieged by claims of internal corruption</a>, the Globes existed primarily as an opportunity for the stars of the day to sit around and abuse the open bar together. Jack Nicholson became the show\u2019s unofficial figurehead for exactly that reason.</p> <p>But, little by little, the show became another pitstop on the awards ceremony treadmill; one more place for the stars to wobble and genuflect on the road to the Oscars. It started to lose its identity amid a sea of lesser awards.

      "bodyText": "Ricky Gervais should not host the Golden Globes this year. He has said as much himself, again and again and again. The first time he was apparently going to quit the job was after his second ceremony, in 2011, until he read some negative reviews of his performance, which caused him to reverse his decision purely to \u201cannoy them\u201d. But then he vowed that the next ceremony would also be his last \u2013 writing on his blog: \u201cI\u2019ve told my agent to never let me be persuaded to do it again\u201d \u2013 only to return in 2016 for a fourth effort. Would he ever do a fifth? Unlikely. A Ricky Gervais Golden Globes performance in the age of cancel culture, he said, would be \u201cthe end of my career\u201d. And yet here we are. On Sunday, Ricky Gervais will host the Golden Globes ceremony again. It won\u2019t be a record-breaking turn; for most of the awards\u2019 76-year history, there were no \u201cname\u201d hosts, and it has been only in recent years that a celebrity has steered the event (and only a handful have had that honour). Gervais has had more goes than anyone else. Nor will it be particularly shocking, since Gervais\u2019s self-consciously provocative ain\u2019t-I-a-stinker shtick is now so well rehearsed that you could set your clock by it. Everyone knows how the ceremony will go. He will cross the line a couple of times, make a few headlines, tell everyone he doesn\u2019t care and then go back to tweeting pictures of his face three times a day. Same as it ever was. So will this be his last Golden Globes? He seems to think so, shoehorning his now traditional statement that he will never do this again into the press release that announced his reappointment. Nobody believes him, of course. Gervais and the Golden Globes will never truly be free of one another. They are destined to do this dance until the end of days. And, perhaps, that is probably for the best. Gervais might not be the Golden Globes host we want \u2013 in an ideal world, it would be someone who takes about 70% less delight in how naughty they are being \u2013 but he is the one we deserve. It\u2019s hard to remember but, not so long ago, the Golden Globes were an afterthought. Untelevised on a regular basis until the early 1980s and besieged by claims of internal corruption, the Globes existed primarily as an opportunity for the stars of the day to sit around and abuse the open bar together. Jack Nicholson became the show\u2019s unofficial figurehead for exactly that reason. But, little by little, the show became another pitstop on the awards ceremony treadmill; one more place for the stars to wobble and genuflect on the road to the Oscars. It started to lose its identity amid a sea of lesser awards. Things came to a dreary head in 2008 when, thanks to the writers\u2019 strike, the ceremony took the form of a 32-minute press conference. One way to regain some of its old reputation, the show figured, was to employ a host. Although technically not the first ever Golden Globes host \u2013 Janine Turner and John Larroquette did a perfunctory job in 1995 \u2013 Gervais\u2019s initial appointment, in 2010, seemed a masterstroke at the time. After all, the Golden Globes are where he made his first footsteps on the international stage, stammering \u201cI\u2019m not from around these parts\u201d during his acceptance speech when The Office surprised everyone by winning best comedy in 2004. There are traces of that Gervais \u2013 the blinking underdog \u2013 in his first turn as host. His monologue opened with an admission that the US doesn\u2019t recognise him as the creator of The Office. \u201cI\u2019m not used to these sorts of viewing figures,\u201d he gulped a moment later. There were jokes about how he looked like the victim of botched surgery and his tiny penis, and constant plugs for his films and TV shows, as if this was going to be his last chance to address the world. The performance veered on boorishness \u2013 this is the ceremony where he introduced one guest by saying: \u201cI like a drink as much as the next man, unless the next man is Mel Gibson\u201d \u2013 but at least it was grounded in something approaching restraint. The following year, that restraint began to erode.

His first race in the Blackwell red and blue colours was a Grade One hurdle at Chepstow in which he finished second, with the eventual star Smad Place behind him. \u201cHis marvellous attitude was the reason he was as good as he was,\u201d says Aidan Coleman, who rode the horse 31 times. \u201cIf he was a hand bigger, he definitely would have been top class.\u201d</p> <p>They won the Denman Chase and two valuable Ascot handicaps together but Houblon\u2019s best runs were in defeat, most notably when he carried top weight in the Hennessy and finished just three lengths behind Many Clouds, who was carrying 6lb less and went on to win the Grand National. One of the reasons that Coneygree tackled and won the Gold Cup as a novice was that his connections were so impressed he had beaten Houblon Des Obeaux at Newbury the previous month.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got the ability and he loves his job, so he\u2019s everything you\u2019d want,\u201d was the verdict of Charlie Deutsch, Houblon\u2019s jockey in recent seasons, after they enjoyed what proved to be their final victory together, at Sandown in November. The horse\u2019s sustained enthusiasm for racing, after 10 years of constantly taking on quality rivals at the toughest tracks, was his most endearing trait.</p> <p>\u201cThe last easy race he had was probably when he won a novice chase at Worcester in 2012,\u201d says Coleman. Roberts adds: \u201cHe never got sick of anything, he never saw a vet. I think he was lame once, when he had a corn in his foot a few years ago. He matched strides with a lot of good horses throughout his career. He was that step below the very best, for sure, but he ran in two Gold Cups, two Grand Nationals. And he was a horse that could put a smile on your face every morning.\u201d</p>",

His first race in the Blackwell red and blue colours was a Grade One hurdle at Chepstow in which he finished second, with the eventual star Smad Place behind him. \u201cHis marvellous attitude was the reason he was as good as he was,\u201d says Aidan Coleman, who rode the horse 31 times. \u201cIf he was a hand bigger, he definitely would have been top class.\u201d They won the Denman Chase and two valuable Ascot handicaps together but Houblon\u2019s best runs were in defeat, most notably when he carried top weight in the Hennessy and finished just three lengths behind Many Clouds, who was carrying 6lb less and went on to win the Grand National. One of the reasons that Coneygree tackled and won the Gold Cup as a novice was that his connections were so impressed he had beaten Houblon Des Obeaux at Newbury the previous month. \u201cHe\u2019s got the ability and he loves his job, so he\u2019s everything you\u2019d want,\u201d was the verdict of Charlie Deutsch, Houblon\u2019s jockey in recent seasons, after they enjoyed what proved to be their final victory together, at Sandown in November. The horse\u2019s sustained enthusiasm for racing, after 10 years of constantly taking on quality rivals at the toughest tracks, was his most endearing trait. \u201cThe last easy race he had was probably when he won a novice chase at Worcester in 2012,\u201d says Coleman. Roberts adds: \u201cHe never got sick of anything, he never saw a vet. I think he was lame once, when he had a corn in his foot a few years ago. He matched strides with a lot of good horses throughout his career. He was that step below the very best, for sure, but he ran in two Gold Cups, two Grand Nationals. And he was a horse that could put a smile on your face every morning.\u201d",

It was monumental and bizarre to absorb,\u201d Loweth says. The collection premiering on Sunday is a collaboration with Maggi Hambling, a British artist best known for A Conversation With Oscar Wilde, an outdoor sculpture in central London, and Scallop, a huge seashell on the beach in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, dedicated to the composer Benjamin Britten. The show will focus on \u201cqueer sensuality, queer touch\u201d and draw on Hambling\u2019s whole archive. Entitled Fearless Love, it will have added resonance for the duo. \u201cMyself and Tom have gone from being personal partners to just working together, so that\u2019s been interesting, moving apart as partners but coming together to work on this collection.\u201d",

MNG Jet said it leased two private jets it believed were for two separate clients, one flying from Dubai to Osaka in Japan and then on to Istanbul, and another flying from Istanbul to Beirut. The company said it had since discovered the planes were not leased for the named passengers but were instrumental in Ghosn\u2019s escape to Lebanon from Japan, where the former Nissan chairman was facing trial over allegations of financial misconduct. He has consistently denied the charges. MNG Jet said it had filed a criminal complaint in Turkey to prosecute anyone involved in using the jets, which it said it had leased believing they were for other people. \u201cOne employee of the company, who is under investigation by the authorities, has admitted having falsified the records,\u201d the company said. \u201cHe confirmed that he acted in his individual capacity, without the knowledge or the authorisation of the management of MNG Jet. \u201cMNG Jet is proactively cooperating with the authorities and hopes that the people who illegally used and/or facilitated the use of the services of the company will be duly prosecuted.\u201d The company did not say who was the subject of its criminal complaint, nor who were the named passengers on the aircraft leasing contracts. Ghosn, 65, who fled while on bail, is expected to speak to the media in Beirut on Wednesday, in a public appearance that could provide answers to myriad questions swirling around his escape. Ghosn arrived in Lebanon on Monday. The most widely circulated account, that he was carried out of his Tokyo residence in a wooden musical instrument case and departed on a private jet from Kansai airport in western Japan, has been challenged by his 53-year-old wife, Carole Ghosn. She described this as \u201cfiction\u201d but declined to provide details of her husband\u2019s escape. Ghosn issued a statement on Thursday denying that his wife or other family members had any involvement in the plot, which could place participants in legal peril. Speculation that they were involved was \u201cinaccurate and false\u201d, Ghosn said, adding: \u201cI alone arranged for my departure.

The security footage was taken by a camera installed at his house at about noon on Sunday, and the camera did not show him returning home, according to the Japanese broadcaster NHK. Ghosn\u2019s bail conditions included a requirement that his home be placed under 24-hour camera surveillance. NHK said the police suspected that Ghosn may have left his home to meet up with someone before heading to an airport. Lebanon received an Interpol arrest warrant for Ghosn on Thursday while Turkey has launched an investigation into his escape from Japan, via Istanbul. Ghosn, the former chair of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi carmaking alliance, was first arrested in November 2018 and has been charged with four counts of financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust. He has denied allegations that he understated his salary by tens of millions of dollars as head of Nissan, and that he used company funds to cover up personal investment losses.

Linked to the abolitionist and women\u2019s suffrage movements \u2013 with which it shared prominent intellectuals and overlapping leadership, including the likes of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B Anthony \u2013 the temperance movement was part of a mass mobilization of American women fighting for social change. Like the abolitionist and women\u2019s suffrage movements, temperance eventually achieved its political goal: for the 13 years of Prohibition, 1920 to 1933, the sale and consumption of alcohol was banned in the US.</p> <p>But unlike its sister struggles, the temperance movement now has a bit of a bad reputation. It is easy to see the woman-led, often explicitly religious movement as a group of reactionaries, attempting to impose moral obsequiousness on a public that did not share their values. In the end, Prohibition itself was an obscene failure: alcohol continued to be sold and consumed, and the government\u2019s vain attempts to enforce the ban on booze bred their own kinds of violence. The leaders of the movement were mocked as nagging housewives, out to ruin the fun. The temperance movement petered out, and is now remembered as a Pollyannaish bust.</p> <p>But the motivations and makeup of the temperance movement are more complicated than their simplified legacy would suggest. Rather than a regressive movement consumed with moralist disdain for alcohol use, many of its most ardent supporters wanted alcohol banned for a much more practical reason: women\u2019s safety. Drunk men, they observed, were more likely to sexually assault women, more likely to beat their wives and children, and more likely to subject passing women to sexual harassment. They didn\u2019t all see drunkenness as an offense to their Christian morality, although some of them did. For the most part, they saw male drunks as a threat to women\u2019s safety.</p> <p>In other words: temperance has come to be seen as a movement of nagging housemarms, but it could be better understood as a mass movement against domestic violence.</p> <p>Perhaps the feminist energy of the temperance movement is why the liquor industry lobbied so hard no only against the temperance movement, but against women\u2019s right to vote.

      "bodyText": "In October 2017, two years after her divorce and while recovering from a sudden break-up, Elizabeth Day took stock of her life. She was 38, \u201cnot an age at which I had anticipated being single, childless and facing an uncertain personal future\u201d. The award-winning novelist and journalist for the Observer decided to draw on her 17 years of experience interviewing celebrities to start a podcast in which she talked to people \u201cabout what they had learned from things going wrong\u201d. In an age obsessed with the \u201ccurated perfection\u201d of social media, people are loth to admit publicly to failures. But as Day increasingly realised in her own life, failure is \u201ca necessary staging post on a journey towards greater success\u201d. The podcast was called How to Fail With Elizabeth Day and it became an instant hit with listeners, clocking up 200,000 downloads after just eight episodes, as well as landing her a book deal. It was, Day admits, the most successful thing she had ever done, adding wryly: \u201cI\u2019m aware of the irony.\u201d Her book draws on her own challenges as well as those faced by her interviewees.

      "body": "<p>I started an apprenticeship on NBC Nightly News in July 2001. At that time, the programme was hosted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-brokaw\" title=\"\">Tom Brokaw</a>, a veteran newscaster and household name in the US. I was 23 and had grown up watching him with my family. I was a desk assistant, answering phones, opening the mail, logging tapes, whatever needed doing. I was in the newsroom on 9/11; as the second tower was hit, we all watched it happen live. The days after were emotional and exhausting, but our job was to report the news.</p> <p>About a week later, I was opening the mail when I came across a letter that looked as if it had been written by a child. Tom received a lot of mail: love letters, hate mail, gifts, faecal matter. A colleague and I would open it and give it to his assistant, Erin, who would write back on his behalf. This one immediately felt creepy.</p> <p>Inside was a note on a tiny piece of paper and a substance that looked like brown sugar and sand. The note had scribbly handwriting that said, \u201c09-11-01\u201d and in capital letters, \u201cThis is next, Take Penacilin [sic] now, Death to America, Death to Israel, Allah is great.\u201d</p> <p>I showed it to people around me and asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I put the substance in the bin and left the envelope and note on the mail pile in Erin\u2019s office. That night I went to my boyfriend\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>Ten days later, I woke up and my glands were so swollen that my chin disappeared. I had a high fever and a sensation of something running through my veins. I\u2019d recently started acne medication and thought maybe it was an allergic reaction. My doctor gave me antibiotics, and three days later I returned to work. </p> <p>Then, on 5 October, it was reported that Robert Stevens, a photojournalist at another media company, had died from inhalational anthrax. There were news reports about him having opened a love letter addressed to Jennifer Lopez. Around the same time, Erin had gone off sick, too. People at work talked about us both being off with bizarre symptoms, but it didn\u2019t click that it might be related to the letter. Unbeknown to me, Tom and Erin were tested for exposure to anthrax; it came back positive but they didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d been exposed to it.</p> <p>A couple of days later, I got a call saying I needed to come to the office asap. The urgency freaked me out and when I got in, I was told a black car was waiting to take me to be questioned by the FBI.</p> <p>The FBI interrogated me about everywhere I\u2019d been. They thought I could have had exposure to anthrax naturally (where it isn\u2019t usually harmful in low doses). It wasn\u2019t until towards the end of the conversation that I told them about the letter. It might seem obvious now that it was the source, but man-made weaponised anthrax wasn\u2019t something we knew about then. I was questioned for seven hours; I wasn\u2019t allowed to call my parents, who were watching TV reports about anthrax at NBC and couldn\u2019t get a hold of me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/04/experience-my-wife-lost-her-memory-while-giving-birth\">Experience: my wife lost her memory while giving birth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eventually I spoke to them, and my dad drove down to New York.

If your new year aim is to buck the national trend by not buying a suitcase-worth of new clothes \u2013 not to mention the new items to the value of \u00a39,000 that the average household wastes or doesn\u2019t use every year \u2013 mending skills may come in handy.

That said, any fist-sized, hard, round object will serve you just as well (a tennis ball, a small glass or a lightbulb, say \u2013 or, of course, a darning mushroom).</p> <p>Prioritise comfort and durability when choosing your yarn. As one knitter on Instagram, Chiara Quaglia (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/petulabuona/\" title=\"\">@petulabuona</a>), puts it: \u201cNo one wants a thick thing under the heel.\u201d If the hole is small, just loop up the dropped stitches around the hole, gently pull the yarn to close the gap, and knot. If the hole is large, or the sock is threadbare, you will need to do a spot of weaving to reinforce the knit.<strong> </strong>Before you run away in panic, this is easier than it sounds. There are cute little looms out there that make the job much easier, but anyone who advocates fixing stuff will tell you not to buy anything special. The DIY site <a href=\"https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-to-darn-a-sock-1106645\" title=\"\">the Spruce Crafts</a> has a detailed, step-by-step guide to weaving with a needle, while Instagram is awash with feet clad in socks<strong> </strong>so beautifully mended that they look like abstract art, proving that darning is best thought of as an opportunity, not a chore. Best of all, it works on any type of sock.</p> <h2>Shoes</h2> <p>Darning isn\u2019t only for socks. It can be used for any woven item \u2013 including trainers made from canvas or other fabrics. Last summer, the Colorado-based artist Brit Horsfall took on a friend\u2019s pair of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1FvHdPAreQ/\" title=\"\">bashed-up Toms trainers</a>; using seven constrasting threads \u2013 one for each hole \u2013 and sewing in tight squares, she created a beautifully patterned pair of shoes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1FvHdPAreQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Mending is a mindful practice, that highlights the imprint we leave on this world as we move through it. I\u2019ve said it before; life happens in our garments. Mending these felt like being a part of a slowly developing X-ray of the owners feet... in thread of course. Still so fun. If you have toms that need love, I\u2019d give them my all \u2728 I\u2019d like to see a few more of these happen and explore how peoples shoes and wear differ! . . . . #darnit #darning #mending #mendingmayhem #visiblemending #handsewn #handstitched #handmade #upcycle #menddontspend #betterthatnew #stoked #fiberartist #visibleclothingrepair #falltones #warms #artistsoninstagram #fiberarts</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brithorsfallart/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> brit horsfall</a> (@brithorsfallart) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-08-13T03:48:03+00:00\">Aug 12, 2019 at 8:48pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Flaunting what you can\u2019t hide is the basic principle behind visible mending. The textile practitioner Tom van Deijnen volunteers his sewing skills at the monthly <a href=\"https://brightonrepaircafe.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Brighton Repair Caf\u00e9</a>, which takes on everything from broken lawnmowers to fairy decorations in need of soldering. He has shown on Instagram just how beautifully you can repair shoes \u2013 for example, <a href=\"https://tomofholland.com/2017/08/04/cobbled-together/\" title=\"\">by darning the canvas panels on a pair of leather brogues with </a><a href=\"https://tomofholland.com/2017/08/04/cobbled-together/\" title=\"\">linen thread</a>.

Jo Elbourne, another textile artist, taught herself how to repair woven seats on wooden chairs when she came across a spool of rope in a charity shop (a third #visiblemending rule: always be on the lookout for secondhand materials). She says it is a great trial-and-error task: at worst, you undo what you have done and use the rope for something else; at best, you have a chair you can sit on again (if you have managed something sufficiently robust) or at least use for stashing books, towels or the day\u2019s clothes.</p> <h2>Baskets</h2> <p>For woven baskets \u2013 wicker, grasses, rope \u2013 minor breaks and splits can be darned or glued; use wood glue for wicker.

Hickman used a soldering iron (outdoors, she specifies, and not beneath a smoke detector) to do the job; David Kelly, a poster on the Q&amp;A site Quora, suggests running a metal drill bit in reverse and using the heat from the friction to melt a hole. Having unintentionally burned wood while trying to drill holes into it, I feel certain this would work. Only attempt any of this if you know what you are doing.</p> <h2>Leather</h2> <p>Katrina Cole, whose family has been in the business for many years, says a good leather or shearling garment or bag can become an heirloom if it is shown some love. First up, she says, invest in a tub of leather balm. It will remedy much of the loss of colour and softness caused by wear and humidity. Small tears \u2013 on a leather jacket, say \u2013 often don\u2019t need to be sewn at all. Instead, cut a piece of leather or fabric slightly larger than the tear, cover it with Copydex (latex-based rubber cement) or UHU glue (never superglue \u2013 that is a surefire way to ruin your item for good) and place it carefully, glue side up, behind the tear. Smooth down each side to stick it to the patch, making sure the edges meet tightly. If you need to do more, use a spearpoint needle and strong thread \u2013 any thread will do for fine leather, but double it up for something thicker.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An industrious weaver called Krysta Relyea recently wrote a post on Instagram saying she had just realised she owned enough pairs of jeans to get her through the rest of her life, provided she maintains her weight. \u201cOf course, patches and new zippers will be a must,\u201d she said. \u201cSome just need a little altering.\u201d Search the terms with which she tagged that nugget \u2013 including #buynothingnew, #visiblemending and #makedoandmend \u2013 and a world of possibility opens up. Whereas visibly repaired clothes might once have been considered a sign of not being able to afford new ones, the mending movement celebrates the ingenuity our forebears deployed to make old things last. If your new year aim is to buck the national trend by not buying a suitcase-worth of new clothes \u2013 not to mention the new items to the value of \u00a39,000 that the average household wastes or doesn\u2019t use every year \u2013 mending skills may come in handy. Here are a few to get you started. Socks My mother taught me how to do this using thin darning yarn (wool), a darning needle (a largish, blunt needle with an eye big enough to thread with wool) and a cowrie shell (I didn\u2019t grow up in the UK). That said, any fist-sized, hard, round object will serve you just as well (a tennis ball, a small glass or a lightbulb, say \u2013 or, of course, a darning mushroom). Prioritise comfort and durability when choosing your yarn. As one knitter on Instagram, Chiara Quaglia (@petulabuona), puts it: \u201cNo one wants a thick thing under the heel.\u201d If the hole is small, just loop up the dropped stitches around the hole, gently pull the yarn to close the gap, and knot. If the hole is large, or the sock is threadbare, you will need to do a spot of weaving to reinforce the knit. Before you run away in panic, this is easier than it sounds. There are cute little looms out there that make the job much easier, but anyone who advocates fixing stuff will tell you not to buy anything special. The DIY site the Spruce Crafts has a detailed, step-by-step guide to weaving with a needle, while Instagram is awash with feet clad in socks so beautifully mended that they look like abstract art, proving that darning is best thought of as an opportunity, not a chore. Best of all, it works on any type of sock. Shoes Darning isn\u2019t only for socks. It can be used for any woven item \u2013 including trainers made from canvas or other fabrics. Last summer, the Colorado-based artist Brit Horsfall took on a friend\u2019s pair of bashed-up Toms trainers; using seven constrasting threads \u2013 one for each hole \u2013 and sewing in tight squares, she created a beautifully patterned pair of shoes. Flaunting what you can\u2019t hide is the basic principle behind visible mending. The textile practitioner Tom van Deijnen volunteers his sewing skills at the monthly Brighton Repair Caf\u00e9, which takes on everything from broken lawnmowers to fairy decorations in need of soldering.

      "body": "<p>In 2013, the director <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4099092/\" title=\"\">Trey Edward Shults</a> got a call from a hospital in Missouri; his father was dying of pancreatic cancer. They hadn\u2019t spoken in a decade. His dad was an alcoholic and addict with a history of domestic violence. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t a part of my life. So you care, but you <em>don\u2019t</em>, if you know what I mean? You compartmentalise.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, his girlfriend persuaded him to drive to Missouri.

      "body": "<p>For a dizzying moment in the disorientated postwar era, cinema and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/federico-fellini\">Federico Fellini</a> put Rome at the centre of the world; now his early masterpiece from 1960, La Dolce Vita, is rereleased as part of a retrospective at London\u2019s BFI Southbank to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth. It\u2019s a film with Fellini\u2019s genius for revealing dreamlike and surreal images everywhere, especially that extraordinary image of Christ being helicoptered over the city, apparently on its way to be delivered to the pope.</p> <p>The movie finds Rome in a hysterical, excitable but also somehow desperate mood \u2013 the mood of \u201cIl Boom\u201d, that economic and cultural revival in which Italy was euphorically eager to forget the catastrophe of fascism and defeat, and to start all over again, in a headlong rush of modernity and excitement: movies, music, fashion and style. It is as if Rome\u2019s new contemporary sexiness and hedonism has revived the spirit of pre-Christian Rome and pagan ritual. But this coexists with a secret melancholy, a spiritual bust to go with the boom: ennui and fear.</p> <p>Marcello Mastroianni plays Marcello, a handsome and jaded gossip journalist who is a man about town, a night owl, a womaniser whose affairs drive his regular girlfriend Emma (Yvonne Furnaux) to despair. Most importantly, he is an <em>habitu\u00e9</em> of the fashionable Via Veneto, where Hollywood and Italian movie stars are routinely surrounded by aggressive photographers; here is where Marcello\u2019s own colleague, Paparazzo (Walter Santesso), gave the world a new word. (When Marcello addresses him crisply as \u201cPaparazzo!\u201d it now sounds accusing in an unintentional way.) For shooting nighttime scenes, Fellini created a gigantic full-scale replica of the Via Veneto at the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios, and Shawn Levy\u2019s book about Rome in this period, Dolce Vita Confidential, amusingly describes how Fellini came to prefer his own artificial Via Veneto \u2013 larger, straighter \u2013 to the real thing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BeWEPXWDX4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1BeWEPXWDX4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Marcello despises himself for having failed to write a novel, and he is actually acquainted with a serious and much-lauded writer known simply as Steiner (played by Alain Cuny), that name perhaps signalling a <em>Mitteleuropa\u00efsch</em> seriousness at odds with Rome\u2019s carefree world. It is Steiner who is to be the touchstone of Marcello\u2019s fragile idealism, his sense that he might one day make something of himself; and it is Steiner\u2019s awful fate that is to seal Marcello\u2019s disillusion: especially the way the paparazzi<em> </em>behave around his widow.</p> <p>Is Marcello a damned soul? There is a whiff of sulphur in his relationship with Maddalena (Anouk Aim\u00e9e), whose name perhaps recalls Mary Magdalene, especially when at the end of a long evening they go off together with a sex worker to her wretched apartment to have sex there, for the low-life thrills. (The woman hopes that Marcello might give her 2,000 lire in the morning; he does not.)</p> <p>Fellini contrives an amazing sequence when Marcello has to cover a spasm of religious hysteria when two children are reported to have had a vision of the Blessed Virgin: an impromptu media circus convenes as the sick and the disabled arrive en masse, hoping to be cured. And it is disturbing and even moving when Marcello\u2019s handsome and roguish old father (Annibale Ninchi) arrives in Rome without warning and Marcello takes him for a night on the town; the older man charms the local young women, one of whom \u2013 to Marcello\u2019s consternation and dismay \u2013 takes him home to her apartment. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a248424dbfbc1afdda7e01e7168ff765eb67e065\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a248424dbfbc1afdda7e01e7168ff765eb67e065/0_222_2723_1634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All roads lead to Rome \u2026 Yvonne Furneaux and Marcello Mastroianni in La Dolce Vita.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All roads lead to Rome \u2026 Yvonne Furneaux and Marcello Mastroianni in La Dolce Vita.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Pathe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is an excruciating and mortifying sequel as his father suffers some kind of medical crisis, brought on, we can only assume, by incautious exertion, or the prospect of exertion. Marcello has to come round to this woman\u2019s place to get him a taxi \u2013 having already confessed to a friend that he doesn\u2019t even know his father very well. He sees in him a picture of both his future and present self. (Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s ageing journalist Jep in his 2013 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/05/le-grande-bellezza-great-beauty-review\">The Great Beauty</a>, played by Toni Servillo, is in some way a conflation of Marcello and his father.) There is something so sad in it.</p> <p>An extended sequence in a 16th-century castle as the guest of a decadent and financially ruined aristocratic family is the prelude to a gloomy twilight of Marcello\u2019s self-respect. It is a comparable, lugubrious mood that Antonioni found in his movie La Notte a year later. More parties lead to that strange beach confrontation with the fish, a sea monster that is a portent of disaster.</p> <p>La Dolce Vita is widely remembered for Marcello gallantly disporting himself in the Trevi fountain with the visiting Hollywood diva Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), a scene that might be simply too preposterous, were it not for the inspired ending that Fellini conjures. Suddenly, like a hard cut, night turns to morning, like awakening from a dream, and the pair are still fully clothed in the fountain, blinking in the daylight. Have they really been like that, all night, or is the whole thing a dream? And the press interview scene is bizarre, with Sylvia asked whether she prefers pyjamas or a nightgown, or if she thinks neorealism is dead. </p> <p>Like the interview scenes in Godard\u2019s Breathless that same year, it shows a fascination with the theatre of celebrity. It is a brilliant film, but there is nothing sweet about it.</p> <p>\u2022 La Dolce Vita is rereleased in the UK on 3 January.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For a dizzying moment in the disorientated postwar era, cinema and Federico Fellini put Rome at the centre of the world; now his early masterpiece from 1960, La Dolce Vita, is rereleased as part of a retrospective at London\u2019s BFI Southbank to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth. It\u2019s a film with Fellini\u2019s genius for revealing dreamlike and surreal images everywhere, especially that extraordinary image of Christ being helicoptered over the city, apparently on its way to be delivered to the pope. The movie finds Rome in a hysterical, excitable but also somehow desperate mood \u2013 the mood of \u201cIl Boom\u201d, that economic and cultural revival in which Italy was euphorically eager to forget the catastrophe of fascism and defeat, and to start all over again, in a headlong rush of modernity and excitement: movies, music, fashion and style. It is as if Rome\u2019s new contemporary sexiness and hedonism has revived the spirit of pre-Christian Rome and pagan ritual. But this coexists with a secret melancholy, a spiritual bust to go with the boom: ennui and fear. Marcello Mastroianni plays Marcello, a handsome and jaded gossip journalist who is a man about town, a night owl, a womaniser whose affairs drive his regular girlfriend Emma (Yvonne Furnaux) to despair. Most importantly, he is an habitu\u00e9 of the fashionable Via Veneto, where Hollywood and Italian movie stars are routinely surrounded by aggressive photographers; here is where Marcello\u2019s own colleague, Paparazzo (Walter Santesso), gave the world a new word. (When Marcello addresses him crisply as \u201cPaparazzo!\u201d it now sounds accusing in an unintentional way.) For shooting nighttime scenes, Fellini created a gigantic full-scale replica of the Via Veneto at the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios, and Shawn Levy\u2019s book about Rome in this period, Dolce Vita Confidential, amusingly describes how Fellini came to prefer his own artificial Via Veneto \u2013 larger, straighter \u2013 to the real thing. Marcello despises himself for having failed to write a novel, and he is actually acquainted with a serious and much-lauded writer known simply as Steiner (played by Alain Cuny), that name perhaps signalling a Mitteleuropa\u00efsch seriousness at odds with Rome\u2019s carefree world. It is Steiner who is to be the touchstone of Marcello\u2019s fragile idealism, his sense that he might one day make something of himself; and it is Steiner\u2019s awful fate that is to seal Marcello\u2019s disillusion: especially the way the paparazzi behave around his widow. Is Marcello a damned soul? There is a whiff of sulphur in his relationship with Maddalena (Anouk Aim\u00e9e), whose name perhaps recalls Mary Magdalene, especially when at the end of a long evening they go off together with a sex worker to her wretched apartment to have sex there, for the low-life thrills. (The woman hopes that Marcello might give her 2,000 lire in the morning; he does not.) Fellini contrives an amazing sequence when Marcello has to cover a spasm of religious hysteria when two children are reported to have had a vision of the Blessed Virgin: an impromptu media circus convenes as the sick and the disabled arrive en masse, hoping to be cured. And it is disturbing and even moving when Marcello\u2019s handsome and roguish old father (Annibale Ninchi) arrives in Rome without warning and Marcello takes him for a night on the town; the older man charms the local young women, one of whom \u2013 to Marcello\u2019s consternation and dismay \u2013 takes him home to her apartment. There is an excruciating and mortifying sequel as his father suffers some kind of medical crisis, brought on, we can only assume, by incautious exertion, or the prospect of exertion. Marcello has to come round to this woman\u2019s place to get him a taxi \u2013 having already confessed to a friend that he doesn\u2019t even know his father very well. He sees in him a picture of both his future and present self. (Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s ageing journalist Jep in his 2013 film The Great Beauty, played by Toni Servillo, is in some way a conflation of Marcello and his father.) There is something so sad in it. An extended sequence in a 16th-century castle as the guest of a decadent and financially ruined aristocratic family is the prelude to a gloomy twilight of Marcello\u2019s self-respect. It is a comparable, lugubrious mood that Antonioni found in his movie La Notte a year later. More parties lead to that strange beach confrontation with the fish, a sea monster that is a portent of disaster. La Dolce Vita is widely remembered for Marcello gallantly disporting himself in the Trevi fountain with the visiting Hollywood diva Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), a scene that might be simply too preposterous, were it not for the inspired ending that Fellini conjures. Suddenly, like a hard cut, night turns to morning, like awakening from a dream, and the pair are still fully clothed in the fountain, blinking in the daylight. Have they really been like that, all night, or is the whole thing a dream? And the press interview scene is bizarre, with Sylvia asked whether she prefers pyjamas or a nightgown, or if she thinks neorealism is dead. Like the interview scenes in Godard\u2019s Breathless that same year, it shows a fascination with the theatre of celebrity. It is a brilliant film, but there is nothing sweet about it. \u2022 La Dolce Vita is rereleased in the UK on 3 January.",

      "bodyText": "Australian authorities have made a final plea for people to flee bushfire-affected areas in three states before the onset of extreme conditions so dangerous that firefighters may be unable to defend entire towns. On Friday, authorities in New South Wales urged people still in a 14,000 square kilometre area of the state\u2019s south coast, and in other high risk areas in the Snowy Valley, to leave overnight. In Victoria \u2013 where there are grave fears for 28 people still missing in the East Gippsland region \u2013 authorities have sent 250,000 text messages to people in affected shires and urged them to evacuate. Late on Friday, authorities said 3.5% of the Victorian landmass had been affected by fire. Both NSW and Victoria have enacted emergency measures that give firefighting authorities the power to forcibly relocate people if necessary. In South Australia, warnings have been issued for two fires on Kangaroo Island, which firefighters have said they cannot prevent from spreading. SA country fire service chief officer Mark Jones said he would be \u201castonished\u201d if homes were not already lost. Forecasters have predicted temperatures in the mid-40Cs on Saturday for some parts of south-east Australia. The fire danger will be increased by strong winds. On Friday, the military continued evacuations of the Victorian inlet of Mallacoota, where about 4,000 people were trapped by a fire that reached the edge of the township and blocked their exit. Most were being taken on a 17-hour voyage by ship to the HMAS Cerberus naval base at Western Port. The defence forces have also been dropping supplies to communities isolated by active firegrounds. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, toured an evacuation centre in Victoria on Friday as he faced heavy criticism for his response to the escalating and unprecedented bushfire crisis. On Thursday night, Morrison was given a hostile reception in the NSW town of Cobargo, where he was heckled by people who had lost their homes. On Friday, the former NSW fire commissioner Greg Mullins compared the prime minister\u2019s response to the bushfires to Donald Trump\u2019s response to mass shootings. \u201cPeople are angry, and ... if people want to direct that at me, that is up to them,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that will distract me. It is something that I will empathise with. It is something that I understand. It\u2019s not something for me to take personally. \u201cThis is not about any one individual, not me or anyone else. We all have to a job do.\u201d NSW authorities have warned some towns, including the apple-growing hub of Batlow, may be \u201cundefendable\u201d in the extreme conditions and that in those circumstances firefighters may allow properties to burn rather than risk attempting to contain the fire. \u201cWe are unfortunately very likely to lose homes tomorrow but we will be very happy and call it a success if there are no lives lost,\u201d the NSW rural fire service deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers, said. \u201cThat is a single focus tomorrow and we need the community to have the focus as well.\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, held a press conference on Friday afternoon to tell people on the south coast and in other affected areas that by Saturday morning it would be too late to leave. \u201cThere is a window until tonight, for people to get out and we encourage them to do so, please do not stay in the area unless you absolutely have to,\u201d she said. People on the south coast continued to report heavy delays in leaving the area, and long queues to buy petrol and other supplies. There are additional concerns for mountainous areas in NSW and Victoria, where people in the Kosciuszko national park and the Victorian alpine region have been told to evacuate. Fires continued to burn uncontrolled and bushfire smoke continues to shroud a massive area. Air quality in Canberra again ranked among the poorest in the world on Friday, thanks to smoke from the bushfires. The national fire season has claimed at least 19 lives and destroyed more than 1,500 homes. The land mass burned is now above 5m hectares \u2013 an area larger than the Netherlands or Denmark.",

      "bodyText": "We will leave our live coverage of the Australian bushfires there for today. Here is how things currently stand: Thousands of people have evacuated from north-east Victoria, East Gippsland, and the south coast of NSW. Police have powers to compel people to leave in Victoria under the state of disaster declaration, but they have said they will not force people to leave. It is the largest peacetime evacuation in Australian history. Residents and tourists who remain in East Gippsland, north-east Victoria, the south coast of NSW and the Shoalhaven region have been warned they could face extreme, unpredictable and potentially fatal bushfires. They have been told to get out tonight. Fire authorities in both NSW and Victoria say they will have no ability to control fires burning tomorrow. The death toll from the fires since 30 December has risen to 10, with two people confirmed dead in Victoria and eight dead in NSW. Twenty-eight people remain unaccounted for in East Gippsland. Two bushfires burning out of control in Kangaroo Island in South Australia are expected to cause significant property damage, including to the infrastructure in the Forest Chase national park. The main road into Western Australia from the eastern states, the Eyre highway, remains cut off due to bushfire and is not expected to open until at least Monday, prompting concerns that WA could run out of some supplies. Prime minister Scott Morrison has brushed off criticism of his leadership following damning footage of a visit to bushfire victims in Cobargo, NSW on Thursday, saying it he does not take it personally and it was \u201cnot about [him]\u201d. Morrison said he was \u201cinclined not to proceed\u201d with a planned visit to India later this month, hours after confirming that he would still go. Our live coverage will resume tomorrow morning. In the meantime: please stay safe and ensure you are following the emergency alerts for your region. Tomorrow promises to be a very difficult day, and we want to see you all at the other side of it. This is the full quote that Scott Morrison says is being taken out of context, helpfully put in context by Amy Remeikis. Scott Morrison says he tried in \u2018good faith\u2019 to comfort bushfire victims Asked if he thought, in retrospect, that it was odd that he picked up people\u2019s hands to shake them, Scott Morrison said he tried in \u201cgood faith\u201d to offer comfort. He said that some people were more standoffish than others and \u201cI understand that, it\u2019s a. very emotional time. You seek to try and in good faith, and in good will. He said his comment that Australians during these \u201cterrible events\u201d would be \u201cinspired by the great feats of our cricketers\u201d had been \u201ctaken a bit out of context.\u201d Asked if he wished he had responded differently to the bushfires, Morrison said it is \u201cnot about me,\u201d it was about people on the ground. That\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on. Not on the other issues. That\u2019s for others to Twitter about. That\u2019s for others to Twitter about. He said comments from former fire chiefs that they had not been listened to were \u201cnot true.\u201d Those fire chiefs said the Coalition ignored their advice because it concerned the climate emergency. Morrison said he was listening to the fire chiefs \u201cthat are in their jobs now.\u201d Then came this abrupt exchange. Leila McKinnon: Have you been working the phones trying to get more resources from overseas? Morrison: Of course. McKinnon: Can we expect any more planes? Morrison: Yes. McKinnon asked when those planes would arrive. Morrison didn\u2019t really answer. And then the interview was over. Scott Morrison is giving an interview with A Current Affair right now and repeating the line that his response to the bushfire crisis is \u201cnot about me.\u201d The first question, from host Leila McKinnon, does not pull any punches. McKinnon: People didn\u2019t even want to shake your hand out there, do you feel that you have lost the respect of Australians? Morrison says that people are \u201creally hurting\u201d in fire zones, and he has visited many fire zones and attempted to offer comfort. That offer of comfort has received \u201cdifferent receptions wherever you go\u201d, he says. He says the people of Cobargo were feeling \u201cvery raw\u201d and he tries not to \u201ctake any of that personally\u201d. Jenny and I went to [offer comfort] and some didn\u2019t want to. Some did. McKinnon asks if Morrison regrets walking away from 20-year-old Zoey Salucci-McDermott, who said she would only shake his hand if he increased funding to the RFS. Morrison repeated a claim he made earlier today, which we put to Salucci-McDermott and she disputed. Said Morrison: Zoey and I did speak, actually, of her concerns about and she did raise the issue the level of support for the RFS. Morrison said he told her he would pass her concerns on. There are community meetings up and down the east coast tonight, ahead of extreme bushfire conditions tomorrow. While we wait for that interview, a reminder that this happened today. Where the bloody hell was he? Political reporter Amy Remeikis has written a day-by-day account of prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s activities in the past eight days, tracking his diary \u2014 which included engagements like the New Year\u2019s Day Cricket Australia-McGrath Foundation reception at Kirribilli house \u2014 alongside bushfire developments. Morrison is giving an interview to A Current Affair in a few moments. We\u2019ll bring that to you as it happens. Cobargo resident to PM: \u2018Be a leader\u2019 A woman who lives in Cobargo has driven a 100km round trip to Bega today to upload a video to social media demanding that prime minister Scott Morrison show leadership and offer immediate assistance to Cobargo and other towns in the bushfire crisis. Ronnie Ayliffe is the sister of Mark Ayliffe, the Cobargo RFS captain. She says Mark was concerned that the criticism of Morrison by locals in Cobargo during his whistle-stop tour yesterday meant that he had lost his opportunity to ask \u2014 and receive \u2014 federal assistance in fighting the fires. \u201c[My brother] is a shell of a human being, he is hanging on by a thread,\u201d Ayliffe said. \u201cHe holds the burden of everything that is lost on his own shoulders, and yet he has done a job that generals couldn\u2019t do. He has been extraordinary and I want you, the world, to know that. She continues: Yesterday, Mr Scott Morrison, prime minister of our nation came to visit Mark. And Mark thought this will be a lovely time that I can ask for help. Please help us. Help us to fight this again, help us to rebuild, help us with generators and fuel and... help us, help us. But then this happened. And Ayliffe said her brother was concerned that his only opportunity to ask for help had passed. But I don\u2019t think asking nicely is going to get us anywhere... the only way we are going to get anything is if you, the world, demand it. Tell Mr Morrison to help us. And not just Cobargo \u2014 but especially Cobargo \u2014 but everyone impacted by these fires. Help us in the immediate sense with things that will help us to survive this. Good god, we\u2019ve got no power, we\u2019ve got no telecommunications, we have got nothing but death and destruction.... Demand it. Tell him to be a leader. Tell him he has to help all of the people affected by fires. The time for being nice and asking nicely is over. I want you, the world, to demand it. Don\u2019t forget us. Ayliffe lives at Sams Creek, which is just outside Cobargo. She said she has spent the past few days shoring up protections around her house, but did not believe she would be able to save it. Tomorrow [the fire is] going to come with a ferocity that\u2019s going to take your face off, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to have a house. There is a community meeting and bushfire briefing in Narooma on the NSW south coast tonight. ABC reporter Melissa Clarke is there, and shared this practical, yet chilling, advice. There has been a lot of discussion over the past week about hazard reduction burns. Specifically, whether more hazard reduction burns could have prevented the current bushfire crisis, and whether hazard reduction burns have been prevented by \u201cgreen tape.\u201d I thought I would draw attention to this thread from environmental scientist Cormac Farrell, who works in bushfire prevention and is also the Australian Parliament\u2019s head beekeeper. He says, basically, that community safety trumps environmental concerns when it comes to hazard reduction burns. So if burns are happening less often it\u2019s because it is not safe to do so, not because greenies are blocking them. I\u2019ve also seen some discussion about fuel reduction burn targets being abandoned. I\u2019ve spoken to fire authorities in Victoria and Tasmania about this before, and the consensus wisdom is that the targets do not work because the easiest way to meet a target is to lob blazeballs out of a helicopter and burn a big bit of bush in the middle of a state forest or national park. That will hit the five or 10% fuel reduction target, but will not necessarily be the kind of targeted hazard protection that actually makes the community safer. Conditions appear to be worsening in East Gippsland. The town of Bruthen, east of Bairnsdale, has just been ordered to evacuate. And there\u2019s a new emergency warning for the northern parts of East Gippsland, near Goongerah. This is what residents are being told on the south coast of NSW. Tourists have been strongly advised for two days to get out \u2014 they should already have left. Speaking of sport, the fire alarms at Melbourne\u2019s AAMI Park seem to have been set off by the bushfire smoke that has settled over the city. Earlier, Victorian authorities said the air quality in the city was \u201cvery poor\u201d to \u201chazardous\u201d. The A-League match between Melbourne City and Western United is due to start at 7.30pm. Tennis Australia announces exhibition match Let\u2019s do a round-up of sports-bodies and persons raising money for bushfire relief. Tennis Australia has announced it will host an exhibition match at Rod Laver Arena on 15 January to raise money for the Red Cross bushfire appeal. It\u2019s also donating the profits from a Jessica Mauboy concert, scheduled for 19 January, and pledged $1m to help rebuild tennis facilities in bushfire affected communities. The idea of a charity exhibition match was raised by Nick Krygios, who has encouraged a flood of donations and offers of support from other athletes. The AFL has also said it will raise funds for bushfire relief. CEO Gillion McLauchlan said in a statement today that the organisation was working on a coordinated response to support fundraising efforts. Nathan Buckley has also said... this: This is the map of predicted fire spread in NSW that deputy commissioner Rob Rogers was speaking about earlier. The red zones are areas where the fire is expected to grow, the crosshatched areas are areas of potential ember attack. But, as noted earlier, this only covers existing fires. New fires \u2014 and with extreme to catastrophic conditions throughout southeast NSW, you can bet on new fires starting \u2014 could occur outside of these highlighted areas. Here is the video of that interview with Zoey Salucci-McDermott, the pregnant 20-year-old woman at Cobargo who refused to shake prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s hand. There has been a bit of inconsistency with the spelling of Zoey\u2019s name, but it is with a -y. Apologies if we got that wrong before. Local fire chief for PM: a report from the gridlocked NSW south coast Guardian Australia\u2019s investigations editor Anne Davies is among those who have been trying to leave the south coast of NSW, following the advice of NSW fire services. She has filed this dispatch: People have spent 24 hours sleeping in their cars in the hope of being allowed to leave with police escorts in groups of 20 to 50. The evacuation stopped for the an hour and a half mid afternoon after the fire flared and trees fell across the road but was underway again this afternoon. Bendalong and Manyana are now one of the few coastal towns, along with Sussex Inlet in the Shoalhaven that still has unburned bush. Loved for its forests that stretch down to the beach, the fire has now ringed the villages, in some places burning just 200 meters from houses. No one is confident about what will happen on Saturday. The forecast is for catastrophic fire danger high temperatures and strong winds. If it reaches the crowns of the towering gums, it will burn all the way to the beach. With 700 people in the caravan park and another 4000 in houses- all without electricity for four days, the Rural Fire Service made it clear they wanted everyone to leave if possible. Sheridan O\u2019Donnell From Newcastle, and Louie Racht from Sydney had been staying with their families in Bendalong. They were fourth in the line to exit, when the Guardian visited early this afternoon. They had been been there for 24 hours. Luckily their house was so close they could sleep there but had spent hours waiting in the line of nearly 400 vehicles. \u201cCan we just give a shout out to Peter Jackson from Austinmer Rural Fire Service,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell. \u201cHe was just here on holidays like us. Now he\u2019s our kids\u2019 new hero.\u201d Jackson took charge of the evacuation plan, providing the daily briefings and managing the flow of cars. \u201cHe\u2019s the sort of leader we need. Peter Jackson for PM,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. Rob Rogers also spoke at that press conference about the risk that fires on either side of the Victoria/NSW border could merge. That\u2019s the Corryong fire, on the Victorian side of the border, and the Tumbaruma fire on the NSW side. There is a risk that the smoke columns for those fires could be drawn together, as happened with the two largest fires in East Gippsland on Monday, and cause the fires to merge. Depending on winds, that could send it back toward Thredbo and Perisher Valley, and even the ACT. Earlier in that press conference, premier Gladys Berejiklian was asked whether NSW had been offered assistance from the ADF to help evacuate the south coast, or whether that assistance had been denied. She said: We have accepted all assistance that we need and continue to do so. Another reporter asked deputy RFS commissioner Rob Rogers if he agreed with comments from former fire chief Greg Mullins, who said this morning that the prime minister should call in additional aerial support from Europe. Rogers says he does not agree with Mullins, and they do not require more aircraft. We have the resources we want.... There is a limit to how many aircraft can safely operate over fire grounds. Many of these fire grounds, we have difficulty getting any aircraft in when they have been aircraft available [because of the smoke] Rogers said there were national arrangements for sharing aircraft and other resources with other states and territories and he was \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with those arrangements. Rob Rogers says that some areas of NSW are going to reach catastrophic fire danger ratings tomorrow. It is not widespread enough to bump a whole region up from extreme to catastrophic, but he says the RFS will be preparing for catastrophic conditions. The fire danger rating for the southeastern corner of NSW on Saturday is extreme. Rogers says: Whatever the rating is, it\u2019s going to be a pretty bad day. The cool change, which is forecast to come through Victoria and East Gippsland around midday, will not reach those areas of NSW until very late at night, or even after midnight. That is much later than the change came through on New Year\u2019s Eve. And the later the change, the worse the conditions. I was talking to the bureau earlier and they are suggesting it could be delayed further, the change, and every time it is delayed, the fire danger gets higher and higher, so we will be watching closely. RFS deputy commissioner Rob Rogers says that NSW is likely to lose more homes tomorrow. More than 1,200 houses have already been destroyed throughout the state so far this fire season. We are unfortunately very likely to lose homes tomorrow but we will be very happy and call it a success if there are no lives lost. That is a single focus tomorrow and we need the community to have the focus as well, and then obviously, call for help when you need it, 000, life-threatening only. Rogers says there are five areas of concern: the Shoalhaven region, the south coast from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border, the Snowy Valley area, the Blue Mountains, and the NSW north coast. There will be 3,000 fires and 700 aircraft fighting fires around the state and an additional 650 fire fighters and 150 fire appliances standing by as surge capacity. Rogers says he thinks that most communities in that at-risk area would be aware of the risk, and the recommendation to leave. He said anyone who ignores that advice to leave must take responsibility for their own safety. We are giving them information and being honest about the risk, but if people choose to stay, then that is on them. I guess what they have to do is understand that if they choose to do that, do not expect there will be a fire truck if you ring, make sure you understand that you are likely to be stuck there for some time and the last thing you should do is suddenly change your mind at the last minute. Unfortunately, we have seen people caught in cars and that is fatal. Been caught in a car is only slightly better than being caught on foot. Cars are not safe places to be. Four of those confirmed dead in the NSW south coast fires since New Year\u2019s Eve were found in cars. NSW: leave tonight from all at-risk fire regions NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is holding a press conference in Sydney. She says there is still a window for people leaving the south coast to leave the area via the Princes Highway, which has been opened to allow thousands of people to leave. There is a window until tonight, for people to get out and we encourage them to do so, please do not stay in the area unless you absolutely have to. RFS deputy commissioner Rob Rogers says that people in the area of concern, which is almost the entirety of the south coast of NSW, from Nowra down, need to leave tonight \u2014 they cannot wait until tomorrow morning. I would also say to you, and we ask for an early morning leave, that didn\u2019t happen on New Year\u2019s Eve, so what we\u2019re saying to people is be out of those areas tonight, and we\u2019re just saying go somewhere that isn\u2019t in one of those areas, go to an area that has been burnt out already, towards the beach areas, make sure that you are not in that area when those winds come in tomorrow morning, and the temperature start elevating. These fires can move frighteningly quickly, and unfortunately we had homes being alight at 3.30am, and we had people ringing 000 saying they were trapped already, in the early morning, and that is not the way people want to be woken up so we need people to be safe. The Bureau of Meteorology has released a weather update for tomorrow, focusing on the fire danger. Mt Hotham resort closed due to fires The Mt Hotham resort has been closed due to worsening bushfire conditions in the northeast, chief executive Jon Hutchins says. A small team of \u201cessential staff\u201d will remain \u201cfor asset protection and to support our local CFA staff\u201d. They will use snowmaking equipment to protect key assets from fire, if required. Mt Hotham is within the area declared a state of disaster in Victoria. All visitors to the mountain have left, Hutchins says, and anyone planning on visiting the area has been urged to stay away. There are some smaller fires burning in the area already, and it is northeast of the 200,000 hectare Barmouth-Spur fire, the largest of the 550,000 hectare fires burning in East Gippsland. Mt Hotham is already cut off to the south by closures to the Great Alpine Road, which has been closed since 21 December, and the Dargo High Plains Road, which is also closed due to fire. The Bogong High Plains Road and the Benambra-Corryong Road are also closed. The young woman who refused Scott Morrison\u2019s handshake has spoken to the media. Zoey Salucci-McDermott, 20, told the Ten Network that the encounter with the prime minister left her \u201cin shock\u201d and broke her heart. Salucci-McDermott, who is 28 weeks pregnant, told the PM she would not shake his hand until he promised more funding for the rural fire service. In footage of the encounter, which has been beamed around the world, the prime minister is seen taking Salucci-McDermott\u2019s hand anyway after she declines his handshake, before turning his back and walking away. Salucci-McDermott, who lost her home in the fires, told Ten: \u201cIt broke my heart, I would have happily sat down and had a cuppa with him if he\u2019d just asked if I was okay.\u201d \u201cI told him it was a war zone, and he walked away, and it broke my heart. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything but stand there.\u201d She added that she thought Morrison\u2019s visit was insincere but also wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt at first. \u201cWhen we saw him turn up he was originally taking photos with whoever wanted to take photos ... So I felt it was insincere but I don\u2019t like to judge a book by its cover,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did come up because he did obviously saw I had a child and was obviously pregnant. He came up to us and just went to shake my hand. I said, \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 You know all that. You saw the video. \u201cAnd with the walking away, he wasn\u2019t here to help us, was he?\u201d On Friday, Morrison claimed he had discussed funding for fire services with Salucci-McDermott when asked why he had turned away from her. Guardian Australia understands there was no further conversation, beyond that shown in the footage. CFS chief officer Mark Jones said he \u201csincerely hoped\u201d there were no people remaining on the western half of Kangaroo Island. I hope there are none. If we knew of them, we would be urging them to leave, and we have given lots of warnings, used every method at our disposal to encourage people not to be in the western part of Kangaroo Island and I sincerely hope \u2014 other than people that are firefighting \u2014 that they have left. We have no reports of injuries yet to either firefighters or members of the public. If you do not need to be on Kangaroo Island, SA premier Steven Marshall said, they should avoid the area today. As the mayor of Kangaroo Island, Peter Clements, just told ABC24, it\u2019s \u201ca bugger of a day\u201d. He said he expected the fire to burn through the entirety of the Flinders Chase national park, which takes up the southwest corner of the island. Clements said anyone who remained in the western area of the island were \u201cbloody idiots\u201d. We\u2019re jumping states again to South Australia, which is experiencing today that extreme fire weather followed by a gusty wind change that Victoria and NSW are forecast to get tomorrow. Country Fire Service chief officer Mark Jones said the biggest threat at the moment is to Kangaroo Island. About 150 firefighters are battling blazes in the west and southwest of the island, and Jones said he was disappointed that many did not heed warnings to leave the island. Is disappointing to me to note that reports are coming back that some people did not heed the warnings to leave early, for some of those people it may be too late and we urge them to seek a place of safety. Both fires have breached control lines, and fire danger indexes for the island \u201cgreatly exceeded those predicted\u201d. In some good news, the Cudlee Creek fire, which did run today, is being contained. Jones said he expects homes will have been lost on Kangaroo Island today. I would be astonished if homes were not lost, it has covered such a large proportion of the western side [of the island], and it has burned so fiercely that I would be surprised if nothing has been lost. We have no confirmed details of this point. 95% of ACT firefighters returned home ahead of extreme conditions To the ACT now, where the chief minister, Andrew Barr, is addressing the media about their fire preparations. There is no fire in the ACT at the moment but fires in NSW, particularly the Kosciuszko National Park, are close. Barr says 95% of ACT firefighting resources have been returned to the territory ahead of the fire threat tomorrow. Canberra is also a landing point for those who have evacuated from the NSW south coast. The respite centre in Dickson has been up and running for close to 24 hours now. A small number of people have already accessed the facility, and we will continue to run this centre 24 hours a day whilst it is needed. Barr said he recognised that people were anxious about the possibility of evacuations in the ACT itself, if fire starts, and preparations were in place to stand up an evacuation centre at short notice if needed. He said the best way for people to help those affected by bushfires was to donate to the Red Cross. We are aware many Canberrans want to provide assistance to victims of bushfires who may be entering into the ACT and this is greatly appreciated. But I\u2019ve been asked by the team at the respite centre...that further support is not required at this stage. ...If you do want to do something, make a donation to the Red Cross appeal. The Government has already made a donation and we encourage people to do so via the Red Cross website. Steve Warrington, the chief officer of the Victorian Country Fire Authority, has toured fire-affected areas at Sarsfield near Bairnsdale and is addressing the media in Bairnsdale now. He says that 3.5% of the state has been affected by fire, but the most significant impact has been on the loss of lives and homes. We have 3.5% of the Victoria landmass impacted now by fire. I can talk to you about 800,000 hectares of fire if you like and can give you all those facts and figures. But when you go into these communities and you see one house or you speak to one community member, and you realise the impact that every one of these has. There is life lost here. There are houses destroyed right across this part of the state, and indeed in the north-east, it really brings home to you the impact that this has had right at the community level. Wairewa, 50km east of Bairnsdale, lost 11 of its 22 homes. Buchan lost 24 homes. Firefighting efforts were focused on saving the centre of Buchan, so the property losses are on the outskirts. Warrington urged people to think seriously about the prospect that their home could burn down \u2014 not just feel bad for those who lost everything but assume it would never happen to them. Think about it \u2013 where are you going to live if you don\u2019t have your home? Where are you going to have your loved ones, where are your pets going to go? What about your collectables, your photos, your family emblems, etcetera? It is the whole emotion. He says even experienced firefighters are scared. I\u2019ve had a good career captain saying, \u2018Hey, we were really scared. The noise of the thing coming up the hill towards us.\u2019 I had many people say, \u2018I always had a plan to defend and stay. I\u2019ll never do it again.\u2019 Trade in shares of Kangaroo Island Plantation Timber has been halted until next Tuesday while the company assesses the damage of fires that have already destroyed more that 13% of its forests. The company, which grows blue gum and pine trees, has been battling fires on Kangaroo Island, south-west of Adelaide, since before Christmas. South Australia\u2019s Country Fire Service has declared an emergency on the island, where two fires are burning. Just yesterday, KIPT said it would try to salvage wood from the areas that have already burned by bringing forward harvesting. The areas so far known to be burned were worth about $20m, KIPT said. Smoke from the bushfires is affecting air quality in Melbourne. EPA Victoria says the air quality is poor; at that press conference at the state control centre just now the report was \u201chazardous to poor\u201d air quality in Melbourne and as far west as Geelong. A statewide air quality warning was issued just after 2.11pm. If your maximum visibility is 1.5km, the alert says, \u201cyour air quality is in the hazardous level, and you need to limit your time outdoors, limit exercise, and follow any treatment plans.\u201d Granger reiterated that people in the at risk areas of East Gippsland and northeast Victoria should leave. If they value their safety they must leave. I\u2019d suggest personal belongings are of very, very little value in these circumstances. These are dire circumstances, there is no doubt. Andrew Crisp said he had been told by the incident controller in Gippsland that there were a lot of people on the road, apparently leaving the area. Guardian Australia has been told by people on in northeast Victoria that there has been a steady exodus of people from the alpine region and into Wangaratta. Mick Granger says that the numbers of those declared deceased and unaccounted for in the East Gippsland fires have not changed. As of this morning, that\u2019s two men confirmed deceased and 28 people unaccounted for. Granger asked for patience in tracking down those missing people and confirming what has happened to them, and said that number could fluctuate. We have very, very hot fire zones. We have areas that have been damaged by fire but are not safe to proceed into. So those numbers will jump up, up and down, in respect to the missing persons, the unaccounted for persons. So I just ask for your patience. Our process will be to validate that someone is listed as missing or unaccounted for and making inquiries, when it is safe to do so, to locate those persons. He said that police had been working to get into other isolated communities, on top of Mallacoota, to ensure they\u2019re aware of the recommendation to evacuate. Satellite phones have been delivered to many isolated communities so they are no longer cut off. Mick Granger from Victoria Police says that 1,200 people are being evacuated from Mallacoota by sea today, and will make the 16-hour voyage to Hastings, which is a deepwater port on the Mornington Peninsula. \u201cWe know that one of the ADF vessels has left Mallacoota and they\u2019re in the process of loading about 1,100 people onto a second vessel that\u2019ll leave later this afternoon,\u201d Granger said. Another three dozen people or so have been airlifted from Mallacoota to Sale. They are people considered to be at the greatest health risk. Richard Russell, from the Bureau of Meteorology, says Victoria will experience \u201cstrong, hot dry, north to north-westerly winds\u201d in the fire zone ahead of a south-westerly change tomorrow. That change will reach Melbourne about 8am, and East Gippsland around midday, bringing gusty south-westerly winds. This is a similar weather pattern to Monday, but the change on Monday came through much later. It was also held back by the smoke column from the East Gippsland fires, which generated its own weather and held back the winds. You also see some swirling winds while the change comes through. Temperatures before the wind change are forecast to be very hot \u2014 up to 46C in Albury, near the Tallangatta fires. Andrew Crisp warns that new fires could start at any time, anywhere in Victoria. It\u2019s not enough to just look at the fires that are already burning and decide you are safe, he said. The risk is any \u2018new starts\u2019. We saw that in the lead-up to last weekend...we gave the community an idea of where we believed the fires would travel, the East Gippsland fire. But we had the Mallacoota fire, and what the Mallacoota fire did was actually block the Princes Highway. So that\u2019s why the message at the moment is very much about if you can get out, you must get out now because, who knows, there could be further fires start this afternoon or even tomorrow and cut further roads. So it will be too late to leave. Crisp said that people in Victoria had a \u201cshared responsibility\u201d to stay informed about any fires or potential fires in their area, and stay safe. We want you to do what you can to look after yourselves and, in the long-term, make things easy for our fire and emergency services when they have to work in these particular areas. Victorian emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp is speaking now at the state control centre in Melbourne. He is providing an update on the fire situation, heading into extreme fire conditions tomorrow. Crisp says: We literally have hundreds and hundreds of kilometres of active reach, of uncontained fire. So that\u2019s the situation we find ourselves in at the moment. What we\u2019re experiencing is our state is drying out well and truly and we\u2019ve got warmer weather... But we\u2019ll see some northerly winds come through tomorrow, we will see a change come through. We will speak to that in more detail but what that means for us is elevated fire conditions. Crisp says the key message from the declaration of a state of natural disaster is that people in affected areas \u2014 that\u2019s Gippsland and the North East \u2014 need to get out. We went out last night with some strong message that if you\u2019re in that area, you should be getting out. This video, released by authorities in Victoria, gives a sense of the scale of the bushfires burning in East Gippsland. It was filmed from a helicopter with a thermal camera. The bright white bits are the fire. There are five \u2018evacuate now\u2019 warnings in Victoria at the moment The most recent warning to evacuate was issued for Bessiebelle in western Victoria, in areas south of the Budj Bim national park and Aboriginal heritage landscape, at 2.33pm. There\u2019s an out of control bushfire in the national park, which is burning in a southerly direction. The other \u201cevacuate now\u201d warnings are for Boggy Creek and Bullumwall in East Gippsland, which are under threat from the fire burning at Mount Taylor, north of Bairnsdale; and for two areas in the north-east, near Tallangatta along the Murray Valley Highway, and at Towong, which is threatened by the Walwa fire. If you are in Victoria or travelling through Victoria, it\u2019s a good idea to install the Vic Emergency app and set up your area of concern. You\u2019ll then get alerts to your phone whenever a new warning comes through. If you are travelling into an area without phone reception, or if you lose phone or internet, tune into ABC local radio. Scott Morrison has just given an interview on ABC Radio in Victoria. He says the national security committee of cabinet will now meet tomorrow. The PM had said yesterday it would meet on Monday, which drew criticism from Anthony Albanese today. Asked why the delay to Monday, Morrison replied: \u201cThey are meeting tomorrow.\u201d The prime minister, who is in Victoria today, also gave more details about the defence force\u2019s involvement in the fire effort. He said 100 defence force reservists had now signed up to take part in ADF-led operations. When the Victorian government asks for more assistance, \u201cwe will keep saying yes every time\u201d, Morrison said. There has been some movement in the Currowan fire at Shoalhaven. Good afternoon everyone. I am taking over our live coverage from Helen Davidson. Scott Morrison has just been on radio in Melbourne. We\u2019ll bring you what he said shortly. If you want to send us information directly, you can reach me on Twitter @callapilla or at calla.wahlquist@theguardian.com This report is from NITV\u2019s Madeline Hayman-Reber. You can read the full story here. The Yuin community is in mourning after fires engulfed the coastal village of Mogo, destroying the homes of five members of the Mogo Local Aboriginal Land Council, along with the building itself. CEO Linda Carlson described what it was like to helplessly watch the fire in the moments before the entire town was wiped out as \u201cterrifying\u201d. \u201cI was in Batemans Bay and I just saw this fireball coming and it was heading straight for Mogo and I thought that whole village is gone,\u201d Ms Carlson told NITV News on Friday. One of the buildings razed housed the Mogo Aboriginal Land Council. \u201cI nearly cried. The people are just traumatised for their houses. There were some local members who rescued other family members and took them to safety,\u201d Ms Carlson said. \u201cThey were driving through walls of fire to get out of there when they reached a point of no return.\u201d The pregnant woman who refused to shake the prime minister\u2019s hand during a photo opportunity at Cobargo says she lost everything in the fires that ravaged the town on New Year\u2019s Eve. Scott Morrison was met with heckling and abuse on Thursday night as angry locals told him they were unsatisfied with the response to fires that destroyed their town. In footage that quickly went viral, Zoey is seen shaking Morrison\u2019s hand before saying she would only do so if the prime minister provided more funding for the Rural Fire Service. The prime minister took her hand anyway and then is seen walking away without saying anything further. In a post on Facebook, Zoey wrote: \u201cI have lost everything I own.\u201d She later added: \u201cMy house is burnt to the ground the prime minister turned his back on me.\u201d Asked by a reporter how he could claim to being offering support when he walked away from the woman, Morrison replied: \u201cI stood there with the same lady you\u2019re referring to. \u201cWe talked about what she was asking there, which was greater support for the firefighting effort in that part of New South Wales. So we talked about that.\u201d Conditions have forced closures and cancellations of attractions and events in Canberra. The Canberra International tennis tournament, set to start on Monday, has been relocated to Bendigo in country Victoria due to bushfires and smoke haze in the region. The event is on the ATP Challenger Tour and the ITF Women\u2019s circuit, and has eight top 100 men\u2019s players and 20 women from the top 200 entered in the field. \u201cThe health of players, fans, volunteers, staff and stakeholders is our biggest priority at all times,\u201d Tennis ACT chief executive Kim Kachel said. The National Zoo and Aquarium is also closed this Saturday \u201cdue to the unprecedented combination of the ACT Government declaring a state of alert, an extreme fire warning and the continuation of poor air quality\u201d. The zoo said: \u201cWe apologise to any visitors and members that were planning on visiting the zoo tomorrow. However, we feel given the seriousness and combination of all of these unique factors, it is the most prudent course of action. Any individuals that have encounters or tours booked for tomorrow will be contacted in order to reschedule or, if that is not possible, receive a full refund.\u201d The WNBL announced on Friday it had cancelled Sunday\u2019s round 12 basketball game between the UC Capitals and Perth Lynx, due to be played at the AIS. Officials said heavy smoke, caused by the NSW bushfires, was impacting air quality inside the venue. Football Federation Australia also announced that the W-League round eight match between Canberra United and Sydney FC on Sunday had been postponed. There is a final opportunity for people to evacuate Cann River. The National Security Committee is going to hook up in the morning on this. I\u2019m inclined not to proceed on that visit. There are issues I need to resolve formally when working through issues of that nature. That is my inclination on that issue. We\u2019ll make a further announcement and arrangement on that accordingly. Morrison is getting grilled on the community anger directed at him, particularly in recent days, and about his leadership. His responses are recognising that people are \u201cangry\u201d, \u201craw\u201d, and have \u201csuffered great loss\u201d, but not that the feelings are specifically towards him. \u201cPeople are angry, and... if people want to direct that at me, that is up to them. It\u2019s not something that will distract me. It is something that I will empathise with. It is something that I understand. It\u2019s not something for me to take personally.\u201d He\u2019s asked about calls for more aerial firefighting equipment, and if we have sought more from overseas countries. He says that is a matter for emergency chiefs, but there has been one request made very recently from one of the states. No details on that though. Asked about Greg Mullins comparing his response to the fires with Trump\u2019s response to mass shootings, Morrison corrects the reporter to say Mullins is the \u201cformer\u201d chief fire commissioner. \u201cThis is not about any one individual - not me or anyone else. We all have to a job do.\u201d Questions now, and the first one is about his reception in Cobargo. \u201cPeople are frustrated. People have suffered great loss. They\u2019re feeling very raw, particularly where I was yesterday. And that\u2019s the case in many parts of the country. And so I understand how people are feeling. And however they wish to respond is a matter for them. All I seek to do is to provide the support of the Commonwealth government and to assure them of everything we are doing to support them in this time of need.\u201d A follow-up question from the reporter who says it didn\u2019t look like he was being that supportive, noting he walked away from the woman who didn\u2019t want to shake his hand. Morrison says he talked to the woman about what she was asking for \u2013 greater support for the RFS. Asked about Andrew Constance, Liberal government minister in NSW, saying he probably got the welcome he deserved. \u201cI\u2019ve known Andrew for a long time and I\u2019ve reached out to him today.\u201d Morrison says he thought they had contacted Constance to tell him they were coming to the electorate, but realising they hadn\u2019t, he has apologised. \u201cI assumed that he was otherwise occupied on that day, which would be completely understandable. But Andrew\u2019s been through a terrible, terrible experience and ordeal, and so I totally understand how he\u2019d be feeling.\u201d Morrison acknowledges that these fires are at an unprecedented scale. In some contrast to previous appearances, Morrison is much more focused and emphatic on the Commonwealth\u2019s role in the disaster response. This is a time to focus on the task in front of us and coming together and working closely together. I can assure you, that is happening absolutely between the Commonwealth and the state government. The Premier here in Victoria and I are in constant contact, and those in New South Wales should know that that is also the case there in NSW. Darren Chester is addressing media about East Gippsland, with Morrison beside him. I\u2019ll bring you the main points. \u201cHaving been out on the fireground today and met with people who lost everything, their spirit and determination is simply magnificent,\u201d said Chester. \u201cWe\u2019re in for some pretty tough times again over the next 36 hours. We just received briefings again about the risk, and the number one consideration for us all is the safety of our community.\u201d Morrison says there are \u201csome gruelling days ahead\u201d. \u201cWhat I have been pleased to see here has been the absolute integration of the local efforts together with the state efforts and the efforts of the Australian Defence Force.\u201d He says 57 people have left Mallacoota on the MB Sycamore, and HMAS Choules will be leaving shortly, with about 900 on board. Mallacoota is receiving 12,000 litres of fuel every day, principally through air support. He said a lot of the missing people are from remote areas without communication. Morrison urges people to get to places of safety before the situation is \u201cfar more dangerous\u201d tomorrow. \u201cThat evacuation effort today is extremely important and has a very big focus from the Commonwealth.\u201d The ADF is working with state emergency services to get key roads open, Morrison says, and with state governments to set up evacuation centres and providing accomodation. He stresses it won\u2019t be a \u201ctent city\u201d. There will be a big rebuilding effort here in East Gippsland, as there has been, and there will need to be, in many other parts of the country, as disasters have befallen them. The Commonwealth will play a key role in working together with state and local authorities in building those businesses back up, in building the infrastructure again and ensuring that we can see a recovery of the area. Not just physically, but also economically, to provide those ongoing services that are necessary. A community briefing in Jindabyne painted a grim picture of the deteriorating fire conditions across the Snowy-Monaro shire area. Rocky Plains fire captain, David Fletcher, told a crowd of approximately 1,500 that spilled out of the memorial hall that all the fires in the area were not contained. They expected 40 km/h winds gusting up to 70 km/h which would make the fires intense and erratic, and they expected spot fires well ahead of the front on Saturday. Fletcher predicted the fires to the south in Victoria were expected to cross the border and impact their area sometime on Saturday. He said 87 heavy plant were currently working on existing fires and building containment lines. He could not guarantee a fire fighting appliance at every property and urged residents to stay ONLY if they had the resources, skills, and capacity to defend their properties. Brad Hughes from Jindabyne police asked that people who intended to evacuate to move on from the area if they could, as accommodation in Cooma and other towns was already stretched with displaced persons from the south coast fires. Evacuation centres have been set up at the Bombala community centre and the Multi Function Centre at Cooma showgrounds. There is no evacuation centre in Jindabyne because of the risk of fire impacting the town. The saleyards at Cooma and Bombala are open for large animals who have been evacuated, feeding them is the sole responsibility of the owners. Horses can be stabled at the Cooma Showground, smaller animals, birds in cages and chickens are also being catered for at the Multi Function Centre in Cooma. These facilities are managed by the Department of Communities and Justice. The mayor of the Snowy-Monaro shire, Peter Beer, reiterated that emergency services will not be able to support everyone and that they really did not know exactly what would happen Saturday. Community recovery assistance has been extended for bushfire-hit communities in the Bega Valley, Eurobodalla, Queanbeyan-Palerang, Shoalhaven, Snowy Monaro, Snowy Valleys and Mid-Western council areas, the emergency management minister David Littleproud has announced. This brings the total support to more than $80m and includes: Recovery grants of up to $15,000 for farmers and small businesses $4.5m in funding for additional mental health support and local led economic and community resilience initiatives \u201cThe Federal Government will stand by these communities until they\u2019re back on their feet and will make further assistance available as it is needed,\u201d Littleproud said. Most people appear to have seen this footage by now, but here are the two now infamous handshake attempts by Scott Morrison. Here\u2019s the follow up to one of the interactions, from ABC reporters on the ground. He reportedly received a warmer welcome in Lucknow, Victoria, in that no one yelled at him. Here\u2019s one account of the stopover. An extraordinary amount of land is under threat tomorrow. This is the New South Wales RFS\u2019s prediction for fire spread tomorrow in those catastrophic conditions. Victorian emergency services have just issued a strong recommendation to evacuate from Bessiebelle, Broadwater, Codrington, Homerton, Lake Condah, Macarthur, Tyrendarra, Condah South, and Condah Mission. \u201cIf you are located in the area south of the fire in Budj Bim National Park it is strongly recommended that you evacuate now and move to a safer location away from the fire.\u201d There is a bushfire at Foote Tk - 2km south east of Lake Condah that is not yet under control This fire is travelling from Budj Bim National Park in a south-westerly direction towards Old Mill Road. Firefighters are uncertain if they can hold the fire at its current location. A wind change is expected around 2pm, which will cause the fire to change directions towards Bessiebelle. Conditions can become very dangerous and unpredictable. Hello, this is Helen Davidson taking over the blog from Luke now. New South Wales police have arrested a 19-year-old for allegedly stealing from a vacant home in Batlow, and stealing a car which he later crashed. The occupants had evacuated ahead of the bushfires. The man allegedly searched through the house and then stole a Ford Falcon sedan which was later seen being driven erratically in Batlow. \u201cPolice initiated a pursuit, but it was terminated shortly after due to safety concerns. Soon after, officers located the sedan after it crashed into a tree. The driver, a 19-year-old man, was taken to Wagga Wagga Base Hospital in a stable condition, where he remains under police guard.\u201d Officers searched the vehicle, finding a backpack with several items believed to be stolen, including jewellery, documentation and ammunition. \u201cThis sort of behaviour will not be tolerated by police or the wider community, and we will take immediate action to bring these people before the courts,\u201d deputy commissioner Gary Worboys said. \u201cI also ask members of the community to be vigilant \u2013 if you see a crime being committed, call triple zero immediately.\u201d Former New South Wales fire chief, Greg Mullins, has likened Scott Morrison\u2019s response to the bushfires to Donald Trump\u2019s reluctance to discuss guns after a mass shooting. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta watch what I say because I\u2019m very tired, I\u2019ve been at multiple fires,\u201d Mullins said. But I\u2019m angry about the prime minister\u2019s response. It reminds me of President Trump when there\u2019s multiple shootings saying it\u2019s nothing to do with guns. We have to talk about climate change because our bushfire situation in Australia has changed forever. It\u2019s been a 20 year process. People in the business like me have watched with horror, spoken to the Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO and scientists and said, \u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019 And they said, here it is, but we\u2019re not being listened to. Everything I heard from the government is, \u2018We\u2019re doing this, we\u2019re doing this, aren\u2019t we good? Yeah, too late, guys. You can listen to the whole interview here. It starts at 2:20 and is well worth a listen. Greg Mullins says he has never seen a bushfire situation this serious. He was in Batemans Bay on New Year\u2019s Eve in charge of an RFS crew and, \u201cI\u2019m still shocked.\u201d This is what 29 other fire and emergency chiefs, former chiefs, and I, tried to warn the prime minister about back in April and May. And we weren\u2019t listened to. What could Scott Morrison have done? \u201cWe made a number of suggestions to use the military in a more organised and less ad-hoc fashion. The answer was that\u2019s a stupid idea,\u201d he said. \u201cEventually they were forced into using the ADF.\u201d The former NSW fire chief, Greg Mullins, gave an interview on ABC Radio Sydney this morning. You might remember he was among the former fire chiefs calling for a national bushfire summit. I\u2019m going to transcribe some of his quotes for you, but here\u2019s a flavour below. A reminder that bushfires \u2013 and the climate emergency \u2013 will have added impacts on low-income people and those with disabilities. Just a further update on the number of homes lost in New South Wales. The RFS now puts the figure at 1,365 since the start of the fire season. And there is also one from Woolworths. New South Wales update: Woolworths Narooma and Bermagui remain closed and will not reopen until Sunday. Woolworths Batemans Bay and Moruya will trade until 8pm this evening (3 January) and will close tomorrow and not reopen until Sunday. BWS stores in Batemans Bay and Narooma are closed today with all BWS stores south of Nowra to Tura Beach to be closed tomorrow. Stock was replenished across Woolworths stores overnight on the south coast, with the exception of Moruya, with delivery trucks escorted by police through the Princes Highway closure yesterday evening. Additional stock is currently en route to Woolworths supermarkets in the region for further replenishment today. There will be no deliveries tomorrow as a safety precaution due to conditions in the region. Woolworths continues to support the supply needs of the Salvation Army by meeting their ongoing requirements at evacuation centres in the region. This includes a number of Woolworths trucks heading to the region with essential supplies which will arrive today. Our Bega online delivery trucks are also being used to ship further supplies from the store to the local evacuation centres. Plans are in place to support stores that might be impacted over the weekend from the fires currently burning in the Kosciuszko national park. This includes power generators being sent to our Jindabyne, Cooma and Tumut stores. Team members from nearby areas are also helping support the stores to accommodate teams needing to remain with their homes. A Woolworths power generator has also been provided to the Bega Shire Council to support the power and water needs for the community. Victoria update: Currently all stores in affected areas of Victoria remain open, although we will continue to monitor the situation over the course of the day. Woolworths has supplied 45 pallets of water to the Salvation Army to distribute to the CFA for use across the far east of Gippsland and stores continue to support the needs of the CFA across the region. I have received a statement from the Commonwealth Bank about bank closures and ATM outages. It reads in part: The continuing bushfire emergencies across the country are impacting Commonwealth Bank services, particularly on the south coast of NSW and in Victoria. With the safety of our customers and our staff the absolute priority plus the impact of the damage caused to key power and telecommunications services, we have closed the following branches as at 10.30am today, Friday 3 January 2020: New South Wales Batemans Bay (ATMs unavailable) Batlow Eden Huskisson (closed from 12:30pm) Jindabyne Merimbula Moruya Narooma (closed from 1:00pm) Ulladulla (closed from 1:00pm) ACT Australian National University Victoria Bright Corryong Lakes Entrance Mount Beauty (closed from 1:00pm) Orbost ATMs have also been affected with both Batemans Bay onsite ATMs currently out of service. All other ATMs are currently reported as working. Further information on our affected services can be found at https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/support/commbank-incidents.html HMAS Choules is expected to reach Hastings at 11pm tonight after leaving Mallacoota today. The New Zealand government is sending a further 22 firefighters to Australia to assist in the fire effort. In a statement, the NZ prime minister Jacinda Ardern said: \u201cThe devastation caused by these fires is taking a substantial toll on our Australian neighbours and we will continue to do what we can to assist as they deal with this extremely dynamic, dangerous and ongoing situation. \u201cNew Zealanders around the country have expressed their condolences to those who have lost loved ones and sympathy to all affected, and I extend mine too. It\u2019s simply devastating to see the scale of the loss. \u201cI\u2019ve been in contact with prime minister Scott Morrison again this week to share our collective support for our neighbours and friends, and what they\u2019re experiencing.\u201d The government\u2019s press release states: A formal request for further assistance was made earlier this week and the extra personnel (20 firefighters, a strike team leader and a liaison officer) will help with front-line firefighting on two five-day rotations. They\u2019ll leave for Australia on 8 January. Since late October 2019, 157 New Zealanders have been deployed to assist with the Australia bush fires. The ABC has just broadcast some of the PM\u2019s visit to Lucknow. All very pleasant, no repeat of the scenes at Cobargo yesterday. This is from Monday. The fire front is now even larger and is expected to move south as conditions deteriorate on Saturday. Big four accounting firm KPMG has cancelled its annual jolly for chief executives and other corporate bigwigs, a couta boat race usually held at Sorrento, on Victoria\u2019s Mornington Peninsula, because of the bushfires. The race usually attracts a who\u2019s who of corporate Australia, who are ladled into couta boats \u2013 a type of sailboat historically used for fishing around the peninsula \u2013 for a race from Sorrento down to the Port Phillip Heads and back before breaking for lunch, usually compered by Eddie McGuire. Past attendees at the event include defenestrated Westpac chairman Lindsay Maxsted, former Australia Post boss Ahmed Fahour, treasurer Josh Frydenberg and former treasurer and Future Fund chairman Peter Costello. \u201cOut of respect for bushfire affected communities \u2013 and given the current catastrophic bushfire situation across eastern Australia \u2013 with the expectation of worsening weather conditions tomorrow and over the weekend, KPMG has taken the decision to cancel its annual Couta Boat race,\u201d a spokeswoman said. It is not clear whether the event, which has come to symbolise corporate Australia\u2019s insulation from the real world, will return next year. The race attracted controversy \u2013 and the hashtag #yachtbanter \u2013 in 2017 when executives used the occasion to call for cuts to penalty rates, while in 2015 McGuire drew gasps from lunchers by saying that \u201cyou\u2019ve got to love Australia, when all the Muslims are delivering the postage and parcels\u201d in reference to Fahour. KPMG\u2019s spokeswoman said clients and crew would instead get a \u201cscaled-back lunch\u201d and it would be making a donation to bushfire support. But Albanese does offer his view of why people are angry. One of the reasons why we have seen some frustration expressed by people on the ground, they don\u2019t want to be told it\u2019s a natural disaster. Australia\u2019s had natural disasters in the past. We haven\u2019t, in my lifetime, had people on beaches waiting to be evacuated in life jackets sending boats out to sea like it\u2019s a peacetime version of something that we have seen during wartime. We have not seen that. This is not business as usual. Albanese is asked to characterise the PM\u2019s response to the crisis. He declines, saying he\u2019s not a commentator and it\u2019s his just to put forward practical suggestions. I\u2019ve been constructive and I\u2019ll continue to do so. In November, I called for Coag to meet. I called for the prime minister to meet with the former fire chiefs who have hundreds of years of expertise between them. I called for Coag to consider our aerial firefighting capacity, I called for a scheme to support our volunteer firefighters in terms of economic compensation. I called for a national disaster plan to be put in place. I called for climate change and its impact including adaptation and mitigation, to be on the agenda. Labor leader Anthony Albanese is speaking to the media now. He reiterates his calls for national response to the bushfire crisis. He notes that the national security committee of cabinet will only meet on Monday. I\u2019m not quite sure why it takes that long as a former member of the national security committee to convene a meeting like that. It can be convened of course by its very nature on very short notice. I do think that the failure of Coag to meet until March is not a circumstance which, in my view, is justifiable. NSW police have said a man has died at Belowra. He was unaccounted for and presumed dead, but they have now confirmed the tragic news. The police statement reads: NSW police force has confirmed a seventh person has died in bushfires impacting the state\u2019s south coast. On Tuesday (31 December 2019), officers from South Coast Police District were informed a 72-year-old man was unaccounted for at Belowra, about 50km north west of Cobargo, after a large-scale bushfire impacted the area. Yesterday (Thursday 2 January 2020), officers were able to access the site and located a body in a vehicle on Belowra Road. While the body has not been formally identified, it is believed to be the 72-year-old man. Inquiries are continuing, and reports will be prepared for the information of the coroner. Seven people have now died in the bushfire emergency affecting the NSW south coast. An eighth man, a NSW RFS volunteer, died while fighting a fire at Jingellic on Monday (30 December 2019). Detectives from South Coast Police District have now established Strike Force Indarra to investigate all aspects of the fires. This will include investigating the seven fatalities that occurred in the district, loss of livestock, properties damaged and destroyed, and the cause of the fires. As the bushfire emergency continues, people are urged to obey direction of emergency services and to monitor the Rural Fire Service NSW website www.rfs.gov.au and www.livetraffic.com for road closures. Emergency services are also reminding the community not to contact Triple Zero (000) unless there is an emergency. More from Morrison on the anger from people he\u2019s visited. Mitchell noted in the interview they have not only heckled him, but others have refused to shake his hand. \u201cI know people are angry and they will often fixate whether it\u2019s a prime minister or someone else,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cI understand that, I understand the emotion, I understand the hurt, the anger, the frustration. What we will do is just continue to use every resource and person we have to assist the situation.\u201d Mitchell asks Morrison about Andrew Constance\u2019s comments saying the PM got the welcome \u201che probably deserved\u201d when he was heckled and abused at Cobargo. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen those comments,\u201d Morrison replies. 3AW\u2019s Neil Mitchell turns to the angry reaction Morrison has received at fire grounds. Why are they angry, at you, Mitchell asks. \u201cPeople are angry and people are upset,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cWhether they\u2019re angry with me or or they\u2019re angry about their situation, all I know is that they\u2019re hurting, and it\u2019s my job to try and offer some comfort and support. \u201cThat\u2019s my job, I don\u2019t take these things personally, why would I?\u201d More on the evacuation in Mallacoota. Gippsland Nationals MP Darren Chester has told the ABC that 25 people have been evacuated by Spartan aircraft. Some have been questioning the involvement of the ADF this fire season. Or more specifically wondering why they haven\u2019t been more prominently involved. As the Defence Department has also been stressing, Morrison tells Mitchell \u201cthey are not new to the scene\u201d. Their involvement has been \u201cprolonged and sustained\u201d, he says. And he notes that Daniel Andrews has welcomed the cooperation between the state and federal authorities, which includes the military. The prime minister Scott Morrison has just been on 3AW with Neil Mitchell. He will be touring East Gippsland today. Asked if the current situation is the \u201cnew normal\u201d, Morrison says \u201cit\u2019s a very important question ... but we have to understand that it\u2019s on the back of a very severe drought\u201d. He also notes that \u201cfires are different because of the prolonged nature of the season across the country\u201d. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is fronting the media and says that the number of people who are now unaccounted for has increased to 28. The figure was 17 yesterday. \u201cWe have grave fears for the safety and well beingof those 28 people who cannot be located,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving said that, though, these numbers will move around. A number of people who were part of the original 17 were located yesterday.\u201d Stay tuned. The evacuations have begun at the isolated Victorian coastal town of Mallacoota. Authorities say 800 people will be relocated using the Navy vessel HMAS Choules. Others will be airlifted out of the town. The emergency services minister is reportedly still not back in the job. He\u2019s been on holidays in Europe. His boss, the premier Gladys Berejiklian, declared a state of emergency in NSW yesterday. There were a few other awkward moments for Scott Morrison last night. NSW deputy police commissioner Gary Worboys acknowledges it\u2019s been a long night for people trying to get out of the south coast. And he says there will be plenty of congestion on the roads today. Already, tens of thousands of cars have left the area, Worboys says. This is probably quite clear given the mass evacuations, but a fairly chilling quote from Rodgers: \u201cOur pure focus for tomorrow is about the preservation of life.\u201d Rodgers says crews are concerned about Batlow in southern NSW. \u201cThere is a 50km plus stretch of fire likely to come back across the border tomorrow. That combined with fires already in that part of the state will have a fire front stretching 60-70km long. We can\u2019t stop those fires, we can\u2019t stop those fires we already have.\u201d NSW authorities are providing media briefing right now. RFS deputy commissioner Rob Rodgers says there are currently 142 fires burning through the state. He notes a fire south of Batemans Bay is very active and they are concerned that as conditions deteriorate tomorrow, the fire may flare up again. \u201cBut even those areas that have already been impacted by fire, there\u2019s still a lot of pockets among the bush that we are concerned about and conditions tomorrow, the fire may flare up,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll put out maps shortly that will pinpoint the ember buffer. Do not be in those areas. Go to a major centre away from those potential impact areas. It might be a large town. Go to the beach, an area that has already been burnt, just don\u2019t be there.\u201d The NSW Liberal transport minister, Andrew Constance, has told Channel Seven that prime minister Scott Morrison got the welcome \u201che probably deserved\u201d when he was heckled and abused by locals at Cobargo last night. Constance represents Bega and lived through the terror of the fires on New Year\u2019s Eve. Asked about the reaction to the prime minister. Constance said: \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t even know he was coming and I haven\u2019t had a call from him. So to be honest with you the locals probably gave him the welcome that he probably deserved. I\u2019d say this to the prime minister today: the nation wants you to open up the cheque books, help people rebuild their lives. I know this is tough and I know I\u2019m on his side of politics, but you know, Gladys and Shane Fitzsimmons came here two days ago and they obviously visited the fire-affected part of my electorate in the north. Glad\u2019s going to come back, but this is the feeling that people are going through. Asked what he\u2019d like to the see the PM do, Constance said pointedly that he had \u201cseen strong leadership out of Gladys [Berejiklian] and Shane [Fitzsimmons].\u201d He said he\u2019s aware of a firefighter who rang Centrelink yesterday and \u201cit was a terrible experience for him\u201d. As I mentioned, Scott Morrison copped an earful at Cobargo last night. The town was devastated by fires on Tuesday. Channel Nine captured this footage but the news has travelled far and wide. It has also been prominently covered on CNN and the BBC. Andrews is asked about the footage of Scott Morrison receiving a frosty reception in Cobargo last night. You might have already seen it, but I\u2019ll post it here shortly because if you haven\u2019t, you definitely should. The premier says he understands that emotions are running high right now. But he adds: \u201cI can only say thank you to the prime minister for the partnership we have. I have just spoken with him a few moments ago. He is in Victoria today. \u201cThe partnership between our emergency services, led by Victoria police and the ADF, is unprecedented and I am grateful for the partnership and open dialogue and constant communication I have had with the prime minister. That is keeping Victorians safe.\u201d Andrews says he hopes it sends a \u201cpowerful and formal message to people \u2018Don\u2019t visit these communities and if you can, get out, you have to get out.\u2019\u201d \u201cAll we can do is appeal to peoples\u2019 common sense and the sense that there is a shared responsibility here,\u201d he says. \u201cNone of us should put other people in harm\u2019s way. We cannot guarantee your safety if you stay and you may well cause other people to go into dangerous circumstances to try and provide assistance to you. \u201cFinally, there is a very large matter of getting trapped and being isolated. We don\u2019t want to see any more people cut off in fire-affected communities.\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is speaking on the ABC now. Overnight, a second person was confirmed dead in East Gippsland. The state government has also declared a state of disaster, which allows authorities to forcibly evacuate people. Andrews says it is the first time the state has invoked these powers. (They were established after Black Saturday.) Good morning. I\u2019m Luke Henriques-Gomes. Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the bushfires crisis. You\u2019re joining us as a mass scale evacuation takes place across the east coast of Australia ahead of deteriorating conditions today and tomorrow. We\u2019ll be with you throughout the today with the latest news.",

When facing Buffalo, scoring on chunk plays is a strong way to place pressure on the Bills\u2019 methodical offense. The Bills specialize in slow-paced, physical games, so Houston would do well to try and take a big early lead and force Buffalo into an uncomfortable pace.</p> <p><strong>Key Player: </strong>Carlos Hyde, Texans. There will be plenty of focus on the Texans\u2019 high-flying offense, but Buffalo\u2019s stingy pass defense is equipped to limit Watson and his star receivers. If Hyde, who quietly rushed for over 1,000 yards this season, can exploit Buffalo\u2019s front seven, then Houston will be in better position to execute the kinds of big plays it takes to beat the Bills.</p> <p><strong>Prediction: </strong>Bills 20-14 Texans</p> <h2><strong>Tennessee Titans at New England Patriots<br>Saturday, 8.15 pm ET/1.15am GMT (Sunday)</strong></h2> <p><strong>What the Titans need to do to win: </strong>Rushing champion Derrick Henry rushed for over 100 yards in five of his last six games (896 total yards, 6.45 yards per carry) to help propel the Titans to the playoffs for the second time in the last three seasons. As the season grows longer, Henry seems to get stronger: he clinched the 2019 rushing title with his splendid final third of the season after logging 585 of 1,059 yards in his final four games in 2018. Even with the Patriots\u2019 stout front seven and revered run defense, Henry is one of the toughest running backs in the league to stop because of his size and pure strength. If Henry succeeds early, that should allow quarterback Ryan Tannehill more time to try and exploit the fierce New England defense.</p> <p><strong>What the Patriots need to do to win:</strong><em> </em>Get their offense in sync. Tom Brady and the New England attack still managed 12 wins in 2019, but their Week 17 loss to Miami was a rocky, mistake-filled performance on offense that plunged them into the No 3 seed. If Brady can establish a better rhythm with rookie wide receiver N\u2019Keal Harry and rely a bit less on Julian Edelman, the Patriots offense can better support a defense that helped pace the 12-win season.</p> <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Titans WR AJ Brown. New England have one of the league\u2019s best secondary anchored by star cornerback Stephon Gilmore, but Brown has logged over 100 yards receiving in four of his last six games and scored five touchdowns in that timeframe.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump will be praying with the religious right at his first campaign event of 2020 in Miami on Friday, where his Evangelicals for Trump \u201ccoalition launch\u201d will take place at a Hispanic megachurch in a clear attempt to shore up the support of one his most loyal voting blocs. The rally was hastily put together in the wake of a blistering December editorial in Christianity Today calling for the \u201cmorally lost and confused\u201d president\u2019s removal from office. Stung by the criticism from an unexpected quarter, Trump attacked the influential Christian newspaper as a \u201cfar-left magazine\u201d. Yet in attempting to put out that fire by assembling dozens of evangelical leaders from across the nation to speak with and for him in Miami, Trump has ignited another controversy over immigration. His choice of venue \u2013 a Hispanic church in the south of a city with the nation\u2019s largest foreign-born population \u2013 angered activists already upset with his hardline immigration policies, such as terminating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program for so-called Dreamers, which the US supreme court will rule on this year, and placing immigrant children in cages at America\u2019s southern border. Even Guillermo Maldonado, the pastor of the King Jesus international ministry and Trump loyalist who has prayed with the president at the White House, felt the need to reassure concerned members of his congregation who were not legal immigrants that they would not be at risk of deportation if they attended. \u201cDo you think I would do something where I would endanger my people? I\u2019m not that dumb,\u201d Maldonado told congregants during a sermon at the church last Sunday, at which he said he heard some people might be put off by the Trump administration\u2019s increasing immigration raids. Still, with an estimated 27,000 Dreamers in Florida, almost half of them living in the Miami metro area and neighboring cities, advocates are furious that Trump is courting fervently anti-immigrant evangelical voters on their doorstep. \u201cTrump\u2019s hateful rhetoric on immigration has not only led to the detention and deportation of millions of immigrants, but they\u2019ve also inspired deadly attacks like the shooting in El Paso and most recently a woman who ran over a child because she was Mexican,\u201d said Bruna Sollod, communications director for United We Dream. \u201cTrump and his advisers encourage the white supremacist belief that immigrants and people of color are inferior and must be rooted out. Every person in our country should denounce white supremacy and the evil actions that follow it.\u201d Despite such opposition, Trump is calculating that by appealing to evangelicals he can again lock in the support of a large power base of voters that helped propel him to the White House in 2016. In that election he secured 81% support from white born-again/evangelical Christians, a thumping majority that helped secure crucial swing states such as Florida, Missouri and Pennsylvania. Even though researchers later determined that more white evangelicals were voting against the beaten Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton than voting for Trump, by a 51 to 45% margin, the president retains a 75% favorable rating among that group in December polling, likely driven by the appointment of a flood of social conservatives in judicial system \u2013 including two supreme court judge \u2013 and Trump\u2019s embracing of a hardline anti-abortion stance. With his overall approval rating mired in the low 40s for almost a year, and non-white evangelical support below 30% in other recent polling, Trump realizes he must appeal to and hold on to those mostly older, white religious voters if he is to have any chance of a second term. Yet some observers believe it is a marriage of convenience, rather than any deeply held theological conviction on the part of the president. Even his choice of which Palm Beach church he and the first lady, Melania Trump, attended on Christmas Eve was perceived as a political maneuver designed to impress evangelicals. \u201cTrump bows to the ageing white evangelical agenda, but I don\u2019t think he cares for them, they\u2019re not the folks he has sought out in the past and not the kind of people he would choose to go golfing with,\u201d said Dr Alan Bean, a Texas hospice chaplain and commentator for Baptist News. \u201cBut they need each other. They really feel they are losing their country and cannot imagine an America where white evangelicals like themselves are not predominant. They know it\u2019s slipping away, they\u2019re trying to hang on as long as they can and that means they come out and vote in force. Trump is the only politician with the clout and inclination to work with them. They know he needs them and he feels their desperation, it\u2019s very reciprocal.\u201d Meanwhile, other evangelical demographics sense an opportunity to have their voices heard. \u201cNo party should take us for granted,\u201d said Father Gabriel Salguero, founder and president of the national Latino evangelical coalition. \u201cHispanic evangelicals are the quintessential swing voter. There are about 9 million Hispanic evangelicals in the US, and many of us live in key swing states like Florida, Colorado, Ohio and Pennsylvania. It\u2019s incumbent on any candidate to speak to the Latino evangelical community. \u201cThe president understands this and if anything it shows there\u2019s been a real awakening, in both parties, to the reality of the growth and influence of evangelical Latinos.\u201d Salguero, a pastor at a large multinational church in Orlando, urged Hispanics to listen to what Trump has to say. \u201cThe truth is that Hispanic evangelicals are politically homeless,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not fall neatly into any category, our allegiance is not to any party or partisan allegiance, it is to the gospel of Christ and the community we serve. [But] at the end of the day we have to make a choice.\u201d",

This adaptation of a fondly remembered classic novel really is a step up from the impressive-enough Lady Bird; it manages to be both faithful to the spirit of the book as well as injecting it with a contemporary empowerment message.</p> <h2>Jojo Rabbit (12A)</h2> <p><em>(Taika Waititi, 2019, Czech/NZ/US) 108 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL4McUzXfFI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tL4McUzXfFI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There is a feeling that the likable director of Thor: Ragnarok may have overreached himself with this Nazi-era comedy; the intention is laudable, but not everyone is convinced.

Nevertheless, director Bi Gan has more than a smidge of Leos Carax about his work: this is a beautiful-looking if cryptic neo-noir, boasting a bravura 59-minute shot in 3D.</p> <h2>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (12A)</h2> <p><em>(JJ Abrams, 2019, US) 142 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qn_spdM5Zg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8Qn_spdM5Zg?start=24&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=24\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>JJ Abrams is back in the saddle for the final chunk of the current Star Wars trilogy \u2013 appropriately enough as he was the man who re-engineered and rehabilitated the series with The Force Awakens back in 2015.

Since self-releasing singles in 2017 \u2013 via an early ambition to be the \u201cpunk Beatles\u201d \u2013 they have gone on to tour with kindred spirits Shame and Idles, made their US TV chatshow debut and crashed into the UK Top 10 with ambitious, Mercury-nominated debut album Dogrel. <br><em><a href=\"https://academymusicgroup.com/o2academynewcastle/events/1260619/fontaines-dc-tickets\">O2 Academy Newcastle,</a><strong><a href=\"https://academymusicgroup.com/o2academynewcastle/events/1260619/fontaines-dc-tickets\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://academymusicgroup.com/o2academynewcastle/events/1260619/fontaines-dc-tickets\">Friday 10 January</a></em></p> <h2>Holly Macve</h2> <p>Steeped in the traditions of country music, and with a hint of the vintage stylings of Lana Del Rey, Brighton-based Macve was actually born in Galway in western Ireland. At 18, while working in a cafe, she met Bella Union boss Simon Raymonde, who fell in love with her voice; her critically acclaimed 2017 debut album, Golden Eagle, was released on his prestigious label. <br><em><a href=\"http://thelexington.co.uk/event.php?id=1059\">The Lexington, N1, Wednesday 8 January</a></em></p> <h2>Black Midi</h2> <p>Equal parts potential and pretension, Brit School alumni Black Midi are what you might politely refer to as divisive. Eschewing pop for prog, choruses for free-form improvisation, their debut album, Schlagenheim, was inspired by 20th-century classical music, while a performance at the Mercury music prize involved some painful gymnastics. Not dull. <br><em><a href=\"https://bmblackmidi.com/tourdates/\">RNCM Theatre, Manchester, Friday 10 January; touring to 20 February</a></em></p> <h2>Field Music</h2> <p>Previously the work of brothers Peter and David Brewis, Field Music explore being a proper studio band on new album Making a New World. Typically eccentric, it takes the form of a 19-track song cycle about the historical echoes of the first world war, featuring songs about the armistice and the Inter-Allied Women\u2019s Conference. It was an idea that blossomed out of a project for London\u2019s Imperial War Museum. <br><em><a href=\"http://field-music.co.uk/\">Liverpool, Thursday 9; Manchester, Friday 10 January; touring to 29 February</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Tony Kofi/Monkathon III</h2> <p>Tony Kofi\u2019s Monkathon started life as a marathon 2003 gig when the spirited blues-boppish UK saxophonist\u2019s group played all 70 of Thelonious Monk\u2019s known compositions over six hours on the spin. This performance is an edited version of Kofi\u2019s impassioned Monk tribute, with pianist Jonathan Gee a key presence in an exhilarating quartet. <br><em><a href=\"https://tonykofimusic.com/events\">The Verdict, Brighton, Friday 10 January</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Two of the best \u2026 classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37e664eadf70304eeb489adc5e6043529acba061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37e664eadf70304eeb489adc5e6043529acba061/0_65_2242_1345/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaime Mart\u00edn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young disciple\u2026 Jaime Mart\u00edn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CTK/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain</h2> <p>The Spanish conductor Jaime Mart\u00edn takes charge of the latest lineup of young talent for the National Youth Orchestra\u2019s winter concerts. He has opted for a programme of music about protest and revolution, ending with Shostakovich\u2019s 11th Symphony, which depicts the events of the failed Russian revolution of 1905. Before that, there is Britten\u2019s Sinfonia da Requiem, originally commissioned to mark the 2,600th anniversary of the Japanese empire but which was, in fact, a scarcely disguised protest again militarism and war \u2013 and was rejected by the Japanese government. The orchestra begin the concert as a choir, singing Hanns Eisler\u2019s part-song Auf Den Strassen Zu Singen. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nyo.org.uk/winter-2020\">Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry, Saturday 4; Barbican Hall, EC2, Sunday 5; Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham,</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.nyo.org.uk/winter-2020\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.nyo.org.uk/winter-2020\">Monday 6 January</a></em></p> <h2>Ibert &amp; Schreker</h2> <p>An intriguingly themed studio concert from the BBC Philharmonic: Holly Mathieson conducts rarely heard scores by Franz Schreker and Jacques Ibert, both of them based upon works by Oscar Wilde. The Birthday of the Infanta, Schreker\u2019s 1908 music for a pantomime, is based upon the same Wilde short story that his Viennese contemporary Alexander von Zemlinsky later used for his one-act opera Der Zwerg (The Dwarf). Ibert\u2019s The Ballad of Reading Gaol is even less familiar. Composed in 1922 as a symphonic poem based on Wilde\u2019s famous prison text, it was later converted into a ballet, although Mathieson is conducting the original version, which was Ibert\u2019s first symphonic work. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e6qfbp\">MediaCityUK, Salford, Wednesday 8 January</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55948dea5cf63e2b7944c599187947262969094f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55948dea5cf63e2b7944c599187947262969094f/22_30_2208_2658/831.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Gauguin\u2019s Still Life With Profile of Laval, 1886.\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Gauguin\u2019s Still Life With Profile of Laval, 1886.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Gauguin/Indianapolis Museum of Art</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Cars: Accelerating the Modern World</h2> <p>The modern world\u2019s most glamorised engines of liberation and destruction get their blockbuster. Writers from F Scott Fitzgerald to JG Ballard have seen the car as modernity\u2019s most powerful symbol. Artists such as Richard Hamilton and Andy Warhol have explored its imagery. Today, we strive to reconcile that myth with the need for greener transport. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/cars\">Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, SW7, to 19 April</a></em></p> <h2>Paula Rego</h2> <p>The sinewy art of this painter dramatises states of feeling through the hefty presence of the human physique. Rego\u2019s bodies are thick-limbed and stockily strong; her characters are dark-eyed and secretive. The pictures are sinister fairytales full of barely suppressed Freudian passions. Open the door of the bloody chamber. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/paula-rego-obedience-and-defiance\">Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, to 19 April</a></em></p> <h2>Stubbs: All Done from Nature</h2> <p>It is well worth catching this intelligent survey of an artist who not only painted horses but flayed and de-fleshed them to know the science behind his art. The centrepiece is a superb showing of Stubbs\u2019s drawings of the horses he dissected to research his book The Anatomy of the Horse. These are shown next to the preserved skeleton of an 18th-century racehorse as well as his famous portrait of Whistlejacket. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.mkgallery.org/whats-on/george-stubbs-all-done-nature/\">MK Gallery, Milton Keynes, to 26 January</a></em></p> <h2>Bridget Riley</h2> <p>This delirious retrospective of one of Britain\u2019s greatest modern artists is a fairground of surprise. As a young painter, Riley learned figurative skills but she found liberation in light when she studied the pointillism of Seurat. She took his optical experiments further in abstract paintings that manipulate perception, with lines that flow in waves and flat canvases that warp and wobble in space. Art that embodies the psychedelic 1960s. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/hayward-gallery-art/bridget-riley\">Hayward Gallery, SE1, to 26 January</a></em></p> <h2>Gauguin Portraits</h2> <p>As a portraitist Gauguin is a rum cove \u2013 did he love anyone except himself? After a brilliant survey of his self-portraits as a Christ-like visionary, not to mention the actual Christ, there are strange works in which he seems as interested in flowers and fruit as the people with them. It gets more exciting and moving when he sails for Tahiti; whatever his faults, Gauguin\u2019s empathy for the plight of Pacific people cannot be denied. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/the-credit-suisse-exhibition-gauguin-portraits\">The National Gallery, WC2, to 26 January</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a47081769d61effa1308b7225102efb272b2866\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a47081769d61effa1308b7225102efb272b2866/0_22_5194_3485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Magic Goes Wrong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mischief night\u2026 Magic Goes Wrong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Day</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Magic Goes Wrong</h2> <p>Mischief Theatre is everywhere, and with good reason. Here\u2019s a chance to switch off the brain, dial back the cynicism and have a giggle. All of the company\u2019s shows involve a theatrical production going hideously, hilariously wrong; this time a charity magic show spirals out of control.

The show starts out fairly low-key but morphs into a foot-tapping and heart-tugging night at the theatre. The touring production is directed by Peter Rowe but based on John Tiffany\u2019s original concept and stars Daniel Healy and Emma Lucia. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.fairfield.co.uk/whats-on/once/\">Fairfield Halls: Ashcroft Playhouse, Croydon, to 11 January; touring to 25 July</a></em></p> <h2>Dear Evan Hansen</h2> <p>Grief tourism; the insidious sway of social media; the desire to be liked over the desire to be good. Dear Evan Hansen doesn\u2019t sound like much fun, does it? But this is a provocative and strikingly modern musical, with Sam Tutty as a student embroiled in a web of lies, gossip and online spin. There\u2019s also a catchy score from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the songwriters behind La La Land and The Greatest Showman. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk/tickets/dear-evan-hansen/\">No\u00ebl Coward Theatre, WC2, to 30 May</a></em></p> <h2>Cuttin\u2019 It</h2> <p>Charlene James\u2019s unflinching play is a powerful piece about FGM told with such heart. It focuses on two teenagers, Muna and Iqra, both of Somalian origin and now living in Britain. The girls are friends but have very different ideas about FGM, a brutal ordeal both have undergone. This is a scorching play that will open your eyes to this awful ritual, still practised today.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films Little Women (U) (Greta Gerwig, 2019, US) 135 mins Even though Greta Gerwig was passed over for a directing nomination from the Golden Globes, there is time for the Oscars to rectify the mistake. This adaptation of a fondly remembered classic novel really is a step up from the impressive-enough Lady Bird; it manages to be both faithful to the spirit of the book as well as injecting it with a contemporary empowerment message. Jojo Rabbit (12A) (Taika Waititi, 2019, Czech/NZ/US) 108 mins There is a feeling that the likable director of Thor: Ragnarok may have overreached himself with this Nazi-era comedy; the intention is laudable, but not everyone is convinced. Waititi himself plays an imaginary Hitler in the mind of a German kid growing up in the 1930s, who discovers a Jewish girl hiding in his house. Long Day\u2019s Journey into Night (12A) (Bi Gan, 2018, Ch/Fr) 138 mins This has arrived in the UK bearing the kudos of being a big romantic hit for New Year\u2019s Eve in its home country \u2013 but suffered something of a backlash when audiences realised they weren\u2019t dealing with the likes of Notting Hill. Nevertheless, director Bi Gan has more than a smidge of Leos Carax about his work: this is a beautiful-looking if cryptic neo-noir, boasting a bravura 59-minute shot in 3D. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (12A) (JJ Abrams, 2019, US) 142 mins JJ Abrams is back in the saddle for the final chunk of the current Star Wars trilogy \u2013 appropriately enough as he was the man who re-engineered and rehabilitated the series with The Force Awakens back in 2015. He is leading a final all-star tribute act that includes Carrie Fisher, from footage shot for The Last Jedi as well as Force Awakens; this is the final instalment of the \u201cSkywalker Saga\u201d, with the field free for another direction in the future. La Dolce Vita (12A) (Federico Fellini, 1960, It/Fr) 174 mins Re-released as part of a touring programme marking the 100th anniversary of the master director\u2019s birth, La Dolce Vita remains a jaw-dropping achievement, and one of the great films of the European new wave. An ironically titled fable of \u201cthe good life\u201d, starring Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg, it\u2019s still amazing to look at. AP Five of the best \u2026 rock, pop &amp; jazz Fontaines DC Dublin post-punkers Fontaines DC bonded over a love of poetry, releasing two collections while at university. Since self-releasing singles in 2017 \u2013 via an early ambition to be the \u201cpunk Beatles\u201d \u2013 they have gone on to tour with kindred spirits Shame and Idles, made their US TV chatshow debut and crashed into the UK Top 10 with ambitious, Mercury-nominated debut album Dogrel. O2 Academy Newcastle, Friday 10 January Holly Macve Steeped in the traditions of country music, and with a hint of the vintage stylings of Lana Del Rey, Brighton-based Macve was actually born in Galway in western Ireland. At 18, while working in a cafe, she met Bella Union boss Simon Raymonde, who fell in love with her voice; her critically acclaimed 2017 debut album, Golden Eagle, was released on his prestigious label. The Lexington, N1, Wednesday 8 January Black Midi Equal parts potential and pretension, Brit School alumni Black Midi are what you might politely refer to as divisive. Eschewing pop for prog, choruses for free-form improvisation, their debut album, Schlagenheim, was inspired by 20th-century classical music, while a performance at the Mercury music prize involved some painful gymnastics. Not dull. RNCM Theatre, Manchester, Friday 10 January; touring to 20 February Field Music Previously the work of brothers Peter and David Brewis, Field Music explore being a proper studio band on new album Making a New World. Typically eccentric, it takes the form of a 19-track song cycle about the historical echoes of the first world war, featuring songs about the armistice and the Inter-Allied Women\u2019s Conference. It was an idea that blossomed out of a project for London\u2019s Imperial War Museum. Liverpool, Thursday 9; Manchester, Friday 10 January; touring to 29 February MC Tony Kofi/Monkathon III Tony Kofi\u2019s Monkathon started life as a marathon 2003 gig when the spirited blues-boppish UK saxophonist\u2019s group played all 70 of Thelonious Monk\u2019s known compositions over six hours on the spin. This performance is an edited version of Kofi\u2019s impassioned Monk tribute, with pianist Jonathan Gee a key presence in an exhilarating quartet. The Verdict, Brighton, Friday 10 January JF Two of the best \u2026 classical concerts National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain The Spanish conductor Jaime Mart\u00edn takes charge of the latest lineup of young talent for the National Youth Orchestra\u2019s winter concerts. He has opted for a programme of music about protest and revolution, ending with Shostakovich\u2019s 11th Symphony, which depicts the events of the failed Russian revolution of 1905. Before that, there is Britten\u2019s Sinfonia da Requiem, originally commissioned to mark the 2,600th anniversary of the Japanese empire but which was, in fact, a scarcely disguised protest again militarism and war \u2013 and was rejected by the Japanese government. The orchestra begin the concert as a choir, singing Hanns Eisler\u2019s part-song Auf Den Strassen Zu Singen. Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry, Saturday 4; Barbican Hall, EC2, Sunday 5; Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham, Monday 6 January Ibert &amp; Schreker An intriguingly themed studio concert from the BBC Philharmonic: Holly Mathieson conducts rarely heard scores by Franz Schreker and Jacques Ibert, both of them based upon works by Oscar Wilde. The Birthday of the Infanta, Schreker\u2019s 1908 music for a pantomime, is based upon the same Wilde short story that his Viennese contemporary Alexander von Zemlinsky later used for his one-act opera Der Zwerg (The Dwarf). Ibert\u2019s The Ballad of Reading Gaol is even less familiar. Composed in 1922 as a symphonic poem based on Wilde\u2019s famous prison text, it was later converted into a ballet, although Mathieson is conducting the original version, which was Ibert\u2019s first symphonic work. MediaCityUK, Salford, Wednesday 8 January AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Cars: Accelerating the Modern World The modern world\u2019s most glamorised engines of liberation and destruction get their blockbuster. Writers from F Scott Fitzgerald to JG Ballard have seen the car as modernity\u2019s most powerful symbol. Artists such as Richard Hamilton and Andy Warhol have explored its imagery. Today, we strive to reconcile that myth with the need for greener transport. Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, SW7, to 19 April Paula Rego The sinewy art of this painter dramatises states of feeling through the hefty presence of the human physique. Rego\u2019s bodies are thick-limbed and stockily strong; her characters are dark-eyed and secretive. The pictures are sinister fairytales full of barely suppressed Freudian passions. Open the door of the bloody chamber. Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, to 19 April Stubbs: All Done from Nature It is well worth catching this intelligent survey of an artist who not only painted horses but flayed and de-fleshed them to know the science behind his art. The centrepiece is a superb showing of Stubbs\u2019s drawings of the horses he dissected to research his book The Anatomy of the Horse. These are shown next to the preserved skeleton of an 18th-century racehorse as well as his famous portrait of Whistlejacket. MK Gallery, Milton Keynes, to 26 January Bridget Riley This delirious retrospective of one of Britain\u2019s greatest modern artists is a fairground of surprise. As a young painter, Riley learned figurative skills but she found liberation in light when she studied the pointillism of Seurat. She took his optical experiments further in abstract paintings that manipulate perception, with lines that flow in waves and flat canvases that warp and wobble in space. Art that embodies the psychedelic 1960s. Hayward Gallery, SE1, to 26 January Gauguin Portraits As a portraitist Gauguin is a rum cove \u2013 did he love anyone except himself? After a brilliant survey of his self-portraits as a Christ-like visionary, not to mention the actual Christ, there are strange works in which he seems as interested in flowers and fruit as the people with them. It gets more exciting and moving when he sails for Tahiti; whatever his faults, Gauguin\u2019s empathy for the plight of Pacific people cannot be denied. The National Gallery, WC2, to 26 January JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows Magic Goes Wrong Mischief Theatre is everywhere, and with good reason. Here\u2019s a chance to switch off the brain, dial back the cynicism and have a giggle. All of the company\u2019s shows involve a theatrical production going hideously, hilariously wrong; this time a charity magic show spirals out of control. Creative input from American magic maestros Penn &amp; Teller will ensure the tricks are up to scratch. Vaudeville Theatre, WC2, to 31 May LIMF London international mime festival is a season of vibrant visual theatre, including live art, circus and clowning. It is always hugely stimulating, full of acts to make the mind boggle. Highlights include mime artist Trygve Wakenshaw\u2019s Only Bones v1.4 (Tue to 25 Jan) and Nick Lehane\u2019s puppet piece Chimpanzee (21 to 25 Jan). Various venues, London, Wednesday 8 January to 2 February Once: The Musical Everything that was great about John Carney\u2019s 2007 film \u2013 the gentle romance and the sweeping score by Glen Hansard and Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1 \u2013 has been honoured in Enda Walsh\u2019s superb stage adaptation. The show starts out fairly low-key but morphs into a foot-tapping and heart-tugging night at the theatre. The touring production is directed by Peter Rowe but based on John Tiffany\u2019s original concept and stars Daniel Healy and Emma Lucia. Fairfield Halls: Ashcroft Playhouse, Croydon, to 11 January; touring to 25 July Dear Evan Hansen Grief tourism; the insidious sway of social media; the desire to be liked over the desire to be good. Dear Evan Hansen doesn\u2019t sound like much fun, does it? But this is a provocative and strikingly modern musical, with Sam Tutty as a student embroiled in a web of lies, gossip and online spin. There\u2019s also a catchy score from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the songwriters behind La La Land and The Greatest Showman. No\u00ebl Coward Theatre, WC2, to 30 May Cuttin\u2019 It Charlene James\u2019s unflinching play is a powerful piece about FGM told with such heart. It focuses on two teenagers, Muna and Iqra, both of Somalian origin and now living in Britain. The girls are friends but have very different ideas about FGM, a brutal ordeal both have undergone. This is a scorching play that will open your eyes to this awful ritual, still practised today. Stars Asha Hassan and Hermon Berhane. Royal Exchange Theatre: The Studio, Manchester, Thursday 9 January to 1 February MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Ockham\u2019s Razor: This Time It is hard not to fall in love with aerial circus company Ockham\u2019s Razor. Amid the skilful swinging, balancing and navigating the contraptions they build, the work is always warm, poetic and deeply human. This Time, part of London international mime festival, explores family relationships through the passage of time with a multigenerational cast. Shoreditch Town Hall, EC1, Wednesday 8 to 19 January Thick &amp; Tight: Romancing the Apocalypse Daniel Hay-Gordon and Eleanor Perry resurrect characters from the past in an indefinable performance that combines lip-syncing, queer culture and comedy with the rigour of two trained contemporary dancers. Sadler\u2019s Wells: Lilian Baylis Studio, EC1, Thursday 9 to 11 January Northern Ballet 50th Anniversary Gala It is half a century since Laverne Meyer launched a company of 11 dancers in a church hall in Manchester\u2019s Moss Side.

      "bodyText": "A British teenager found guilty of lying about being gang-raped in Cyprus has pleaded with Boris Johnson to \u201cbring me home\u201d. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room in the town of Ayia Napa on 17 July. She has since alleged that Cypriot police forced her to sign a retraction, which led to her being convicted of public mischief at Famagusta district court in Paralimni. \u201cEvery second of this ordeal has been a waking nightmare. I\u2019m 19 and all I want to do is clear my name and come home to my family,\u201d she told the Sun. \u201cI would say to both the foreign secretary and prime minister, both of whom are fathers, please support me with your actions, not just with your words.\u201d A Foreign Office spokeswoman said the UK was \u201cseriously concerned about the \u201cfair trial guarantees in this deeply distressing case and we will be raising the issue with Cypriot authorities\u201d. It contacted the teenager\u2019s family on Thursday, the first time since she was convicted. The former Cypriot justice minister Kypros Chrysostomides told the BBC the teenager had \u201calready suffered a lot\u201d and he expected her sentence would be very lenient. He was one of a number of prominent legal figures in Cyprus to urge the attorney general, Costas Clerides, to intervene in the case. \u201cShe has already been in detention for four and a half weeks and she has been prevented from travelling for about five months already,\u201d Chrysostomides said. The teenager\u2019s mother has backed calls for a tourism boycott of the country. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday: \u201cThe place isn\u2019t safe, it is absolutely not safe.

An online crowdfunding appeal to raise money for legal support for the teenager has passed \u00a3120,000, exceeding its \u00a3105,000 goal.

That\u2019s why they stay taboo. People straight away, particularly with a comedian, if you\u2019re joking about a subject, they think you\u2019re anti it as opposed to pro it.\u201d</p> <p>This year\u2019s ceremony will also be going vegan for the first time, with \u201ca 100% plant-based meal\u201d served to attendees. \u201cIt was a little shocking when first mentioned, because of being very close to the actual Globes and having already decided on a menu,\u201d Matthew Morgan, the executive chef at the Beverly Hilton, said. \u201cBut once we thought about it and the message that it sent, we were really excited about it.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Ruffalo has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkRuffalo/status/1212762937691168768\">tweeted</a> his support for the shift, writing that the HFPA \u201cshould be commended for this and all the other awards shows should follow suit\u201d.</p> <p>While the Globes has been seen as an important predictor for the Oscars, the voting base is made up of about 90 voters compared to more than 6,000 members of the Academy.

He has revealed that he plans not to let the current climate affect his routine this time around. \u201cPeople like the idea of freedom of speech until they hear something they don\u2019t like,\u201d he said to the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cSo there\u2019s still a pressure, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to water it down or back down and not say what I want.\u201d Gervais has come under fire in recent years for transphobic jokes both on stage and on Twitter. Last month, he was criticised for a number of tweets attacking trans women, writing: \u201cWe need to protect the rights of women. Not erode them because some men have found a new cunning way to dominate and demonise an entire sex.\u201d In the same Hollywood Reporter interview, Gervais reiterated that he isn\u2019t transphobic but does believe that jokes about the trans community shouldn\u2019t be avoided. \u201cI can justify the jokes, but I get it,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people, when you deal with contentious issues or taboo subjects, the very mention of them is the sacrilege. That\u2019s why they stay taboo. People straight away, particularly with a comedian, if you\u2019re joking about a subject, they think you\u2019re anti it as opposed to pro it.\u201d This year\u2019s ceremony will also be going vegan for the first time, with \u201ca 100% plant-based meal\u201d served to attendees. \u201cIt was a little shocking when first mentioned, because of being very close to the actual Globes and having already decided on a menu,\u201d Matthew Morgan, the executive chef at the Beverly Hilton, said. \u201cBut once we thought about it and the message that it sent, we were really excited about it.\u201d Mark Ruffalo has tweeted his support for the shift, writing that the HFPA \u201cshould be commended for this and all the other awards shows should follow suit\u201d. While the Globes has been seen as an important predictor for the Oscars, the voting base is made up of about 90 voters compared to more than 6,000 members of the Academy. Last year saw Green Book, Rami Malek and Olivia Colman win at both ceremonies. This year\u2019s big screen acting categories are likely to produce wins for Brad Pitt as best supporting actor for Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, Renee Zellweger for best actress in a drama for Judy and Adam Driver for best actor in a drama for Marriage Story. Jennifer Lopez and Laura Dern will face off in the best supporting actress category for their roles in Hustlers and Marriage Story respectively. There was criticism following the announcement of this year\u2019s nominations for the lack of female representation in both the best director and best screenplay categories despite acclaimed films from Greta Gerwig (Little Women), Lorene Scafaria (Hustlers) and Marielle Heller (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood). \u201cWhat happened is that we don\u2019t vote by gender,\u201d the HFPA\u2019s president, Lorenzo Soria, said to Variety. \u201cWe vote by film and accomplishment.\u201d The small screen awards could see Jennifer Aniston named best actress in a drama series for Apple\u2019s critically divisive The Morning Show while Phoebe Waller-Bridge is favourite to win best actress in a comedy for the second season of Fleabag. It\u2019s also set to be a major night for Netflix, entering the evening with a record 17 nominations, including their first best picture nods. This year\u2019s Oscar nominations will be announced on 13 January and the ceremony will take place on 9 February.",

The insatiable appetites of the digital age and the sheer quantity of music that fills out Spotify\u2019s weekly New Music Friday playlist make it harder than ever to cut through the noise.

      "body": "<p>At the top of a wind-scoured hill outside Edinburgh, Jasmin Paris\u2019s dog, Moss, patiently waits for his owner. He is, I think, wondering what on earth is taking her so long. The answer, I\u2019m afraid, is me. </p> <p>We are in the Pentland Hills near her home \u2013 easy terrain for a skilled fell runner. For me, it\u2019s a painful reminder that road marathons and track races do not help in the hills. I spend my clumsy descents looking at my feet, and each time I look up, Paris is defying gravity \u2013 not so much dropping as floating down.</p> <p>In January, Paris, then 35, made headlines across the globe when she won the <a href=\"https://thespinerace.com/\" title=\"\">Spine Race</a>, one of those almost comically difficult events that sounds less like a run and more like a sadistic punishment: 268 miles, nonstop, along the Pennine Way. Paris took a week off from her PhD in veterinary science to compete, and thrashed every man in the field in the process.</p> <p>The race is billed as the world\u2019s toughest endurance contest, and with good reason. It\u2019s dark two-thirds of the time. Racers traverse the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, North Pennines and cross over Hadrian\u2019s Wall to the <a href=\"https://www.visitnorthumberland.com/northumberland-national-park/cheviot-hills\" title=\"\">Cheviots</a>, sleeping only in snatches. Yet Paris\u2019s time of 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds beat her nearest male rival by nearly 15 hours. And she did it while expressing milk for her baby daughter in aid stations en route \u2013 ensuring more than her allotted 15 minutes of fame when she crossed the line. But it\u2019s a fame she clearly finds a little baffling: it\u2019s a fair bet no one has taken up fell running in a bid to become rich or famous.</p> <p>\u201cThat last day of the race, in the Cheviots, was so remote and so, so beautiful,\u201d she tells me. Where we are in the Pentlands feels fairly remote on a windy day, but it is only a bus ride from Edinburgh town centre. \u201cI think I saw one person in about 10 hours. It was one of those mountain days that you remember for ever. I had stopped thinking about the outside world. It\u2019s a simple existence: you put one foot in front of the other and keep going. Emerging from the darkness to what came after \u2013 the whole world seemingly wanting to talk to you \u2013 was such a stark contrast. But that wasn\u2019t the reason I wanted to do it. It was a challenge, a personal challenge.\u201d The thing is, I think that might be why she won.</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b53b865237ae578926d3d2ec8826dd783b254c48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b53b865237ae578926d3d2ec8826dd783b254c48/0_45_3008_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Thomas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Thomas crossing the Channel in 2012.<strong> </strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Becky Baxter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it comes to speed, men will always be first across the line. No woman will outsprint Usain Bolt. No woman will hit the side of the pool ahead of Michael Phelps\u2019s world records. Yet a remarkable phenomenon seems to have gathered pace over the past few years: the longer and more brutal the event, the more women seem to be winning outright, or surpassing men\u2019s achievements.</p> <p>In September this year, the US swimmer Sarah Thomas (already holder of the world record for the longest open-water swim) completed another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/17/cancer-survivor-sarah-thomas-first-person-swim-channel-four-times-non-stop\" title=\"\">breathtaking feat of endurance</a>. The Channel Swimming Association records 1,652 solo, observed, unassisted swims (no neoprene wetsuits or flotation devices) of the Channel since 1875. Thirty-four people have swum it there and back without stopping. Four people have swum it three times in a row (two men, two women). But only one \u2013 Thomas \u2013 has swum it four times. It took her 54 hours and 10 minutes, and though the crossing at its narrowest point is 20 miles, because of the strong tides pushing against her, she actually swam not 80 but close to 130 miles.</p> <p>This was despite battling nausea and throwing up everything she ate for the first two crossings. A day into her swim, she was almost ready to bail, but her team told her: just keep going. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I did,\u201d she said. \u201cI swam until the sun came up and I started to feel better.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not only Paris and Thomas. Last month Maggie Guteri became the first woman to win the peculiarly sadistic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/jan/30/a-loop-eternal-welcome-to-the-big-dog-backyard-ultra\" title=\"\">Big Dog Backyard Ultra</a> in Tennessee. The distance is not even set \u2013 it\u2019s a case of last man or woman standing. She ran for 60 hours and covered 250 miles. This year, German cyclist Fiona Kolbinger won the <a href=\"https://www.transcontinental.cc/\" title=\"\">Transcontinental</a> race \u2013 2,485 miles across Europe. And in 2018, British fell runner Nicky Spinks set a record for the course in the Lake District known as the <a href=\"https://www.inov-8.com/blog/nicky-spinks-double-bob-graham-record/\" title=\"\">Double Bob Graham </a><a href=\"https://www.inov-8.com/blog/nicky-spinks-double-bob-graham-record/\" title=\"\">Round</a> (one circuit of 42 fells, 66 miles and 26,900ft of ascent isn\u2019t enough). Most of these women aren\u2019t even full-time athletes: Paris got up at 4am to fit her Spine Race training in. Spinks is a farmer. Kolbinger is a medical researcher.</p> <p>So what is going on here? Are we witnessing the beginning of a brave new world, or are these extraordinary women simply outliers?</p> <p>***</p> <p>Those looking for a definitive scientific answer may be disappointed. Until about the age of 10, girls and boys are, athletically speaking, the same. Top running speed is the same for boys and girls, as is top swimming speed. Then puberty happens and testosterone changes everything. By 14, boys have bigger hearts, stronger arms, bigger shoulders, longer limbs, greater muscle mass. More power, and more speed, for life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d4c85987e92c7463e4e26cc5f3053a72510fe8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d4c85987e92c7463e4e26cc5f3053a72510fe8a/9_5_1266_760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Thomas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas swims Lake Champlain, New York, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Classen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2010, Israeli physicist Ira Hammerman set out to look at records in 82 different sports, ranging from running to speed skating, to see if there was a pattern to the resultant \u201cperformance gap\u201d. In every sport, across every distance, <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/ssuser7d8e6c/the-almost-constant-ratio-of-record-speeds-for-women-vs-men-elite-athletes-a-comparison-over-distances-and-multiple-sports\" title=\"\">a clear </a><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/ssuser7d8e6c/the-almost-constant-ratio-of-record-speeds-for-women-vs-men-elite-athletes-a-comparison-over-distances-and-multiple-sports\" title=\"\">difference emerged</a>: women\u2019s speed records are about 9-11% slower than men\u2019s.</p> <p>However, when it comes to very long endurance events, the data is limited. While ultrarunning is experiencing something of an explosion in popularity, there aren\u2019t that many 200-mile-plus races, and relatively few women are running them.</p> <p>So is it not possible that after a certain mileage the relative advantages that male hormones bring just, well, run out? The renowned <a href=\"https://sportsscientists.com/who-are-we/\" title=\"\">sports scientist Ross Tucker</a> is doubtful. He points out that the success rate among women in ultra-distance races is probably down to the fact that these are niche events \u2013 the tiny numbers of ultra-committed female athletes who do compete make any kind of analysis or extrapolation meaningless. However, intriguingly, he does wonder whether a woman\u2019s body composition might prove to be an advantage when it comes to long-distance swimming. \u201cThe higher relative body fat percentage is probably enough to offset the differences in strength between men and women, particularly for cold water,\u201d he says. A higher body fat percentage helps in buoyancy, which in turn reduces energy expenditure. It also helps insulate in cold water.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the theory that women do so well in ultra races because they are better than men at burning fat for fuel \u2013 making them more efficient. But if that were true, Tucker would expect the gap between the sexes to narrow as the reliance on fat gets larger \u2013 which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of the male narrative is about pain and suffering and the pain cave and the glory of pain. Oh God, it\u2019s so boring</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn running, from 100 metres to 90 kilometre ultramarathons, the gap between men and women doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he says. \u201cThat said, it could be that there is a kind of \u2018inflection\u2019 point where suddenly it begins to count. The data is just too thin to know for sure.\u201d</p> <p>But if women win because of who else does or doesn\u2019t turn up \u2013 how did Paris do so by such a margin? After all, when she won the Spine, the second-place finisher was Eoin Keith, a previous winner and the holder of the course record she smashed \u2013 hardly an average competitor. The answer may lie less in the body than in the head.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Paris doesn\u2019t run for prizes. She \u2013 like Thomas, who works for a healthcare company in Colorado \u2013 is an amateur, with a full-time job. If every single fell race in the country were called off tomorrow, she\u2019d still be up in those hills every day. She tells me about holidays spent there in her late teens and early 20s with her brother. They\u2019d pack everything they needed to be self-sufficient for a week, go to the remotest hills and hike, eat, sleep, repeat. She hasn\u2019t raced a huge amount since January\u2019s Spine Race, but in the summer she, her husband and a friend completed the Petite Trotte \u00e0 L\u00e9on (<a href=\"https://utmbmontblanc.com/en/page/23/23.html\" title=\"\">PTL</a>). Part of ultrarunning\u2019s biggest event \u2013 the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) \u2013 the PTL is not so much a race as an endurance adventure. The 300km route passes through France, Italy and Switzerland, and includes 25,000m of ascent. \u201cIt was kind of a holiday,\u201d Paris says, smiling.</p> <p>I suspect it\u2019s not most people\u2019s idea of a relaxing week. But it reminds me of a conversation I had with the cyclist <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/where-there-s-a-will-9781788161510.html\" title=\"\">Emily Chappell</a>, who was the first woman across the line in the 2016 Transcontinental, and has herself been pondering the question of what can lead to women outperforming men.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this bee in my bonnet about the current narrative for cycling \u2013 the male narrative,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of it is about pain and suffering and the pain cave and the glory of pain and seeking out pain. Oh God, it\u2019s so boring. So the working theory I\u2019ve come up with is that people who do endurance sport are often people who have quite comfortable lives, and they are almost looking for pain elsewhere. I know it\u2019s making generalisations, but what if men are looking for the pain they lack in life, and women are looking for the freedom?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39e7b3302fd541a2fcdd2625b2228ef630808c84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39e7b3302fd541a2fcdd2625b2228ef630808c84/335_1161_6042_7553/800.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Chappell\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Chappell near Cheddar Gorge in Somerset: \u2018In cycling, women are looking for the freedom they lack in life.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a persuasive theory. So many endurance events are marketed with a hefty dash of machismo \u2013 \u201ctough\u201d this, \u201cultimate\u201d that, \u201cwarrior\u201d the other. But is this constant reminder of suffering really the best way to approach an ultra event, when managing your head is as \u2013 if not more \u2013 important than managing your body? If you buy into this narrative that you are here only to suffer and endure, rather than have fun, then maybe those who start relaxed, looking forward to the journey, might have a head start.</p> <p>Perhaps this sounds a little woolly. But Thomas agrees that, for her, swimming is about freedom, not glory. \u201cThis is exactly me!\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about racing and winning \u2013 I just like pushing myself. The long open-water swims make me feel free and strong. To look across the Channel and say, \u2018I swam that\u2019 is really empowering. I love being alone in a large body of water, knowing I\u2019m relying on myself to make it through.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://performanceinmind.co.uk/about/\" title=\"\">Dr Josephine Perry</a>, a sports psychologist and author of Performing Under Pressure, goes a step further. She believes women are better at dealing with pain. \u201cEighty per cent of women get period pain at some point in their lives and around 10% have conditions like endometriosis, which can severely impact their ability to perform in sport,\u201d she says. \u201cIf a large majority of women have developed strong coping mechanisms to deal with this regular pain, then the short-term pain they feel when running a race will fade in comparison.\u201d</p> <p>Sports psychologists also often talk about \u201cthe process, not the outcome\u201d \u2013 enjoying, or at least staying in, the moment. Thomas clearly embraces this. \u201cI was always weird during my competitive swimming days. I loved the training more than the racing,\u201d she says. Perry believes this mindset can, perhaps contrary to expectations, create winners. \u201cSomething I see regularly with athletes is that when you are expected to do well, it adds a significant pressure,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen there are no expectations we relax and can enjoy the process of seeing what is possible, rather than worrying about failing. These women may well see the event as \u2018just a race\u2019 in which they can see what is possible, rather than openly and loudly setting out to win it. This can be incredibly beneficial to performance.\u201d</p> <p>Then there is the question of pride. Even when women do not win outright, they often perform better than men: better, in that a higher proportion of women finish ultra events successfully. And ego \u2013 or rather a lack of one \u2013 may be a key factor.</p> <p>Paris tells me about another infamous ultra race she ran in 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.berghausdragonsbackrace.com/\" title=\"\">Dragon\u2019s Back</a>: five days, 315km and 15,500m of ascent in the Welsh mountains. \u201cOne of my role models is Helene Diamantides, one of the pioneers of women\u2019s fell running. She said to us at the start of the race: look around the room. If you are a man, you have a 50% chance of finishing the race. If you\u2019re a woman, you have a 90% chance. But then, there were far fewer women in the room. Because they have less ego, they wouldn\u2019t turn up unless they were well-prepared. Whereas men can be a bit like, how hard can this be?\u201d</p> <p>Thomas agrees. \u201cI think women do train harder, generally, and are less likely to wing something than the guys are,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember seeing something a few years ago that ran some numbers as related to speed. There are more guys who do longer swims, so there is a wider range of times, more variation. There are fewer women, but we seem to be more consistent.\u201d</p> <p>It is backed up, too, by data from less extreme events. In marathon running, we know that women are on average <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jan/20/women-are-better-than-men-at-marathon-pacing-says-new-research\" title=\"\">better pacers</a>. Not faster overall, just better at running evenly: less likely to go out too hard and \u201cblow up\u201d. And whether it\u2019s 26.2 miles or 262, going out too hard can be the worst mistake you can make.</p> <p>\u201cIn something like the Spine Race, it\u2019s not even just about being able to run a long way,\u201d Paris says. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that you need to look after yourself. You need to eat enough, feed yourself, look after your feet. I think sometimes the men, maybe their egos give them a single-mindedness and focus.

      "bodyText": "At the top of a wind-scoured hill outside Edinburgh, Jasmin Paris\u2019s dog, Moss, patiently waits for his owner. He is, I think, wondering what on earth is taking her so long. The answer, I\u2019m afraid, is me. We are in the Pentland Hills near her home \u2013 easy terrain for a skilled fell runner. For me, it\u2019s a painful reminder that road marathons and track races do not help in the hills. I spend my clumsy descents looking at my feet, and each time I look up, Paris is defying gravity \u2013 not so much dropping as floating down. In January, Paris, then 35, made headlines across the globe when she won the Spine Race, one of those almost comically difficult events that sounds less like a run and more like a sadistic punishment: 268 miles, nonstop, along the Pennine Way. Paris took a week off from her PhD in veterinary science to compete, and thrashed every man in the field in the process. The race is billed as the world\u2019s toughest endurance contest, and with good reason. It\u2019s dark two-thirds of the time. Racers traverse the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, North Pennines and cross over Hadrian\u2019s Wall to the Cheviots, sleeping only in snatches. Yet Paris\u2019s time of 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds beat her nearest male rival by nearly 15 hours. And she did it while expressing milk for her baby daughter in aid stations en route \u2013 ensuring more than her allotted 15 minutes of fame when she crossed the line. But it\u2019s a fame she clearly finds a little baffling: it\u2019s a fair bet no one has taken up fell running in a bid to become rich or famous. \u201cThat last day of the race, in the Cheviots, was so remote and so, so beautiful,\u201d she tells me. Where we are in the Pentlands feels fairly remote on a windy day, but it is only a bus ride from Edinburgh town centre. \u201cI think I saw one person in about 10 hours. It was one of those mountain days that you remember for ever. I had stopped thinking about the outside world. It\u2019s a simple existence: you put one foot in front of the other and keep going. Emerging from the darkness to what came after \u2013 the whole world seemingly wanting to talk to you \u2013 was such a stark contrast. But that wasn\u2019t the reason I wanted to do it. It was a challenge, a personal challenge.\u201d The thing is, I think that might be why she won. *** When it comes to speed, men will always be first across the line. No woman will outsprint Usain Bolt. No woman will hit the side of the pool ahead of Michael Phelps\u2019s world records. Yet a remarkable phenomenon seems to have gathered pace over the past few years: the longer and more brutal the event, the more women seem to be winning outright, or surpassing men\u2019s achievements. In September this year, the US swimmer Sarah Thomas (already holder of the world record for the longest open-water swim) completed another breathtaking feat of endurance. The Channel Swimming Association records 1,652 solo, observed, unassisted swims (no neoprene wetsuits or flotation devices) of the Channel since 1875. Thirty-four people have swum it there and back without stopping. Four people have swum it three times in a row (two men, two women). But only one \u2013 Thomas \u2013 has swum it four times. It took her 54 hours and 10 minutes, and though the crossing at its narrowest point is 20 miles, because of the strong tides pushing against her, she actually swam not 80 but close to 130 miles. This was despite battling nausea and throwing up everything she ate for the first two crossings. A day into her swim, she was almost ready to bail, but her team told her: just keep going. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I did,\u201d she said. \u201cI swam until the sun came up and I started to feel better.\u201d It\u2019s not only Paris and Thomas. Last month Maggie Guteri became the first woman to win the peculiarly sadistic Big Dog Backyard Ultra in Tennessee. The distance is not even set \u2013 it\u2019s a case of last man or woman standing. She ran for 60 hours and covered 250 miles. This year, German cyclist Fiona Kolbinger won the Transcontinental race \u2013 2,485 miles across Europe. And in 2018, British fell runner Nicky Spinks set a record for the course in the Lake District known as the Double Bob Graham Round (one circuit of 42 fells, 66 miles and 26,900ft of ascent isn\u2019t enough). Most of these women aren\u2019t even full-time athletes: Paris got up at 4am to fit her Spine Race training in. Spinks is a farmer. Kolbinger is a medical researcher. So what is going on here? Are we witnessing the beginning of a brave new world, or are these extraordinary women simply outliers? *** Those looking for a definitive scientific answer may be disappointed. Until about the age of 10, girls and boys are, athletically speaking, the same. Top running speed is the same for boys and girls, as is top swimming speed. Then puberty happens and testosterone changes everything. By 14, boys have bigger hearts, stronger arms, bigger shoulders, longer limbs, greater muscle mass. More power, and more speed, for life. In 2010, Israeli physicist Ira Hammerman set out to look at records in 82 different sports, ranging from running to speed skating, to see if there was a pattern to the resultant \u201cperformance gap\u201d. In every sport, across every distance, a clear difference emerged: women\u2019s speed records are about 9-11% slower than men\u2019s. However, when it comes to very long endurance events, the data is limited. While ultrarunning is experiencing something of an explosion in popularity, there aren\u2019t that many 200-mile-plus races, and relatively few women are running them. So is it not possible that after a certain mileage the relative advantages that male hormones bring just, well, run out? The renowned sports scientist Ross Tucker is doubtful. He points out that the success rate among women in ultra-distance races is probably down to the fact that these are niche events \u2013 the tiny numbers of ultra-committed female athletes who do compete make any kind of analysis or extrapolation meaningless. However, intriguingly, he does wonder whether a woman\u2019s body composition might prove to be an advantage when it comes to long-distance swimming. \u201cThe higher relative body fat percentage is probably enough to offset the differences in strength between men and women, particularly for cold water,\u201d he says. A higher body fat percentage helps in buoyancy, which in turn reduces energy expenditure. It also helps insulate in cold water. Then there\u2019s the theory that women do so well in ultra races because they are better than men at burning fat for fuel \u2013 making them more efficient. But if that were true, Tucker would expect the gap between the sexes to narrow as the reliance on fat gets larger \u2013 which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. \u201cIn running, from 100 metres to 90 kilometre ultramarathons, the gap between men and women doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he says. \u201cThat said, it could be that there is a kind of \u2018inflection\u2019 point where suddenly it begins to count. The data is just too thin to know for sure.\u201d But if women win because of who else does or doesn\u2019t turn up \u2013 how did Paris do so by such a margin? After all, when she won the Spine, the second-place finisher was Eoin Keith, a previous winner and the holder of the course record she smashed \u2013 hardly an average competitor. The answer may lie less in the body than in the head. *** Paris doesn\u2019t run for prizes. She \u2013 like Thomas, who works for a healthcare company in Colorado \u2013 is an amateur, with a full-time job. If every single fell race in the country were called off tomorrow, she\u2019d still be up in those hills every day. She tells me about holidays spent there in her late teens and early 20s with her brother. They\u2019d pack everything they needed to be self-sufficient for a week, go to the remotest hills and hike, eat, sleep, repeat. She hasn\u2019t raced a huge amount since January\u2019s Spine Race, but in the summer she, her husband and a friend completed the Petite Trotte \u00e0 L\u00e9on (PTL). Part of ultrarunning\u2019s biggest event \u2013 the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) \u2013 the PTL is not so much a race as an endurance adventure. The 300km route passes through France, Italy and Switzerland, and includes 25,000m of ascent. \u201cIt was kind of a holiday,\u201d Paris says, smiling. I suspect it\u2019s not most people\u2019s idea of a relaxing week. But it reminds me of a conversation I had with the cyclist Emily Chappell, who was the first woman across the line in the 2016 Transcontinental, and has herself been pondering the question of what can lead to women outperforming men. \u201cI\u2019ve got this bee in my bonnet about the current narrative for cycling \u2013 the male narrative,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of it is about pain and suffering and the pain cave and the glory of pain and seeking out pain. Oh God, it\u2019s so boring. So the working theory I\u2019ve come up with is that people who do endurance sport are often people who have quite comfortable lives, and they are almost looking for pain elsewhere. I know it\u2019s making generalisations, but what if men are looking for the pain they lack in life, and women are looking for the freedom?\u201d It\u2019s a persuasive theory. So many endurance events are marketed with a hefty dash of machismo \u2013 \u201ctough\u201d this, \u201cultimate\u201d that, \u201cwarrior\u201d the other. But is this constant reminder of suffering really the best way to approach an ultra event, when managing your head is as \u2013 if not more \u2013 important than managing your body? If you buy into this narrative that you are here only to suffer and endure, rather than have fun, then maybe those who start relaxed, looking forward to the journey, might have a head start. Perhaps this sounds a little woolly. But Thomas agrees that, for her, swimming is about freedom, not glory. \u201cThis is exactly me!\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about racing and winning \u2013 I just like pushing myself. The long open-water swims make me feel free and strong. To look across the Channel and say, \u2018I swam that\u2019 is really empowering. I love being alone in a large body of water, knowing I\u2019m relying on myself to make it through.\u201d Dr Josephine Perry, a sports psychologist and author of Performing Under Pressure, goes a step further. She believes women are better at dealing with pain. \u201cEighty per cent of women get period pain at some point in their lives and around 10% have conditions like endometriosis, which can severely impact their ability to perform in sport,\u201d she says. \u201cIf a large majority of women have developed strong coping mechanisms to deal with this regular pain, then the short-term pain they feel when running a race will fade in comparison.\u201d Sports psychologists also often talk about \u201cthe process, not the outcome\u201d \u2013 enjoying, or at least staying in, the moment. Thomas clearly embraces this. \u201cI was always weird during my competitive swimming days. I loved the training more than the racing,\u201d she says. Perry believes this mindset can, perhaps contrary to expectations, create winners. \u201cSomething I see regularly with athletes is that when you are expected to do well, it adds a significant pressure,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen there are no expectations we relax and can enjoy the process of seeing what is possible, rather than worrying about failing. These women may well see the event as \u2018just a race\u2019 in which they can see what is possible, rather than openly and loudly setting out to win it. This can be incredibly beneficial to performance.\u201d Then there is the question of pride. Even when women do not win outright, they often perform better than men: better, in that a higher proportion of women finish ultra events successfully. And ego \u2013 or rather a lack of one \u2013 may be a key factor. Paris tells me about another infamous ultra race she ran in 2015, the Dragon\u2019s Back: five days, 315km and 15,500m of ascent in the Welsh mountains. \u201cOne of my role models is Helene Diamantides, one of the pioneers of women\u2019s fell running. She said to us at the start of the race: look around the room. If you are a man, you have a 50% chance of finishing the race. If you\u2019re a woman, you have a 90% chance. But then, there were far fewer women in the room. Because they have less ego, they wouldn\u2019t turn up unless they were well-prepared. Whereas men can be a bit like, how hard can this be?\u201d Thomas agrees. \u201cI think women do train harder, generally, and are less likely to wing something than the guys are,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember seeing something a few years ago that ran some numbers as related to speed. There are more guys who do longer swims, so there is a wider range of times, more variation. There are fewer women, but we seem to be more consistent.\u201d It is backed up, too, by data from less extreme events. In marathon running, we know that women are on average better pacers. Not faster overall, just better at running evenly: less likely to go out too hard and \u201cblow up\u201d. And whether it\u2019s 26.2 miles or 262, going out too hard can be the worst mistake you can make. \u201cIn something like the Spine Race, it\u2019s not even just about being able to run a long way,\u201d Paris says. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that you need to look after yourself. You need to eat enough, feed yourself, look after your feet. I think sometimes the men, maybe their egos give them a single-mindedness and focus. But that\u2019s almost a disadvantage, because actually, in an event that long you have to be able to multitask, to think about lots of things, to navigate [to look after yourself].\u201d So having the biggest heart, and the highest oxygen uptake, might make you quickest over a certain distance but it won\u2019t necessarily help you over days of endurance. Yet as Tucker suggests, if there is one sport in which women do narrow that performance gap it is ultra-endurance swimming. Over distances of 16-36km, women are generally only 1-6% slower. And in two long-distance swims, the Catalina Channel (32k) and the Manhattan Island Marathon Swim (45.9km) \u2013 both of which Thomas has completed \u2013 the fastest women ever were faster than the best-performing men. As Tucker suggests, perhaps women\u2019s body fat and its more even distribution is an advantage \u2013 fat is buoyant so aids flotation. But Thomas is not one to explore the theories. \u201cI haven\u2019t really looked into the science,\u201d she says. \u201cI just try to accept that my body is strong and can handle cold, no matter how much I hate my love handles.\u201d *** Of course, women beating men is hardly new. In any race, some women will finish faster than some men \u2013 there\u2019s even a phrase for it in the athlete\u2019s lexicon: being \u201cchicked\u201d. It is not something all men take well. Even in my own career as a club runner, I\u2019ve encountered a few who are clearly rankled by it, including a man who refused to let me run faster than him on a simple run commute home, to the point where he ended up throwing up under a tree because he\u2019d pushed himself so hard. And I\u2019ve also lost count of the number of races where the second half has been spent overtaking enthusiastic runners who set off too fast \u2013 99% of them male. Fortunately, hostility is the exception. Thomas points out that swimming has a longer history of equality than most sports. \u201cGertrude Ederle was the first woman to swim the Channel in the late 1920s, while the first female to run a marathon didn\u2019t come along until the 70s. So women swimmers have a decades-longer tradition of being accepted than runners do. \u201cI think most men are in awe of the women they swim with,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey seem to accept that we\u2019re just as tough, just as fast.

We also talk about Emelie Forsberg, a star of the ultrarunning world, with multiple wins to her name. Recently she had a baby with her partner, Kilian Jornet \u2013 himself probably the closest thing ultrarunning has to a household name. Forsberg was posting on Instagram about her return to competition in the Courmayeur-Champex-Chamonix (CCC; part of the UTMB race series), which would take her about 12 hours. Paris says she immediately spotted one reply asking: \u201cWhen you run for 12 hours, who looks after your baby?

The visitors made five changes to the side that was rolled over in Melbourne, the \u201couts\u201d including injured stars Kane Williamson and Trent Boult. That meant a callow XI featuring two frontline spinners; so of course stand-in skipper Tom Latham lost the toss and was forced to bowl first on a docile pitch under cloudless skies.</p> <p>The popgun Kiwi attack celebrated the wicket of Joe Burns (18) before lunch and David Warner (45) shortly afterwards but they then had to admire another massive partnership between Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith. Labuschagne, who remains unbeaten on 130, batted superbly all day for his fourth Test century this summer. He offered a couple of edges through the cordon but they went into gaps that were not plugged. He scored heavily on the on-side but most handsomely through the off, cover-driving gloriously at regular intervals.</p> <p>By contrast, Smith took an age to get in, and 39 balls to even get off the mark. Once he settled he looked assured without being fluent, but again found the doldrums late in his innings before eventually perishing for 63, edging the second new ball to first slip. </p> <p>Colin de Grandhomme took two of the wickets to fall, Neil Wagner the other, but it was a long day in the field for New Zealand who bowled without penetration and fielded without intensity. Tomorrow, with temperatures pushing 40C, promises to be even more punishing. To find out what happens Adam Collins and I will be right here to steer you through the day\u2019s play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73beb84d31fe6d711582b9c8840b7cca2adf64cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73beb84d31fe6d711582b9c8840b7cca2adf64cc/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marnus Labuschagne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia\u2019s Marnus Labuschagne batted superbly on day one of the third Test.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cornaga/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-03T07:01:47.719Z\">at 7.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e0ee2348f087e8308e67c00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-03T06:45:53.289Z\">6.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90th over: Australia 283-3 (Labuschagne 130, Wade 22) </strong>Matt Henry sends down a maiden to wrap things up for the day. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-03T06:46:05.003Z\">at 6.46am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e0ee0fc8f085eda5c1115b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-03T06:41:36.664Z\">6.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>89th over: Australia 283-3 (Labuschagne 130, Wade 22) </strong>A distinct absence of fire and brimstone from Wagner in his last spell of the day, and it concludes with Australia\u2019s batsmen exchanging singles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RicFinlay/status/1212986122218823682\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Crowd, Day 1, SCG: 36,420.<br><br>Last year, v India, it was 33,678.</p>&mdash; Ric Finlay (@RicFinlay) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RicFinlay/status/1212986122218823682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 3, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e0ee0228f08c39722643f50\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-03T06:36:27.066Z\">6.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>88th over: Australia 280-3 (Labuschagne 129, Wade 20) </strong>Henry back into the fray and he settles quickly into a tidy line and length in an over that features two singles.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e0edf348f085eda5c1115ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-03T06:32:48.930Z\">6.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>87th over: Australia 278-3 (Labuschagne 128, Wade 19) </strong>Wagner is lacking spite in his final spell of the day and Wade is delighted, rocking back and slapping a short ball through mid-on for four, then hoicking a pull for six, before pulling through midwicket for four more!

One of those batsmen is Marnus Labuschagne, who reaches 50 for the sixth time in seven innings this summer with a push into the off-side that some good running turns into three runs. Smith then gets in on the act by cutting another four after engineering some width by dropping deep in his crease. </p> <p>Raf from Melbourne has taken the contrarian position on the excellent bowling of Neil Wagner. \u201cWhen you say Wagner cannot be faulted, is it ok if we fault him for only having such good figures because he\u2019s being allowed to flagrantly break the laws of cricket on number of bouncers an over and on negative leg side bowling? He is doing a tremendous job of maintaining accuracy over long spells of this awful tactic, no doubt, but if he\u2019s allowed to keep doing it we\u2019re going to see every team in world cricket doing this and Tests turn into slow-scoring borefests. There\u2019s a reason that limited over cricket has even harsher restrictions on bowling like this, but Test cricket has rules against it too. I\u2019m impressed by bowlers who beat batsmen by bowling within the laws. I\u2019m not impressed with this whole Wagner love-in when his whole tactic is to just bowl in a way that is so artificially difficult to hit that it would trigger instant wide calls in limited over cricket, until the batsmen get bored and frustrated.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s almost as though we need some independent arbiters out there to determine if Wagner is breaking any laws.

I\u2019m hoping 2020 will see Woakes and Henry and their brand of quiet excellence shine.\u201d</p> <p>To an extent, I agree. Henry does plenty right. But I do understand why Ferguson got the chance at Perth before everything went wrong. I\u2019m not sure we line up on the same view of Archer, either. He had to play the moment he was eligible.

With the unfolding disaster taking place across the east of New South Wales and Victoria, it does feel a fraction odd that we\u2019re gearing up for a Test Match in Sydney. Of course, there is a chance that the smoke from the bushfires will mean that some of the cricket is lost - that\u2019s been made clear. But if it is rain that takes them off the field, there will be universal celebration. Fingers crossed. </p> <p>It\u2019s with that unusual sentence, and tragic sentiment, that I welcome you to the third and final Test Match of this series between Australia and New Zealand - the last of the home summer for the hosts. They have won four from four so far, hammering Pakistan two-zip, that the current state of this series as well. From a World Test Championship perspective, a clean sweep here means plenty in terms of giving themselves the best chance of appearing in that Lord\u2019s final next June. </p> <p>The news from the SCG is that there is a lot going on in the New Zealand camp. I can confirm that Kane Williamson and Henry Nicholls <em>are</em> at the ground and are training now to decide whether they are well enough to play after picking up a nasty bug over the last few days. Mitchell Santner, however, is not. He\u2019s out. </p> <p>That means that Will Somerville will get his chance to play a Test Match on the ground that has so long been his home venue in Sydney. Of course, the off-spinner spent the bulk of his professional career as a NSW tweaker before making the move to New Zealand where the 35-year-old has played three Test Matches. He might have Todd Astle, the 33-year-old leggie, for company. We\u2019ll know soon. Matt Henry, the experienced seamer, will come in for Trent Boult, who fractured his hand while batting during the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne last week. </p> <p>There\u2019s also Glenn Phillips, who has arrived from Auckland as a back-up batting option for Williamson and/or Nicholls if either of those players are ruled out before the toss. The 23-year-old right-hander has played 11 T20Is but never a Test. He averages 43 at First Class level. By contrast to the hyperactivity, injury and illness in the Kiwi camp, Australia are surely going in unchanged. Buckle up! <br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here is the report of day one at the SCG. New Zealand\u2019s disastrous tour plumbed new depths on the opening day of the Sydney Test. The visitors made five changes to the side that was rolled over in Melbourne, the \u201couts\u201d including injured stars Kane Williamson and Trent Boult. That meant a callow XI featuring two frontline spinners; so of course stand-in skipper Tom Latham lost the toss and was forced to bowl first on a docile pitch under cloudless skies. The popgun Kiwi attack celebrated the wicket of Joe Burns (18) before lunch and David Warner (45) shortly afterwards but they then had to admire another massive partnership between Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith. Labuschagne, who remains unbeaten on 130, batted superbly all day for his fourth Test century this summer. He offered a couple of edges through the cordon but they went into gaps that were not plugged. He scored heavily on the on-side but most handsomely through the off, cover-driving gloriously at regular intervals. By contrast, Smith took an age to get in, and 39 balls to even get off the mark. Once he settled he looked assured without being fluent, but again found the doldrums late in his innings before eventually perishing for 63, edging the second new ball to first slip. Colin de Grandhomme took two of the wickets to fall, Neil Wagner the other, but it was a long day in the field for New Zealand who bowled without penetration and fielded without intensity. Tomorrow, with temperatures pushing 40C, promises to be even more punishing. To find out what happens Adam Collins and I will be right here to steer you through the day\u2019s play. 90th over: Australia 283-3 (Labuschagne 130, Wade 22) Matt Henry sends down a maiden to wrap things up for the day. 89th over: Australia 283-3 (Labuschagne 130, Wade 22) A distinct absence of fire and brimstone from Wagner in his last spell of the day, and it concludes with Australia\u2019s batsmen exchanging singles. 88th over: Australia 280-3 (Labuschagne 129, Wade 20) Henry back into the fray and he settles quickly into a tidy line and length in an over that features two singles. 87th over: Australia 278-3 (Labuschagne 128, Wade 19) Wagner is lacking spite in his final spell of the day and Wade is delighted, rocking back and slapping a short ball through mid-on for four, then hoicking a pull for six, before pulling through midwicket for four more! That will give Australia\u2019s no.5 plenty of satisfaction after their summer-long duel. 86th over: Australia 264-3 (Labuschagne 128, Wade 5) CdG continues, this time around the wicket to Wade. There\u2019s shape in the air from the big man but nothing that threatens a wicket. Wade even pinches the strike from the final delivery. 85th over: Australia 263-3 (Labuschagne 128, Wade 4) Wagner gets a late dash with the new ball, and he has the good fortune of seeing his old mate Matthew Wade on strike. It\u2019s not the best over from the left-arm enforcer though, Wade milking a single before Labuschagne shows his sublime touch by cashing in on a wide half-volley that he sends galloping through the covers. 84th over: Australia 258-3 (Labuschagne 124, Wade 3) Australia regroup quickly after the surprise wicket, Wade glancing three then Labuschagne drilling a gorgeous four through the covers. Dan\u2019s point, below, is interesting. It would be easy to view Smith\u2019s knock as stodgy and, in the circumstances, lacking an end product. But he still scored 60+ and forced New Zealand to bowl all day. As England fans can testify following the end of Jonathan Trott\u2019s career - be careful what you wish for. That sound you can hear is your humble correspondent eating a large dish of humble pie. CdG has just dismissed Steve Smith with a classical out-swinger that kissed the deck, found the edge of the bat, and landed in the safe hands of first slip. I don\u2019t think anybody saw that coming. 83rd over: Australia 251-2 (Labuschagne 120, Smith 63) Searching for swing, Henry dishes up a wide half-volley to Labuschagne who leans into a perfect cover drive that was four from the moment it left the bowler\u2019s hand. Meanwhile, in the stats world, Smith and Labuschagne are playing duelling averages, the newcomer edging closer to the man he replaced as a concussion substitute a few short months ago. 82nd over: Australia 245-2 (Labuschagne 115, Smith 63) CdG reprises his role as close-to the most unthreatening new-ball bowler in test history. Smith respects the gentle 117kph out-swingers, defending the straight ones, leaving the wide ones, playing out the first non-Wagner maiden of the day. 81st over: Australia 245-2 (Labuschagne 115, Smith 63) \u201cIt\u2019s starting to get a little ugly for the tourists\u201d says James Brayshaw on TV, roughly seven hours after things started to get ugly for the tourists. New Zealand try to remedy their disfigurement by taking the new ball that\u2019s on offer and handing it to Matt Henry at the Randwick end. He opens with a couple of yorkers around off-stump then his third delivery lands on a good length and finds the outside edge of Labuschagne\u2019s bat, but the centurion\u2019s hands were soft and the ball skips away for four through third-man. 80th over: Australia 241-2 (Labuschagne 110, Smith 63) A couple of singles form Somerville\u2019s over, possibly the last with the current ball. 79th over: Australia 239-2 (Labuschagne 109, Smith 63) Today\u2019s report could be abbreviated to something like: \u201cAustralia took command of the match by nudging singles into the on-side\u201d. Very little else seems to have happened. It occurs again this Astle over, and would happen a second time but Labuschagne returns for a second. Smith then bucks the trend with a rare push into the off-side for a run. Exhilarating this is not, but a credit to the patience, hunger and determination of the pair at the crease. 78th over: Australia 236-2 (Labuschagne 107, Smith 62) The very first appeal since I took over the OBO two-and-a-half hours ago comes from Will Somerville, bellowing for an LBW against Marnus Labuschagne. His entreaty is declined on-field but he convinces Tom Latham to REVIEW but, as expected, the ball pitched outside leg-stump, as you might imagine for a right-arm bowler adopting an approach from around the wicket to a right-handed batter. 77th over: Australia 234-2 (Labuschagne 106, Smith 61) Astle gives Wagner a break before the second new ball is due. The sunnies are still on, the flight is still there, but there\u2019s no venom to unsettle either batsman. Australia\u2019s effortless accumulation continues. 76th over: Australia 231-2 (Labuschagne 104, Smith 60) Somerville has offered little threat today and when Australia have set their mind to scoring runs against him they\u2019ve done so with ease. Four arrive this over, the most aesthetically pleasing two coming from the blade of Steve Smith driving through the covers. 75th over: Australia 227-2 (Labuschagne 103, Smith 57) Wagner continues to charge in and hurl rocks towards Steve Smith\u2019s ribcage. Nothing misbehaves this over though and Smith advances his score by one. 74th over: Australia 226-2 (Labuschagne 103, Smith 56) Will Somerville is back for his third spell as we sleepwalk towards the close of play. An uneventful over sees Smith advance his score by three with two shots into the on-side. 73rd over: Australia 223-2 (Labuschagne 103, Smith 53) Wagner really does deserve a better support crew than he\u2019s been given. He squares Smith up, then rips a jaffa past Labuschagne\u2019s outside edge - with a ball 73-overs old. Time for the final drinks break of the day. 72nd over: Australia 222-2 (Labuschagne 103, Smith 52) Altogether now in your finest Richie Benaud voice: \u201cIt\u2019s choo for choo choo choo\u201d. Steve Smith nurdles a single from the opening delivery of Colin de Grandhomme\u2019s over, allowing Marnus Labuschagne on strike on 99. He\u2019s not there for long. CdG leaks onto the right-hander\u2019s pads and a fine glance beats the ring and dribbles away to the fine-leg fence for four. The helmet comes off, the bat\u2019s raised, and Australia\u2019s no.3 celebrates his fourth ton in five Tests. What a run-machine he is turning into. 71st over: Australia 217-2 (Labuschagne 99, Smith 51) Yikes! Wagner has Smith fending around his left armpit after aborting a duck, and the half-centurion is lucky not to guide the ball straight to leg-slip. He survives, and after the fourth ball manages to get off strike. Can Labuschagne get to three figures? No, not this time, and he almost ends on 99 fishing at a wider length delivery angled across him by Wagner, the only man to unsettle this pair all afternoon. 70th over: Australia 216-2 (Labuschagne 99, Smith 50) Colin de Grandhomme replaces Todd Astle and Labuschagne immediately advances to 99 with a push to midwicket. The first four deliveries of CdG\u2019s spell are all under 120kph - and none of them are change-of-pace slower balls. One of those hits that same spot Astle found earlier and keeps alarmingly low. Smith survives and then tips and runs to bring up his half-century, one that began and ended in painstaking fashion, with some fluency in-between. 69th over: Australia 214-2 (Labuschagne 98, Smith 49) Labuschagne looks a little skittish for the first time today as he attempts to engineer his century against Wagner. He\u2019s safe enough with the basics of bat on ball but he\u2019s edgy between the wickets and almost runs himself out taking off for a single that Smith smartly refuses. 68th over: Australia 213-2 (Labuschagne 97, Smith 49) Astle has done well enough to keep himself in the attack either side of tea, and another well-flighted over goes for just one. Smith is treading water again. 67th over: Australia 212-2 (Labuschagne 96, Smith 49) There\u2019s a buzz around the SCG as Wagner is invited to inject a little life into a moribund afternoon. But he starts with a gentle half-volley to Labuschagne that\u2019s clipped gracefully through midwicket for three. That brings Smith on strike, which means more short balls targeted at the ribcage. They are negotiated safely on this occasion, prompting the latest in a long line of glove changes. 66th over: Australia 209-2 (Labuschagne 93, Smith 49) Three runs from Astle\u2019s latest over, one notable for a ball that kept very low just outside off stump. Not much has misbehaved off the pitch today but that was a disconcerting sight. Time for more Wagner... 65th over: Australia 206-2 (Labuschagne 91, Smith 48) Labuschagne gets away with another rare error. For the second time in an hour or so he drives away from his body and watches the ball fly through the vacant third-fourth slip region. That\u2019s exactly the plan New Zealand has set for Labuschagne with Henry bowling but the fielders in the cordon were not stationed in the right places. 64th over: Australia 199-2 (Labuschagne 84, Smith 48) This is low-octane cricket at the moment with Australia casually accumulating runs. Astle goes for three. 63rd over: Australia 196-2 (Labuschagne 82, Smith 47) Century partnership for Labuschagne and Smith. Another Henry over comes and goes like a passing cloud. 62nd over: Australia 194-2 (Labuschagne 81, Smith 46) Astle\u2019s over begins with Labuschagne executing one of the shots of the day. He advanced to the pitch of the ball, but in a manner that opened his body a fraction, allowing his fast and strong wrists to come from in to out to glide the ball through the covers. Beautiful cricket shot. 61st over: Australia 188-2 (Labuschagne 76, Smith 45) Just the one from Henry\u2019s over. This partnership patiently resetting after the interval. I mentioned at tea - a little tongue-in-cheek - that Tim Paine may already be planning for a declaration considering the bad weather and poor air quality that may disrupt the weekend. It will be interesting to see if this pair look to kick on and up the scoring rate once they\u2019re set after tea, before the second new ball arrives. Without trying Australia are ticking along at 3rpo but they may choose to get a wriggle on while conditions are optimal for them to do so and buy them some time later in the Test. Yeah, I\u2019m grasping for talking points. 60th over: Australia 187-2 (Labuschagne 75, Smith 45) Astle continues with his leggies, and it\u2019s a tidy resumption of his spell, going for just one - and that run the product of confusing Smith with his flight. 59th over: Australia 185-2 (Labuschagne 74, Smith 44) Matt Henry opens the bowling after tea, and he does so from around the wicket to Steve Smith. He doesn\u2019t have the menace of Neil Wagner though, and Smith is quickly off strike with a paddle to square-leg. The tactic to Labuschagne could scarcely be more different, New Zealand packing the off-side and making him chase away from his body. Again, the batsman curtails the planning with an easy single. What this over confirmed was that this surface is gently paced and consistent, allowing batsmen to trust the bounce and ride it off the back-foot accordingly. Todd Astle bowling in wraparound shades appreciation post. One obvious benefit of New Zealand fielding two spinners is the over-rate. We\u2019re already 58-overs deep into the day, meaning we\u2019re only two behind schedule, meaning we may get close to hitting the scheduled 5.30pm close of play. Another session to Australia. they might have lost David Warner just after lunch, and Steve Smith might have taken an age to get off the mark, but the runs are now flowing on a docile pitch against a popgun attack. Tim Paine is probably already sizing up the weather (and air quality) forecast and preparing declaration strategies. 58th over: Australia 182-2 (Labuschagne 73, Smith 42) Nice over from Astle, first landing his wrong \u2018un then beating Smith with his flight, drawing a mistimed drive. 57th over: Australia 180-2 (Labuschagne 72, Smith 41) Somerville is now coming around the wicket to the right-handers, asking a slightly different question of first Labuschagne, then Smith. The former looks a tad uneasy until he rotates the strike, allowing Smith to use his feet and clip a couple to midwicket. James Hannan has joined in the conversation about Neil Wagner. \u201cAs to the current furore (if it can be called that) over Wagner\u2019s bouncer barrage, I think most people are forgetting Australia are two up in the series and have posted large totals in each of their first digs. The problem isn\u2019t Wagner, it\u2019s that he\u2019s had no support. The man is pure phenomenon and we need more like him. Did anyone see the push ups he did at the top of his mark in 40 degree heat in Perth, just before he ran in for another over?\u201d You won\u2019t find Adam or I disagreeing with you James. 56th over: Australia 177-2 (Labuschagne 71, Smith 39) Astle is bowling in some crisp 90s-looking wraparound shades that give him the feel of Mark Waugh rolling his arm over in grade cricket. They don\u2019t help him when he drops too short and wide, allowing Smith to calmly guide a four behind point. 55th over: Australia 171-2 (Labuschagne 70, Smith 34) Spin from both ends again with Will Somerville back into the attack. His stump-to-stump offies are worked into the on-side for three singles and a three as Australia continue their serene progress. 54th over: Australia 165-2 (Labuschagne 68, Smith 30) Todd Astle\u2019s leg-spin is called upon once more. Smith is patient with the ones that land on a good length, but he kicks himself for missing out on the long-hop that he slaps straight to the ring fielder. A maiden is there for the taking but Astle can\u2019t join the dots, offering a hint of width from ball six that Smith steers down to third-man. 53rd over: Australia 163-2 (Labuschagne 68, Smith 28) Henry keeps Smith honest in an over that goes for just the one single. \u201cNot sure I would be overstating the use of umpires with regards to Wagner,\u201d emails Peter Warrington. \u201cAs far they are concerned there is no such thing as intimidatory bowling, not even the ball that Cummins cleaned Anderson up with in Perth a couple if summers ago. Or the alleged Beamer of J Archer. Seems umps think people wanna see the quicks go at it?\u201d. That\u2019s up to them, and the ICC to decide. In the meantime Wagner is free to bowl in his current manner, which is creatively solving a problem that has tormented the very best bowlers for years. 52nd over: Australia 162-2 (Labuschagne 68, Smith 27) CdG\u2019s gentle medium pace goes for two this over. It\u2019s a glorified net for these two Australians at the moment, and that net is one of the middle ones, used by bowlers sharpening-up for the second or third XIs. 51st over: Australia 160-2 (Labuschagne 67, Smith 26) Oooh, that mistake New Zealand are desperate for almost arrived. Labuschagne drove loosely outside off, releasing his bottom hand from the bat in the process, but the resulting edge flies harmlessly through the gap where a third or fourth slip might have been stationed. The four runs from that streaky effort sit alongside four singles and a two in the scorebook documenting a dot-less over for Matt Henry. 50th over: Australia 150-2 (Labuschagne 61, Smith 22) CdG\u2019s recall ends the experiment with spin for now, just as Australia were getting on top of both Astle and Somerville. De Grandhomme goes for three easy singles in an innocuous over. The match is now in a very one-sided passage with Australia scoring runs with the minimum of fuss and New Zealand looking unable to do anything about it. 49th over: Australia 147-2 (Labuschagne 60, Smith 20) Just the single to Smith from Henry\u2019s latest over. 48th over: Australia 146-2 (Labuschagne 60, Smith 19) If Australia were becalmed in the hour after lunch they\u2019re going through the gears now. Labuschagne takes Somerville high over midwicket for six, then clips another effortless two to move into the 60s. On this surface, with this attack, it\u2019s going to take an error of judgement from one of these run-hungry batsmen to generate a breakthrough. 47th over: Australia 138-2 (Labuschagne 52, Smith 19) Matt Henry\u2019s back for a burst to disrupt the rhythm of spin from both ends, and he almost jags Smith with a leg-glance that flies just wide of the diving leg-gully. 46th over: Australia 135-2 (Labuschagne 51, Smith 17) Somerville, like Astle, has landed his spinners extremely well, offering New Zealand good control .But this is a first day pitch so there are no demons and the slow turn is easy to see onto the face of the bat for batsmen of this class. One of those batsmen is Marnus Labuschagne, who reaches 50 for the sixth time in seven innings this summer with a push into the off-side that some good running turns into three runs. Smith then gets in on the act by cutting another four after engineering some width by dropping deep in his crease. Raf from Melbourne has taken the contrarian position on the excellent bowling of Neil Wagner. \u201cWhen you say Wagner cannot be faulted, is it ok if we fault him for only having such good figures because he\u2019s being allowed to flagrantly break the laws of cricket on number of bouncers an over and on negative leg side bowling? He is doing a tremendous job of maintaining accuracy over long spells of this awful tactic, no doubt, but if he\u2019s allowed to keep doing it we\u2019re going to see every team in world cricket doing this and Tests turn into slow-scoring borefests. There\u2019s a reason that limited over cricket has even harsher restrictions on bowling like this, but Test cricket has rules against it too. I\u2019m impressed by bowlers who beat batsmen by bowling within the laws. I\u2019m not impressed with this whole Wagner love-in when his whole tactic is to just bowl in a way that is so artificially difficult to hit that it would trigger instant wide calls in limited over cricket, until the batsmen get bored and frustrated.\u201d It\u2019s almost as though we need some independent arbiters out there to determine if Wagner is breaking any laws. What\u2019s that? Oh, right... 45th over: Australia 128-2 (Labuschagne 48, Smith 13) Astle continues, but his seventh over contains a rare long-hop that Smith does not miss out on, slashing through cover for four. 44th over: Australia 123-2 (Labuschagne 47, Smith 9) Smith is easing into his work now, regularly finding that single just behind square on the leg-side to keep the partnership ticking along. With spin from both ends Smith is now batting in his baggy green, which will delight the felt fetishists out there. Labuschagne retains his lid, which, as long retired junior scorer, I appreciate, for distinguishing the two right-handed batsmen out in the middle. Thank you very much Adam. Remember to retune your emails and tweets to the following addresses: @JPHowcroft and jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. 43rd over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 46, Smith 8) Appropriately, it is Todd Astle for the final over of this third hour and my stint on the OBO today. Labuschagne collects a couple early in the over through midwicket before playing the rest with respect. As he should. This man commands respect. On that note, I\u2019m handing over to JP Howcroft with drinks on the field. Talk tomorrow! 42nd over: Australia 119-2 (Labuschagne 44, Smith 8) Right, Will Somerville is back for his first go of the middle session and is immediately spinning a long way back at Labuschagne, beating his inside edge. There\u2019s an appeal for leg before but not a convincing one. When Smith gets his chance he gets down the track to time it beautifully through midwicket for his first boundary. He miscues in defence to finish but the task is changing for New Zealand here. They have to stay patient. Samson yet again: the most number of balls faced without scoring, then converted into a ton, was 37 when Colin Cowdrey went on with it against India in 1964. 40th over: Australia 114-2 (Labuschagne 43, Smith 4) Astle, the absolute boy, goes again. Smith, far more comfortable in his skin now, comes down the track to whip two to start the over. That\u2019s the guy we know. He plays the rest out carefully. How about Andrew Samson on SEN? \u201c39 balls to get off the mark is the most by an Australian since David Boon against the West Indies in the Port of Spain in 1991.\u201d Firstly, I remember that. But more importantly, how does he find such a thing? 40th over: Australia 112-2 (Labuschagne 43, Smith 2) As Smith struggles, his little mate continues to take singles when he pleases, putting the former captain back on strike straight away. And he get off the mark with one around the corner! It took him 39 balls to do so, would you believe it. The SCG crowd go up as though he\u2019s brought up a century - very good from them. Smith can laugh at it too, putting his hand in the air to acknowledge the reception as Wagner pats him on the back. A replay shows that Labuschagne, who was heading to the danger end, only just made his ground with a dive when the ball past the stumps. Later in the over he takes another to deep backward square and the crowd are up with him again. 39th over: Australia 108-2 (Labuschagne 41, Smith 0) The madness continues, Smith failing to take a single when it is there after deflecting from short leg, then clipping a short ball straight into the fielder in that position. He leaves a big-turning leggie to finish. Excellent work, TODDY ASTLE! 38 dots for Smith! 38th over: Australia 107-2 (Labuschagne 40, Smith 0) Wagner and Smith, what a couple of crazy cats! Smith is refusing to engage with the determined short attack from over the wicket. Not quite in the Wade manner - he\u2019s using his bat. But with that comes risk too, the final ball prompting a chorus oooooh and aaaaahhh from behind the wicket as Smith tries and fails to get his first run behind square. The ball trickles away no more than a few metres from his glove. 33 dots now! Captivating! Wagner has figures of 12-6-15-1. He cannot be faulted. 37th over: Australia 107-2 (Labuschagne 40, Smith 0) I\u2019m ALL IN on Todd Astle. In the best tradition of leggies, he\u2019s almost all the way through a very tidy over at Labuschagne before giving him a BIG full toss to smash away. Performance art. 36th over: Australia 103-2 (Labuschagne 36, Smith 0) Wagner is clearly loving this, smiling each time Smith can\u2019t get him away. 27 is the only number that matters here: the amount of dots the world\u2019s best player has faced in a row. Remarkable. 35th over: Australia 102-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 0) Astle now with his throwback hair/shades/action - I\u2019m well into his narrative. Smith gets five balls to work with here after Labuschagne gives him the strike with the first delivery bu the result is the same: 24 balls, yet to get off the mark! He\u2019s furious when missing a long-hop too, picking out the man at point rather perfectly. This is good stuff. 34th over: Australia 101-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 0) Wagner is less interested in the short stuff at Labuschagne, which is surprising given it worked in the second dig at Perth. He gets off strike with one to fine leg, giving Smith two balls to deal with from his nemesis. He does so, with soft hands. 19 balls, zero runs for Smith. 33rd over: Australia 100-2 (Labuschagne 33, Smith 0) Labuschagne gives the strike back to Smith from the first ball of the new over, the former captain moving around more in the crease than usual to line up with de Grandhomme outside the off stump. He\u2019s been out there for 15 balls without scoring, make that 16 - an inside edge that spits out to midwicket. And 17, when defending the final offering. 32nd over: Australia 99-2 (Labuschagne 32, Smith 0) Right, now it\u2019s Wagner v Smith. Over the wicket to begin, bumping him right away - ducked. He\u2019s into that awkward zone next up, on Smith\u2019s hip, playing just behind square. That wasn\u2019t a long way from the catcher at short leg. Another duck is required in response to the bouncer that follows; right on the money. At the stumps, Smith defends with soft hands - good batting. \u201cThat\u2019s the hard bit for Smith here,\u201d says Simon Katich on SEN. \u201cHe gets so few balls to get forward to with so much short stuff that it\u2019s not easy to get into the righ position.\u201d He does to finish, Wagner - now from round the wicket - turned safely along the ground to leg gully. A maiden it is. Probing. 31st over: Australia 99-2 (Labuschagne 32, Smith 0) Labuschagne plays a good de Grandhomme over watchfully, only getting out of his defensive posture in order to flick a couple out to midwicket when the chance presents. He\u2019s in great nick. 30th over: Australia 97-2 (Labuschagne 30, Smith 0) Men still out for Labuschagne with Wagner at him but two conventional slips too. And that\u2019s where he draws him into a false stroke, beating him outside the line of the off-stump. He didn\u2019t need to play at it but the angle was so wide, he felt as though he needed to. With a single into the on side to finish, the Queenslander is into the 30s and keeps the strike. \u201cNeil Wagner quite clearly takes the cake for being the gutsiest international bowler in the world,\u201d writes Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cHe\u2019s got the ranking he does in Test match cricket for a reason. His leg theory lines have proved to be the only tactic which has troubled the otherwise peerless Aussie batsmen so far. The length and frequency of his spells is unparalleled in my opinion. Salute to the most effective workhorse on this tour!\u201d Too right. 29th over: Australia 96-2 (Labuschagne 29, Smith 0) Labuschagne is straight back into accumulation mode, tucking de Grandhomme around the corner. Remarkable to think that Warner has an average of 6.5 against Wagner in the series, to whom he\u2019s fallen four times. That\u2019s the real quiz, which Smith returns to next over. 28th over: Australia 95-2 (Labuschagne 28, Smith 0) Smith\u2019s turn, who has fallen to Wagner\u2019s short ball every time he\u2019s been dismissed this series and he allows his first delivery out there to strike him on the stomach! \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate tactic,\u201d says Simon Katich on SEN radio, pre-empting the usual whingeing. Well played, Neil Wagner. What a tour he\u2019s had. The key question: can someone back him up? It works! He\u2019s done it again! Wagner has the field spread for an error on the short ball and that\u2019s what Warner has made, pulling straight to de Grandhomme at leg gully. That\u2019s the fourth time he\u2019s picked the opener up in the series. What a (re)start! The players are back on the field. Warner is on strike, resuming on 45. Wagner gets his second crack, setting the field immediately for the short stuff. PLAY! A reminder of those donation/auction details. \u201cG\u2019day Adam.\u201d Hi Murray Henman. \u201cHas anyone (ICC / CA / SCG) issued any standards for whether / when the players should come off for smoke?\u201d Good question. I heard Kevin Roberts before play making it clear that the players will come off as and when they need to with smoke - that\u2019s been clear all week. I\u2019ll take a look through the public comments if they\u2019ve specified when that\u2019d be. Australia\u2019s session. It was always destined to be so after they won the chance to bat first at the toss. As I mentioned a couple of overs ago, the Black Caps bowled really well in the second half an hour to build pressure - a period that culiminated in de Grandhomme winning Burns\u2019 outside edge to Taylor. As usual, Wagner was the catalyst of that tightening, Henry bowling nicely too. However, it fell away from the moment Labuschagne walked out to the middle, timing the ball immaculately from the outset. He and Warner have added 56 in 78 balls. 27th over: Australia 95-1 (Warner 45, Labuschagne 28) Spin from both ends before the break, Todd Astle on with his leggies - bowling in the shades! Very 1990s, as is his no-nonsense action after skipping to the crease. Like it. As does Warner, who is sweeping before the over is done, albeit straight to the man at backward square. \u201cHow good is it seeing two spinners on at the SCG before lunch on day one?\u201d asks Kerry O on telly. Labuschagne defends two accurate leggies to finish. LUNCH! 26th over: Australia 93-1 (Warner 44, Labuschagne 27) Somerville is cut away off the back foot from Warner for two to begin the over, bringing up the 50 partnership between these two in just 67 balls. He\u2019s on the back foot again from the next ball, time time slapping forward of point for three more. His length improves from there but it is another over going Australia\u2019s way. After the Black Caps did so well in the second half an hour, culminating in the wicket of Joe Burns on the cusp of drinks, the hosts have dominated the rest of the session to date. There will probably be one more over before lunch, two if they rush. 25th over: Australia 87-1 (Warner 39, Labuschagne 26) Labuschagne is on one here, I reckon. The moment Henry strays ever so slightly to a middle and leg line, he\u2019s onto it with a leg glance that skips away for four. There\u2019s an element of risk associated with that stroke against a bowler like Henry who generates movement off the track, but you would never know it from the way it was executed. 24th over: Australia 79-1 (Warner 37, Labuschagne 22) A lot to like about Somerville\u2019s bouncing approach and high action, creating ample dip. He has a short leg but can\u2019t get one quite in that zone to Labuschagne, who started the with a couple carved to deep point and finished sweeping two more to deep square. 23rd over: Australia 75-1 (Warner 37, Labuschagne 18) Henry is back on the field and back into the attack. Labuschagne has to deal with one in the ribs early in the over and he works it away for a couple. Good batting. They finish the over with three easy singles in a row, which is a pretty bad sign for the Black Caps with quarter of an hour left on the clock until lunch on the opening day. 22nd over: Australia 70-1 (Warner 36, Labuschagne 14) This is a nice moment, Will Somerville into the attack for his first Test on what was his home ground for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield until a couple of years ago. He\u2019s straight on the mark to Labuschagne to begin, then Warner - his old teammate - to finish. 21st over: Australia 69-1 (Warner 36, Labuschagne 13) \u201cRhythm is gone,\u201d says Isa Guha of Colin de Grandhomme as Warner smashes him through cover once again. The all-rounder recovers well but the shape and bite from earlier has disappeared over the last couple of overs. I suspect it might be still to do with his footing. 20th over: Australia 65-1 (Warner 32, Labuschagne 13) Wagner into his sixth over, Labuschagne showing the respect he deserves. A third maiden from him. 19th over: Australia 65-1 (Warner 32, Labuschagne 13) de Grandhomme is having a bit of an issue with his front foot, overstepping by a long way after looking down at where he should be landing. He\u2019s sliding on arrival, the replay shows, which is never a good thing for a seamer\u2019s confidence. Warner is all over a half-volley to finish, giving it the threatment through extra cover. This hasn\u2019t been the opener\u2019s most convincing morning at the office but he\u2019s into the 30s and still standing. 18th over: Australia 58-1 (Warner 26, Labuschagne 13) WARNER NEARLY OUT HOOKING! Wagner was spot on with his bumper, winning a fat top edge. Will Somerville was the man running in from long-leg in front of the members but he misjudged the approach, pulling out instead of diving. Should have made it to the contest, in footy speak. Urgh. Wagner is doing everything right, as usual. 17th over: Australia 57-1 (Warner 25, Labuschagne 13) de Grandhomme to Warner, who takes one to square leg that nearly causes some bother between the wickets before both batsmen reach their ground. Is it just me or does running between the wickets become far more of a talking point when Labuschagne is out there? Maybe that says more about how many hours he has batted this summer. More an issue when he\u2019s partnering with Smith, to be fair. They\u2019re a lock for a run out soon. \u201cMatt Henry is very much like the Chris Woakes of New Zealand Cricket,\u201d writes Sachin Paul. \u201cI have never seen him have a bad game or be his side\u2019s worst bowler, yet when they have to cut a bowler, he always seems to incur the wrath of captains and selectors because of other iconic duos (Branderson/Bou-thee) or the new exciting thing (Ferguson/Archer). I\u2019m hoping 2020 will see Woakes and Henry and their brand of quiet excellence shine.\u201d To an extent, I agree. Henry does plenty right. But I do understand why Ferguson got the chance at Perth before everything went wrong. I\u2019m not sure we line up on the same view of Archer, either. He had to play the moment he was eligible. Henry\u2019s still off with this thumb whack, by the way. Back on soon, we\u2019re told. 16th over: Australia 54-1 (Warner 24, Labuschagne 11) Wagner slips onto Warner\u2019s pads to begin, clipped away for three. After a sketchy little period for the opener, that\u2019ll feel nice. Labuschagne looked a million bucks upon walking out but isn\u2019t far away from feeding a catch to midwicket from a delivery that swings more than he anticipated when setting up to drive. Still, he adds three. On SEN radio, Brendon McCullum says he would have played Southee instead of Todd Astle on the basis that they already have they use of Jeet Raval\u2019s more-than-handy legbreaks here. 15th over: Australia 47-1 (Warner 20, Labuschagne 8) After the drinks break - taken at the fall of the wicket - Labuschagne is away with two boundaries in three balls. As you do. The first is a tidy glance, fine of long leg. The second is perfectly clipped, in front of the man at square leg. A fantastic start. It was at the SCG where he was brought back into the team last year to bat at No3, of course. It was a lovely delivery from de Grandhomme but the way Burns\u2019 leg kicked out upon making contact is going to be the talking point. You watch, they\u2019ll drop him. And they get the scalp they need! de Grandhomme is brought back to replace Henry and picks up Burns with the first ball of his new spell, an edge straight to Taylor at slip. The perfect way for the Black Caps to go to drinks. They earned that. 14th over: Australia 39-0 (Warner 20, Burns 18) Wagner had the wood over Burns but he has Warner three times in this series as well. He\u2019s getting good conventional swing away from the left-hander from over the wicket, enough to find a leading edge first up. Another high-quality maiden follows. They\u2019ve had a good half an hour but they need a wicket very soon to make it truly worthwhile. Dreadful smoke covering the MCG now too. A state of emergency was formally declared for the east of Victoria overnight by Premier Dan Andrews. 13th over: Australia 39-0 (Warner 20, Burns 18) A seventh over in this opening spell from Henry and he\u2019s still bending his back, beating Warner to begin from around the wicket, decking away from a perfect line and length. There\u2019s an appeal for caught behind down the legside but no review - the ball deflected off his hip, not the bat. To finish, another inside edge. Henry is right on top of Warner now. 12th over: Australia 38-0 (Warner 19, Burns 18) Wagner to Burns is a match-up the Black Caps will want more of after this over - an excellent maiden. The line and length was predictably disciplined, slipping one back from over the wicket into the inside edge, deflecting back onto the Queenslander\u2019s boot and nearly his stumps. 11th over: Australia 38-0 (Warner 19, Burns 18) Henry into his sixth over and he\u2019s into Warner\u2019s inside edge again too - a handful of those so far today. Burns is looking better now, for the second time so far playing his best shot - the cover drive - lashing a half-volley away. He then hammers another drive, Henry just getting his hand to it. It has drawn blood, the slow-mo showing the ball crunching into his middle finger. He comes off to get it patched up at the end of the over. 10th over: Australia 32-0 (Warner 18, Burns 13) Wagner is on and immediately into the game by finding Burns\u2019 outside edge, through third slip for four. It was well played with soft hands, but still. What a great series he\u2019s had, picking up 14 scalps at 21 including Smith four times. He\u2019s up for leg before later in the over, but there\u2019s not a lot of hope for it with an inside edge. It\u2019s also high. Even so, a fine start. 9th over: Australia 28-0 (Warner 18, Burns 9) Another very good over from Henry to Warner, banging in a probing short ball early on before twice finding his inside edge. The first of those wasn\u2019t far away from going back onto his leg stump. Superb as always from my man Bharat Sundaresan. 8th over: Australia 26-0 (Warner 17, Burns 9) Shot! A productive over - Warner and Burns turning the strike over easily - is made into an excellent one with the Queenslander leaning into a CdG half-volley, crashing it to the rope at cover. \u201cHappy New Year Adam.\u201d Thank you, Ian Forth. To you and yours, too. \u201cOne test match where it\u2019s definitely not cowardly to pray for rain. Though let\u2019s not rely on prayers in the future, eh?\u201d Indeed. Let\u2019s hope we lose entire sessions - entire days - to downpours. There aren\u2019t any forecast for at least a few days, though, I\u2019m afraid. 7th over: Australia 18-0 (Warner 14, Burns 4) Warner rotates the strike first ball of the new Henry over, timing one to mid-off. He\u2019s more dangerous to Burns, who has been the slower starter - smashing into the right-hander\u2019s pad with an off-cutter - prompting a big shout for lbw. But Latham doesn\u2019t consider a review with the height the main concern. There\u2019s another half-appeal for leg before to finish with Warner back on strike, this going well over the woodwork. Better over. Andrew Samson on SEN reports that Glenn Phillips becomes the 26th South African to play for another Test nation, the sixth for New Zealand. He adds that there have been 14 to turn out for England and two (Kepler Wessels and Marnus Labuschagne) who have worn the baggy green. He\u2019s also the first player that I\u2019ve seen in the World Test championship run around without a number on his shirt. Given that he has just arrived in the country, that\u2019s fair enough! We\u2019ll follow his story closely throughout the week on the OBO. 6th over: Australia 16-0 (Warner 13, Burns 3) Burns takes the single on offer from his pads. de Grandhomme is right back on it to Warner, again back towards him with genuine swing, locating the inside edge. That\u2019s encouraging. As is the final ball of the over to Burns, which beats the Queenslander driving at a ball he should have left. There\u2019s half an appeal for caught behind - it was very, very close. 5th over: Australia 14-0 (Warner 12, Burns 2) Burns is off the mark from his 12th ball of the morning via a compact push to mid-on. Warner\u2019s turn and he\u2019s straight back into it, clipping three through midwicket. Burns is back on strike for the final ball and Henry gets it to move back towards him, finding the inside edge. Better. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hello, Terry Hogan. \u201cHappy New Year! Welcome to 2020 cricket.\u201d Indeed, what a massive few weeks we have ahead of us. Can\u2019t wait. \u201cIn reference to the four keepers, NZ played four keepers against England at Headingly in 2015 and managed to win by 199 runs. An omen for this week perhaps?\u201d Good pick up! Adam Lyth\u2019s one Test ton. Simpler times, ay? \u201cGood luck for the new baby. I hope it all goes well for you and your partner.\u201d Thanks so much! We\u2019re 34 weeks (or something like that) and counting. She\u2019s currently painting another wall of the baby\u2019s room - a strong, rich yellow. 4th over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 9, Burns 0) Ooh, a good\u2019un from CdG to Warner, brought forward as the ball did plenty and well beaten. There\u2019s something in this track but New Zealand are going to have to extract it by bowling their most consistent line and length. That\u2019s not the case with a half-volley on the left-hander\u2019s pads though, clipped away with ease for four; the first boundary of the Test Match. He adds to more in the same direction next ball. But to his credit, the all-rounder bounces back with a beauty to finish, hooping past the inside edge from over the wicket, just missing off-stump. \u201cSo far de Grandhomme is posing more questions than Matt Henry,\u201d says Simon Katich on the SEN radio call. 3rd over: Australia 3-0 (Warner 3, Burns 0) Warner is making solid contact with his defensive strokes - always a good sign for him. He grabs a third single, working him behind point from the balls of his feet. That\u2019s the shot he played so brilliantly when stroking a century in a session on this day, at this ground three years ago against Pakistan. Burns defends the rest with his own big blade. Big chance here. 2nd over: Australia 2-0 (Warner 2, Burns 0) Colin de Grandhomme is given the new ball from the Padingto End, which makes sense given the shape he gets, even at medium pace. Good start to Warner as well, finding the outside half of his bat, wide of gully for one. Burns is able to leave a couple well outside the off-stump before using his bat, back to leaving by the end - albeit closer to his woorwork. 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Warner 1, Burns 0) Oooh, Warner is beaten first up with a delivery that bounces and jags across the left-hander. Handy. He offers a smile at the Australian opener - that wasn\u2019t far away at all. Warner gets bat on ball by the middle of the over, leaning over an assertive forward defensive. He\u2019s off the mark to finish with well-placed push to cover, taking the single on offer. The players are on the field. The teams are sorted, the anthems are done. It\u2019s a comparatively clear day in Sydney as Dave Warner enters the arena alongside Joe Burns. They have pink numbers on their shirts with this, of course, the McGrath Foundation Test Match. Matt Henry, back into the team, has the new ball. PLAY! A minute of applause at the SCG. Held to recognise the outstanding and dedicated work of firefighters doing their best in the most horrible circumstances. Cricket Australia are running an auction of the team\u2019s playing shirts to raise money, too. Confirmation from the Kiwi camp that Southee was left out, not injured. The decision was made due to his recent workload, the team spokesman tells us. \u201cFour wicket keepers,\u201d KP Bowman tells me on twitter in relation to Glenn Phillips\u2019 inclusion. \u201cFour! Our slip catching will be amazing now.\u201d Blundell and Wade both bowling last week was a real treat: just the third time in a Test where two bowlers used began their Test career with the gloves. Being on debut, Phillips can\u2019t add to that, but he should slot in nicely behind the wicket. I assume you all saw this in Cape Town? Rory Burns, after a lovely little first touch and finish, has rolled his ankle in England\u2019s football warm-up at training. In turn, he\u2019s out of the series. Dreadful timing after he looked fantastic last week in England\u2019s second innings. Their \u2018cursed\u2019 tour, as Stokes says here, continues. So, to confirm. In addition to Boult (injured), Santner (ill, but probably dropped regardless), Williamson (ill), Nicholls (ill)... Tim Southee was dropped. Stiff! Australia: David Warner, Joe Burns, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Matthew Wade, Travis Head, Tim Paine (c &amp; wk), James Pattinson, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon. New Zealand: Tom Latham (c), Tom Blundell, Jeet Raval, Ross Taylor, Glenn Phillips, BJ Watling (wk), Colin de Grandhomme, Todd Astle, William Somerville, Matt Henry, Neil Wagner. Paine says: \u201cIt looks like a good wicket. It\u2019s a good toss to win. We are going in unchanged. We looked at playing a second spinner but out quicks have been outstanding so we\u2019re sticking with a winning combination.\u201d Latham confirms that Williamson AND Nicholls are both out. FIVE CHANGES! Jeet Raval, Glenn Nicholls (debut), Matt Henry, Todd Astle and Will Somerville are all into the New Zealand side who lost at the MCG. What a dramatic start. I neglected to mention off the top... this works a lot better if we talk. If you\u2019re new to the OBO, hit me up with an email or a tweet. Tim Southee in doubt too? Good grief. We\u2019ll know shortly. On that World Test Championship point. India are out of the blocks with maximum points from the seven Tests they have played, on 360 points. Australia are second on 256 points in nine starts, tallying six wins and a draw. Of course, all Tests aren\u2019t created equal in this competition. If you\u2019re not across that, well, I don\u2019t blame you. But in short: if the hosts win this, they move to 306 before a lengthy break, not scheduled to play again until a visit to Bangladesh in June. He has been ruled out after his net session this morning . What a mess. Tom Latham will captain the Black Caps with Glenn Phillips to make his debut. Hi everyone. With the unfolding disaster taking place across the east of New South Wales and Victoria, it does feel a fraction odd that we\u2019re gearing up for a Test Match in Sydney. Of course, there is a chance that the smoke from the bushfires will mean that some of the cricket is lost - that\u2019s been made clear. But if it is rain that takes them off the field, there will be universal celebration. Fingers crossed. It\u2019s with that unusual sentence, and tragic sentiment, that I welcome you to the third and final Test Match of this series between Australia and New Zealand - the last of the home summer for the hosts. They have won four from four so far, hammering Pakistan two-zip, that the current state of this series as well. From a World Test Championship perspective, a clean sweep here means plenty in terms of giving themselves the best chance of appearing in that Lord\u2019s final next June. The news from the SCG is that there is a lot going on in the New Zealand camp. I can confirm that Kane Williamson and Henry Nicholls are at the ground and are training now to decide whether they are well enough to play after picking up a nasty bug over the last few days. Mitchell Santner, however, is not. He\u2019s out. That means that Will Somerville will get his chance to play a Test Match on the ground that has so long been his home venue in Sydney. Of course, the off-spinner spent the bulk of his professional career as a NSW tweaker before making the move to New Zealand where the 35-year-old has played three Test Matches. He might have Todd Astle, the 33-year-old leggie, for company. We\u2019ll know soon. Matt Henry, the experienced seamer, will come in for Trent Boult, who fractured his hand while batting during the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne last week. There\u2019s also Glenn Phillips, who has arrived from Auckland as a back-up batting option for Williamson and/or Nicholls if either of those players are ruled out before the toss. The 23-year-old right-hander has played 11 T20Is but never a Test. He averages 43 at First Class level. By contrast to the hyperactivity, injury and illness in the Kiwi camp, Australia are surely going in unchanged. Buckle up!",

      "body": "<p>The scrubby, vacant patch beneath the Burrard Street Bridge in Vancouver looks at first glance like a typical example of the type of derelict nook common to all cities: 11.7 acres of former railway lands, over which tens of thousands of people drive every day.</p> <p>This is not any old swath of underused space, however. It\u2019s one of Canada\u2019s smallest First Nations reserves, where dozens of Squamish families once lived. The village was destroyed by provincial authorities more than a century ago.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a marginalized community saying, \u2018This is how we\u2019re creating value for our nation, and the public at large'</p> <footer> <cite>Khelsilem, Squamish Nation councillor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now it may rise again \u2013 but in radically different form. In an internal referendum on Tuesday, 87% of voting Squamish Nation members approved the construction here of what may become the most dramatic statement of urban Indigenous presence in any Canadian city \u2013 a new district called Senakw, after the long-displaced village, with 11 towers, 6,000 dwelling units and more than 10,000 residents. </p> <p>\u201cWe want to bring our people back home to that part of our territory,\u201d says Khelsilem, a Squamish Nation councillor. \u201cPeople who support new housing are often marginalized out of decision-making, and this is a marginalized community saying, \u2018This is how we\u2019re creating value for our nation, and the public at large.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab1b9eb36365ef49ad767a24a9968773731c6977\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab1b9eb36365ef49ad767a24a9968773731c6977/869_0_3931_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vancouver and the site of the proposed development\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Few First Nations reserves in Canada are found so centrally in urban areas, and this unique location has given the Squamish Nation a chance to explode local city-building norms. Construction begins in 2021, and at more than 500 units per acre, Senakw\u2019s density will reach Hong Kong levels \u2013 a fact that is only allowed because Senakw exists not on city land, but on reserve land, which is technically federal. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is this opposition assumed between the civilization cities are imagined to represent, and the imagined savageness of Indigenous people</p> <footer> <cite>Jordan Stanger-Ross</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another striking feature is that only 10% of apartments will include parking, unlike the city\u2019s rules that mandate one parking space per unit. The buildings will also forgo the podium-and-tower design that\u2019s become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/jun/27/thearchitectureofvancouveri\">a hallmark of \u201cVancouverism\u201d</a> in favour of slender high-rises maximising public space. The buildings could be up to 56 storeys tall, towering above the low-rise neighbourhoods nearby.</p> <p>Senakw would be a sharp rebuke to the mindset in Canada that indigeneity and urbanity are incompatible, says Jordan Stanger-Ross, an associate professor of history at British Columbia\u2019s University of Victoria. \u201cIn the early history of Vancouver, and colonial cities generally, there is this opposition assumed between the civilization cities are imagined to represent, and the imagined savageness of Indigenous people,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is an idea that the two can\u2019t co-exist.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32e48b35738a8806e82fdb061292e90ce7e300b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32e48b35738a8806e82fdb061292e90ce7e300b9/0_40_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View of Kitsilano Indian Reserve looking east, 1907.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View of Kitsilano Indian Reserve looking east, 1907.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: City of Vancouver Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That idea persists, says Ginger Gosnell-Myers, who served from 2013 to 2018 as Vancouver\u2019s first Indigenous Relations Manager. \u201cIf you look at where reserves have been placed in this country, they\u2019re largely on the outskirts,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s by design ... we\u2019re looking at a deliberate history of exclusion.\u201d</p> <p>Though the original village here was ostensibly a protected reserve, government and industrial interests chipped away at it. In 1913, the provincial government coerced the remaining Squamish residents into selling their land, placed them on barges bound for the north, and razed the village. For a time the area became a squatter\u2019s camp, and was surrendered altogether by the Squamish nation in 1947.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Squamish Nation has waited more than a century for this. They\u2019re not going to wait any longer</p> <footer> <cite>Ginger Gosnell-Myers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Canadian Pacific Railway set up a rail terminus here, but when the railway tried to sell the land in 1989, the Squamish said it should revert to reserve status. In 2002, after a long legal battle, they regained a fraction of the land and have been exploring how to use it ever since. \u201cThe Squamish Nation kept pushing to explore the near-maximum the site could handle,\u201d said Khelsilem on Twitter last month. \u201cThis is our jewel of developable land and we\u2019re only going to get once chance in the next 100 years to develop it.\u201d</p> <p>Even by the standards of architectural rendering, early images of appear optimistic: towers inscribed with Indigenous art, girdled in greenery and rising into blue skies punctuated by flocks of birds. The design proposal was created by Revery Architecture in conjunction with the Squamish Nation, and gave particular attention to the history of the site and its relationship to the natural environment. The idea was to give people crossing the Burrard Street Bridge the feeling of entering a forest as much as a city.</p> <p>If Senakw could be the most dramatic example of the Indigenization of Canadian cities, it\u2019s not the only one. Indigenous communities have long been involved as urban property developers. The Squamish Nation itself is one-third of the MST Property Development Corporation, comprising three Vancouver-area First Nations which have embarked on smaller projects, the goal being the return of profits to the nation\u2019s members for social and community development.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1bc0dd2c08985658a8f274665afb886957c5b0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1bc0dd2c08985658a8f274665afb886957c5b0d/0_0_4384_2813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"70-90% of the 6,000 units will be for rent, with provisions for affordable housing for Squamish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">70-90% of the 6,000 units will be for rent, with provisions for affordable housing for Squamish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Revery Architecture</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Neither is it unique to Canada.

      "bodyText": "The scrubby, vacant patch beneath the Burrard Street Bridge in Vancouver looks at first glance like a typical example of the type of derelict nook common to all cities: 11.7 acres of former railway lands, over which tens of thousands of people drive every day. This is not any old swath of underused space, however. It\u2019s one of Canada\u2019s smallest First Nations reserves, where dozens of Squamish families once lived. The village was destroyed by provincial authorities more than a century ago. Now it may rise again \u2013 but in radically different form. In an internal referendum on Tuesday, 87% of voting Squamish Nation members approved the construction here of what may become the most dramatic statement of urban Indigenous presence in any Canadian city \u2013 a new district called Senakw, after the long-displaced village, with 11 towers, 6,000 dwelling units and more than 10,000 residents. \u201cWe want to bring our people back home to that part of our territory,\u201d says Khelsilem, a Squamish Nation councillor. \u201cPeople who support new housing are often marginalized out of decision-making, and this is a marginalized community saying, \u2018This is how we\u2019re creating value for our nation, and the public at large.\u201d Few First Nations reserves in Canada are found so centrally in urban areas, and this unique location has given the Squamish Nation a chance to explode local city-building norms. Construction begins in 2021, and at more than 500 units per acre, Senakw\u2019s density will reach Hong Kong levels \u2013 a fact that is only allowed because Senakw exists not on city land, but on reserve land, which is technically federal. Another striking feature is that only 10% of apartments will include parking, unlike the city\u2019s rules that mandate one parking space per unit. The buildings will also forgo the podium-and-tower design that\u2019s become a hallmark of \u201cVancouverism\u201d in favour of slender high-rises maximising public space. The buildings could be up to 56 storeys tall, towering above the low-rise neighbourhoods nearby. Senakw would be a sharp rebuke to the mindset in Canada that indigeneity and urbanity are incompatible, says Jordan Stanger-Ross, an associate professor of history at British Columbia\u2019s University of Victoria. \u201cIn the early history of Vancouver, and colonial cities generally, there is this opposition assumed between the civilization cities are imagined to represent, and the imagined savageness of Indigenous people,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is an idea that the two can\u2019t co-exist.\u201d That idea persists, says Ginger Gosnell-Myers, who served from 2013 to 2018 as Vancouver\u2019s first Indigenous Relations Manager. \u201cIf you look at where reserves have been placed in this country, they\u2019re largely on the outskirts,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s by design ... we\u2019re looking at a deliberate history of exclusion.\u201d Though the original village here was ostensibly a protected reserve, government and industrial interests chipped away at it. In 1913, the provincial government coerced the remaining Squamish residents into selling their land, placed them on barges bound for the north, and razed the village. For a time the area became a squatter\u2019s camp, and was surrendered altogether by the Squamish nation in 1947. The Canadian Pacific Railway set up a rail terminus here, but when the railway tried to sell the land in 1989, the Squamish said it should revert to reserve status. In 2002, after a long legal battle, they regained a fraction of the land and have been exploring how to use it ever since. \u201cThe Squamish Nation kept pushing to explore the near-maximum the site could handle,\u201d said Khelsilem on Twitter last month. \u201cThis is our jewel of developable land and we\u2019re only going to get once chance in the next 100 years to develop it.\u201d Even by the standards of architectural rendering, early images of appear optimistic: towers inscribed with Indigenous art, girdled in greenery and rising into blue skies punctuated by flocks of birds. The design proposal was created by Revery Architecture in conjunction with the Squamish Nation, and gave particular attention to the history of the site and its relationship to the natural environment. The idea was to give people crossing the Burrard Street Bridge the feeling of entering a forest as much as a city. If Senakw could be the most dramatic example of the Indigenization of Canadian cities, it\u2019s not the only one. Indigenous communities have long been involved as urban property developers. The Squamish Nation itself is one-third of the MST Property Development Corporation, comprising three Vancouver-area First Nations which have embarked on smaller projects, the goal being the return of profits to the nation\u2019s members for social and community development. Neither is it unique to Canada. In New Zealand, a number of treaty settlements since the 1990s have put urban land in the hands of tribal development groups, and M\u0101ori design principles have gradually become more common in both public and private building \u2013 particularly in the rebuilding of Christchurch\u2019s city centre following the 2011 earthquake. Not all of the Squamish Nation has praised the project. Some members have raised concerns about the 50-50 profit sharing partnership with Westbank, a private developer better known as a builder of luxury condos. There has also been some pushback from the broader Vancouver community. One city councillor called the height \u201cinconsistent with the values of a liveable city\u201d. Khelsilem argues that most reaction so far has been positive, in part thanks to Vancouver\u2019s housing crisis . Barely more than 1,000 purpose-built rental apartments were approved last year, and the city saw a net gain of only 2,300 rental units between 2010 and 2018, despite adding nearly 40,000 people. Senakw, however, will have plenty of rental properties \u2013 70-90% of the 6,000 total units \u2013 with provisions for affordable housing for Squamish. \u201cThere is extreme demand for rental housing to be built in this city,\u201d says Gosnell-Myers, \u201cand you have a proposal that will meet a lot of that demand. Now it\u2019s the city\u2019s responsibility to act.\u201d Gosnell-Myers says the city must now work with the Squamish Nation to supply amenities for a community of more than 10,000 people: schools, transit connections and other infrastructure.

      "body": "<p>Artificial intelligence programmers are developing bots that can identify digital bullying and sexual harassment.</p> <p>Known as \u201c#MeTooBots\u201d after the high-profile movement that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/metoo-two-years-weinstein-allegations-tip-of-iceberg-accusers-zelda-perkins-rosanna-arquette\">arose </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/metoo-two-years-weinstein-allegations-tip-of-iceberg-accusers-zelda-perkins-rosanna-arquette\">after allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein</a>, the bots can monitor and flag communications between colleagues and are being introduced by companies around the world.</p> <p>Bot-makers say it is not easy to teach computers what harassment looks like, with its linguistic subtleties and grey lines.</p> <p>Jay Leib, the chief executive of the Chicago-based AI firm NexLP, said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of all the forms of harassment. I thought it was just talking dirty. It comes in so many different ways. It might be 15 messages \u2026 it could be racy photos.\u201d</p> <p>Nex\u2019s AI platform is used by more than 50 corporate clients, including law firms in London.</p> <p>The industry is a potentially fertile ground for the bots to examine: a third of female lawyers in Britain report having experienced sexual harassment.</p> <p>The bot uses an algorithm trained to identify potential bullying, including sexual harassment, in company documents, emails and chat. Data is analysed for various indicators that determine how likely it is to be a problem, with anything the AI reads as being potentially problematic then sent to a lawyer or HR manager to investigate.</p> <p>Exactly what indicators are deemed red flags remains a company secret, but Leib said the bot looked for anomalies in the language, frequency or timing of communication patterns across weeks, while constantly learning how to spot harassment.</p> <p>Leib believes other industries could also benefit. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest from clients across sectors such as financial services, pharmaceuticals,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Prof Brian Subirana, a lecturer in AI at Harvard and MIT, said the idea of using AI to root out harassment was promising though the bots\u2019 capabilities were limited.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a type of harassment that is very subtle and very hard to pick up. We have these training courses [about harassment] at Harvard, and it requires the type of understanding that AI is not yet capable of,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The underlying issue is that AI can only reliably conduct basic story analysis, meaning it is taught to look for specific triggers. It cannot go beyond that parameter and cannot pick up on broader cultural or unique interpersonal dynamics. This means the bots risk leaving gaps or proving oversensitive.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know when AI will break the \u2018story understanding\u2019 frontier,\u201d Subirana said.</p> <p>He added that if employees\u2019 correspondence gets flagged, it can create a climate of distrust, and offenders may learn how to trick the software. Alternatively, offenders could resort to other mediums of communication that are not monitored by the bots.</p> <p>A further concern is protecting the confidentiality of the data that is collected. Subirana said if the software made a mistake and the data was leaked, internal communications between employees could be seen by rival companies.</p> <p>\u201cThere are still hurdles to jump before AI can do what we think it can,\u201d Subirana said. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of any HR who has said it is useful for this yet.\u201d</p> <p>He is not the only sceptic.

      "bodyText": "Artificial intelligence programmers are developing bots that can identify digital bullying and sexual harassment. Known as \u201c#MeTooBots\u201d after the high-profile movement that arose after allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, the bots can monitor and flag communications between colleagues and are being introduced by companies around the world. Bot-makers say it is not easy to teach computers what harassment looks like, with its linguistic subtleties and grey lines. Jay Leib, the chief executive of the Chicago-based AI firm NexLP, said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of all the forms of harassment. I thought it was just talking dirty. It comes in so many different ways. It might be 15 messages \u2026 it could be racy photos.\u201d Nex\u2019s AI platform is used by more than 50 corporate clients, including law firms in London. The industry is a potentially fertile ground for the bots to examine: a third of female lawyers in Britain report having experienced sexual harassment. The bot uses an algorithm trained to identify potential bullying, including sexual harassment, in company documents, emails and chat. Data is analysed for various indicators that determine how likely it is to be a problem, with anything the AI reads as being potentially problematic then sent to a lawyer or HR manager to investigate. Exactly what indicators are deemed red flags remains a company secret, but Leib said the bot looked for anomalies in the language, frequency or timing of communication patterns across weeks, while constantly learning how to spot harassment. Leib believes other industries could also benefit. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest from clients across sectors such as financial services, pharmaceuticals,\u201d he said. Prof Brian Subirana, a lecturer in AI at Harvard and MIT, said the idea of using AI to root out harassment was promising though the bots\u2019 capabilities were limited. \u201cThere\u2019s a type of harassment that is very subtle and very hard to pick up. We have these training courses [about harassment] at Harvard, and it requires the type of understanding that AI is not yet capable of,\u201d he said. The underlying issue is that AI can only reliably conduct basic story analysis, meaning it is taught to look for specific triggers. It cannot go beyond that parameter and cannot pick up on broader cultural or unique interpersonal dynamics. This means the bots risk leaving gaps or proving oversensitive. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when AI will break the \u2018story understanding\u2019 frontier,\u201d Subirana said. He added that if employees\u2019 correspondence gets flagged, it can create a climate of distrust, and offenders may learn how to trick the software. Alternatively, offenders could resort to other mediums of communication that are not monitored by the bots. A further concern is protecting the confidentiality of the data that is collected. Subirana said if the software made a mistake and the data was leaked, internal communications between employees could be seen by rival companies. \u201cThere are still hurdles to jump before AI can do what we think it can,\u201d Subirana said. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of any HR who has said it is useful for this yet.\u201d He is not the only sceptic. Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, a women\u2019s rights NGO, pointed out there could be unforeseen consequences from policing staff\u2019s communications. \u201cWe would want to look carefully at how the technology is being developed, who is behind it, and whether the approach taken is informed by a workplace culture that is seeking to prevent harassment and promote equality, or whether it is in fact just another way to control their employees,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has implications for the privacy of staff and could be abused\u201d, she added. She suggested educating staff about appropriate attitudes and behaviours would be more effective in protecting potential victims. Despite the concerns, Subirana believes #MeTooBots could offer indirect benefits. \u201cThe use case that I could imagine is a training one. It could provide a database [of problematic messages],\u201d he said. He added that believing communications were being monitored could make people less prone to harass colleagues, in a placebo known as the Hawthorne effect. \u201cThere is a preventive element here,\u201d he said. Similar technology is being used to retrospectively scour large volumes of digital communications to fight harassment claims. One law firm using the technology is Morgan Lewis, which specialises in US employee and labour practice. But instead of monitoring employees, the AI is used to analyse clients\u2019 past communications. \u201cWe\u2019ve used this in dozens of cases,\u201d said Tess Blair, a partner at the firm. She said the tech usually helped build a case rather than providing the smoking gun.

If a full investigation proceeds, technology like Morgan Lewis\u2019s can analyse their clients\u2019 digital communications to build a case. But however good the #MeTooBots become, Blair sees their role as assistants to humans rather than an all-seeing judge, jury and executioner. \u201cComputers are not value-judging, they are saying \u2018this doesn\u2019t fit the pattern\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is then up to us to interpret.\u201d",

It\u2019s the sort of food that\u2019s so brimming with exciting flavours and textures that you\u2019d be hard pushed to miss meat. Chef Helen Graham\u2019s credentials include stints at popular Middle Eastern restaurants in Soho such as the Good Egg and the Palomar, and this shows in the dishes \u2013 from the pumpkin <em>tirshy</em> dip with preserved lemons (\u00a36.80), to the silky fried aubergine with date syrup (\u00a37).

The menu is 80% vegan at all times and totally plant-based every Tuesday. Both branches feature a \u201cfood boat\u201d, essentially a large buffet with an extensive range of hot and cold dishes. Food is priced by weight and tallied up at the counter (\u00a31.90 per 100g at breakfast, \u00a32.50 at lunch, \u00a32.80 at dinner, takeaway slightly cheaper), which can be a tad embarrassing when you\u2019ve been tempted by a little spoon of everything.

Restaurants that feature a mishmash of world foods are often best avoided (can they really make a decent Som Tam salad <em>and</em> a poke bowl?) but make an exception for Genesis. The menu offers a breakneck world tour, from a seitan shawarma and fries (\u00a314.95) to fried avocado tacos (two for 8.50). What boldly claims to be the only organic cocktail menu in the UK offers interesting, if not quite so healthy, accompaniments \u2013though they do cost \u00a310.50 each.<br>\u2022 <em>144 Commercial Street E1, <a href=\"https://eatgenesis.com/\" title=\"\">eatgenesis.com</a></em></p> <h2>The Vurger Co, Canary Wharf and Shoreditch</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c465c3df48cd2031c74f1c61d194ad82ced95fb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c465c3df48cd2031c74f1c61d194ad82ced95fb2/0_333_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vurger burgers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is the spot for the vegan burger of your dreams, from \u00a38.45. A squishy bun, cheese and a choice of four patties: classic bean; auburger, made of aubergine and chickpeas; chipotle corn fritter; or the opinion-dividing Beyond Meat patty (an LA concoction so realistically meaty it makes some veggies squeamish).

      "bodyText": "Bubala, Spitalfields This bijou Middle Eastern restaurant has only been up and running a few months, but the bright, airy and plant-filled space has already established itself as an unpretentious east London favourite for vegans. It\u2019s the sort of food that\u2019s so brimming with exciting flavours and textures that you\u2019d be hard pushed to miss meat. Chef Helen Graham\u2019s credentials include stints at popular Middle Eastern restaurants in Soho such as the Good Egg and the Palomar, and this shows in the dishes \u2013 from the pumpkin tirshy dip with preserved lemons (\u00a36.80), to the silky fried aubergine with date syrup (\u00a37). The menu is 80% plant-based and there\u2019s a vegan set menu of 11 dishes for \u00a330. \u2022 65 Commercial Street E1, bubala.co.uk Tibits, Bankside and Regent Street There\u2019s something wonderfully old-fashioned about Tibits \u2013 you won\u2019t find hip takes on street food or yet another version of mac\u2019n\u2019cheese, just wholesome dishes that celebrate vegetables. The menu is 80% vegan at all times and totally plant-based every Tuesday. Both branches feature a \u201cfood boat\u201d, essentially a large buffet with an extensive range of hot and cold dishes. Food is priced by weight and tallied up at the counter (\u00a31.90 per 100g at breakfast, \u00a32.50 at lunch, \u00a32.80 at dinner, takeaway slightly cheaper), which can be a tad embarrassing when you\u2019ve been tempted by a little spoon of everything. Look out for the unusual \u2013 and moreish \u2013 dried green bean and walnut salad. \u2022 12-14 Heddon Street, off Regent Street W1; and 124 Southwark Street SE1, tibits.co.uk Black Cat Vegan Cafe, Hackney Black Cat prides itself on being an independent vegan cafe with heart. Everything at the venue is cruelty-free (right down to the cleaning products), it\u2019s run cooperatively and there\u2019s a bookshop selling cookery books and political literature \u2013 for perusing as you indulge in one of its homemade cakes. It has a laid-back, cosy feel and the regularly changing menu is delicious and well-priced \u2013 try the Caribbean Chick\u2019n Stew with rice and fried plantains (\u00a39.75) or the chickpea and roasted veg pancake (\u00a38). Black Cat is also currently running a residency at Shoreditch bar Roadtrip &amp; The Workshop, with an all-vegan \u201ctapas without borders\u201d menu. \u2022 76A Clarence Road E5, blackcatcafe.co.uk Genesis, Shoreditch In an act of filial rebellion, Alex and Oliver Santoro didn\u2019t let their family\u2019s 100-year history in the meat industry stop them co-founding this vegan and organic diner. Though the vegan brothers stepped down from the business in 2019, the ethos is being continued at this Spitalfields location. Restaurants that feature a mishmash of world foods are often best avoided (can they really make a decent Som Tam salad and a poke bowl?) but make an exception for Genesis. The menu offers a breakneck world tour, from a seitan shawarma and fries (\u00a314.95) to fried avocado tacos (two for 8.50). What boldly claims to be the only organic cocktail menu in the UK offers interesting, if not quite so healthy, accompaniments \u2013though they do cost \u00a310.50 each. \u2022 144 Commercial Street E1, eatgenesis.com The Vurger Co, Canary Wharf and Shoreditch This is the spot for the vegan burger of your dreams, from \u00a38.45. A squishy bun, cheese and a choice of four patties: classic bean; auburger, made of aubergine and chickpeas; chipotle corn fritter; or the opinion-dividing Beyond Meat patty (an LA concoction so realistically meaty it makes some veggies squeamish). This is very much a fast-food restaurant rather than a place for a lengthy lunch, and the decor reflects that. It serves vegan wine and craft beers \u2013 plus indulgent biscoff or salted popcorn shakes (\u00a34.95). Added bonus: all the packaging is compostable and no restaurant waste goes to landfill. \u2022 Unit 9, Avant Garde Building, 6 Richmix Square, Cygnet Street E1; and Unit 1, The Wharf Kitchen, Jubilee Place Lower Mall 2, E14, thevurgerco.com The Gate, Marylebone, St John\u2019s Wood, Islington and Hammersmith Tasty enough to seduce even the most hardened of carnivores, The Gate was feeding vegans long before it was trendy, and counts the likes of Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow as fans.

      "body": "<p>Last summer, in the midst of promotional chaos surrounding my new novel The Offing, I cancelled my own London book launch and instead drove to the Chatsworth estate in Derbyshire, a place I had never previously visited, and jumped in the river right in front of the very big house. It was not entirely an act of self-destruction or a plea for help. (No one knew I was there, the river was only five feet deep and I\u2019m no Virginia Woolf.) It simply seemed like a more obvious thing to do than trying to persuade members of the public to buy my book, and an act more broadly in keeping with the spirit of the novel in question and my writing life in general.</p> <p>Out in the middle of the bracing River Derwent, with one foot hovering over a deeper, much darker, metaphorical void, I reached beneath the first rock I came to and pulled out a large crayfish. I held the creature aloft, as if it were a totem or trophy. Lobster features significantly in The Offing and here was its freshwater cousin, so it must mean something, I thought. <em>Something Very Important.</em></p> <p>Facing the fact that such crustaceans have crawled the Earth for at least 100m years, my own ruminations, paranoia and worries suddenly seemed tragically over-thought. For a few moments, that tenacious crayfish brought me back into being and told me that everything was going to be all right. It intimated all this with its probing, beady eyes.</p> <p>Relating this, I now realise I was perhaps driven half-insane with anxiety, and it was largely my own doing. Writing had put me there in the river, talking to a crustacean while elderly couples in North Face jackets looked on, instead of attempting to charm a smattering of London readers. Even in my drinking days, I never chatted to crayfish.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were puking jags, migraines and aching muscles. Food lost its flavour and noises became amplified</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the decade draws to a close and I tot up my published work \u2013 seven novels, one work of non-fiction, three short poetry collections \u2013 only now do I see why exhaustion triggered a tsunami of anxiety that hit so powerfully that I was laid up for several weeks, incapable of doing little but watch period dramas as I lay foetal on the sofa. What I can\u2019t tell you about EM Forster adaptations really isn\u2019t worth knowing.</p> <p>Shit, as they say, had got real, in a very pathetic, very English way.</p> <p>Numerous reports suggest we are currently in the midst of an anxiety epidemic, but it is often only evident when it is upon you, and mind and body switch into energy-saving mode. For me, anxiety goes way back. All those years reading Camus, Sartre and Hamsun and still I had failed to see the signs stacking up over the previous months: the rising sense of panic, the narcolepsy-like bouts of sleep at inopportune moments, the way my digestive system went into revolt. There were puking jags, migraines and aching muscles. Food lost its flavour and noises became amplified, so much so that I became fixated on a neighbour\u2019s cockerel that crowed every morning from 3.55am, and which I wanted to strangle. Even the chimes of the local church bells sounded malevolent, as if mocking my shortcomings. Anxiety feels like you\u2019ve had your skin removed.</p> <p>Every day I was reading articles about mental health awareness \u2013 I think I even wrote some \u2013 while ignoring my own. I\u2019d seen some friends get sectioned and others struggling, but I thought I was fine. I had a version of myself to sell to the world: that of the fully functioning human being. My GP when I saw him looked worse than I felt \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve not had a holiday in eight months,\u201d he wearily confided through a yawn \u2013 and I spent much of my allotted 12 minutes listening to his plight, finally diagnosing him as suffering from exhaustion.</p> <p>I did what I could. I got out of bed to appear on BBC Radio 4 and then went straight back to it. I did photoshoots in my back garden, as that was as far as I could travel. I dined on rather a lot of tranquilisers before another appearance. I listened to the same two songs for the entire summer (Truth Hurts by Lizzo and Jogging by Richard Dawson). And so it went. To anyone who encountered me during this period I probably appeared fine, but I felt drunk all the time, even though these days I\u2019m teetotal. Other authors sent nice messages secretly relating similar experiences and thankfully I have a wonderfully understanding agent and publicist who were looking out for me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Doing nothing is harder than you think. It involves saying no and suspending any sense of guilt at doing so</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Courses of counselling mean I now understand the origins of my anxiety, but not how to banish it. I\u2019m not entirely convinced it is possible to rid oneself of anxiety, just as we can\u2019t rid ourselves of joy, excitement or desire, though swimming, meditation, yoga, long walks, CBT, massages, CBD oil, acupuncture and a 13-album box-set by Gong all help at different times. In the end, I\u2019ve learned the only real cures are time spent with my wife and dog, and doing nothing.</p> <p>Doing nothing is harder than you think. It involves saying no and suspending any sense of guilt at doing so. It involves feeling (though not necessarily <em>being</em>) selfish. It also means missing out on opportunities. Of course, all work is hard, and writing remains the best job in the world, even though it\u2019s not technically a job, because most jobs \u2013 at least, until recently \u2013 offered sick pay, pensions, workers\u2019 rights and some degree of stability. But the perks are many, chief among them the freedom to be selfish.</p> <p>Underlying my summer meltdown was something more prosaic: wisdom-tooth problems and endless infections mere inches from my brain, yet every time I got given a surgery date it clashed with promotional opportunities. For my publicist, getting me to do things was no doubt like pulling teeth, yet getting a tooth pulled was all I wanted. The NHS treatment was wonderful, but the surgery was rough: some of my jawbone was removed and I was given fentanyl, a drug 100 times stronger than morphine. I eased into autumn with a swollen head, and nicely off my nut.</p> <p>It\u2019s at this point in such articles that we might conclude with a brief anecdote to illustrate redemption and a self-congratulatory payoff about how wonderful life is now the author has discovered spin classes and celery juice. This is not one of those pieces. I do feel better, for now. I\u2019m still swimming, I\u2019m writing a new novel. And I\u2019m still aware that anxiety sits beneath everything, like bedrock. It\u2019s a part of me, and especially insidious in the mornings. I think perhaps it\u2019s a part of most of us as we enter the third decade of an utterly traumatic century. It\u2019s wild out there in the world. All we can do is look out for each other and recognise the signs. And stay in bed now and again.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/21/the-offing-benjamin-myers-review\">The Offing by Benjamin Myers</a> is published by Bloomsbury Circus.</p>",

Writing had put me there in the river, talking to a crustacean while elderly couples in North Face jackets looked on, instead of attempting to charm a smattering of London readers. Even in my drinking days, I never chatted to crayfish. As the decade draws to a close and I tot up my published work \u2013 seven novels, one work of non-fiction, three short poetry collections \u2013 only now do I see why exhaustion triggered a tsunami of anxiety that hit so powerfully that I was laid up for several weeks, incapable of doing little but watch period dramas as I lay foetal on the sofa. What I can\u2019t tell you about EM Forster adaptations really isn\u2019t worth knowing. Shit, as they say, had got real, in a very pathetic, very English way. Numerous reports suggest we are currently in the midst of an anxiety epidemic, but it is often only evident when it is upon you, and mind and body switch into energy-saving mode. For me, anxiety goes way back. All those years reading Camus, Sartre and Hamsun and still I had failed to see the signs stacking up over the previous months: the rising sense of panic, the narcolepsy-like bouts of sleep at inopportune moments, the way my digestive system went into revolt. There were puking jags, migraines and aching muscles. Food lost its flavour and noises became amplified, so much so that I became fixated on a neighbour\u2019s cockerel that crowed every morning from 3.55am, and which I wanted to strangle. Even the chimes of the local church bells sounded malevolent, as if mocking my shortcomings. Anxiety feels like you\u2019ve had your skin removed. Every day I was reading articles about mental health awareness \u2013 I think I even wrote some \u2013 while ignoring my own. I\u2019d seen some friends get sectioned and others struggling, but I thought I was fine. I had a version of myself to sell to the world: that of the fully functioning human being. My GP when I saw him looked worse than I felt \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve not had a holiday in eight months,\u201d he wearily confided through a yawn \u2013 and I spent much of my allotted 12 minutes listening to his plight, finally diagnosing him as suffering from exhaustion. I did what I could. I got out of bed to appear on BBC Radio 4 and then went straight back to it. I did photoshoots in my back garden, as that was as far as I could travel. I dined on rather a lot of tranquilisers before another appearance. I listened to the same two songs for the entire summer (Truth Hurts by Lizzo and Jogging by Richard Dawson). And so it went. To anyone who encountered me during this period I probably appeared fine, but I felt drunk all the time, even though these days I\u2019m teetotal. Other authors sent nice messages secretly relating similar experiences and thankfully I have a wonderfully understanding agent and publicist who were looking out for me. Courses of counselling mean I now understand the origins of my anxiety, but not how to banish it. I\u2019m not entirely convinced it is possible to rid oneself of anxiety, just as we can\u2019t rid ourselves of joy, excitement or desire, though swimming, meditation, yoga, long walks, CBT, massages, CBD oil, acupuncture and a 13-album box-set by Gong all help at different times. In the end, I\u2019ve learned the only real cures are time spent with my wife and dog, and doing nothing. Doing nothing is harder than you think. It involves saying no and suspending any sense of guilt at doing so. It involves feeling (though not necessarily being) selfish. It also means missing out on opportunities. Of course, all work is hard, and writing remains the best job in the world, even though it\u2019s not technically a job, because most jobs \u2013 at least, until recently \u2013 offered sick pay, pensions, workers\u2019 rights and some degree of stability. But the perks are many, chief among them the freedom to be selfish. Underlying my summer meltdown was something more prosaic: wisdom-tooth problems and endless infections mere inches from my brain, yet every time I got given a surgery date it clashed with promotional opportunities. For my publicist, getting me to do things was no doubt like pulling teeth, yet getting a tooth pulled was all I wanted. The NHS treatment was wonderful, but the surgery was rough: some of my jawbone was removed and I was given fentanyl, a drug 100 times stronger than morphine. I eased into autumn with a swollen head, and nicely off my nut. It\u2019s at this point in such articles that we might conclude with a brief anecdote to illustrate redemption and a self-congratulatory payoff about how wonderful life is now the author has discovered spin classes and celery juice. This is not one of those pieces. I do feel better, for now. I\u2019m still swimming, I\u2019m writing a new novel. And I\u2019m still aware that anxiety sits beneath everything, like bedrock. It\u2019s a part of me, and especially insidious in the mornings. I think perhaps it\u2019s a part of most of us as we enter the third decade of an utterly traumatic century. It\u2019s wild out there in the world. All we can do is look out for each other and recognise the signs. And stay in bed now and again. \u2022 The Offing by Benjamin Myers is published by Bloomsbury Circus.",

      "body": "<p>If you have been in a relationship for a year or more, you will know exactly what \u201cthat argument\u201d is. It is the one that keeps going round and round, always ending where it started.</p> <p>\u201cYou never pick up your dirty clothes, even though you know it drives me crazy.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re always late, even when I remind you how much it matters to me.\u201d And so on.</p> <p>But you don\u2019t have to go on like this. There are a number of ways to stop \u2013 or at least control \u2013 the endless bickering. Take a look at the disputes one by one, so you can choose the most suitable way to neutralise your own argument and, as a bonus, improve your relationship.</p> <p>Before you start, though, you must answer an important question. I would suggest you and your partner answer it separately, then compare your answers: \u201cIf you weren\u2019t arguing about X, what would you enjoy doing instead?\u201d</p> <p>The answer is critical, because if you can\u2019t come up with anything much, you won\u2019t have enough incentive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/anyone-can-change-any-habit-science-keeping-2018-resolutions\" title=\"\">to break your unhappy habit</a>. If you both come up with some suggestions, that is great news: start building them into your schedules right away. If you drew a blank, think back to when you first met. What did you enjoy doing then that you could build into your relationship today? Find a way to do so.</p> <p>Once you take this positive step, you will notice things starting to improve, because the more time you spend having fun together, the less time \u2013 and less incentive \u2013 you have to argue. Yes, you will probably still have the argument, but hopefully a bit less often, because we haven\u2019t yet tackled it. This is the next task.</p> <p>Here are six techniques to consider.</p> <h2>The DIY approach</h2> <p>Maybe your partner doesn\u2019t want to work on this problem. Maybe you just want to get on with other things yourself. If so, the DIY approach is for you. All you have to do is make up your mind to stop caring about whatever has been annoying you. You can do this if you will accept that your partner\u2019s behaviour is not the problem; the real problem is that you allow yourself to become irritated by that behaviour. Kahlil Gibran explains this elegantly in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/30/digested-classic-the-prophet-kahlil-gibran\" title=\"\">The Prophet</a> when someone in the audience asks him how to become free of negativity: \u201cIf it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you. And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e067bc20a2fa9d477878643dbcccf998c848aa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e067bc20a2fa9d477878643dbcccf998c848aa9/81_94_2614_3265/801.jpg\" alt=\"Kahlil Gibran in about 1898\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you\u2019 ... Kahlil Gibran, pictured circa 1898.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Photographic Society/Victoria and Albert Museum, London/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adopting the DIY approach involves a change of attitude. What your partner says or does is no longer critical.

      "bodyText": "If you have been in a relationship for a year or more, you will know exactly what \u201cthat argument\u201d is. It is the one that keeps going round and round, always ending where it started. \u201cYou never pick up your dirty clothes, even though you know it drives me crazy.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re always late, even when I remind you how much it matters to me.\u201d And so on. But you don\u2019t have to go on like this. There are a number of ways to stop \u2013 or at least control \u2013 the endless bickering. Take a look at the disputes one by one, so you can choose the most suitable way to neutralise your own argument and, as a bonus, improve your relationship. Before you start, though, you must answer an important question. I would suggest you and your partner answer it separately, then compare your answers: \u201cIf you weren\u2019t arguing about X, what would you enjoy doing instead?\u201d The answer is critical, because if you can\u2019t come up with anything much, you won\u2019t have enough incentive to break your unhappy habit. If you both come up with some suggestions, that is great news: start building them into your schedules right away. If you drew a blank, think back to when you first met. What did you enjoy doing then that you could build into your relationship today? Find a way to do so. Once you take this positive step, you will notice things starting to improve, because the more time you spend having fun together, the less time \u2013 and less incentive \u2013 you have to argue. Yes, you will probably still have the argument, but hopefully a bit less often, because we haven\u2019t yet tackled it. This is the next task. Here are six techniques to consider. The DIY approach Maybe your partner doesn\u2019t want to work on this problem. Maybe you just want to get on with other things yourself. If so, the DIY approach is for you. All you have to do is make up your mind to stop caring about whatever has been annoying you. You can do this if you will accept that your partner\u2019s behaviour is not the problem; the real problem is that you allow yourself to become irritated by that behaviour. Kahlil Gibran explains this elegantly in The Prophet when someone in the audience asks him how to become free of negativity: \u201cIf it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you. And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.\u201d Adopting the DIY approach involves a change of attitude. What your partner says or does is no longer critical. How you react is what matters now \u2013 and that is entirely up to you. Of course, letting go like this is much easier said than done, particularly if your argument is well-entrenched and if the topic concerns something deeply important to you. If that is the case, you may want to try one of the other techniques, either alone or in combination with this. The digging-under approach Often the content of the argument is a cover for a more fundamental difference. In my clinical experience, couples argue about four main issues: a perceived imbalance of power/lack of reciprocity; lack or loss of trust; lack or loss of respect; or lack of understanding about differing needs for space and independence. If you want to get to the bottom of what you are arguing about, uncovering that fundamental difference is your task. Because of the strength of the emotions involved and the feelings of vulnerability that are bound to arise, this is hard to do without the presence of a trusted, experienced third person. If you want to take this approach \u2013 and it is a good one, because it may well prevent new versions of the argument from springing up \u2013 I suggest you sign up for some sessions with a recommended couples\u2019 therapist. The ring-fencing game Therapists often use this technique, in which permission is given to have the argument, but only at set times and for a set duration (preferably not just before bedtime). For example, you can argue, but only between 7pm and 7.30pm on Mondays and Thursdays. Usually, the couple find this so artificial that they feel less like arguing and more like laughing at something that, having had time to cool down, seems rather trivial. The balancing act This approach is based on behavioural marital therapy (BMT), a type of therapy popular in the 70s and early 80s. Each partner defines a behaviour they find irritating in the other (focusing on the content of the argument in question) and suggests an alternative positive substitute. Then, whenever the argument crops up, each partner agrees to behave in the positive manner instead of arguing. Although a number of studies showed BMT can produce specific behavioural changes, Matthew Sanders and colleagues at the University of Queensland reviewed the relevant literature and concluded that, despite this, the relationship doesn\u2019t usually improve overall. So, this option is one to try if you wish to eliminate a specific argument and don\u2019t mind if nothing else changes. Fifty shades of grey Whenever emotions dominate, we start thinking in black and white. In other words, we assume there are only two solutions to any problem: either I am right or you are right. In truth, however, there are many possible solutions. When we are feeling calm and rational, it is easy to see that. So, to deal with your argument more rationally, begin by agreeing to call time immediately whenever you start arguing. Then, wait at least 20 minutes \u2013 the time it takes for emotions to settle so reason can reassert itself. You can make it even more likely you will calm down if you spend that time doing something you enjoy, on your own. After this time apart, sit down together. Each of you must come up with five ways the other could behave or react that wouldn\u2019t feel upsetting (and might even feel good). Talk these through until you reach a compromise. This technique is borrowed from parenting literature, because it is a great way to sort out arguments between siblings. It doesn\u2019t guarantee you will not create another argument, but it means you have a strategy for dealing with it if you do. The debating game I have saved this technique for last because it is my favourite. It requires effort, imagination and some acting skill, but it is worth it. Not only can the debating game sort out your differences, but it also deepens empathy, a quality that will positively affect all your relationships. Instead of waiting for the argument to surface, choose a time when you are both calm and reasonably rested. Find a quiet, comfortable spot and deliberately call the argument to mind. You must now change places \u2013 that is, each must imagine their partner\u2019s point of view. Argue from the other side, say for 10 minutes, or until you feel you have covered all angles.

      "body": "<p>Futurism is a mug\u2019s game: if you\u2019re right, it seems banal; if you\u2019re wrong, you look like the founder of IBM, Thomas Watson, when he declared in 1943 that there is room in the world \u201cfor maybe five computers\u201d.</p> <p>David Adams knew these risks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/18/2020.davidadam\" title=\"\">when he wrote about the future of technology</a> in the Guardian in 2004 \u2013 even citing the very same prediction as an example of how they can go awry. And from our vantage point in 2020, Adams certainly did a better job than Watson. When he looked ahead to today, he avoided many of the pitfalls of technology prediction: no promises about flying cars nor sci-fi tech such as teleportation or faster-than-light travel.</p> <p>But in some ways, the predictions were overly pessimistic. Technology really has made great leaps and bounds in the past 16 years, nowhere more clearly than AI. \u201cArtificial intelligence brains simply cannot cope with change and unpredictable events,\u201d wrote Adams, explaining why robots would be unlikely to interact with humans any time soon.</p> <p>\u201cFundamentally, it\u2019s just very difficult to get a robot to tell the difference between a picture of a tree and a real tree,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/13/driverless-cars-will-make-our-roads-safer-says-oxbotica-co-founder\" title=\"\">Paul Newman</a>, then and now a robotics expert at Oxford University, told Adams. Happily, Newman proved his own pessimism to be unwarranted: in 2014, he co-founded Oxbotica, which has hopefully solved the problem he mentioned, because it makes and sells driverless car technology to vehicle manufacturers around the world.</p> <p>If we move on from worrying over details, there are two key points at which the 2020 predictions fall apart: one about tech, the other about society.</p> <p>\u201cGadget lovers could use a single keypad to operate their phone, PDA [tablet] and MP3 music player,\u201d Adams wrote, \u201cor combine the output of their watch, pager and radio into a single speaker.\u201d The idea of greater convergence and connectivity between personal electronics was correct. But there was a very specific hole in this prediction: the smartphone. After half a century of single-purpose consumer electronics, it was difficult to perceive how all-encompassing a single device could become, but just three years after Adams pubished his piece, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/29/iphone-at-10-how-it-changed-everything\" title=\"\">the iPhone launched and changed everything</a>. Forget carrying around a separate MP3 player; in the real 2020, people aren\u2019t even carrying separate cameras, wallets or car keys.</p> <p>Failing to foresee the smartphone is an oversight about the progress of technology. But the other missing point is about how society would respond to the changing forces. The 2004 predictions are, fundamentally, optimistic. Adams writes about biometric healthcare data being beamed to your doctor\u2019s computer; about washing machines that automatically arrange their own servicing based on availability in your \u201celectronic organiser\u201d; and about radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips on your clothes that trigger customised adverts or programme your phone based on where you are. And through it all is a sense of trust: these changes will be good, and the companies making them well-intentioned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdbd3108beded0ef6b3743d48c8a5bbf5c502618\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdbd3108beded0ef6b3743d48c8a5bbf5c502618/0_0_4606_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robots are here to stay \u2026 an automated production line in China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robots are here to stay \u2026 an automated production line in China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: China News Service/VCG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is a loss of privacy that is going to be very difficult for people and we haven\u2019t figured out how to deal with that,\u201d one of Adams\u2019s interviewees admitted, when describing technology in 2020. \u201cBut if you explain what it does, how much information it provides and where it goes \u2013 and that the trade-off is that you don\u2019t have to wait as long in line at the supermarket \u2013 then people will take the trade-off.\u201d In fact, over the past decade and a half, the vast majority of people were simply never given the choice to accept the trade-off, and it is increasingly clear that many of them never would have if they had understood what was at risk.</p> <p>If the Guardian missed the advent of the smartphone, despite writing just three years before the launch of the iPhone, how can we possibly do better today, looking 10 times further ahead? The world of 2050 will be unimaginably different in many ways, even if we can safely assume people will still generally have two arms, two legs and an unpleasant smell if they don\u2019t wash for long periods of time.</p> <p>But there are forces working in our favour. The internet is far more entrenched now than it was in 2004, and while its chaotic effect on our lives shows no sign of abating, it is at least predictably unpredictable. Similarly, smartphone penetration in the west is now as high as it looks likely to go. However the world changes over the next 30 years, it won\u2019t be as a result of more Britons or Americans getting phones.</p> <p>Other predictions can be as simple as following trendlines to their logical conclusion. By 2050, the switchover to electric cars will have mostly finished, at least in developed nations \u2013 as well as in those developing nations, such as China, that are starting to prioritise air quality over cheap mechanisation.</p> <p>The \u201cnext billion\u201d will be online, mostly through low-cost smartphones receiving increasingly ubiquitous cellular connections. But what they do on the internet is harder to guess. In 2020, there are two countervailing trends at work: on the one hand, providers, principally Facebook, have been trying to use subsidised deals to push newly connected nations on to stripped-down versions of the internet. If they succeed at scale, then many of the benefits of the web will be stolen from whole nations, reduced instead to being passive participants in Facebook and a few local media and payment companies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"92ebab4838cd86d10f29d3934830256d6074e1f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92ebab4838cd86d10f29d3934830256d6074e1f1/0_347_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Who will be the \u2018next billion\u2019 users?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Who will be the \u2018next billion\u2019 users?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: triloks/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But pushback, from national regulators in places such as India and from competing carriers, could bring the new nations to the real internet instead. Unless, that is, national regulators push in a different direction, copying China, Iran and Russia to keep Facebook out by building a purely nationalistic internet. How better to ensure that the benefits of the web accrue domestically, they reason, than by requiring your citizens to use home-grown services? And if it makes it easier to impose censorship, well, that\u2019s just another benefit.</p> <p>James Bridle, the author of the unsettling book New Dark Age, points out that the discussion can\u2019t lose sight of who the next billion actually are. \u201cI keep thinking about the way the tech industry talks about \u2018the next billion users\u2019 without acknowledging that those people are going to be hot, wet and pissed off,\u201d he says, \u201cand we\u2019re only talking about hardening borders, rather than preparing \u2013 politically, socially, technologically \u2013 for this reality.\u201d</p> <p>Because, if we are guessing the future from simple trend lines, there is another one that we need to acknowledge: the climate. The specifics of what will change are not for this piece, but the human response very much is.</p> <p>One possibility is plan A: humanity, in time, reaches net zero when it comes to emissions. In that scenario, we will live in a world where plant proteins replace meat in everyday consumption, where electrically powered networked mass transit reaches into the suburbs and beyond, a world of video-conferencing and remote attendance steadily chipping away at business flights, and of insulation inside the walls of British homes. (Look, it can\u2019t all be high-tech.)</p> <p>If plan A fails, then there is a chance we turn to plan B. That is a world in which megascale injections of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere turn the heavens a milky-white, and a whole generation never sees a clear blue sky, in order to reflect more of the sun\u2019s rays and pause the greenhouse effect. It is one in which we turn on gigantic processing plants that do nothing but extract carbon dioxide from the air and pump it underground into disused oil wells. It is one in which whole cities are abandoned and populations relocated to avoid the worst effects we can\u2019t prevent.</p> <p>Plan B \u2013 geoengineering \u2013 is neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the future of humanity, says Holly Jean Buck, the author of After Geoengineering. \u201cThe worst thing would be we fail plan A and plan B. Over the next decade, I think [some form of geoengineering will be tried]\u2019. Right now, it\u2019s toned down, I think because of people not wanting to talk about it. We don\u2019t have the body of knowledge, and would need 20 or 30 years to develop it. Right about midcentury means it will be a crunch point: climate change will be really apparent.\u201d</p> <p>But for Buck, as for Bridle, the distinctions that really matter aren\u2019t necessarily the technology. \u201cThe choices around whether we have a livable future or a dystopian one are about social attitudes and social changes.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, we\u2019re in this era of stopgaps. Society used to be able to make a long-term plan: people built long-term infrastructure and thought a bit further out. That\u2019s not something that happens now: we go to quick fixes. We need a cultural change in values, to enable more deliberate decision-making.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"17b458cd30ce9013959bebd782556d0e990a7882\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17b458cd30ce9013959bebd782556d0e990a7882/0_432_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In 2004, we failed to foresee the smartphone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 2004, we failed to foresee the smartphone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: triloks/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is another possibility: that technology really does save the day, and then some. John Maeda, the chief experience officer at the digital consultancy Publicis Sapient, says that by 2050, \u201ccomputational machines will have surpassed the processing power of all the living human brains on Earth. The cloud will also have absorbed the thinking of the many dead brains on Earth, too \u2013 and we all need to work together to survive. So I predict that we will see a lasting cooperation between the human race and the computational machines of the future.\u201d</p> <p>This sort of thinking has come to be known as the singularity: the idea that there will be a point, perhaps even a singular moment in time, when the ability of thinking machines outstrips those who created them, and progress accelerates with dizzying results.</p> <p>\u201cIf you interview AI researchers about when general AI \u2013 a machine that can do everything a human can do \u2013 will arrive, they think it\u2019s about 50/50 whether it will be before 2050,\u201d says Tom Chivers, the author of The AI Does Not Hate You.</p> <p>\u201cThey also think that AGI\u201d \u2013 artificial general intelligence \u2013 \u201ccan be hugely transformative \u2013 lots of them signed an open letter in 2015 saying \u2018eradication of disease and poverty\u2019 could be possible. But also,\u201d he adds, citing a 2013 survey in the field, \u201con average they think there is about a 15% to 20% chance of a \u2018very bad outcome [existential catastrophe]\u2019, which means everyone dead.\u201d</p> <p>There is, perhaps, little point in dwelling on the 50% chance that AGI does develop. If it does, every other prediction we could make is moot, and this story, and perhaps humanity as we know it, will be forgotten. And if we assume that transcendentally brilliant artificial minds won\u2019t be along to save or destroy us, and live according to that outlook, then what is the worst that could happen \u2013 we build a better world for nothing?</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 January 2020 to clarify that Holly Jean Buck was not predicting that solar geoengineering, specifically, would be tried in the next decade.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Futurism is a mug\u2019s game: if you\u2019re right, it seems banal; if you\u2019re wrong, you look like the founder of IBM, Thomas Watson, when he declared in 1943 that there is room in the world \u201cfor maybe five computers\u201d. David Adams knew these risks when he wrote about the future of technology in the Guardian in 2004 \u2013 even citing the very same prediction as an example of how they can go awry. And from our vantage point in 2020, Adams certainly did a better job than Watson. When he looked ahead to today, he avoided many of the pitfalls of technology prediction: no promises about flying cars nor sci-fi tech such as teleportation or faster-than-light travel. But in some ways, the predictions were overly pessimistic. Technology really has made great leaps and bounds in the past 16 years, nowhere more clearly than AI. \u201cArtificial intelligence brains simply cannot cope with change and unpredictable events,\u201d wrote Adams, explaining why robots would be unlikely to interact with humans any time soon. \u201cFundamentally, it\u2019s just very difficult to get a robot to tell the difference between a picture of a tree and a real tree,\u201d Paul Newman, then and now a robotics expert at Oxford University, told Adams. Happily, Newman proved his own pessimism to be unwarranted: in 2014, he co-founded Oxbotica, which has hopefully solved the problem he mentioned, because it makes and sells driverless car technology to vehicle manufacturers around the world. If we move on from worrying over details, there are two key points at which the 2020 predictions fall apart: one about tech, the other about society. \u201cGadget lovers could use a single keypad to operate their phone, PDA [tablet] and MP3 music player,\u201d Adams wrote, \u201cor combine the output of their watch, pager and radio into a single speaker.\u201d The idea of greater convergence and connectivity between personal electronics was correct. But there was a very specific hole in this prediction: the smartphone. After half a century of single-purpose consumer electronics, it was difficult to perceive how all-encompassing a single device could become, but just three years after Adams pubished his piece, the iPhone launched and changed everything. Forget carrying around a separate MP3 player; in the real 2020, people aren\u2019t even carrying separate cameras, wallets or car keys. Failing to foresee the smartphone is an oversight about the progress of technology. But the other missing point is about how society would respond to the changing forces. The 2004 predictions are, fundamentally, optimistic. Adams writes about biometric healthcare data being beamed to your doctor\u2019s computer; about washing machines that automatically arrange their own servicing based on availability in your \u201celectronic organiser\u201d; and about radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips on your clothes that trigger customised adverts or programme your phone based on where you are. And through it all is a sense of trust: these changes will be good, and the companies making them well-intentioned. \u201cThere is a loss of privacy that is going to be very difficult for people and we haven\u2019t figured out how to deal with that,\u201d one of Adams\u2019s interviewees admitted, when describing technology in 2020. \u201cBut if you explain what it does, how much information it provides and where it goes \u2013 and that the trade-off is that you don\u2019t have to wait as long in line at the supermarket \u2013 then people will take the trade-off.\u201d In fact, over the past decade and a half, the vast majority of people were simply never given the choice to accept the trade-off, and it is increasingly clear that many of them never would have if they had understood what was at risk. If the Guardian missed the advent of the smartphone, despite writing just three years before the launch of the iPhone, how can we possibly do better today, looking 10 times further ahead? The world of 2050 will be unimaginably different in many ways, even if we can safely assume people will still generally have two arms, two legs and an unpleasant smell if they don\u2019t wash for long periods of time. But there are forces working in our favour. The internet is far more entrenched now than it was in 2004, and while its chaotic effect on our lives shows no sign of abating, it is at least predictably unpredictable. Similarly, smartphone penetration in the west is now as high as it looks likely to go. However the world changes over the next 30 years, it won\u2019t be as a result of more Britons or Americans getting phones. Other predictions can be as simple as following trendlines to their logical conclusion. By 2050, the switchover to electric cars will have mostly finished, at least in developed nations \u2013 as well as in those developing nations, such as China, that are starting to prioritise air quality over cheap mechanisation. The \u201cnext billion\u201d will be online, mostly through low-cost smartphones receiving increasingly ubiquitous cellular connections. But what they do on the internet is harder to guess. In 2020, there are two countervailing trends at work: on the one hand, providers, principally Facebook, have been trying to use subsidised deals to push newly connected nations on to stripped-down versions of the internet. If they succeed at scale, then many of the benefits of the web will be stolen from whole nations, reduced instead to being passive participants in Facebook and a few local media and payment companies. But pushback, from national regulators in places such as India and from competing carriers, could bring the new nations to the real internet instead. Unless, that is, national regulators push in a different direction, copying China, Iran and Russia to keep Facebook out by building a purely nationalistic internet. How better to ensure that the benefits of the web accrue domestically, they reason, than by requiring your citizens to use home-grown services? And if it makes it easier to impose censorship, well, that\u2019s just another benefit. James Bridle, the author of the unsettling book New Dark Age, points out that the discussion can\u2019t lose sight of who the next billion actually are. \u201cI keep thinking about the way the tech industry talks about \u2018the next billion users\u2019 without acknowledging that those people are going to be hot, wet and pissed off,\u201d he says, \u201cand we\u2019re only talking about hardening borders, rather than preparing \u2013 politically, socially, technologically \u2013 for this reality.\u201d Because, if we are guessing the future from simple trend lines, there is another one that we need to acknowledge: the climate. The specifics of what will change are not for this piece, but the human response very much is. One possibility is plan A: humanity, in time, reaches net zero when it comes to emissions. In that scenario, we will live in a world where plant proteins replace meat in everyday consumption, where electrically powered networked mass transit reaches into the suburbs and beyond, a world of video-conferencing and remote attendance steadily chipping away at business flights, and of insulation inside the walls of British homes. (Look, it can\u2019t all be high-tech.) If plan A fails, then there is a chance we turn to plan B. That is a world in which megascale injections of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere turn the heavens a milky-white, and a whole generation never sees a clear blue sky, in order to reflect more of the sun\u2019s rays and pause the greenhouse effect. It is one in which we turn on gigantic processing plants that do nothing but extract carbon dioxide from the air and pump it underground into disused oil wells. It is one in which whole cities are abandoned and populations relocated to avoid the worst effects we can\u2019t prevent. Plan B \u2013 geoengineering \u2013 is neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the future of humanity, says Holly Jean Buck, the author of After Geoengineering. \u201cThe worst thing would be we fail plan A and plan B. Over the next decade, I think [some form of geoengineering will be tried]\u2019. Right now, it\u2019s toned down, I think because of people not wanting to talk about it. We don\u2019t have the body of knowledge, and would need 20 or 30 years to develop it. Right about midcentury means it will be a crunch point: climate change will be really apparent.\u201d But for Buck, as for Bridle, the distinctions that really matter aren\u2019t necessarily the technology. \u201cThe choices around whether we have a livable future or a dystopian one are about social attitudes and social changes. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re in this era of stopgaps. Society used to be able to make a long-term plan: people built long-term infrastructure and thought a bit further out. That\u2019s not something that happens now: we go to quick fixes. We need a cultural change in values, to enable more deliberate decision-making.\u201d There is another possibility: that technology really does save the day, and then some. John Maeda, the chief experience officer at the digital consultancy Publicis Sapient, says that by 2050, \u201ccomputational machines will have surpassed the processing power of all the living human brains on Earth. The cloud will also have absorbed the thinking of the many dead brains on Earth, too \u2013 and we all need to work together to survive. So I predict that we will see a lasting cooperation between the human race and the computational machines of the future.\u201d This sort of thinking has come to be known as the singularity: the idea that there will be a point, perhaps even a singular moment in time, when the ability of thinking machines outstrips those who created them, and progress accelerates with dizzying results. \u201cIf you interview AI researchers about when general AI \u2013 a machine that can do everything a human can do \u2013 will arrive, they think it\u2019s about 50/50 whether it will be before 2050,\u201d says Tom Chivers, the author of The AI Does Not Hate You. \u201cThey also think that AGI\u201d \u2013 artificial general intelligence \u2013 \u201ccan be hugely transformative \u2013 lots of them signed an open letter in 2015 saying \u2018eradication of disease and poverty\u2019 could be possible. But also,\u201d he adds, citing a 2013 survey in the field, \u201con average they think there is about a 15% to 20% chance of a \u2018very bad outcome [existential catastrophe]\u2019, which means everyone dead.\u201d There is, perhaps, little point in dwelling on the 50% chance that AGI does develop. If it does, every other prediction we could make is moot, and this story, and perhaps humanity as we know it, will be forgotten. And if we assume that transcendentally brilliant artificial minds won\u2019t be along to save or destroy us, and live according to that outlook, then what is the worst that could happen \u2013 we build a better world for nothing? \u2022 This article was amended on 16 January 2020 to clarify that Holly Jean Buck was not predicting that solar geoengineering, specifically, would be tried in the next decade.",

He asked his grandfather, then in his mid-70s, to tell him more about the war. After five decades\u2019 silence on the subject, \u201che finally cracked. And he told us loads and loads of stories, especially after a couple of rums. He was very theatrical and charismatic and Edwardian. He was also quite deaf, so he shouted them all.\u201d</p> <p>Alfred Mendes was 16 when he enlisted, excited at the chance to serve in a good war that was going so well. When he got to the western front, \u201che just couldn\u2019t believe what he found. His stories weren\u2019t about bravery, but how utterly random it all was.\u201d His small stature meant he was often chosen as a messenger. \u201cThat image of that little man, cut adrift in that vast, misty landscape, really stayed with me.\u201d</p> <p>After the war, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Mendes\" title=\"\">Alfred</a> moved to Barbados, became a civil servant, wrote socialist novels and died in 1991, aged 94.

Both Bond movies were \u201cchaos\u201d, he says, making noises that indicate months-long logistical migraines, high-wire acts of placation and compromise.</p> <p>This film has one linear storyline and just one long shot \u2013 well, really a couple of dozen, invisibly stitched together by the cinematographer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp5KKaXrKUc\" title=\"\">Roger Deakins</a>. Two young lance corporals, Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are hauled in front of their general (Colin Firth) and given a mission. They must shin up the dugout, race across no man\u2019s land (mind the barbed wire, gunfire, rats, craters and corpses), along the (abandoned, probably) enemy trenches, through a French countryside strewn with booby traps, then find an adjoining battalion and tell them to call off their dawn attack as they would be advancing into a trap. If the pair fail, 1,600 men \u2013 including Blake\u2019s brother \u2013 will die.</p> <p>Originally, says Firth, his scene was yet more brutal: as the boys hurry off to almost certain death, an orderly unfurls a white linen tablecloth for the officer\u2019s high tea. That was scrapped. \u201cThe military establishment\u2019s indifference to the wellbeing of these two young men was abundantly clear without that kind of emphasis,\u201d says Firth, \u201cor making it about the callousness of one particular general.</p> <p>\u201cThe mission the boys are sent on is one of brutal necessity, a tragedy compounded, of course, by the fact that the war itself was not.\u201d Firth is only on screen for a few minutes, but filming even that short scene made him reassess his feelings. \u201cOne could empathise with the powerlessness and terror of young men who had no say in their fate, acting on decisions made by old men.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6e726159ddb0493390805c6b0cf7aa959eb182a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6e726159ddb0493390805c6b0cf7aa959eb182a/0_123_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Firth as General Erinmore in 1917\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s like this, men \u2026 Colin Firth as General Erinmore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Duhamel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tablecloth edit is a clever one. In its light-touch handling of the conflict\u2019s class battle, 1917 distinguishes itself in its genre. \u201cOnce you start on all that,\u201d says the films\u2019 screenwriter, Krysty Wilson-Cairns, \u201cyou\u2019ve lost most of your audience. And in Scotland, anyway, it means <em>nothing</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson-Cairns is a 32-year-old Glaswegian, perky in a jumpsuit. This is her first film. Her formative cinema experience came as a teenager in 2003: \u201cI saw <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305357/\" title=\"\">Charlie\u2019s Angels: Full Throttle</a> and I was <em>blown away</em>. After that I knew I either wanted to be an Angel or to work in the movies. And Charlie wasn\u2019t taking applications.\u201d</p> <p>Her gender has raised eyebrows given 1917\u2019s subject matter, she says, grinning, \u201cbut I somehow negotiated my vagina through it\u201d. And she does suspect it means the stakes in the screenplay skewed differently: the aim is to get home, rather than to slaughter as many of the enemy as possible. \u201cYou\u2019re not holding your breath to see if he will make the shot, but knowing that if he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll never see his family again.\u201d</p> <p>One of Wilson-Cairns\u2019s own grandfathers didn\u2019t serve in the armed forces, but he was evangelical about educating Krysty about war. \u201cHe told me that understanding history is the only way to avert future catastrophe. The first world war was the stupidest thing humanity ever did to each other.</p> <p>\u201cBut although it was misguided, those men were also fighting for a free and united Europe. And somehow that\u2019s under threat again, out of sheer madness and folly and political gain. Peace is so tenuous. I pray to God that we don\u2019t have the same outcome.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d3fafad7dbad8f48aacb392efc594638203ddab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d3fafad7dbad8f48aacb392efc594638203ddab/575_152_735_785/468.jpg\" alt=\"Krysty Wilson-Cairns, screenwriter\" width=\"468\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Krysty Wilson-Cairns was given an early grounding in the futility of war by one of her grandfathers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean Baptiste Lacroix/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both she and Mendes separately say they want the film to act as a corrective to a repackaging of the war in the service of jingoistic isolationism. \u201cPeople who are attached to some sort of nostalgic vision treat these wars retrospectively as triumphs,\u201d says Mendes. \u201cIn fact, they were tragedies.</p> <p>\u201cThat kind of hijacking of shared cultural memories and pride is very subtle, and very easy to do. At the moment, it happens all the time. \u2018We\u2019re going back to being on our own again! This is the spirit that fought two world wars!\u2019 That\u2019s what we\u2019re now lumbered with.\u201d</p> <p>And while the volume rises on such dodgy tub-thumping, so the values that meant people were prepared to lay down their lives have been eroded, Mendes thinks; it\u2019s only extreme environmental activists who are today doing something analogous.</p> <p>\u201cSacrifice has fallen out of fashion,\u201d says Wilson-Cairns. \u201cThe idea of having something above you, something to die for, is becoming an antiquated notion. People are inherently more selfish and more self-obsessed nowadays.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/17/mark-strong-kingsman-golden-circle-interview\" title=\"\">Mark Strong</a> is among those actors \u2013 Firth, Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch \u2013 who pop up for cameos as the boys\u2019 superiors; bit parts whose starriness some have found distracting. Strong agrees there has been a slump in altruism. But that is chiefly the lookout of the institutions, he says, not the people beholden to them. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s an issue of no longer understanding sacrifice, but more that collective responsibility is giving way to protection of self-interest. Not just in Britain but all over the world, there seems to be a move to secede from the collectives that were created \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 after the two wars, whether Catalonia or Scotland or the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.\u201d He gives Trump a name check, too; not the most inspirational model of magnanimity.</p> <p>Both 1917\u2019s leads say they hope they would do the same as their characters in the circumstances. Still: fingers crossed it\u2019s not tested.

Making the film, he said, \u201cI had so many reality checks: \u2018Cor, have I got it easy!\u2019\u201d He read a collection of contemporaneous diaries between takes, and was especially taken by one written by a man who was in the cavalry, shot in the hip and spent four days paralysed in no man\u2019s land. \u201cIt turned out it was my great-great grandfather! He went on to work in the first poppy factory in Richmond.\u201d Chapman is proud and awed, but hasn\u2019t investigated any further.</p> <p>MacKay, 27, gentle and diplomatic, is wary of damning his \u2013 or any \u2013 generation. Our unfamiliarity with the need to give up everything is only for the good, he says. And how do you understand hardship if you\u2019ve known nothing but comfort; he talks about wanting to grow his own veg.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re less in touch with what really matters because we\u2019re not being stretched. The film is about being at your absolute pits. You don\u2019t want to be in a place where you only have what you need. But we\u2019re perhaps rather too far down the other end of the scale and need to stop before we exhaust everything.\u201d</p> <p>MacKay is 1917\u2019s true breakthrough. Familiar from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/pride-film-review-miners-strike-gay-people-1984\" title=\"\">Pride</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/03/sunshine-on-leith-review\" title=\"\">Sunshine on Leith</a>, this film \u2013 plus Justin Kurzel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/true-history-of-the-kelly-gang-review-justin-kurzel\" title=\"\">upcoming Ned Kelly movie</a> \u2013 should make him an A-lister. Mendes cast MacKay partly, he says, because his face and demeanour suggested old-fashioned qualities of dignity and virtue. MacKay couldn\u2019t possibly comment, but says he based Schofield on his own grandfather, for whom he was named, and who was a man of honour and tact.</p> <p>In the film, neither Blake nor Schofield speak about their feelings; they don\u2019t need to \u2013 nor do they have time. Mendes was surprised, he says, at how many American viewers identified 1917 as a singularly English film because of this. \u201cIt\u2019s about telling the truth in the face of great difficulty. The classic example is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/16/brief-encounter-romance\" title=\"\">Brief Encounter</a>; a particular way of handling great emotion.\u201d</p> <p>MacKay cautions against rose-tinting reticence. \u201cStiff upper lips can be very unhealthy. Denial is rarely good. But there\u2019s a real depth of resolve to swallowing something for the now. There\u2019s weight, like an ocean. Under the surface, there\u2019s so much bottled that, when it does break, it\u2019s bigger than those that break all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Watching the film, says MacKay, \u201cmade it very clear to me who I want to come back to in my life, who means the most to me.\u201d Usually, seeing yourself on screen isn\u2019t easy, he says; this is the first time he has been transported \u2013 thanks to the shooting style. \u201cYou take every step with those men. Making it meant a lot to me.

      "bodyText": "When Sam Mendes was small, he would laugh at his grandfather\u2019s habit of forever washing his hands. His father took him to one side. \u201cIt\u2019s because he remembers the mud in the trenches,\u201d he said, \u201cand never being able to get clean.\u201d Sam stopped laughing. He asked his grandfather, then in his mid-70s, to tell him more about the war. After five decades\u2019 silence on the subject, \u201che finally cracked. And he told us loads and loads of stories, especially after a couple of rums. He was very theatrical and charismatic and Edwardian. He was also quite deaf, so he shouted them all.\u201d Alfred Mendes was 16 when he enlisted, excited at the chance to serve in a good war that was going so well. When he got to the western front, \u201che just couldn\u2019t believe what he found. His stories weren\u2019t about bravery, but how utterly random it all was.\u201d His small stature meant he was often chosen as a messenger. \u201cThat image of that little man, cut adrift in that vast, misty landscape, really stayed with me.\u201d After the war, Alfred moved to Barbados, became a civil servant, wrote socialist novels and died in 1991, aged 94. At 34, Sam won the best director Oscar for his debut, American Beauty; 20 years later, a movie inspired by Alfred\u2019s stories may bag him another. The film, 1917, is Mendes\u2019s first since Skyfall and Spectre and clearly intended as an antidote to 007. Both Bond movies were \u201cchaos\u201d, he says, making noises that indicate months-long logistical migraines, high-wire acts of placation and compromise. This film has one linear storyline and just one long shot \u2013 well, really a couple of dozen, invisibly stitched together by the cinematographer Roger Deakins. Two young lance corporals, Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are hauled in front of their general (Colin Firth) and given a mission. They must shin up the dugout, race across no man\u2019s land (mind the barbed wire, gunfire, rats, craters and corpses), along the (abandoned, probably) enemy trenches, through a French countryside strewn with booby traps, then find an adjoining battalion and tell them to call off their dawn attack as they would be advancing into a trap. If the pair fail, 1,600 men \u2013 including Blake\u2019s brother \u2013 will die. Originally, says Firth, his scene was yet more brutal: as the boys hurry off to almost certain death, an orderly unfurls a white linen tablecloth for the officer\u2019s high tea. That was scrapped. \u201cThe military establishment\u2019s indifference to the wellbeing of these two young men was abundantly clear without that kind of emphasis,\u201d says Firth, \u201cor making it about the callousness of one particular general. \u201cThe mission the boys are sent on is one of brutal necessity, a tragedy compounded, of course, by the fact that the war itself was not.\u201d Firth is only on screen for a few minutes, but filming even that short scene made him reassess his feelings. \u201cOne could empathise with the powerlessness and terror of young men who had no say in their fate, acting on decisions made by old men.\u201d The tablecloth edit is a clever one. In its light-touch handling of the conflict\u2019s class battle, 1917 distinguishes itself in its genre. \u201cOnce you start on all that,\u201d says the films\u2019 screenwriter, Krysty Wilson-Cairns, \u201cyou\u2019ve lost most of your audience. And in Scotland, anyway, it means nothing.\u201d Wilson-Cairns is a 32-year-old Glaswegian, perky in a jumpsuit. This is her first film. Her formative cinema experience came as a teenager in 2003: \u201cI saw Charlie\u2019s Angels: Full Throttle and I was blown away. After that I knew I either wanted to be an Angel or to work in the movies. And Charlie wasn\u2019t taking applications.\u201d Her gender has raised eyebrows given 1917\u2019s subject matter, she says, grinning, \u201cbut I somehow negotiated my vagina through it\u201d. And she does suspect it means the stakes in the screenplay skewed differently: the aim is to get home, rather than to slaughter as many of the enemy as possible. \u201cYou\u2019re not holding your breath to see if he will make the shot, but knowing that if he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll never see his family again.\u201d One of Wilson-Cairns\u2019s own grandfathers didn\u2019t serve in the armed forces, but he was evangelical about educating Krysty about war. \u201cHe told me that understanding history is the only way to avert future catastrophe. The first world war was the stupidest thing humanity ever did to each other. \u201cBut although it was misguided, those men were also fighting for a free and united Europe. And somehow that\u2019s under threat again, out of sheer madness and folly and political gain. Peace is so tenuous. I pray to God that we don\u2019t have the same outcome.\u201d Both she and Mendes separately say they want the film to act as a corrective to a repackaging of the war in the service of jingoistic isolationism. \u201cPeople who are attached to some sort of nostalgic vision treat these wars retrospectively as triumphs,\u201d says Mendes. \u201cIn fact, they were tragedies. \u201cThat kind of hijacking of shared cultural memories and pride is very subtle, and very easy to do. At the moment, it happens all the time. \u2018We\u2019re going back to being on our own again! This is the spirit that fought two world wars!\u2019 That\u2019s what we\u2019re now lumbered with.\u201d And while the volume rises on such dodgy tub-thumping, so the values that meant people were prepared to lay down their lives have been eroded, Mendes thinks; it\u2019s only extreme environmental activists who are today doing something analogous. \u201cSacrifice has fallen out of fashion,\u201d says Wilson-Cairns. \u201cThe idea of having something above you, something to die for, is becoming an antiquated notion. People are inherently more selfish and more self-obsessed nowadays.\u201d Mark Strong is among those actors \u2013 Firth, Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch \u2013 who pop up for cameos as the boys\u2019 superiors; bit parts whose starriness some have found distracting. Strong agrees there has been a slump in altruism. But that is chiefly the lookout of the institutions, he says, not the people beholden to them. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s an issue of no longer understanding sacrifice, but more that collective responsibility is giving way to protection of self-interest. Not just in Britain but all over the world, there seems to be a move to secede from the collectives that were created \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 after the two wars, whether Catalonia or Scotland or the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.\u201d He gives Trump a name check, too; not the most inspirational model of magnanimity. Both 1917\u2019s leads say they hope they would do the same as their characters in the circumstances. Still: fingers crossed it\u2019s not tested. If conscription came back today, says Chapman, \u201cit\u2019d be all over Twitter\u201d. At 22, the former Billy Elliot and sometime Game of Thrones actor is the youngest and chirpiest of the cast \u2013 and the one least versed in the war before the shoot began. Making the film, he said, \u201cI had so many reality checks: \u2018Cor, have I got it easy!\u2019\u201d He read a collection of contemporaneous diaries between takes, and was especially taken by one written by a man who was in the cavalry, shot in the hip and spent four days paralysed in no man\u2019s land. \u201cIt turned out it was my great-great grandfather! He went on to work in the first poppy factory in Richmond.\u201d Chapman is proud and awed, but hasn\u2019t investigated any further. MacKay, 27, gentle and diplomatic, is wary of damning his \u2013 or any \u2013 generation. Our unfamiliarity with the need to give up everything is only for the good, he says. And how do you understand hardship if you\u2019ve known nothing but comfort; he talks about wanting to grow his own veg. \u201cWe\u2019re less in touch with what really matters because we\u2019re not being stretched. The film is about being at your absolute pits. You don\u2019t want to be in a place where you only have what you need. But we\u2019re perhaps rather too far down the other end of the scale and need to stop before we exhaust everything.\u201d MacKay is 1917\u2019s true breakthrough. Familiar from the likes of Pride and Sunshine on Leith, this film \u2013 plus Justin Kurzel\u2019s upcoming Ned Kelly movie \u2013 should make him an A-lister. Mendes cast MacKay partly, he says, because his face and demeanour suggested old-fashioned qualities of dignity and virtue. MacKay couldn\u2019t possibly comment, but says he based Schofield on his own grandfather, for whom he was named, and who was a man of honour and tact. In the film, neither Blake nor Schofield speak about their feelings; they don\u2019t need to \u2013 nor do they have time. Mendes was surprised, he says, at how many American viewers identified 1917 as a singularly English film because of this. \u201cIt\u2019s about telling the truth in the face of great difficulty. The classic example is Brief Encounter; a particular way of handling great emotion.\u201d MacKay cautions against rose-tinting reticence. \u201cStiff upper lips can be very unhealthy. Denial is rarely good. But there\u2019s a real depth of resolve to swallowing something for the now. There\u2019s weight, like an ocean. Under the surface, there\u2019s so much bottled that, when it does break, it\u2019s bigger than those that break all the time.\u201d Watching the film, says MacKay, \u201cmade it very clear to me who I want to come back to in my life, who means the most to me.\u201d Usually, seeing yourself on screen isn\u2019t easy, he says; this is the first time he has been transported \u2013 thanks to the shooting style. \u201cYou take every step with those men. Making it meant a lot to me. But watching it did, too,\u201d he says. And it is this coup de cinema which most marks out 1917 and makes it feel as uncomfortable, and as peculiarly modern, as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes\u2019s Holocaust drama Son of Saul. The audience is unable to look away or avoid the brutality. And while most first world war films are slow-burns of claustrophobia and paralysis, this is queasily kinetic: a horrifying rollercoaster taking you on a nightmarish heist. Yet not everyone has been convinced. Some reviewers have found the single-shot style too gimmicky; an exercise for the sake of it, a display of technical prowess that distracts from the action. Mendes scoffs. \u201cThe camera never goes through a keyhole or passes through glass or follows the course of a moving bullet.\u201d For him, it\u2019s a cineaste\u2019s complaint, not a concern for the punters. Deakins is downcast about the detractors. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people have told me they\u2019re very aware of the camera.\u201d He looks more hopeful when I wonder if it\u2019s an old fogey issue. \u201cI think the film will appeal to a younger generation raised on video games because of that more immersive feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a piece of classical film-making.\u201d Still, when a friend of Chapman\u2019s told him it reminded him of a first-person shooter game, he baulked. \u201cYou control that. With this film, there\u2019s no control. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so terrifying to watch: you can\u2019t escape.\u201d Wilson-Cairns is, characteristically, more frank. \u201cThe whole point of this movie was to live 115 minutes in someone else\u2019s life. If you noticed the camera, we would all have failed. We didn\u2019t make it so you would look at your phone. Or have it on in the background. Or so that someone somewhere would make a fuckload of money.\u201d What she wanted above all, she says, was veracity. There are historical dramas whose primary duty is entertainment. She was unbothered by liberties taken in, say, last year\u2019s Mary Queen of Scots: colour-blind casting, fact-massaging, anachronistic dialogue. Those weren\u2019t appropriate here, she says. \u201cWe had to pay homage to the reality these men suffered through. We didn\u2019t want to inflate it or deflate it. People lived this. It\u2019s not a spaceship. It\u2019s not a fantasy.\u201d Deakins has a slightly different take. \u201cIt\u2019s not naturalistic,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you really showed what it was like, you wouldn\u2019t have anybody in the cinema after five minutes.\u201d Still, he was buoyed by Mendes\u2019s backbone when they were shooting a hospital tent scene near the end. \u201cHe said: \u2018We can\u2019t pussyfoot around.

David Smith, the policy director at the Residential Landlords Association, said: \u201cInstead of offering inadequate and sporadic pots of money, it is critical that the government provides proper, multi-year funding to enable councils to plan and prepare workable strategies to find the criminal landlords. \u201cThis should be supported by councils having the political will to prioritise enforcement against the crooks, rather than tying good landlords up in licensing schemes which do nothing to protect tenants.\u201d Darren Rodwell, the Local Government Association\u2019s housing spokesman, said: \u201cCouncils are doing what they can to raise standards in the private rented sector and are taking action where required, and it is important to note that most landlords are responsible and provide decent housing for their tenants.\u201d",

Under the plans Shell would spend up to $6bn on green investment , but instead it is on track to meet a third of this, with only a year left for the company to meet its guidance. Up to the end of 2019, Shell\u2019s guidance suggests it should have spent at least $3bn.</p> <p>In the same four years the company spent more than $120bn developing fossil fuel projects and set out plans to increase its total spending to $30bn a year in the early 2020s. A spokesman for Shell declined to comment.</p> <p>Shell is considered a climate leader within the oil industry despite spending a fraction of its total budget on new energies, which include biofuels, hydrogen and electricity investments.</p> <p>Data from Rystad Energy, a Norwegian consultancy, shows that Europe\u2019s five largest oil companies \u2013 Shell, BP, Total, Eni and Equinor \u2013 together spent a total of $5.5bn on renewable energy projects to date, comparedwith a combined total budget of almost $90bn last year alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/oil-spending/giv-3902N80jGK8cLoJS/\" data-alt=\"Renewable energy spending\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/oil-spending/giv-3902N80jGK8cLoJS/\">Renewable energy spending</a> </figure>  <p>Stephen Kretzmann, the executive director of Oil Change International, said executives \u201ctrumpet their relatively tiny investments in renewables\u201d but continue to \u201cpour more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/26/shell-not-green-saviour-death-machine-greenwash-oil-gas\">fuel on the fire of global warming every day</a>\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt used to be the case that some people believed that an oil company that invested even only a small portion of their resources in renewable energy was worthy of praise\u2026 because it makes us feel better to believe that the people who run these powerful companies get it.\u201d</p> <p>Oil bosses have voiced support for global climate targets in public but the industry continues to invest an estimated 1% of its annual spending budget on clean energy while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/oil-majors-must-cut-production-by-a-third-to-meet-climate-target-study\">producing more fossil fuel products than the Paris Climate Agreement allows</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe executives that run the carbon companies definitely do not get the part about the need for them to make less of the thing that is driving climate disaster,\u201d Kretzmann added. \u201cThe big problem isn\u2019t too little investment in renewables - it\u2019s too much investment in, and government support for, fossil fuels.\u201d</p> <p>Shell\u2019s green spending plans were dealt a blow earlier this year when the company <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-eneco-m-a-mitsubishi/japans-mitsubishi-beats-shell-to-buy-dutch-power-firm-eneco-idUKKBN1XZ0SZ\">missed out on a multi</a><a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-eneco-m-a-mitsubishi/japans-mitsubishi-beats-shell-to-buy-dutch-power-firm-eneco-idUKKBN1XZ0SZ\">billion dollar race to buy Dutch utility Eneco</a>, which has a large renewable energy portfolio. Shell and its pension fund partner lost out to a consortium of investors led by Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi, which paid $4.5bn for the company.</p> <p>The deal might have pushed Shell\u2019s green investment towards its planned spending range. Shell said it was disappointed it lost the bid, and said that it would continue to invest growing gas and electricity generation from renewable sources.</p> <p>Shell\u2019s previous acquisitions have included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/21/shell-to-supply-energy-to-uk-households-after-takeover-of-first-utility\">UK energy supplier First Utility</a>, a 49% stake in Australian solar company ESCO Pacific, and Eolfi, a French renewable energy developer that specialises in floating wind projects.</p> <p>Shell plans to spend $2bn to $3bn through its \u201cnew energies division\u201d every year between 2021 to 2025. The company said it plans to become the world\u2019s biggest electricity company by the 2030s, and hopes to bring a reliable electricity supply to 100 million people in developing countries by 2030.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell is at risk of falling short on plans to invest up to $6bn (\u00a34.6bn) in green energy projects between 2016 and the end of 2020, with its slow progress likely to raise concern that oil companies are not moving fast enough to help tackle the climate crisis. The Anglo-Dutch oil company has spent an estimated $2bn on building a low-carbon energy and electricity generation business since setting up its \u201cnew energies\u201d division in 2016. With a year to go, the sum is well below Shell\u2019s own guidance that the total investment between 2016 and the end of 2020 would be between $4bn and $6bn. Shell\u2019s green energy plans are some of the most ambitious in the oil industry, despite assigning just a 10th of its spending pot to \u201cnew energies\u201d. Shell told investors in 2017 it would spend between $1bn to $2bn a year developing a clean energy business up to the end of 2020, up from a previous plan to spend up to $1bn a year in the same period. Under the plans Shell would spend up to $6bn on green investment , but instead it is on track to meet a third of this, with only a year left for the company to meet its guidance. Up to the end of 2019, Shell\u2019s guidance suggests it should have spent at least $3bn. In the same four years the company spent more than $120bn developing fossil fuel projects and set out plans to increase its total spending to $30bn a year in the early 2020s. A spokesman for Shell declined to comment. Shell is considered a climate leader within the oil industry despite spending a fraction of its total budget on new energies, which include biofuels, hydrogen and electricity investments. Data from Rystad Energy, a Norwegian consultancy, shows that Europe\u2019s five largest oil companies \u2013 Shell, BP, Total, Eni and Equinor \u2013 together spent a total of $5.5bn on renewable energy projects to date, comparedwith a combined total budget of almost $90bn last year alone. Stephen Kretzmann, the executive director of Oil Change International, said executives \u201ctrumpet their relatively tiny investments in renewables\u201d but continue to \u201cpour more fuel on the fire of global warming every day\u201d. He said: \u201cIt used to be the case that some people believed that an oil company that invested even only a small portion of their resources in renewable energy was worthy of praise\u2026 because it makes us feel better to believe that the people who run these powerful companies get it.\u201d Oil bosses have voiced support for global climate targets in public but the industry continues to invest an estimated 1% of its annual spending budget on clean energy while producing more fossil fuel products than the Paris Climate Agreement allows. \u201cThe executives that run the carbon companies definitely do not get the part about the need for them to make less of the thing that is driving climate disaster,\u201d Kretzmann added. \u201cThe big problem isn\u2019t too little investment in renewables - it\u2019s too much investment in, and government support for, fossil fuels.\u201d Shell\u2019s green spending plans were dealt a blow earlier this year when the company missed out on a multibillion dollar race to buy Dutch utility Eneco, which has a large renewable energy portfolio. Shell and its pension fund partner lost out to a consortium of investors led by Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi, which paid $4.5bn for the company. The deal might have pushed Shell\u2019s green investment towards its planned spending range. Shell said it was disappointed it lost the bid, and said that it would continue to invest growing gas and electricity generation from renewable sources. Shell\u2019s previous acquisitions have included UK energy supplier First Utility, a 49% stake in Australian solar company ESCO Pacific, and Eolfi, a French renewable energy developer that specialises in floating wind projects. Shell plans to spend $2bn to $3bn through its \u201cnew energies division\u201d every year between 2021 to 2025. The company said it plans to become the world\u2019s biggest electricity company by the 2030s, and hopes to bring a reliable electricity supply to 100 million people in developing countries by 2030.",

      "bodyText": "#Wherethebloodyhellareyou. It was the $186m campaign slogan greenlit by Scott Morrison when he was head of Tourism Australia. But the M&amp;C Saatchi line has been used against the prime minister several times since the bushfire emergency began. First, when he went on a family holiday to Hawaii, and again as the deadly bushfires continue to rage, with worse conditions to come, and Morrison wasn\u2019t seen for days. On Thursday, Morrison faced the cameras for his first press conference since Sunday. Before that, the prime minister had not taken questions since Christmas Eve. So where the bloody hell has he been? The prime minister\u2019s office declined to fill in any of the blanks for this article, other than to note that Morrison has remained in constant contact with premiers, defence force chiefs and fire authorities, as well as his own cabinet ministers, to stay abreast of the situation. 26 December The prime minister is spotted going for a swim at Sydney\u2019s Bronte beach with his mother and children by the Daily Mail. More than 30 fires are considered out of control, although the slightly easier conditions are used by firefighters to carry out more backburning operations in a bid to prepare for worse days ahead. 27 December National party MP Darren Chester calls for volunteer firefighters to be paid, breaking ranks with the government position. Morrison is not seen but releases a statement announcing ADF liaison officers will be placed in every fire control centre. The NSW emergency minister, David Elliott, announces he will be going overseas on leave, but will return if needed. Scores of fires remain out of control, with almost 1,500 volunteer firefighters deployed in an attempt to bolster containment lines. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, announces up to 30% of NSW\u2019s mid-north coast koala population may have been killed in the blazes. 28 December Warnings of the New Year\u2019s Eve heatwave and catastrophic fire conditions begin to circulate. Firefighters continue attempts to set up containment lines, while battling up to 70 blazes. Morrison is not seen publicly. 29 December Morrison announces NSW RFS volunteers will be paid $300 a day, up to $6,000, in federal government funds, to be administered by the NSW government, with other states eligible to apply for the same funds. He holds his first press conference since Christmas Eve, calling media to the NSW RFS headquarters. Despite having said volunteer firefighters \u201cwant to be there\u201d when asked about payment in early December, and calling it a distraction when asked on Christmas Eve, Morrison says the government has been working on the payments \u201cfor some time\u201d. Victorian authorities order the evacuation of a vast area of East Gippsland. Morrison also comments on the Sydney New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks debate, after he is asked whether they should go ahead. He says Australia is known for its \u201coptimism\u201d, which becomes a new year\u2019s theme for him. \u201cSure, we\u2019re going through tough times. You know, it\u2019s not the first time Australia and, in particular this city, has gone through difficult times before. But we always rise above them. We don\u2019t allow them to get us down.\u201d 30 December Bushfires sweep across NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. Morrison does not appear publicly. Late on Monday comes the news a third NSW RFS volunteer, Samuel McPaul, has been killed, when the truck he was in rolled during freak conditions created by a fire at Jingellic, on the NSW/Victoria border. 31 December Morrison releases a video statement over social media, offering condolences to Sam McPaul\u2019s relatives. He also releases a written statement but does not appear publicly. The fires rage out of control across the NSW south coast and Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland area. Fire authorities report it is like nothing they have witnessed before. Pictures of thousands of people stranded on beaches are broadcast to the world, with the defence force called in to evacuate fire refugees. At least four people are confirmed to have died in the past 48 hours. Hundreds of homes are lost \u2013 more than 350 by the end of the day, and counting. Morrison spends the evening at Kirribilli, where unnamed sources report the New Year\u2019s Eve mood to be \u201csombre\u201d. 1 January Morrison releases a new year message to Australia, declaring there is \u201cno better place to raise kids\u201d and reiterates his \u201coptimism\u201d message. Around the country, the devastation which hit the NSW south coast and Victorian East Gippsland region becomes clear. Thousands are left without power, water or communications \u2013 176 homes are confirmed lost. That number would double by 2 January. Morrison is not seen in public but hosts the annual New Year\u2019s Day Cricket Australia-McGrath Foundation reception with the Australian and New Zealand teams at Kirribilli. He does not take questions but releases his address to the teams, where he says the forthcoming Sydney Test will be \u201cplayed out against terrible events\u201d but that \u201cat the same time Australians will be gathered whether it\u2019s at the SCG or around television sets all around the country and they\u2019ll be inspired by the great feats of our cricketers from both sides of the Tasman and I think they\u2019ll be encouraged by the spirit shown by Australians\u201d. The navy deploys HMAS Choules to Mallacoota to help evacuate residents and tourists stranded on the beach. Both the Victorian and NSW fire authorities say they believe the fires will burn for months. Victoria\u2019s emergency commissioner, Andrew Crisp, says \u201conly nature\u201d can stop the blazes, while the NSW RFS deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers, says: \u201cYou could have 10,000 fire fighters on each fire we would not be able to get around these fires.\u201d 2 January The prime minister attends the funeral of Geoffrey Keaton, one of two NSW RFS volunteers killed last week. He holds a press conference later in the day to announce his cabinet\u2019s national security committee will be meeting on Monday, while urging Australians to \u201cbe patient\u201d and remain calm. He also highlights some of the challenges, beyond the evacuations: \u201cDown in Cobargo and places like that, where we know, where dairies have been milking and they simply have to pour the milk down the hill because of the lack of power to those areas at this time. \u201cThat is the tragedy of what is occurring as a result of these disasters.\u201d And he defends his response to date: \u201cIn the midst of the disaster, I understand the anxiety and I understand the fear that is there for many and I understand the frustration but this is a natural disaster. Natural disasters are best dealt with through the methodical, well-coordinated response that we are seeing today.\u201d He reiterates he has no plans to change Australia\u2019s emissions reduction policy. \u201cWhat we will do is ensure that our policies remain sensible, that they don\u2019t move towards either extreme and stay focused on what Australians need for a vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment. Getting the balance right is what Australia, I think, has always been able to achieve.\u201d Morrison spends the afternoon touring some of the communities which have been all but destroyed by fire, with his wife, Jenny. He receives a frosty reception in the NSW town of Cobargo, which has been heavily affected with three deaths and much of the main street destroyed. A local resident and a firefighter both refuse to shake his hand, saying the town needs more support. By late evening, fire authorities have closed two of the Bega evacuation centres, as the south coast evacuation continues. NSW declares a state of emergency for seven days. Conditions for Saturday are forecasts to be some of the worst the nation has ever faced.",

      "body": "<p>Javier Cabral always dreamed of getting paid to eat. But he never imagined the job would require him to devour 36 tacos a day.</p> <p>This was the Los Angeles journalist\u2019s life as a \u201ctaco scout\u201d and associate producer for <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81040704\">Las Cr\u00f3nicas del Taco</a> (Taco Chronicles), a popular new Netflix documentary series on taco history and culture.</p> <p>\u201cIt would just be taco fucking ragers, taco binges,\u201d Cabral said, recalling his early research for the show, which involved jam-packed trips to Mexico where he had a few hours in different regions, eating as much as his stomach could handle: \u201cIt\u2019s like I was sweating lard.\u201d</p> <p>The Spanish-language Netflix show, which features mouthwatering dives into six different types of tacos, such as barbacoa and al pastor, is just one of many ways the dish has transformed Cabral\u2019s life over the last year. The 30-year-old LA native and longtime food writer has also used his love of tacos to try to transform local media: in 2019, he became the editor of <a href=\"https://www.lataco.com/\">LA Taco</a>, a hyperlocal news site that covers southern California culture, arts, news, events and all things tacos, and aims to <a href=\"https://www.lataco.com/read-this-before-celebrating-dia-de-muertos-this-year-signed-a-zapotecan-american/\">spotlight</a><a href=\"https://www.lataco.com/read-this-before-celebrating-dia-de-muertos-this-year-signed-a-zapotecan-american/\"> voices and stories</a> often left out of mainstream publications.</p> <p>\u201cThe taco has really elevated my life and made me financially secure for the first time in a long time,\u201d Cabral said one afternoon, while eating a tostada at Guerrilla Tacos, a restaurant that was one of two LA joints featured in Las Cr\u00f3nicas del Taco. \u201cIt took me awhile to accept the fact that I\u2019ve become the token taco writer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b6ddb433bb2dca9cd91e43d8f570e6b66229cf0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6ddb433bb2dca9cd91e43d8f570e6b66229cf0f/0_0_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Javier Cabral has built his career on taco culture.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Javier Cabral has built his career on taco culture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Javier Cabral</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It has been a long journey for Cabral toward his uniquely LA career, built on taco culture and recently culminating in the release of a <a href=\"https://www.ilovemole.com/oaxacacookbook\">Oaxacan cookbook</a> with the restaurant owner and author Bricia Lopez.</p> <p>A first-generation Mexican American, Cabral grew up in the San Gabriel valley and east LA, and his parents often struggled to make ends meet. When he was in third grade, his family filed for bankruptcy and lost their home, forcing him and his siblings to live in the office of his father\u2019s furniture store.</p> <p>In high school, Cabral became obsessed with the writing of Jonathan Gold, the late Pulitzer prize-winning food critic who was then at LA Weekly, the city\u2019s alternative paper. Cabral often couldn\u2019t afford to eat at the places Gold reviewed, but he would still diligently read him.</p> <p>\u201cJonathan Gold loved all cuisines of all immigrants,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just a punk rock kid. And what\u2019s more punk rock than getting paid to eat?\u201d</p> <p>At 16, Cabral emailed Gold out of the blue, <a href=\"https://www.lataco.com/a-cold-email-from-a-food-obsessed-teen-why-i-owe-everything-to-jonathan-gold/\">saying something</a> along the lines of: \u201cHi, Mr Gold. So, like, I\u2019m in 11th grade and can\u2019t find \u2018food writing\u2019 as a major anywhere. How do I become a food critic?\u201d</p> <p>The two communicated back and forth and, in 2006, Cabral started his own food blog, Teenage Glutster, which Gold later <a href=\"https://www.laweekly.com/moles-la-tia-beyond-the-magnificent-seven/?rel=outbound\">credited</a> in a review. Cabral barely graduated high school, but Gold eventually became his mentor and secured a budget for Cabral to work as a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-scouting-report-el-faro-story.html?rel=outbound\">restaurant scout</a> for him at the LA Times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxOoWlTh7qJ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Javier Cabral always dreamed of getting paid to eat. But he never imagined the job would require him to devour 36 tacos a day. This was the Los Angeles journalist\u2019s life as a \u201ctaco scout\u201d and associate producer for Las Cr\u00f3nicas del Taco (Taco Chronicles), a popular new Netflix documentary series on taco history and culture. \u201cIt would just be taco fucking ragers, taco binges,\u201d Cabral said, recalling his early research for the show, which involved jam-packed trips to Mexico where he had a few hours in different regions, eating as much as his stomach could handle: \u201cIt\u2019s like I was sweating lard.\u201d The Spanish-language Netflix show, which features mouthwatering dives into six different types of tacos, such as barbacoa and al pastor, is just one of many ways the dish has transformed Cabral\u2019s life over the last year. The 30-year-old LA native and longtime food writer has also used his love of tacos to try to transform local media: in 2019, he became the editor of LA Taco, a hyperlocal news site that covers southern California culture, arts, news, events and all things tacos, and aims to spotlight voices and stories often left out of mainstream publications. \u201cThe taco has really elevated my life and made me financially secure for the first time in a long time,\u201d Cabral said one afternoon, while eating a tostada at Guerrilla Tacos, a restaurant that was one of two LA joints featured in Las Cr\u00f3nicas del Taco. \u201cIt took me awhile to accept the fact that I\u2019ve become the token taco writer.\u201d It has been a long journey for Cabral toward his uniquely LA career, built on taco culture and recently culminating in the release of a Oaxacan cookbook with the restaurant owner and author Bricia Lopez. A first-generation Mexican American, Cabral grew up in the San Gabriel valley and east LA, and his parents often struggled to make ends meet. When he was in third grade, his family filed for bankruptcy and lost their home, forcing him and his siblings to live in the office of his father\u2019s furniture store. In high school, Cabral became obsessed with the writing of Jonathan Gold, the late Pulitzer prize-winning food critic who was then at LA Weekly, the city\u2019s alternative paper. Cabral often couldn\u2019t afford to eat at the places Gold reviewed, but he would still diligently read him. \u201cJonathan Gold loved all cuisines of all immigrants,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just a punk rock kid. And what\u2019s more punk rock than getting paid to eat?\u201d At 16, Cabral emailed Gold out of the blue, saying something along the lines of: \u201cHi, Mr Gold. So, like, I\u2019m in 11th grade and can\u2019t find \u2018food writing\u2019 as a major anywhere. How do I become a food critic?\u201d The two communicated back and forth and, in 2006, Cabral started his own food blog, Teenage Glutster, which Gold later credited in a review. Cabral barely graduated high school, but Gold eventually became his mentor and secured a budget for Cabral to work as a restaurant scout for him at the LA Times. There were few Mexican American food writers at major publications, but Cabral built a name for himself as a taco expert. He had viral hits at publications like Vice, including one piece explaining why the tortilla quality in LA is inadequate and another defending the rise of $5 \u201cfancy tacos\u201d. In 2018, he joined Las Cr\u00f3nicas del Taco, recruited by Pablo Cruz, a Mexican producer and the show\u2019s creator: \u201cThat just sealed the deal for the rest of my life.\u201d Cabral was drawn to the idea of a food docuseries exclusively dedicated to tacos: \u201cWhen he approached me, I was like hell yeah, let\u2019s not have any talking heads, no egos. Just tacos.\u201d His first step was creating a \u201ctaco bible\u201d, a roughly 100-page manuscript featuring everything the Netflix team might need to know about taco history and detailing his travels to Mexico in search of the best tacos. Fueled by mezcal and pulque (Mexico\u2019s oldest alcoholic drink), Cabral ate his way through the country, cataloging his journeys on Instagram (#TacosForPablo). He also has an impressive ability to retain information about food: \u201cI can remember exactly what we ate five years ago, to the night. I\u2019m really obsessed.\u201d Some taquerias were wary, Cabral recalled: \u201cPeople are really skeptical, especially if they hear me with a Mexican American accent \u2026 they don\u2019t want to give away their recipes.\u201d Others didn\u2019t want attention, he said: \u201cTaquerias in Mexico are very working class.

He was especially moved by the praise from a woman who sells flowers in LA, who told him her seven-year-old son was no longer embarrassed to speak Spanish after watching the show, which will have a second season this year. \u201cI know it\u2019s just a taco show, but I feel like Mexican Americans often have this chip on their shoulder, an inferiority complex \u2026 of not being American enough, not being Mexican, and this show has helped people understand how to be more proud of their country, of their parents\u2019 country, and just honor that part of their family,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>It was midnight at a police barracks in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and in a freezing windowless room about 150 Muslim men and boys sat huddled, bloodied and bruised. Some of the shivering prisoners had raw gashes across their hands and faces, others had broken limbs splayed out at awkward angles. The beatings from police came frequently, according to multiple corresponding accounts; to those who asked for water or closed their eyes in drowsiness or simply did nothing at all. Over and over, metal rods and bamboo canes hit soft human skin. Some had been stripped of their clothes. The youngest among them was just 12 years old, said witnesses.</p> <p>How hundreds of innocent Muslim residents of the city of Muzaffarnagar came to be rounded up on 20 December, before being tortured in police detention, is part of what Indian activist and academic Yogendra Yadav described as an unprecedented and ruthless \u201creign of terror\u201d imposed upon the country\u2019s most populous state over the past two weeks.</p> <p>Since last month, India has been engulfed in the biggest nationwide protests in over four decades. People of all religions, classes, castes and ages took to the streets in opposition to a new citizenship amendment act (CAA) passed by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Hindu nationalist BJP government, which many say discriminates against Muslims and undermines India\u2019s secular foundations. The government has dealt with the dissent with increasing repression, with authorities banning gatherings of more than four people and demonstrators met with batons and tear gas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/india-largest-protests-in-decades-signal-modi-may-have-gone-too-far\">India: largest protests in decades signal Modi may have gone too far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nowhere has the crackdown been so brutal and so openly communal against the Muslim communitythan in Uttar Pradesh. According to accounts given to the Guardian by dozens of victims, witnesses and activists, police in the state stand accused of a string of allegations: firing indiscriminately into crowds; beating Muslim bystanders in the streets; raiding and looting Muslim homes while shouting Islamophobic slurs and Hindu nationalist slogans; detaining and torturing Muslim children. The allegations further include forcing signed confessions and filing bogus criminal charges against thousands of Muslims who had never been to a protest.</p> <p>Hundreds of Muslims and activists remain behind bars across Uttar Pradesh and thousands have been placed on police lists. And the orders, it appears, come from the very top.</p> <p>BJP state chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, a militant Hindu nationalist notorious for his open hatred and persecution of Muslims, pledged to take revenge on protesters in the wake of the unrest. The police took him at his word. \u201cIt was <em>kristallnacht</em> for Muslims,\u201d said activist Kavita Krishnan, describing the events that unfolded across the state on Friday 20 and Saturday 21 December.</p> <p>That day in Muzaffarnagar, trouble began when a peaceful demonstration against the citizenship act turned violent as police clashed with protesters. Stones were pelted and vehicles were set alight. In response, police opened fire on the crowds. Nearby, maulana Asad Raza Hussaini, a respected Muslim cleric, and his students at Sadaat Madrasa, an Islamic seminary, were resting after afternoon prayers when about 50 police officers, bearing batons and iron rods, broke down the doors and burst in. They were allegedly looking for people who had taken part in the protest but upon entering the madrasa began violently smashing everything in their pathway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c6653bb747ed60b760aaa37361bb501c03b3963\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6653bb747ed60b760aaa37361bb501c03b3963/28_0_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruqaiya Parveen, 22, suffered a deep gash on her head, when police barged into her house in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, on 20 December, and beat up several members of the family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruqaiya Parveen, 22, suffered a deep gash on her head, when police barged into her house in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, on 20 December, and beat up several members of the family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe maulana told the policemen gently that none from the seminary took part in any protest rally and pleaded for them not to vandalise the Qur\u2019an centre in the madrasa,\u201d said a neighbour who witnessed the police attack but did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal. \u201cIt was then that the policemen and Rapid Action Force personnel [a branch of the police that deals with crowd control] pounced on him.\u201d </p> <p>The police then rounded up Hussaini and 35 of his students, 15 of whom were under 18 and mostly orphans, and took them to a nearby police barracks. Here the cleric was, witnesses allege, stripped of his clothes, beaten and a rod shoved up his anus, causing rectal bleeding, while the students were allegedly tortured with bamboo rods and made to shout Hindu nationalist slogans Jai Shri Ram\u201d [Hail Lord Ram] and \u201cHar Har Mahadev\u201d [Save us Lord Shiva].</p> <p>\u201cThe maulana had been beaten up very badly and was left without a single cloth on his body and when he was released we found him in very bad shape,\u201d said Salman Saeed, a local Congress leader who came to pick up Hussaini and several students from Civil Lines Barracks. \u201cHe was badly wounded and bloodied, with many bruises across his body. He could not stand up on his legs and was bare-bodied. We were shocked to see the maulana in that condition. He is bed-ridden now.\u201d</p> <p>While Hussaini and all his underage students were released at 2am that night, 12 adults students and the madrasa cook remain behind bars and have been charged with taking part in violence, despite never partaking in a protest.</p> <p>The young students were not the only underage Muslim prisoners in Muzaffarnagar police barracks that night. Upon seeing the commotion in the streets, 14-year-old Mohammad Sadiq, who worked as a mason\u2019s assistant, set out to find his 11-year-old brother. Cars and motorcycles had been set alight and as protesters were fleeing around him, he too began to run. It was then that a dozen police pounced on him, hitting his legs with batons to make him fall to the ground and then unleashing a torrent of blows, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe police said to me, \u2018if you tell us the names of 100 Muslims involved in the riots we will stop beating you\u2019,\u201d recounted Sadiq, as he lay bed-bound and weak from his injuries in his one-room family shack. \u201cI kept telling them I had nothing to do with the riots, that I did not know anything but they kept beating me.

      "bodyText": "It was midnight at a police barracks in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and in a freezing windowless room about 150 Muslim men and boys sat huddled, bloodied and bruised. Some of the shivering prisoners had raw gashes across their hands and faces, others had broken limbs splayed out at awkward angles. The beatings from police came frequently, according to multiple corresponding accounts; to those who asked for water or closed their eyes in drowsiness or simply did nothing at all. Over and over, metal rods and bamboo canes hit soft human skin. Some had been stripped of their clothes. The youngest among them was just 12 years old, said witnesses. How hundreds of innocent Muslim residents of the city of Muzaffarnagar came to be rounded up on 20 December, before being tortured in police detention, is part of what Indian activist and academic Yogendra Yadav described as an unprecedented and ruthless \u201creign of terror\u201d imposed upon the country\u2019s most populous state over the past two weeks. Since last month, India has been engulfed in the biggest nationwide protests in over four decades. People of all religions, classes, castes and ages took to the streets in opposition to a new citizenship amendment act (CAA) passed by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Hindu nationalist BJP government, which many say discriminates against Muslims and undermines India\u2019s secular foundations. The government has dealt with the dissent with increasing repression, with authorities banning gatherings of more than four people and demonstrators met with batons and tear gas. Nowhere has the crackdown been so brutal and so openly communal against the Muslim communitythan in Uttar Pradesh. According to accounts given to the Guardian by dozens of victims, witnesses and activists, police in the state stand accused of a string of allegations: firing indiscriminately into crowds; beating Muslim bystanders in the streets; raiding and looting Muslim homes while shouting Islamophobic slurs and Hindu nationalist slogans; detaining and torturing Muslim children. The allegations further include forcing signed confessions and filing bogus criminal charges against thousands of Muslims who had never been to a protest. Hundreds of Muslims and activists remain behind bars across Uttar Pradesh and thousands have been placed on police lists. And the orders, it appears, come from the very top. BJP state chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, a militant Hindu nationalist notorious for his open hatred and persecution of Muslims, pledged to take revenge on protesters in the wake of the unrest. The police took him at his word. \u201cIt was kristallnacht for Muslims,\u201d said activist Kavita Krishnan, describing the events that unfolded across the state on Friday 20 and Saturday 21 December. That day in Muzaffarnagar, trouble began when a peaceful demonstration against the citizenship act turned violent as police clashed with protesters. Stones were pelted and vehicles were set alight. In response, police opened fire on the crowds. Nearby, maulana Asad Raza Hussaini, a respected Muslim cleric, and his students at Sadaat Madrasa, an Islamic seminary, were resting after afternoon prayers when about 50 police officers, bearing batons and iron rods, broke down the doors and burst in. They were allegedly looking for people who had taken part in the protest but upon entering the madrasa began violently smashing everything in their pathway. \u201cThe maulana told the policemen gently that none from the seminary took part in any protest rally and pleaded for them not to vandalise the Qur\u2019an centre in the madrasa,\u201d said a neighbour who witnessed the police attack but did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal. \u201cIt was then that the policemen and Rapid Action Force personnel [a branch of the police that deals with crowd control] pounced on him.\u201d The police then rounded up Hussaini and 35 of his students, 15 of whom were under 18 and mostly orphans, and took them to a nearby police barracks. Here the cleric was, witnesses allege, stripped of his clothes, beaten and a rod shoved up his anus, causing rectal bleeding, while the students were allegedly tortured with bamboo rods and made to shout Hindu nationalist slogans Jai Shri Ram\u201d [Hail Lord Ram] and \u201cHar Har Mahadev\u201d [Save us Lord Shiva]. \u201cThe maulana had been beaten up very badly and was left without a single cloth on his body and when he was released we found him in very bad shape,\u201d said Salman Saeed, a local Congress leader who came to pick up Hussaini and several students from Civil Lines Barracks. \u201cHe was badly wounded and bloodied, with many bruises across his body. He could not stand up on his legs and was bare-bodied. We were shocked to see the maulana in that condition. He is bed-ridden now.\u201d While Hussaini and all his underage students were released at 2am that night, 12 adults students and the madrasa cook remain behind bars and have been charged with taking part in violence, despite never partaking in a protest. The young students were not the only underage Muslim prisoners in Muzaffarnagar police barracks that night. Upon seeing the commotion in the streets, 14-year-old Mohammad Sadiq, who worked as a mason\u2019s assistant, set out to find his 11-year-old brother. Cars and motorcycles had been set alight and as protesters were fleeing around him, he too began to run. It was then that a dozen police pounced on him, hitting his legs with batons to make him fall to the ground and then unleashing a torrent of blows, he said. \u201cThe police said to me, \u2018if you tell us the names of 100 Muslims involved in the riots we will stop beating you\u2019,\u201d recounted Sadiq, as he lay bed-bound and weak from his injuries in his one-room family shack. \u201cI kept telling them I had nothing to do with the riots, that I did not know anything but they kept beating me. The policemen told me to shout \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019 and I told them I would not so they put an iron rod into the flames of the car that was on fire and then held it against my hands to burn me.\u201d \u201cThen some of the police officers tried to pick me up and put me in the flames of the car on fire,\u201d Sadiq said, \u201cbut two of them said \u2018no, let\u2019s just take him to the police station\u2019.\u201d Sadiq was kept in police detention for the next four days. Stripped to his underwear, he said he was tortured. For two days he was given no food or water and no medical treatment for his badly bleeding wounds. When he was finally released his condition was so bad his mother, Rehana Begum, fainted when she came to collect him. \u201cHis father is dead so he was the only earning member of this house but he has been beaten so badly across the knees he can not walk and can not work now so what will happen to us?\u201d she said, her head in her hands. According to multiple accounts, in the late-night raids on Muslim homes carried out in Muzaffarnagar and across the state over those two days, women, children and the elderly were not spared the brunt of the police brutality. One such victim was 73-year-old Hamid Hasan, who was viciously beaten when police stormed into his house late on 20 December, using metal batons to attack him, his 65-year-old wife and his 22-year-old granddaughter, Ruqaiya Parveen, who was hit so hard across the head she collapsed from the wound and had to have 16 stitches. Hasan wiped away tears as he showed the wrecked remnants of the wedding gifts purchased for his granddaughter\u2019s forthcoming marriage, including a destroyed television, ripped sofa, overturned fridge and smashed air-conditioning unit he had saved up his whole life to buy. \u201cMy family did not take part in any protests, why would they do this to us,\u201d wailed Hasan, who could barely walk from his injuries. \u201cMuslims in this country are being made to live in fear, even in our homes we are not safe from violence now.\u201d Hasan\u2019s 14-year-old grandson Mohammad Ahmad was also dragged from his bed by the officers, beaten in the street and then detained and allegedly tortured by police in the police barracks, along with Hasan\u2019s son Mohammad Sajid, 40. Ahmad recounted how he witnessed officers force his uncle Sajid to sign a confession that a gun and bullets had been found in the police raid on their home. \u201cHe did not want to sign it but he had to because we were terrified,\u201d whispered Ahmad softly, his legs still wrapped in bandages from the beatings. After 24 hours Ahmad was released back to his family, but Sajid remains behind bars, his medical condition worsening by the day. Official figures put the protest death toll in the state at 17. All were Muslim and the youngest was eight. Activists allege a deliberate obfuscation by the police around these deaths, with none of the families given postmortem reports. The sole fatality in Muzaffarnagar on 20 December was Noor Mohammad, 26, a day-wage labourer who was shot over half a kilometre away from where the protests took place. Police allege he was killed by protesters. His wife, 23-year-old Sanno Begum, who is seven months pregnant with their second child, wept as she said all she wanted was \u201cjustice for my husband and my daughter\u201d. \u201cIf they are not giving us the postmortem report, then it must be the police who shot him. I want justice from the government. I have got a little daughter. I have no one to support us now,\u201d she said through tears. Not only did the police force the family to bury Noor 60km (40 miles) away from Muzaffarnagar, but they accompanied the body to the ground, prevented proper funeral rites being carried out and then confiscated the burial certificate from the family. \u201cIt is clear they want to destroy all evidence about his death,\u201d said his brother-in-law Mohammad Salim. The Muzaffarnagar police did not make themselves available for comment. Over 500km across the state in the city of Kanpur, Mohammad Sharif, 74, sobbed as he described how his son Mohammad Raees, 30, died on 20 December in the crossfire of a protest. Raees had been working that day, washing utensils for a wedding, when he wandered out to see the commotion in the street and was hit by a police bullet. \u201cHe was not a protester, he was killed because he was Muslim,\u201d said Sharif. \u201cI want to die.

      "body": "<p>I had goosebumps watching surreal footage of the mass evacuation of people stranded on the south-east Australian coast.</p> <p>Once again, catastrophic bushfire conditions are bearing down on communities during increasingly horrific summers in Australia. It has been an unprecedented continuation of the horrendous bushfires that started as early as spring in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/10/i-never-thought-id-see-the-australian-rainforest-burning-what-will-it-take-for-us-to-wake-up-to-the-climate-crisis\">south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales</a>.</p> <p>As I write this, the Australian navy is evacuating more than 800 people from the bushfire-ravaged town of Mallacoota in eastern Victoria. Holiday makers are being forced to abandon their cars, complete with kids\u2019 bikes strapped to the roof racks, ice melting in Eskies. People hoping for a carefree break over the new year are instead faced with the extraordinary position of having to flee for their lives.</p> <p>There are now tens of thousands of people in coastal NSW and Victoria stranded in towns where the highways are closed, supermarkets are running out of food, and queues for petrol snake down the streets of devastated towns. The scenes experienced by those caught up in the ordeal are being described as apocalyptic \u2013 rightly so.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the locals face the infinitely more serious situation of returning to find their homes completely incinerated. Cars melted, pets killed, beloved landscapes destroyed. A lifetime of memories razed to the ground. As Australia\u2019s climate continues to warm, the most intimate places of human safety \u2013 our very homes \u2013 are being threatened in an increasingly dangerous world.</p> <p>It\u2019s confronting to see military evacuations, usually reserved for developing regions of the world following natural disasters, happening right here in 21st-century Australia. The sheer scale and severity of the emergency has actually overwhelmed our capacity as a nation to deal with the unfolding events. Not just in one area following a single event, but across multiple disasters occurring simultaneously in every state and territory of our nation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/31/darkness-at-noon-australia-bushfire-day-of-terror\">Darkness at noon: Australia's bushfire day of terror</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a climate scientist, the thing that really terrifies me is that weather conditions considered extreme by today\u2019s standards will seem sedate in the future. What\u2019s unfolding right now is really just a taste of the new normal.</p> <p>At this point I could restate all the lines of scientific evidence that clearly show the links between human-caused climate change and the intensification of extreme weather conditions not just in Australia, but all over the world.</p> <p>To avoid sounding like a broken record, instead I will say that as a lead author on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/activities/sixth-assessment-report/\">Sixth Assessment</a> report of the global climate due out next year, I can assure you that the planetary situation is extremely dire.</p> <p>It\u2019s no exaggeration to say my work as scientist now keeps me up at night.</p> <p>As I\u2019ve watched the events of this summer unfolding, I\u2019ve found myself wondering whether the Earth system has now breached a tipping point, an irreversible shift in the stability of the planetary system.</p> <p>There may now be so much heat trapped in the system that we may have already triggered a domino effect that could unleash a cascade of abrupt changes that will continue to play out in the years and decades to come.</p> <p>Rapid climate change has the potential to reconfigure life on the planet as we know it.</p> <p>We know this because the geologic record contains evidence that <a href=\"https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2019/august/1566136800/jo-lle-gergis/terrible-truth-climate-change\">these events have occurred in the past</a>. The key difference is that we\u2019ve never had 7.5 billion people on the planet, so the human species really is in uncharted territory.</p> <p>The scientific community is acknowledging this by including new sections on abrupt climate change throughout <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/09/AR6_WGI_outlines_P46.pdf\">key areas of the upcoming IPCC report</a>. We now consider these \u201clow probability, high impact\u201d scenarios an increasingly critical part of our work.</p> <p>At the risk of stating the bleeding obvious, adapting to climate change in the driest inhabited continent on Earth is going to take a bit of work.</p> <p>To prepare our nation for the very challenging times ahead, we need political leaders \u2013 at every level \u2013 prepared to face this harsh reality.</p> <p>I single out our political leaders because the rest of the country is already leading the way. The leadership and true guts being shown out there by our local communities, often with minimal resources and under intense duress, has been staggering. The resilience, dedication, generosity and heart being demonstrated by our emergency services and embarrassingly unpaid volunteer firefighters is truly the stuff of legends.</p> <p>Cynics might say that our government seems to be taking advantage of the fact that we are a remarkable people willing to do whatever it takes to defend our incredibly unique nation. But the longer we leave things on a national policy level, the worse things are going to get.</p> <p>Failing to adequately plan for the known threat of climate change in a country like Australia should now be considered to be an act of treason.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2020/jan/02/conjola-park-fire-residents-assess-remains-after-bushfire-rages-through-in-pictures\">Bushfire-ravaged communities return to ruins \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The scientific community has been trying to warn the government of the need to plan to <a href=\"https://research.csiro.au/climate/introduction/history-of-climate-adaptation-research-in-csiro/\">adapt to climate change for at least a decade</a>. In fact, the world\u2019s first global conference on climate change adaptation was hosted here in Australia, on the <a href=\"https://www.nccarf.edu.au/content/past-conferences-0\">Gold Coast in 2010</a>.</p> <p>This conference was run by the former <a href=\"https://www.nccarf.edu.au/\">National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility</a>, which lost its federal funding in June 2018. It was a visionary initiative to attempt to help the most vulnerable nation in the developed world prepare for climate change. Despite this immensely important task, the initiative is now vastly scaled-down and operating through Griffith University by a handful of dedicated researchers.</p> <p>How anyone thought that axing funding to the only dedicated national climate change adaptation program in the country was a good idea is completely beyond me.</p> <p>This summer has been a brutal reminder that no matter how much we want to avoid addressing the problem of climate change, it simply can no longer be ignored. As this summer has shown, it is now part of every Australian\u2019s lived experience.</p> <p>Now is the time for our political leaders to make a choice about which side of history they want to be on. There is much work to be done, and we are fast running out of time.</p> <p>As a climate scientist I find prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s request for people to be \u201cpatient\u201d as infuriating as it is condescending. With respect prime minister, the science of climate change has been ignored in this country for decades. We are now seeing the very worst of our scientific predictions come to pass.</p> <p>Everyone\u2019s patience has worn thin. The Australian people are justifiably angry and are now demanding true leadership in the face of this climate emergency.</p> <p>We have already squandered more than a decade debating climate policy in Australia. All the while, the clear reality of a rapidly destabilising planet accelerates all around us.</p> <p>There genuinely is no more time to waste. We must act as though our home is on fire \u2013 because it is.</p> <ul> <li><p>Dr Jo\u00eblle Gergis is an award-winning climate scientist and writer based at the Australian National University.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "I had goosebumps watching surreal footage of the mass evacuation of people stranded on the south-east Australian coast. Once again, catastrophic bushfire conditions are bearing down on communities during increasingly horrific summers in Australia. It has been an unprecedented continuation of the horrendous bushfires that started as early as spring in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. As I write this, the Australian navy is evacuating more than 800 people from the bushfire-ravaged town of Mallacoota in eastern Victoria. Holiday makers are being forced to abandon their cars, complete with kids\u2019 bikes strapped to the roof racks, ice melting in Eskies. People hoping for a carefree break over the new year are instead faced with the extraordinary position of having to flee for their lives. There are now tens of thousands of people in coastal NSW and Victoria stranded in towns where the highways are closed, supermarkets are running out of food, and queues for petrol snake down the streets of devastated towns. The scenes experienced by those caught up in the ordeal are being described as apocalyptic \u2013 rightly so. Meanwhile, the locals face the infinitely more serious situation of returning to find their homes completely incinerated. Cars melted, pets killed, beloved landscapes destroyed. A lifetime of memories razed to the ground. As Australia\u2019s climate continues to warm, the most intimate places of human safety \u2013 our very homes \u2013 are being threatened in an increasingly dangerous world. It\u2019s confronting to see military evacuations, usually reserved for developing regions of the world following natural disasters, happening right here in 21st-century Australia. The sheer scale and severity of the emergency has actually overwhelmed our capacity as a nation to deal with the unfolding events. Not just in one area following a single event, but across multiple disasters occurring simultaneously in every state and territory of our nation. As a climate scientist, the thing that really terrifies me is that weather conditions considered extreme by today\u2019s standards will seem sedate in the future. What\u2019s unfolding right now is really just a taste of the new normal. At this point I could restate all the lines of scientific evidence that clearly show the links between human-caused climate change and the intensification of extreme weather conditions not just in Australia, but all over the world. To avoid sounding like a broken record, instead I will say that as a lead author on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment report of the global climate due out next year, I can assure you that the planetary situation is extremely dire. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say my work as scientist now keeps me up at night. As I\u2019ve watched the events of this summer unfolding, I\u2019ve found myself wondering whether the Earth system has now breached a tipping point, an irreversible shift in the stability of the planetary system. There may now be so much heat trapped in the system that we may have already triggered a domino effect that could unleash a cascade of abrupt changes that will continue to play out in the years and decades to come. Rapid climate change has the potential to reconfigure life on the planet as we know it. We know this because the geologic record contains evidence that these events have occurred in the past. The key difference is that we\u2019ve never had 7.5 billion people on the planet, so the human species really is in uncharted territory. The scientific community is acknowledging this by including new sections on abrupt climate change throughout key areas of the upcoming IPCC report. We now consider these \u201clow probability, high impact\u201d scenarios an increasingly critical part of our work. At the risk of stating the bleeding obvious, adapting to climate change in the driest inhabited continent on Earth is going to take a bit of work. To prepare our nation for the very challenging times ahead, we need political leaders \u2013 at every level \u2013 prepared to face this harsh reality. I single out our political leaders because the rest of the country is already leading the way. The leadership and true guts being shown out there by our local communities, often with minimal resources and under intense duress, has been staggering. The resilience, dedication, generosity and heart being demonstrated by our emergency services and embarrassingly unpaid volunteer firefighters is truly the stuff of legends. Cynics might say that our government seems to be taking advantage of the fact that we are a remarkable people willing to do whatever it takes to defend our incredibly unique nation. But the longer we leave things on a national policy level, the worse things are going to get. Failing to adequately plan for the known threat of climate change in a country like Australia should now be considered to be an act of treason. The scientific community has been trying to warn the government of the need to plan to adapt to climate change for at least a decade. In fact, the world\u2019s first global conference on climate change adaptation was hosted here in Australia, on the Gold Coast in 2010. This conference was run by the former National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, which lost its federal funding in June 2018. It was a visionary initiative to attempt to help the most vulnerable nation in the developed world prepare for climate change. Despite this immensely important task, the initiative is now vastly scaled-down and operating through Griffith University by a handful of dedicated researchers. How anyone thought that axing funding to the only dedicated national climate change adaptation program in the country was a good idea is completely beyond me. This summer has been a brutal reminder that no matter how much we want to avoid addressing the problem of climate change, it simply can no longer be ignored. As this summer has shown, it is now part of every Australian\u2019s lived experience. Now is the time for our political leaders to make a choice about which side of history they want to be on. There is much work to be done, and we are fast running out of time. As a climate scientist I find prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s request for people to be \u201cpatient\u201d as infuriating as it is condescending. With respect prime minister, the science of climate change has been ignored in this country for decades. We are now seeing the very worst of our scientific predictions come to pass. Everyone\u2019s patience has worn thin. The Australian people are justifiably angry and are now demanding true leadership in the face of this climate emergency. We have already squandered more than a decade debating climate policy in Australia. All the while, the clear reality of a rapidly destabilising planet accelerates all around us. There genuinely is no more time to waste. We must act as though our home is on fire \u2013 because it is.

The prime minister announced he had accepted Indian prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s invitation to visit back in October, where he was also due to deliver the inaugural Raisina Dialogue address, which aims to discuss the biggest challenges to the global economy. For Australia, one of those challenges is its fractious relationship with China, with coal exports seen as one of the flashpoints. Australia has increasingly looked to India as a potential buttress against any economic fallout with China, with Morrison making strengthening his relationship with Modi one of his priorities since becoming prime minister. The Coalition has also been an unwavering supporter of the Adani Carmichael mine in central Queensland, with minister for resources and northern Australia Matt Canavan a vocal supporter. Canavan attended a lunch with Adani executives during an official visit to Calcutta in August last year. The government has often pointed to the 1.3% of global carbon emissions Australia is responsible for, when answering criticisms over its climate policies. A report by the Australian Conservation Foundation, released mid last year, found Australia was responsible for at least 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, if the pollution from the nation\u2019s fossil fuel exports was included. Once the pollution from proposed projects was factored in, which included the Adani mine, that number had the potential to jump to 17% by 2030. Morrison has held firm to his view the government had its climate policy settings right, despite admitting the link between climate change and worsening bushfire seasons. \u201cLet me be clear to the Australian people: our emissions reductions policies will both protect our environment and seek to reduce the risks and hazards that we are seeing today and at the same time, it will seek to ensure the viability of people\u2019s jobs and their livelihoods all around the country,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cWhat we will do is ensure that our policies remain sensible, that they don\u2019t move towards either extreme and stay focused on what Australians need for a vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment. Getting the balance right is what Australia, I think, has always been able to achieve.\u201d The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, who has also been supportive of Australia\u2019s coal industry, said the decision of whether to go to India or not was one for the prime minister. \u201cThe prime minister will have to weigh up whether it\u2019s appropriate for him to go or not,\u201d he said. Albanese said he believed people were now seeing the warnings scientists had issued about the worsening impacts climate change would wreak against Australia, and wanted action. \u201cOne of the reasons why we have seen, I think, some frustration expressed by people on the ground, they don\u2019t want to be told it\u2019s a natural disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, Australia\u2019s had natural disasters in the past.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Mor-Cicurel asked Abbott if he was \u201cdenying that fact we are in the process of global warming and global change\u201d.</p> \n<p>Abbott responded that while there was \u201cno doubt that climate has changed\u201d, previous warming events had happened before the industrial revolution.</p> \n<p>Abbott\u2019s points are contradicted by every major science academy in the world, as well as the expertise of government science agencies in his own country.</p> \n<p>His anti-science views on climate change are well known in Australia and have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2017/oct/11/tony-abbott-dares-us-to-reject-evidence-on-climate-but-reveals-a-coward\">corrected many times by leading climate scientists</a> but Mor-Cicurel was not aware of his views before the interview.</p> \n<p>Mor-Cicurel told Guardian Australia the radio network had been reporting regularly on Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis and was not aware of Abbott\u2019s views before the interview.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cPersonally I was surprised [by Abbott\u2019s views on climate change].

During impeachment our average digital revenue per day more than doubled, up by 121%, where it was in the weeks preceding impeachment.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign would always be competing with other candidates on fundraising in the primary, Schultz said, alluding to Sen. <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> and Sanders, who both transferred money from their Senate accounts to their presidential campaigns. </p> <p>\u201cVice President Biden and Dr. Biden will be spending the vast majority of their time in the coming months where they are most effective \u2014 talking with voters in the early states,\u201d Schultz concluded. </p> <p>\u201cAnd, because we didn\u2019t transfer tens of millions of dollars from other campaign accounts like our opponents, we will always be playing from behind in the cash race.

The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the intelligence committee chair, Adam Schiff, called for a \u201cfair\u201d Senate trial and emphasized the importance of the newly revealed documents that appear to incriminate the president. Several 2020 presidential candidates released their fourth-quarter fundraising information. Joe Biden said he raised $22.7m in the final three months of 2019, falling short of Bernie Sanders (who raised $34.5m) and Pete Buttigieg (who raised $24.7m). More than 200 members of Congress asked the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v Wade, which legalized abortion in 1973. Juli\u00e1n Castro dropped out of the Democratic presidential primary, and Marianne Williamson reportedly laid off her campaign staff nationally. Warren released a sweeping plan that, among other things, would raise the hourly minimum wage to $15 and end a program that allows employers to pay disabled workers much less. \u201cBuilding economic security for people with disabilities means rewriting the rules of the economy to foster inclusivity, value their labor and end labor market discrimination and exploitation,\u201d the 2020 presidential candidate said in a statement. As a senator, Warren asked the US labor department to end a program that allows employers to seek waivers to pay employees with disabilities $7.25 an hour, and sometimes as little as 33 cents. The board plan also promises to make more schools accessible and compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act and make tech work for people with disabilities by funding research to develop \u201caffordable and life-changing supports for people with disabilities\u201d. Hillary Clinton has taken on a new role as a chancellor of Queen\u2019s University Belfast. For the former US secretary of state, senator and first lady, the role will be mostly ceremonial. Clinton and her husband the former president have strong ties to the university in Northern Ireland. From the Washington Post: The school awarded Hillary Clinton an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in October 2018 and has established a \u201cHillary Rodham Clinton Award for Peace and Reconciliation,\u201d which the university describes as a full scholarship awarded each year to an \u201cexceptional female student from the USA who wishes to pursue study in a field related to politics, conflict transformation or human rights.\u201d In 2011, it also established the William J Clinton Leadership Institute, which offers courses for current and aspiring business leaders. Tulsi Gabbard, who kicked off her new year by surfing New Hampshire\u2019s frigid waters, made less of a splash with her fundraising announcement. Gabbard reportedly raised $3.4m in the fourth quarter of 2019 \u2013 about 10% of Bernie Sanders\u2019 $34.5m. It\u2019s unlikely that Gabbard will meet the fundraising requirements to qualify for the next 2020 Democratic primary debates. It seems she can command the waves, but can she conquer the New Hampshire primary? A fake video edited so it appears that Joe Biden is making racist remarks has gained more than a million views on social media, according to the AP. From the AP: In the edited clip, which was less than 20 seconds long, Biden says, \u201cOur culture is not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation.\u201d Social media users paired the video with comments like \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Joe Biden is a Racist.\u201d Posts with the video surfaced across social media platforms on Wednesday. The clip, which pulled ABC News coverage of Biden speaking on 30 December in New Hampshire, was distorted out of context. The 2020 Democratic candidate, in discussing the culture on college campuses of violence against women, said \u201cFolks, this is about changing the culture, our culture, our culture, it\u2019s not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation. It is our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture that says it is all right.\u201d Biden also spoke about the need to change an entrenched \u201ccultural problem\u201d that dates back to English common law, and back to the 1300s when men beat their wives without any legal repercussions. In a separate speech in March, Biden said: \u201cIt\u2019s an English jurisprudential culture, a white man\u2019s culture... It\u2019s got to change.\u201d Fake videos are now easier than ever to create and disseminate. Adam Schiff, the head of the House intelligence committee who helped lead the impeachment against Trump has responded to information revealed in newly unredacted emails about the freeze on military aid to Ukraine. As part of our impeachment inquiry, the House subpoenaed these very documents. From their deeply incriminating character, we can now see why they were concealed: They directly corroborate witnesses who testified that military aid to Ukraine was withheld at the direction of the President and that the White House was informed doing so may violate the law. The Administration did not want Congress to find out why. Like House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Schiff reiterated the need for a fair Senate trial that takes into account these new documents. \u201cIf [the documents] are not produced, the Senate and the American people must ask, what else is the President hiding?\u201d Schiff said in a statement. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Newly unredacted emails showed administration officials saying the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military aid was a \u201cclear direction\u201d from Trump, prompting renewed calls from Democratic lawmakers to have some of the president\u2019s advisers testify about alleged efforts to pressure Kyiv to investigate Joe Biden. The Republican senator Josh Hawley said he would introduce a measure Monday to dismiss the impeachment case for \u201clack of prosecution\u201d, although it\u2019s unclear whether such a proposal would succeed. Joe Biden said he raised $22.7m in the final three months of 2019, marking the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s best quarter yet but still falling short of the totals posted by Bernie Sanders ($34.5m) and Pete Buttigieg ($24.7m). Juli\u00e1n Castro dropped out of the Democratic presidential primary, while Marianne Williamson is laying off her campaign staff nationally, indicating the field will likely continue to narrow in the final month before the Iowa caucuses. The FDA said it would ban certain e-cigarette flavors popular with younger users of the products, but the regulation allows for large exceptions that will prove beneficial for the industry\u2019s manufacturers. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. House speaker Nancy Pelosi reacted to news of the newly unredacted emails about the freeze on military aid to Ukraine, arguing the messages demonstrate the need to have a \u201cfair trial\u201d in the Senate. One of the emails obtained by Just Security includes a message from a senior budget official telling a Pentagon staffer, \u201cClear direction from POTUS to continue to hold.\u201d Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer are pressing majority leader Mitch McConnell to call White House officials to testify about the aid freeze in the impeachment trial, but the House speaker has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Trey Gowdy has said he will not join Trump\u2019s legal team, ending months of speculation about whether the former Republican congressman would help the president secure an acquittal in a Senate impeachment trial. \u201cThe president has good lawyers and more importantly good facts,\u201d Gowdy told McClatchy. \u201cHe does not need another lawyer added to his team. He needs the trial to begin and end.\u201d Gowdy said when he left Congress last year that he was done with politics and would focus on private sector work in his home state of South Carolina, but he then appeared ready to join Trump\u2019s team back in October. However, Gowdy changed his thinking when it became clear he would have to give up his law firm and his Fox News contributor contract to take on the new role. Although he will not become one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Gowdy played golf with Trump over the weekend, indicating he will continue to offer advice to Trump as the Senate moves toward an impeachment trial. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign manager stressed that January has to be the campaign\u2019s \u201cbest fundraising month to date,\u201d even as the campaign announced that it had a solid fundraising quarter. In a memo distributed to Democratic donors and obtained by The Guardian, campaign manager Greg Schultz hailed the campaign\u2019s recent $22.7 million haul, noting that it was a 50 percent increase over the last quarter. But in the two-page memo Schultz also stressed it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely critical that January is our best fundraising month to date, so we can continue to make strategic investments throughout the country and perform well in the early states.\u201d The memo and Schultz\u2019s appeal come as Biden, the Democratic frontrunner, continues to find himself in the middle of the fact on fundraising in yet another quarter and just before voting begins in the early primary states. Only a few of the more than two dozen Democratic candidates have released their fundraising numbers so far but Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, two of Biden\u2019s chief rivals in the Democratic primary, have outraised him. Still, Schultz, in the memo, hailed the campaign\u2019s most recent fundraising numbers as a positive sign for Biden. \u201cThanks to the hard work of many, we\u2019re thrilled to announce that the fourth quarter was our best to date, raising $22.7 million, a 50% growth from last quarter. In addition, 57% of our donors were new this quarter, highlighting the new support our campaign is gaining daily,\u201d Schultz wrote. \u201cIn what is typically a difficult time of the year to raise money, the Vice President\u2019s growing momentum translated directly into strong performances in both online and offline revenue, ensuring that we have the resources we need to enter the next critical phase of this campaign.\u201d Schultz added that Donald Trump\u2019s repeated criticism at Biden has actually given the campaign a fundraising boost. \u201cIn fact, Trump\u2019s attacks have majorly backfired, providing our campaign a fundraising boost and reminding Democratic primary voters what we have been saying all along \u2014 Trump does not want Biden to be the nominee because he knows Biden will flat out beat him in November,\u201d Schultz wrote. \u201cHe is so desperate to avoid the electoral defeat he would face against Biden that he got himself impeached soliciting a foreign government in the effort. During impeachment our average digital revenue per day more than doubled, up by 121%, where it was in the weeks preceding impeachment.\u201d The campaign would always be competing with other candidates on fundraising in the primary, Schultz said, alluding to Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sanders, who both transferred money from their Senate accounts to their presidential campaigns. \u201cVice President Biden and Dr. Biden will be spending the vast majority of their time in the coming months where they are most effective \u2014 talking with voters in the early states,\u201d Schultz concluded. \u201cAnd, because we didn\u2019t transfer tens of millions of dollars from other campaign accounts like our opponents, we will always be playing from behind in the cash race. It is absolutely critical that January is our best fundraising month to date, so we can continue to make strategic investments throughout the country and perform well in the early states.\u201d Although Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson is laying off her staff nationally, the self-help author apparently has no plans to call it quits. According to one of her now-former advisers, Williamson will forge ahead with her longshot bid without any asssistance from staffers in the early voting states. The president\u2019s congressional allies appear to be zeroing in on a new talking point to undermine the Senate impeachment trial. As House speaker Nancy Pelosi continues to avoid transmitting the articles of impeachment, Republican lawmakers are arguing the delay indicates the case is not as \u201curgent\u201d as Democrats previously claimed. Senate Republican Josh Hawley said that he intends to introduce a measure Monday to dismiss the impeachment case for \u201clack of prosecution.\u201d Marianne Williamson, the self-help author and Democratic presidential candidate who captured the Internet\u2019s fascination with her early debate performances, has reportedly laid off her campaign staff nationally. The ABC affiliate WMUR reports: The spiritual author and lecturer joined the race in January 2019 and campaigned aggressively throughout the year, making many visits to New Hampshire. The sources told WMUR she remains a candidate but has drastically scaled back her campaign. As of Tuesday, the sources said, Williamson\u2019s campaign, in fact, had no staffers on board. At its height, the sources said, Williamson employed about 45 staffers in the four early voting states as well as her central campaign headquarters. She had two staff members in New Hampshire \u2013 including former U.S. Rep. Paul Hodes, who was a senior campaign adviser and New Hampshire state director. Hodes is no longer employed by the campaign, according to the sources. Also no longer with Williamson as of Thursday is national campaign manager Patricia Ewing. The news comes hours after Juli\u00e1n Castro announced he was dropping out of the Democratic presidential primary, leaving 14 candidates in the race with a month to go until the Iowa caucuses. Congressman Mark Meadows, one of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, criticized his Democratic colleagues as House leadership continues to delay transmitting the articles of impeachment against the president. It\u2019s still unclear when a Senate impeachment trial might begin or what procedures will be adopted, but Mitch McConnell may address those issues tomorrow, when the majority leader is expected to speak on the Senate floor. But McConnell has dismissed any notion that Democrats\u2019 refusal to transmit the articles will have any effect on trial procedures. Joe Biden appears to have changed the tagline for his Iowa bus tour, abandoning the \u201cNo Malarkey\u201d slogan and adopting \u201cBattle for the Soul of the Nation.\u201d The \u201cNo Malarkey\u201d slogan -- which was a play on the Biden-ism, \u201cThat\u2019s a bunch of malarkey!\u201d from the 2012 campaign -- had been mocked as confusing and uninspiring. The former vice president will be in Iowa through Sunday, hosting community events and kicking off phone banks across the first caucus state. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a tweet that newly unredacted emails about the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military aid are a \u201ca devastating blow to Senator McConnell\u2019s push to have a trial without the documents and witnesses we\u2019ve requested\u201d. Schumer argued the emails underscored the need to have Trump administration officials \u2013 including the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and former national security adviser John Bolton \u2013 testify in a Senate impeachment trial about efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden as the aid was held up. Just Security reported on the emails earlier today: \u2018Clear direction from POTUS to continue to hold.\u2019 This is what Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), told Elaine McCusker, the acting Pentagon comptroller, in an Aug. 30 email, which has only been made available in redacted form until now. It is one of many documents the Trump administration is trying to keep from the public, despite congressional oversight efforts and court orders in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation. ... What is clear is that it all came down to the president and what he wanted; no one else appears to have supported his position. Although the pretext for the hold was that some sort of policy review was taking place, the emails make no mention of that actually happening. Instead, officials were anxiously waiting for the president to be convinced that the hold was a bad idea. Joe Biden said he raised $22.7 million during the final three months of 2019, his best quarter yet but short of the totals posted by Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. Sanders announced this morning that he raised $34.5 million last quarter, and Buttigieg said yesterday that he hit $24.7 million. Of the four candidates leading the polls, the only Democratic contender who has not yet released fundraising numbers is Elizabeth Warren, but the Massachsuetts senator told supporters Friday that she had only raised $17 million at that point. More than 200 members of Congress, including 39 Republican senators, have signed on to an amicus brief calling on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark case that established a woman\u2019s right to access abortion. The brief comes two months before the court is scheduled to hear arguments in a case concerning a Louisiana law restricting access to abortion. The Trump administration has announced plans to ban some vaping flavors popular with younger users of the products, but the regulation will include large exemptions that will benefit manufacturers. The AP reports: The Trump administration announced Thursday that it will prohibit fruit, candy, mint and dessert flavors from small, cartridge-based e-cigarettes that are popular with high school students. But menthol and tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes will be allowed to remain on the market. The flavor ban will also entirely exempt large, tank-based vaping devices, which are primarily sold in vape shops that cater to adult smokers. Together, the two exemptions represent a significant retreat from President Donald Trump\u2019s original plan announced four months ago, which would have banned all vaping flavors \u2014 including menthol \u2014 from all types of e-cigarettes. The new policy will preserve a significant portion of the multibillion-dollar vaping market. And the changes are likely to please both the largest e-cigarette manufacturer, Juul Labs, and thousands of vape shop owners who sell the tank-based systems, which allow users to mix customized flavors. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Juli\u00e1n Castro dropped out of the Democratic presidential primary, leaving the race without any Latino candidates. Trump raised $46m during the final quarter of 2019, an impressive haul that the president\u2019s reelection campaign partly credited to anger over last month\u2019s impeachment. Bernie Sanders said he raised $34.5m over the last three months, the largest single-quarter total of any Democratic presidential candidate during this cycle so far. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine who became a key witness in the impeachment inquiry, has offiicially left the post. CNN reports: In his six months as charges d\u2019affaires in Kiev, Taylor twice testified as part of the House probe into President Donald Trump, providing damning testimony about an alleged quid pro quo with Ukraine. He also remained a vocal advocate of maintaining US support for the country, especially amid ongoing Russian aggression In a farewell message posted on New Year\u2019s Eve, Taylor stressed the US\u2019 \u2018strong support\u2019 for Ukraine and voiced optimism about the country. \u2018The time since June has been a great one, it\u2019s an exciting time to be in Ukraine,\u2019 Taylor said. \u2018This has been a great time for me to be here and it\u2019s going to be a great time going forward.\u2019 The embassy announced Thursday that Deputy Chief of Mission Kristina Kvien had taken over the role of charge d\u2019affaires. Bernie Sanders\u2019 impressive fundraising haul during the last quarter of 2019 underscored how much money billionaire Michael Bloomberg is spending on advertising, as a Politico reporter noted. Bloomberg only entered the race in late November, but he has already managed to hit fifth place in a number of national polls. The former New York mayor has decided to skip campaigning in the four early-voting states, instead focusing on Super Tuesday states like California. Bloomberg has already spent more than $100 million advertising in states that will begin voting in early March. The president\u2019s reelection campaign announced this morning that Trump raised an impressive $46m during the last quarter of 2019, finishing the year with more than $100m in cash on hand. Trump\u2019s campaign manager credited the president\u2019s impeachment last month with supercharging grassroot donations. \u201cDemocrats and the media have been in a sham impeachment frenzy and the president\u2019s campaign only got bigger and stronger with our best fundraising quarter this cycle,\u201d Brad Parscale said in a statement. Democrats have also financially benefitted from impeachment, raking in millions of dollars after House speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the formal launch of the inquiry in late September. But the president\u2019s massive fundraising operation, in combination with the resources of the Republican National Committee and conservative Pacs, will make him a formidable opponent for the eventual Democratic presidential nominee. Hours after Bernie Sanders announced he raised $35 million last quarter, the presidential candidate\u2019s campaign manager said he would not accept big-dollar donations if he won the nomination. Sanders has touted his grassroots support, noting the average donaton during the last quarter of 2019 was $18.53. His impressive haul marrked the largest single-quarter fundraising total of any Democratic presidential candidate during this cycle. One of his opponents, Elizabeth Warren, has similarly said she would forgo big-money fundraisers if she won the nomination, but she clarified she would headline open-press events for the Democratic National Committee. Republican senator Chuck Grassley just sent this snarky tweet about the president, aimed at \u201cwhoever keeps watch\u201d on Trump at the White House. The Iowa Republican specifically advised Trump\u2019s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, to read a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed from conservative commentator Daniel Henninger. In the piece, Henninger cites the upheaveals of the \u201cRoaring 20\u2019s\u201d to call for \u201canother wave of creative thought\u2014about politics, culture, education and morality.\u201d Trump is still at his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago and has no events on his public schedule, so the president is spending another day at Trump International Golf Club. Trump has repeatedly visited his golf club since arriving in Florida for the holidays, but he lashed out against the media for covering his trip there on New Year\u2019s Eve, hours after pro-Iran protesters stormed the US embassy in Iraq. Andrew Yang, the only non-white candidate to qualify for the last Democratic presidential debate, congratulated Juli\u00e1n Castro on running a \u201ctremendous race\u201d after the former husing secretary dropped out of the primary. Yang qualified for the December debate on the last day to do so and became the only candidate of color on the Los Angeles stage. Reacting to the mostly white debate stage, Castro\u2019s team had complained that candidates of color were being stifled in the race and called for \u201cmore systematic, wholesale change to the process so that our primaries are a little more reflective of our party and our country\u2019s diversity.\u201d One of the issues that Juli\u00e1n Castro highlighted in the final months of his campaign was whether the mostly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire should continue to vote first in presidential primaries. \u201cI actually believe that we do need to change the order of the states,\u201d Castro said in November. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re the same country we were in 1972. That\u2019s when Iowa first held its caucus first, and by the time we have the next presidential election in 2024, it\u2019ll have been more than 50 years since 1972. Our country\u2019s changed a lot in those 50 years.\u201d Castro applauded the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire for carefully vetting presidential candidates, but he added that the states were \u201cnot reflective of the United States as a whole, certainly not reflective of the Democratic Party, and I believe that other states should have their chance.\u201d Castro\u2019s team has also argued that the early-voting status of Iowa and New Hampshire incentivized the media to focus on white, working-class voters who swung to Trump in 2016, instead of covering the voters of color who make up a key portion of the Democratic base. Democratic presidential candidates thanked Juli\u00e1n Castro for \u201cproposing bold and progressive plans\u201d and \u201csticking up for underrepresented communities\u201d after the former housing secretary suspended his White House bid. Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who is often named as a potential running mate for the party\u2019s eventual nominee, said the country owed Castro \u201ca debt of gratitude\u201d for how he helped to shape the race. With Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s departure, 14 candidates remain in the Democratic presidential primary, with a month to go until the Iowa caucuses. Considering the quick turnaround before the January 14 debate and the possibility of a Senate impeachment trial, it seems likely that other candidates will drop out before Iowans start casting their votes. Juli\u00e1n Castro has now tweeted out the four-minute video announcing his decision to drop out of the Democratic presidential primary, which recaps how the candidate helped to shape the conversation on issues like immigration and criminal justice reform. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of the campaign we\u2019ve run together. We\u2019ve shaped the conversation on so many important issues in this race, stood up for the most vulnerable people, and given a voice to those who are often forgotten,\u201d Castro said in the video. \u201cBut with only a month until the Iowa caucuses, and given the circumstances of this campaign season, I have determined that it simply isn\u2019t our time. ... So today it\u2019s with a heavy heart and with profound gratitude, that I will suspend my campaign for president. To all who have been inspired by our campaign, especially our young people, keep reaching for your dreams\u2014and keep fighting for what you believe in. \u00a1Ganaremos un d\u00eda!\u201d There has been speculation for months over whether (or, more likely, when) Juli\u00e1n Castro would drop out of the Democratic presidential primary. After narrowly meeting a late October goal to raise $800,000, Castro laid off staff in the early voting states of New Hampshire and South Carolina, while offering support to staffers looking for jobs with other campaigns. The former housing secretary also failed to qualify for the past two debates, which prompted criticism from his team that the qualification requirements had shut out candidates of color. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the only Latino candidate in the Democratic presidential primary, is dropping out of the race after failing to qualify for recent debates and struggling to attract donations or supporters. The New York Times reports: Throughout his campaign, Mr. Castro, 45, a native of San Antonio who spent five years as its mayor, portrayed himself as an unapologetic liberal who was shaped by his humble beginnings and had been overlooked by the press. Though he created some memorable moments as he championed progressive policy and challenged his rivals on the campaign trail, Mr. Castro was unable to break into the upper tier of a crowded primary field. His exit is the latest departure of a candidate of color from a field that began as the most racially diverse ever in a Democratic primary. \u2018I\u2019ve determined that it simply isn\u2019t our time,\u2019 Mr. Castro said in a nearly four-minute video message released by his campaign, which included a montage from his year on the trail, including visits to the border and a homeless encampment in Oakland. \u2018Today it\u2019s with a heavy heart, and profound gratitude, that I will suspend my campaign for president.\u2019 Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer, a freshman House Democrat who represents an Iowa district that swung from supporting Barack Obama in 2012 to backing Donald Trump in 2016, has announced she is endorsing Joe Biden\u2019s presidential bid. \u201cWe need a President who reflects those same values and will make America\u2019s working families their top priority. Joe Biden\u2019s character, record, and commitment to rebuilding the backbone of the country \u2014 the middle class \u2014 is what Iowa and this country needs,\u201d Finkenauer said in an email released by Biden\u2019s campaign. The Biden team\u2019s email describes Finkenauer as \u201cone of the most coveted endorsements in Iowa and nationally.\u201d The 31-year-old lawmaker was one of the first two congresswomen elected in Iowa, which hosts the first caucuses in the Democratic primary race, and her 2018 victory was heralded as \u201cthe most authentic roadmap for Democratic success in the heartland.\u201d Finkenauer is engaged to Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Iowa political director, Daniel Wasta, but the congresswoman has previously made clear that connection would not weigh on her eventual endorsement. Good morning, live blog readers! It is looking like a very happy new year for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator\u2019s campaign announced this morning that he raised $34.5m in the last quarter of 2019, the largest single-quarter haul in the Democratic primary race to date. Sanders\u2019 campaign said it received more than 1.8m donations, with contributions averaging $18.53. Since launching his campaign, Sanders has received more than 5 million individual donations. \u201cBernie Sanders is closing the year with the most donations of any candidate in history at this point in a presidential campaign,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, Faiz Shakir said. \u201cYou build a grassroots movement to beat Donald Trump and create a political revolution one $18 donation at a time, and that\u2019s exactly why Bernie is going to win.\u201d Sanders\u2019 fundraising total far outpaces those of his opponents who have already announced their fourth-quarter numbers. Pete Buttigieg said yesterday that he raised a respectable $24.5m, and Andrew Yang announced this morning that he hit $16.5m. Elizabeth Warren has not yet announced her fourth-quarter results, but the Massachusetts senator warned her supporters last week that she had only raised $17m so far. The figure marked a signficicant drop from previous quarters and sparked concerns of dimming enthusiasm among her supporters. But even Sanders\u2019 impressive haul is eclipsed by the fundraising machine powering Trump\u2019s reelection bid. The president\u2019s campaign announced today that it raised $46m last quarter, demonstrating the financial hurdles the eventual Democratic nominee will face. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump is still at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and has no events on his public schedule. Both chambers of Congress remain out of session. Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden and Tom Steyer are campaigning in Iowa today, with one month to go until the caucuses. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

These were the songs that acted as sonic touchstones for a teenage Lee as he steadily wrote his own 90s classics and quickly found himself touring and rubbing shoulders with artists he had admired from afar mere months earlier in his Bondi bedroom. This arrangement keeps a similar pace and the same serpentine twists as the original, but somehow makes the oddball lyrics seem less impenetrable, with Lee\u2019s earnest delivery stripping off a layer of lacquer.

This victory was more of a grind in the end; even though Liverpool initially threatened a goalfest the game went quite flat for long periods, but a two-goal margin of victory did not flatter the home side and the overall significance lies in the fact that J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s players have now gone unbeaten in the Premier League for a whole year.</p> <p>Only Arsenal and Chelsea have managed that in the Premier League era, and no other top-flight side have made it through the festive period without dropping points.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/02/liverpool-v-sheffield-united-premier-league-live\">Liverpool v Sheffield United: Premier League \u2013\u00a0live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Liverpool faced lively opponents in Leicester, Wolves and Sheffield United, all teams in excellent form, yet each obstacle was cleared, with this third win of the series restoring a 13-point lead at the top of the table with a game in hand. Just about the only cause for optimism for those fearing the title race might be over already is that there has been a detectable fall-off in performance over those three matches. Leicester were stylishly routed, Wolves was a much more close-run thing and, while the outcome of this game was never in much doubt from the moment Liverpool took an early lead, after a bright beginning there were too many slack passes and wasted opportunities for the home crowd\u2019s liking. If Liverpool are tiring, it proves only that they are human after all, though they might just have been managing a difficult situation. There was no need to expend unnecessary energy once in front and Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s second-half goal allowed everyone at Anfield to relax just a little.</p> <p>Liverpool got off to the best possible start with a goal in under four minutes. It was a classic quick strike with a minimum of touches, Virgil van Dijk picking up Andy Robertson\u2019s run down the left and Mohamed Salah ready and waiting for the low cross to supply a crisp first-time finish; and, though the margins were quite fine on this occasion, there was no need for VAR interference. Robertson had timed his touchline run to perfection to stay onside, though his job was made easier when the chasing George Baldock slipped on the turf, and Salah was smart enough to delay his move towards the ball until the moment was right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab298d3ad432900d36e7d30231bc94a9ce427f23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab298d3ad432900d36e7d30231bc94a9ce427f23/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohamed Salah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohamed Salah puts Liverpool 1-0 ahead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If that was not the opening Sheffield United had hoped for, it could have been worse still a few minutes later, when the lively Salah burst on to a pass from Jordan Henderson and brought a fingertip save from Dean Henderson with another first-time shot. With the visitors largely penned in their own half, Liverpool moved the ball around confidently as if putting on an exhibition. At one point Robertson found Trent Alexander-Arnold with a lofted pass from one touchline to the other, only for the right-back to send the ball immediately back in the direction it had come in an attempt to find Roberto Firmino in the penalty area.</p> <p>When Georginio Wijnaldum shot narrowly over from Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s pass midway through the first half there was a sense that another breakthrough might be imminent, though Man\u00e9 chose the wrong option when Henderson ran half of the length of the pitch to release him, a slight miscontrol allowing the United defenders to funnel back and cut out his eventual cross.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was not quite all one way \u2013 Lys Mousset could have done better than shoot tamely at Alisson with an unmarked John Fleck calling for the ball at the far post \u2013 but United were indebted to Dean Henderson again when Man\u00e9 nudged an Alexander-Arnold prompt into Salah\u2019s path and the goalkeeper had to beat away a goalbound shot. Liverpool were at their most fluent when attacking at speed on the counter rather than attempting to pass their way through a packed defence. United knew that but were still obliged to come forward occasionally to try to get back on terms. Liverpool were not quite as sharp as they have been in recent weeks, with a few passes going astray and Firmino\u2019s touch in particular letting him down in promising situations, and despite a wealth of possession in and around the Blades area they were unable to add to their lead before half-time.</p> <p>Firmino shot just wide at the start of the second half before Salah almost claimed a freak goal with an effort that trickled through a crowd of defenders and came back off a surprised Henderson\u2019s right-hand upright. The goalkeeper saw the ball only at the last moment but acted quickly enough to prevent it trickling over his line. Man\u00e9\u2019s goal, just past the hour, came from his own determined break down the right. He fed Salah in the middle and carried on running, so that the return pass found him in front of goal, where he was able to beat Henderson at the second attempt. It was a goal considerably less scruffy than it looked. Robertson\u2019s initial pass to Man\u00e9 was excellent, Man\u00e9\u2019s intelligent run even better, and the coolness of Salah\u2019s final pass almost sublime. He might not have meant to do exactly that, but it worked, and for Liverpool at the moment everything works and little else matters.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Records and landmarks keep being surpassed as Liverpool\u2019s relentless red machine grinds on. This victory was more of a grind in the end; even though Liverpool initially threatened a goalfest the game went quite flat for long periods, but a two-goal margin of victory did not flatter the home side and the overall significance lies in the fact that J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s players have now gone unbeaten in the Premier League for a whole year. Only Arsenal and Chelsea have managed that in the Premier League era, and no other top-flight side have made it through the festive period without dropping points. Liverpool faced lively opponents in Leicester, Wolves and Sheffield United, all teams in excellent form, yet each obstacle was cleared, with this third win of the series restoring a 13-point lead at the top of the table with a game in hand. Just about the only cause for optimism for those fearing the title race might be over already is that there has been a detectable fall-off in performance over those three matches. Leicester were stylishly routed, Wolves was a much more close-run thing and, while the outcome of this game was never in much doubt from the moment Liverpool took an early lead, after a bright beginning there were too many slack passes and wasted opportunities for the home crowd\u2019s liking. If Liverpool are tiring, it proves only that they are human after all, though they might just have been managing a difficult situation. There was no need to expend unnecessary energy once in front and Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s second-half goal allowed everyone at Anfield to relax just a little. Liverpool got off to the best possible start with a goal in under four minutes. It was a classic quick strike with a minimum of touches, Virgil van Dijk picking up Andy Robertson\u2019s run down the left and Mohamed Salah ready and waiting for the low cross to supply a crisp first-time finish; and, though the margins were quite fine on this occasion, there was no need for VAR interference. Robertson had timed his touchline run to perfection to stay onside, though his job was made easier when the chasing George Baldock slipped on the turf, and Salah was smart enough to delay his move towards the ball until the moment was right. If that was not the opening Sheffield United had hoped for, it could have been worse still a few minutes later, when the lively Salah burst on to a pass from Jordan Henderson and brought a fingertip save from Dean Henderson with another first-time shot. With the visitors largely penned in their own half, Liverpool moved the ball around confidently as if putting on an exhibition. At one point Robertson found Trent Alexander-Arnold with a lofted pass from one touchline to the other, only for the right-back to send the ball immediately back in the direction it had come in an attempt to find Roberto Firmino in the penalty area. When Georginio Wijnaldum shot narrowly over from Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s pass midway through the first half there was a sense that another breakthrough might be imminent, though Man\u00e9 chose the wrong option when Henderson ran half of the length of the pitch to release him, a slight miscontrol allowing the United defenders to funnel back and cut out his eventual cross. It was not quite all one way \u2013 Lys Mousset could have done better than shoot tamely at Alisson with an unmarked John Fleck calling for the ball at the far post \u2013 but United were indebted to Dean Henderson again when Man\u00e9 nudged an Alexander-Arnold prompt into Salah\u2019s path and the goalkeeper had to beat away a goalbound shot. Liverpool were at their most fluent when attacking at speed on the counter rather than attempting to pass their way through a packed defence. United knew that but were still obliged to come forward occasionally to try to get back on terms. Liverpool were not quite as sharp as they have been in recent weeks, with a few passes going astray and Firmino\u2019s touch in particular letting him down in promising situations, and despite a wealth of possession in and around the Blades area they were unable to add to their lead before half-time. Firmino shot just wide at the start of the second half before Salah almost claimed a freak goal with an effort that trickled through a crowd of defenders and came back off a surprised Henderson\u2019s right-hand upright. The goalkeeper saw the ball only at the last moment but acted quickly enough to prevent it trickling over his line. Man\u00e9\u2019s goal, just past the hour, came from his own determined break down the right. He fed Salah in the middle and carried on running, so that the return pass found him in front of goal, where he was able to beat Henderson at the second attempt. It was a goal considerably less scruffy than it looked. Robertson\u2019s initial pass to Man\u00e9 was excellent, Man\u00e9\u2019s intelligent run even better, and the coolness of Salah\u2019s final pass almost sublime. He might not have meant to do exactly that, but it worked, and for Liverpool at the moment everything works and little else matters.",
