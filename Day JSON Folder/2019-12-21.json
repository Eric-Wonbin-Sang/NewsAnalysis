I could not believe that, offered a hopeful vision for a fairer UK, the public had opted for more economic conservatism. In the early hours of Friday 13 December, as the Tories secured their biggest win since the Thatcher era, I recognised the same <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/labour-voices-on-election-result\" title=\"\">disappointment and disbelief </a>in many of those around me.</p> <p>The Jeremy Corbyn I have known for decades as the MP for my neighbouring constituency is kind, compassionate and thoroughly decent. I regard him as a friend, with a wonderful track record as a constituency MP. To put it politely, these were not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/i-saw-just-how-many-voters-were-hostile-to-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">the qualities that came up on doorsteps </a>as I campaigned in London, Halifax, Bury, Bolton, Cardiff, Birmingham, Watford and elsewhere.</p> <p>The leadership\u2019s failure to deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/10/anyone-but-corbyn-jewish-voters-turn-away-from-labour\" title=\"\">with the stain of antisemitism </a>within the party stripped Labour of moral authority. Jeremy\u2019s triangulation on Brexit left Leavers thinking he was a Remainer and convinced Remainers he supported Leave. His well-reported hostility to institutions such as Nato cemented the public\u2019s distrust. It was not Jeremy\u2019s righteous belief in economic justice that lost Labour this election; it was his perceived worldview, failure of competence, and mind-boggling decision to abdicate leadership on the biggest issue of the day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d60df2110eadfeee432d0e8a999f724240c1e95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d60df2110eadfeee432d0e8a999f724240c1e95/0_0_5861_3517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Lammy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Lammy speaking in London earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Bowles/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Labour to win back what were once seen as our heartlands, we need to unite the country around a vision for the UK we can all take pride in. This does not mean imitating Boris Johnson\u2019s populist, ethnic nationalism. Many people voted Tory because of a legitimate commitment to leaving the EU, or because they did not like Corbyn or what Labour was offering. But Johnson cynically scapegoated migrants during the campaign, warning that Europeans had treated the UK like \u201ctheir own\u201d country for too long. This is not the first time Johnson has attacked a minority in an attempt to win popularity. In 2018, he compared Muslim women to bankrobbers and letterboxes, which led to a surge in hate crimes. By lurching to the right, Johnson was able to make a Faustian pact and convince Nigel Farage to stand down. This helped him win, but set a very dangerous precedent.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s ethnic nationalism relies on the idea of the nation as the natural home of a people whose ancestors are all from one ethnic group. History suggests that once ethnic nationalism is introduced into a nation\u2019s politics it is difficult to remove and even more difficult to control. Once one group is defined as \u201cthe people\u201d, the next step is often to classify the excluded as second-class citizens. This is hardly a route back to national unity.</p> <p>A new tribalism has gripped the UK. However, recent surveys show that on the most fundamental issues \u2013 climate change, equal pay and the right of women to have careers, faith in science and scientists, the NHS \u2013 we are not divided. On these issues our collective views are converging, and even heading towards a consensus. We need a politics that reflects that. The alternative to Johnson\u2019s ethnic nationalism that Labour should offer is a civic nationalism. Rather than basing national pride on biological heritage, skin colour or religion, civic nationalism says we can unite around shared values and institutions. To foster this, we need new spaces and places in which the UK\u2019s diverse peoples can engage with each other and belong.</p> <p>Why don\u2019t we start by creating a citizens\u2019 assembly to begin deciding the basis for a new British bill of rights and a codified constitution? Next, who is up for scrapping our unfair voting system and replacing it with something proportional to encourage a new politics of compromise? Then, why not trial a form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/12/labour-would-trial-universal-basic-income-if-elected-john-mcdonnell-says\" title=\"\">universal basic income </a>\u2013 call it the citizens\u2019 fund \u2013 so that all people have the capacity and capital to come together in social clubs, sports teams and other parts of civic life? More controversially, could compulsory national civic service \u2013 compelling young people from all regions, ethnicities and social classes to mix \u2013 remind us what we have in common?</p> <p>Labour will win back the country only if we show the public that we love the UK, too, and are positive about what we have achieved together, and optimistic about the inclusive, multicultural, dynamic society we want to build. The difference is that our national pride manifests itself in hope, rather than fear. While Johnson pulls the country back towards a nostalgic version of Little England, Labour must own the future of a reinvigorated UK.</p> <p>As for which Labour figure I believe is best-placed to lead this hopeful vision, I will consider that over Christmas.</p> <p><em>David Lammy is the MP for Tottenham in London</em></p> <h2>Mary Creagh: \u201cI asked Corbyn why he is still leader given how toxic he is\u201d</h2> <p> </p> <p>\u201cCan I ask why you\u2019re voting Conservative this time?\u201d I asked the woman \u2013 who voted Labour in 2017 \u2013 smiling at me from the doorway of her home, beautifully decorated for Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she beamed. \u201cFirst, education\u2026\u201d \u201cCut by \u00a369m, in real terms, in Wakefield since 2015,\u201d I interjected. \u201cSecond, the NHS,\u201d she continued. \u201cSuffering the longest funding squeeze in its history,\u201d I countered. \u201cThird, Brexit \u2013 I voted Remain but I just want it done.\u201d</p> <p>I was used to Brexit objections, given my own long-standing opposition to it. Paradoxically, I benefited from Lib Dem and Tory Remainers backing me, and the Greens\u2019 generous decision not to stand, which kept the swing against me to 6.5%, lower than in neighbouring seats. But this voter was switching because she trusted the Tories on education and the NHS, even after the photo of a child with suspected pneumonia asleep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/refuses-to-look-at-picture-of-boy-forced-to-sleep-on-hospital-floor\" title=\"\">on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary</a> was in every newspaper. I knew then that we would lose. Labour, the party of the NHS, was no longer trusted with it.</p> <p>The causes of our worst defeat in 80 years are complex \u2013 and simple. A winter election that Jeremy Corbyn should never have agreed to, against the advice of his shadow cabinet and the parliamentary Labour party. In the middle of a Brexit crisis, his indecision on the biggest issue facing the country meant we lost Leave and Remain voters. His leadership ratings were abysmal. Voters didn\u2019t trust him on defence, security and the economy. They hated the party\u2019s infection by antisemitism and saw good MPs bullied out of their seats. They just didn\u2019t like him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e51599b699cc96bd48328551e2dba1cfdb59fb98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e51599b699cc96bd48328551e2dba1cfdb59fb98/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Creagh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Creagh speaking after losing her seat at the general election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When our \u201call shall have prizes\u201d manifesto was published, people asked where the money was coming from and scoffed at our nationalised broadband idea. Nostrums of the 1970s were presented as answers to the 21st-century challenges of new technology, climate change, an ageing population and the changing nature of work. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/23/labour-fifty-eight-billion-pound-pledge-women-pension-age-trap\" title=\"\">\u00a358bn for the Waspi women</a> knocked the \u201ccarefully costed\u201d mantra on the head.</p> <p>People despaired at the invidious choice before them and picked what they saw as the lesser of two evils. Thousands of party members had resigned. More have resigned since the result.</p> <p>Those failures mean a hard Brexit looms in January. Boris Johnson\u2019s promises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/20/brexit-withdrawal-bill-whats-new-and-whats-different\" title=\"\">on workers and environmental rights have gone</a>, exposed as a ruse to win power. His anarchic Vote Leave government is cracking on. A \u00a310 minimum wage will happen only \u201cif economic conditions permit\u201d. They won\u2019t. The economy will shrink and people will be poorer. Brexit threatens the union and will harm our public services. The gap between north and south, rich and poor will grow.</p> <p>So when I saw Jeremy posing for a photo with young people in parliament, I seized the moment. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/video_and_audio/headlines/50831524/mary-creagh-on-jeremy-corbyn-he-should-be-apologising\" title=\"\">In my accidental exit interview,</a> I asked why he wasn\u2019t apologising to them. Why he was still leader when his personal toxicity, organisational incompetence and political mishandling had led to the catastrophe? How did losing the election mean we won the argument?</p> <p>The answers were indifferent and infuriating. The pre-election trigger ballots to reselect Labour MPs were because he wanted more democracy in the party. The bullying? Mainstream media. Antisemitism? Did I think he wants racism in the Labour party? He was present, but not involved.</p> <p>The Labour party, formed to represent working people, cannot ignore their verdict. We have failed them for four elections in a row. The party does not have a God-given right to exist.</p> <p>Members must decide if we are to be the strong social democratic opposition our country needs, or an ideological vanity project. The next leader must speak not just to members but to voters in Wakefield and Wolverhampton. They must ignore the keyboard warriors and speak to the decent, silent majority who want a leader they can trust.</p> <p>The next leader must reaffirm Labour\u2019s progressive internationalism, kick out the antisemites, rebuild organisational competence and enforce the rules. They\u2019ll need the heart of a lion and a strong stomach for the fight. We need to detoxify and become again a principled opposition that people can trust.

      "bodyText": "David Lammy: \u201cWe need to unite the country around a vision for the UK we can all take pride in\u201d The first election I paid attention to was in 1983. In the wake of the Brixton riots, Michael Foot\u2019s commitment to tackling racial discrimination and disadvantage awakened my political consciousness. The manifesto was Labour\u2019s most radical of the century, offering increased spending for the NHS, comprehensive care for under-fives and an emergency programme for investment in housing and transport. To a boy growing up poor in Tottenham, it seemed the exact tonic our sickly country needed. After learning the result \u2013 wipeout for Labour and a majority of 144 for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservatives \u2013 I was distraught. I could not believe that, offered a hopeful vision for a fairer UK, the public had opted for more economic conservatism. In the early hours of Friday 13 December, as the Tories secured their biggest win since the Thatcher era, I recognised the same disappointment and disbelief in many of those around me. The Jeremy Corbyn I have known for decades as the MP for my neighbouring constituency is kind, compassionate and thoroughly decent. I regard him as a friend, with a wonderful track record as a constituency MP. To put it politely, these were not the qualities that came up on doorsteps as I campaigned in London, Halifax, Bury, Bolton, Cardiff, Birmingham, Watford and elsewhere. The leadership\u2019s failure to deal with the stain of antisemitism within the party stripped Labour of moral authority. Jeremy\u2019s triangulation on Brexit left Leavers thinking he was a Remainer and convinced Remainers he supported Leave. His well-reported hostility to institutions such as Nato cemented the public\u2019s distrust. It was not Jeremy\u2019s righteous belief in economic justice that lost Labour this election; it was his perceived worldview, failure of competence, and mind-boggling decision to abdicate leadership on the biggest issue of the day. For Labour to win back what were once seen as our heartlands, we need to unite the country around a vision for the UK we can all take pride in. This does not mean imitating Boris Johnson\u2019s populist, ethnic nationalism. Many people voted Tory because of a legitimate commitment to leaving the EU, or because they did not like Corbyn or what Labour was offering. But Johnson cynically scapegoated migrants during the campaign, warning that Europeans had treated the UK like \u201ctheir own\u201d country for too long. This is not the first time Johnson has attacked a minority in an attempt to win popularity. In 2018, he compared Muslim women to bankrobbers and letterboxes, which led to a surge in hate crimes. By lurching to the right, Johnson was able to make a Faustian pact and convince Nigel Farage to stand down. This helped him win, but set a very dangerous precedent. Johnson\u2019s ethnic nationalism relies on the idea of the nation as the natural home of a people whose ancestors are all from one ethnic group. History suggests that once ethnic nationalism is introduced into a nation\u2019s politics it is difficult to remove and even more difficult to control. Once one group is defined as \u201cthe people\u201d, the next step is often to classify the excluded as second-class citizens. This is hardly a route back to national unity. A new tribalism has gripped the UK. However, recent surveys show that on the most fundamental issues \u2013 climate change, equal pay and the right of women to have careers, faith in science and scientists, the NHS \u2013 we are not divided. On these issues our collective views are converging, and even heading towards a consensus. We need a politics that reflects that. The alternative to Johnson\u2019s ethnic nationalism that Labour should offer is a civic nationalism. Rather than basing national pride on biological heritage, skin colour or religion, civic nationalism says we can unite around shared values and institutions. To foster this, we need new spaces and places in which the UK\u2019s diverse peoples can engage with each other and belong. Why don\u2019t we start by creating a citizens\u2019 assembly to begin deciding the basis for a new British bill of rights and a codified constitution? Next, who is up for scrapping our unfair voting system and replacing it with something proportional to encourage a new politics of compromise? Then, why not trial a form of universal basic income \u2013 call it the citizens\u2019 fund \u2013 so that all people have the capacity and capital to come together in social clubs, sports teams and other parts of civic life? More controversially, could compulsory national civic service \u2013 compelling young people from all regions, ethnicities and social classes to mix \u2013 remind us what we have in common? Labour will win back the country only if we show the public that we love the UK, too, and are positive about what we have achieved together, and optimistic about the inclusive, multicultural, dynamic society we want to build. The difference is that our national pride manifests itself in hope, rather than fear. While Johnson pulls the country back towards a nostalgic version of Little England, Labour must own the future of a reinvigorated UK. As for which Labour figure I believe is best-placed to lead this hopeful vision, I will consider that over Christmas. David Lammy is the MP for Tottenham in London Mary Creagh: \u201cI asked Corbyn why he is still leader given how toxic he is\u201d \u201cCan I ask why you\u2019re voting Conservative this time?\u201d I asked the woman \u2013 who voted Labour in 2017 \u2013 smiling at me from the doorway of her home, beautifully decorated for Christmas. \u201cNot at all,\u201d she beamed. \u201cFirst, education\u2026\u201d \u201cCut by \u00a369m, in real terms, in Wakefield since 2015,\u201d I interjected. \u201cSecond, the NHS,\u201d she continued. \u201cSuffering the longest funding squeeze in its history,\u201d I countered. \u201cThird, Brexit \u2013 I voted Remain but I just want it done.\u201d I was used to Brexit objections, given my own long-standing opposition to it. Paradoxically, I benefited from Lib Dem and Tory Remainers backing me, and the Greens\u2019 generous decision not to stand, which kept the swing against me to 6.5%, lower than in neighbouring seats. But this voter was switching because she trusted the Tories on education and the NHS, even after the photo of a child with suspected pneumonia asleep on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary was in every newspaper. I knew then that we would lose. Labour, the party of the NHS, was no longer trusted with it. The causes of our worst defeat in 80 years are complex \u2013 and simple. A winter election that Jeremy Corbyn should never have agreed to, against the advice of his shadow cabinet and the parliamentary Labour party. In the middle of a Brexit crisis, his indecision on the biggest issue facing the country meant we lost Leave and Remain voters. His leadership ratings were abysmal. Voters didn\u2019t trust him on defence, security and the economy. They hated the party\u2019s infection by antisemitism and saw good MPs bullied out of their seats. They just didn\u2019t like him. When our \u201call shall have prizes\u201d manifesto was published, people asked where the money was coming from and scoffed at our nationalised broadband idea. Nostrums of the 1970s were presented as answers to the 21st-century challenges of new technology, climate change, an ageing population and the changing nature of work. The \u00a358bn for the Waspi women knocked the \u201ccarefully costed\u201d mantra on the head. People despaired at the invidious choice before them and picked what they saw as the lesser of two evils. Thousands of party members had resigned. More have resigned since the result. Those failures mean a hard Brexit looms in January. Boris Johnson\u2019s promises on workers and environmental rights have gone, exposed as a ruse to win power. His anarchic Vote Leave government is cracking on. A \u00a310 minimum wage will happen only \u201cif economic conditions permit\u201d. They won\u2019t. The economy will shrink and people will be poorer. Brexit threatens the union and will harm our public services. The gap between north and south, rich and poor will grow. So when I saw Jeremy posing for a photo with young people in parliament, I seized the moment. In my accidental exit interview, I asked why he wasn\u2019t apologising to them. Why he was still leader when his personal toxicity, organisational incompetence and political mishandling had led to the catastrophe? How did losing the election mean we won the argument? The answers were indifferent and infuriating. The pre-election trigger ballots to reselect Labour MPs were because he wanted more democracy in the party. The bullying? Mainstream media. Antisemitism? Did I think he wants racism in the Labour party? He was present, but not involved. The Labour party, formed to represent working people, cannot ignore their verdict. We have failed them for four elections in a row. The party does not have a God-given right to exist. Members must decide if we are to be the strong social democratic opposition our country needs, or an ideological vanity project. The next leader must speak not just to members but to voters in Wakefield and Wolverhampton. They must ignore the keyboard warriors and speak to the decent, silent majority who want a leader they can trust. The next leader must reaffirm Labour\u2019s progressive internationalism, kick out the antisemites, rebuild organisational competence and enforce the rules. They\u2019ll need the heart of a lion and a strong stomach for the fight. We need to detoxify and become again a principled opposition that people can trust. We need a courageous, credible, clever and competent person to reshape our movement. Observer readers should join us and help get it right this time. Mary Creagh was MP for Wakefield from 2005 to 2019 Jon Trickett: \u201cWe need radicalism, social justice and national renewal\u201d The Johnson government is clearly resolved to use the power of the state in order to drive through a rightwing shift. Our task is both to oppose Johnson but also to advocate the renewal of the country in a way which unites, rather than divides, and which offers a new economy, social justice and democratic reform.

A sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo has been incubating from as far back as the 2005 election. It is most deeply rooted in those areas which have suffered most from recent economic changes and which are geographically peripheral to the metropolitan growth nodes of the new economy. Too many people in too many communities experience a loss of agency; the power to control their own lives, to make a difference, and to have a voice which can make itself heard.

It explains the Brexit slogan of \u201ctake back control\u201d. Of course, these working-class communities will not recover any control with a Tory government. Sadly the Remainer contingents failed to understand the emotional sense evoked by the offer of restored national sovereignty. Instead they sought to overturn the referendum in an apparent further twist of the knife by a social group which had never seemed to listen to or understood the \u201cheld back\u201d regions.

The legislation, passed last week with a majority of 124, jettisons a commitment in EU regulations that secures safeguards for asylum-seeking minors in Europe who want to reunite with family in the UK.</p> <p>The commitment was in the original withdrawal agreement bill after a campaign led by Labour peer Lord Dubs, who fled the Nazis via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/06/the-kindertransport-children-80-years-on-we-thought-we-were-going-on-an-adventure\" title=\"\">Kindertransport</a> when he was six.</p> <p>Last night Dubs said: \u201cIt\u2019s miserable. Safe Passage have found quite a few local authorities that are willing to take children. We\u2019re talking about a basic principle here. It\u2019s extremely mean and lacking in humanitarian instincts for the government to keep pulling back on this.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office on Saturday night disputed the figure of 1,400 council placements waiting to be filled.</p> <p>Hours earlier, charities in northern France said they had found a 15-year-old Afghan boy called Mustapha who is sleeping rough near Calais and trying to reach England to be reunited with his brother.</p> <p>Campaigners said the prime minister\u2019s bill threatened the teenager\u2019s hopes of reaching the UK via a safe legal route. \u201cThese kids are in a desperate situation and they\u2019ve got no way out,\u201d said Dubs.</p> <p>Labour leadership hopeful Lisa Nandy said Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill was a taste of things to come. \u201cThis is a very clear signal of what sort of government Boris Johnson intends to run. It\u2019s a direct attack on some of the most vulnerable children in the world and it shows that any hint of compassionate conservatism will play no part in his premiership. This approach will extend to welfare, disability and we\u2019ll see the most rightwing government in my lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>Beth Gardiner-Smith, chief executive of Safe Passage, said the Brexit bill \u201cplaced vulnerable child refugees on the negotiating table\u201d and meant more lone children would be forced to take huge risks trying to get into the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThis action is all the more inexplicable because we know there is broad public support for helping child refugees,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Gardiner-Smith added: \u201cInstead of scrapping what few protections there are in place, the government should be focusing its energies on working with councils to ensure there is adequate funding to fill those 1,400 places and offer hope to hundreds of children stranded across Europe.\u201d</p> <p>The pledges have been made by councils under the Home Office\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-scheme-launched-to-resettle-children-at-risk\" title=\"\">Vulnerable Children\u2019s Resettlement Scheme</a> (VCRS) on the proviso that full funding is in place, with a common complaint being that the central government money available is insufficient.</p> <p>The only available data indicates that just 20 unaccompanied minors have been allowed into the UK under a scheme begun more than three years ago to resettle 3,000 vulnerable refugee children from conflict zones in the Middle East and north Africa.</p> <p>Separate figures also reveal a sluggish take-up under the Dubs amendment, launched in April 2016 and geared to allowing unaccompanied child refugees from Europe into the UK. MPs and campaigners hoped the Dubs scheme would resettle around 3,000 children but ministers controversially set a limit of 480 with the Home Office yesterday not specifying how many have since been transferred.</p> <p>\u201cIt was limited because they said councils hadn\u2019t find more places but since then Safe Passage has discovered there are quite a few local authorities who\u2019ve come up with more places. The government is trying to shut down the scheme on spurious grounds,\u201d said Dubs.</p> <p>Charities said they had detected a hardening of the Home Office approach to child refugees even before the bill was unveiled.</p> <p>Clare Moseley, founder of <a href=\"https://care4calais.org/\" title=\"\">Care4Calais</a>, said: \u201cIt\u2019s become absolutely horrible, I do not understand how it can be this hostile, how our country can behave like this, how they keep saying no to this.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/18/europe-humanitarian-crisis-brussels-refugees\">Europe is home to a grave humanitarian crisis \u2013 but Brussels looks the other way | Damian Boeselager</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Campaigners say the issue partly explains why the numbers of vulnerable minors brought to the UK are so low despite so many council places being available.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a proud record of helping vulnerable children, granting protection to 41,000 since 2010 and doing more than the vast majority of EU countries to help unaccompanied minors.</p> <p>\u201cProtecting vulnerable children will remain our priority after Brexit and this new clause reaffirms our commitment while clarifying the role of parliament and government in negotiations.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Home Office has been accused of ignoring more than 1,400 offers from local councils to house child refugees, prompting criticism that Boris Johnson\u2019s government is defying its obligations to offer sanctuary to vulnerable minors. Councils across the UK have volunteered to take hundreds of unaccompanied children from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. However, numbers of arrivals are said to be \u201cpitifully low to nonexistent\u201d. Wiltshire, Leicestershire, Brighton and Hove, along with the London boroughs of Islington, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Lewisham have each pledged to take at least 100 children, according to charity Safe Passage. Birmingham has offered to support 80 more minors, Bristol 60 and Leicester 50. More than 400 of the offers come from Conservative-run local authorities, 950 from Labour councils and the remainder from SNP and independents. It is estimated that about 200 child refugees are living in terrible conditions in northern France, with thousands more trapped in Italy and Greece, where camps are vastly overcrowded and conditions are described as dire. Many are eligible for transfer to the UK. The claims of Home Office resistance to the councils\u2019 offers comes after Johnson told parliament on Thursday he was reducing legal protections for refugee children in his new Brexit bill. The legislation, passed last week with a majority of 124, jettisons a commitment in EU regulations that secures safeguards for asylum-seeking minors in Europe who want to reunite with family in the UK. The commitment was in the original withdrawal agreement bill after a campaign led by Labour peer Lord Dubs, who fled the Nazis via Kindertransport when he was six. Last night Dubs said: \u201cIt\u2019s miserable. Safe Passage have found quite a few local authorities that are willing to take children. We\u2019re talking about a basic principle here. It\u2019s extremely mean and lacking in humanitarian instincts for the government to keep pulling back on this.\u201d The Home Office on Saturday night disputed the figure of 1,400 council placements waiting to be filled. Hours earlier, charities in northern France said they had found a 15-year-old Afghan boy called Mustapha who is sleeping rough near Calais and trying to reach England to be reunited with his brother. Campaigners said the prime minister\u2019s bill threatened the teenager\u2019s hopes of reaching the UK via a safe legal route. \u201cThese kids are in a desperate situation and they\u2019ve got no way out,\u201d said Dubs. Labour leadership hopeful Lisa Nandy said Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill was a taste of things to come. \u201cThis is a very clear signal of what sort of government Boris Johnson intends to run. It\u2019s a direct attack on some of the most vulnerable children in the world and it shows that any hint of compassionate conservatism will play no part in his premiership. This approach will extend to welfare, disability and we\u2019ll see the most rightwing government in my lifetime.\u201d Beth Gardiner-Smith, chief executive of Safe Passage, said the Brexit bill \u201cplaced vulnerable child refugees on the negotiating table\u201d and meant more lone children would be forced to take huge risks trying to get into the UK. \u201cThis action is all the more inexplicable because we know there is broad public support for helping child refugees,\u201d she said. Gardiner-Smith added: \u201cInstead of scrapping what few protections there are in place, the government should be focusing its energies on working with councils to ensure there is adequate funding to fill those 1,400 places and offer hope to hundreds of children stranded across Europe.\u201d The pledges have been made by councils under the Home Office\u2019s Vulnerable Children\u2019s Resettlement Scheme (VCRS) on the proviso that full funding is in place, with a common complaint being that the central government money available is insufficient. The only available data indicates that just 20 unaccompanied minors have been allowed into the UK under a scheme begun more than three years ago to resettle 3,000 vulnerable refugee children from conflict zones in the Middle East and north Africa. Separate figures also reveal a sluggish take-up under the Dubs amendment, launched in April 2016 and geared to allowing unaccompanied child refugees from Europe into the UK. MPs and campaigners hoped the Dubs scheme would resettle around 3,000 children but ministers controversially set a limit of 480 with the Home Office yesterday not specifying how many have since been transferred. \u201cIt was limited because they said councils hadn\u2019t find more places but since then Safe Passage has discovered there are quite a few local authorities who\u2019ve come up with more places. The government is trying to shut down the scheme on spurious grounds,\u201d said Dubs. Charities said they had detected a hardening of the Home Office approach to child refugees even before the bill was unveiled. Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said: \u201cIt\u2019s become absolutely horrible, I do not understand how it can be this hostile, how our country can behave like this, how they keep saying no to this.\u201d Campaigners say the issue partly explains why the numbers of vulnerable minors brought to the UK are so low despite so many council places being available. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a proud record of helping vulnerable children, granting protection to 41,000 since 2010 and doing more than the vast majority of EU countries to help unaccompanied minors. \u201cProtecting vulnerable children will remain our priority after Brexit and this new clause reaffirms our commitment while clarifying the role of parliament and government in negotiations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "For once, Labour has been quick off the mark. It is only 10 days since the party lost a fourth consecutive general election and it is already preparing for its next defeat. Despite the obvious truth that Jeremy Corbyn must take the blame for the worst result in almost 100 years, Rebecca Long Bailey, his anointed successor, is the favourite to succeed him as party leader. Her election would be the public statement that Corbyn has gone but Corbynism lives on. Labour supporters, who want to win the next election, should not despair. The party\u2019s future success, perhaps even its survival, depends on the genuine democratic socialists in the parliamentary party seizing control of the political agenda. The elevation of Long Bailey would provide an early opportunity to demonstrate that they mean business. The cause would be best served by an outright refusal to accept the imposition of a leader who does not command their confidence. A formal protest with a recorded vote would be almost as effective. Emboldened, they must then insist that the shadow cabinet is, once again, elected \u2013 giving its members an independent authority that they would not possess as the leader\u2019s nominees. With their status restored, they would be free to challenge the strategy and tactics of both the leader and the advisers who, with Corbyn, must take some of the blame for the bloodbath of \u201cblack Thursday\u201d and are, even now, arranging to remain surrogate leaders in the new regime. Labour MPs are notorious for their reluctance to fight the ideological battle for democratic socialism. The common response to the complaint that they have watched, but not opposed, the triumphant progress of the far left is the claim that at least they \u201cstayed and fought\u201d. More often than not, they stayed without fighting. If they fight now they will, of course, be accused of splitting the party. In truth they will be preventing, or at worst postponing, the real split that is bound to follow a further drift to the unelectable left. The second accusation will be the creation of a \u201cparty within a party\u201d. A distinct and separate party of the far left has been a cuckoo in Labour\u2019s nest ever since Ed Miliband\u2019s invention of cut-price membership. Men and women who had spent long, dark nights outside Labour meetings hawking revolutionary newspapers came in from the cold \u2013 bringing their sectarian intolerance with them. They became the pathfinders for the most extensive and, it must be admitted, most successful takeover bid in Labour history. At its heart was Momentum, which began life under the guise of Corbyn\u2019s Praetorian Guard but swiftly evolved into a vehicle for moving the party to what turned out to be the unelectable left. Momentum infiltrated constituency parties, enrolled enough delegates to successive annual conferences to gain a stranglehold on party policy, took effective control of Labour\u2019s national executive committee and attempted \u2013 with a measure of success \u2013 to \u201cdeselect\u201d Labour MPs who did not share its prejudices. Momentum found natural allies in recent conversions from Marxist and Trotskyite factions who, encouraged by the hope of colonising a real and functioning political party, suddenly saw the light. Compared with Momentum, the Militant tendency \u2013 which attempted to subvert Labour in the 1980s \u2013 was a ragbag of second-rate conspirators who took corrupt control of Liverpool but were only an irritant in other parts of the country. No Militant sympathisers were employed in the Labour party headquarters or in its regional offices, and no major trade union leader supported Militant\u2019s aims. Now full-time officials openly boast of their Momentum membership. Militant remained an obscure sect. Thanks in part to Momentum, the Corbyn project was endorsed by thousands of good democratic socialists. The radical rhetoric obscured the fatal flaws of Corbyn\u2019s philosophy \u2013 the blanket opposition to private enterprise, the support for any tinpot dictator who called himself a socialist, the intolerance of disagreement, the failure to cleanse Labour of antisemitism which proved that, although he hated racial prejudice, there were some racial prejudices that he did not hate enough. There is no doubt that there is still an army of Labour party members who cannot bring themselves to believe that the Corbyn project was destined to end in disaster. They have to be persuaded that Corbyn\u2019s way could only ever lead to the disappointment of defeat and the betrayal of the millions of families who need a Labour government. No doubt Momentum\u2019s leaders are still rejoicing about the control they achieved over the party machine. The celebrations are not being replicated in the food bank queues that, following Labour\u2019s defeat, will only lengthen.

      "body": "<p>Along the docks in Havana, the streets are quiet. Where thousands of people disembarked from cruise ships on a daily basis, the port now lies empty. A quick stroll away, in the Almacenes de San Jos\u00e9 crafts market, Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez watches a handful of tourists browsing the aisles of this vast restored 19th-century warehouse, hoping they will pause at her stall. For the past nine years, she has been selling a range of goods: decorative plates, coffee mugs, vintage car magnets and Che Guevara keyrings. She welcomed the influx of people from the United States after the \u201cnormalisation\u201d of relations with Cuba <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/17/cubans-havana-welcome-surprise-castro-obama\" title=\"\">in December 2014</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWithout doubt, when the cruise ships were here, it was much better,\u201d she said. Now, after further tightening of US sanctions against Cuba under the Trump administration, she has only seen one ship in the past month. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just the tourists in the cruise ships, independent travellers also came,\u201d she said, and now there are fewer of them as well. The future is uncertain, she admits, but she\u2019s hopeful that she\u2019ll see the visitors from the US again.</p> <p>Hern\u00e1ndez may remain optimistic, but this year has been a troubled one for Cuba, as the island was further sucked into the whirlwind policy-making of the Trump administration, causing increased economic troubles throughout 2019. Perhaps the tornado <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/havana-rare-tornado-rips-through-cuban-capital\" title=\"\">that touched down in Havana in January</a> should have been taken as a portent of things to come.</p> <p>Despite these problems, it has also been a year of landmarks: the Cuban revolution <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-01-01/cubas-castro-blasts-united-states-on-60th-anniversary-of-revolution\" title=\"\">reached its 60th anniversary</a>, and the island\u2019s capital was spruced up for its 500th birthday party in November, which included the first-ever state visit from the Spanish royal family.</p> <p>Garlanded with Christmas decorations, the city looks festive. Potholed streets have been repaved, and dilapidated buildings have been renovated. The bustling shopping district by Calle Galiano <a href=\"http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2019/10/31/constelaciones-de-planetario-iluminan-la-calle-habanera-galiano-galeria/\" title=\"\">was lit up with an extensive light installation</a>, and luxury hotels continued to open. Not all of the work was completed in time for the anniversary celebrations, but the remaining scaffolding gives a sense that Habana Vieja is undergoing an extensive facelift. Yet beneath the scrubbed-up surface, people in the city and across the island are bracing themselves for an indeterminate period in an economic limbo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b5f61ede131b14c2fc0c541f27967fa81239237b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5f61ede131b14c2fc0c541f27967fa81239237b/0_268_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cubans await the arrival of a cruise ship bringing tourists to Havana in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cubans await the arrival of a cruise ship bringing tourists to Havana in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adalberto Roque/AFP /Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most recent blow to the island, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/trump-cuba-travel-sanctions/\" title=\"\">announced in October</a>, was the stopping of commercial flights between the US and the regional cities of Cuba from early December. Last April the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/us-imposes-new-cuba-travel-restrictions-including-ban-on-cruises\" title=\"\">rolled back</a> its \u201c\u2018people-to-people\u201d educational travel permits and prohibited cruise ships from calling into the island. These measures further deflated tourism after a surge that saw some 1.5 million people coming from the US, including Cuban-Americans visiting family, in 2017, driving overall numbers to 4.7 million visitors. However, after a year of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the numbers began to decline, and in 2019 tourist numbers have only just reached 4 million.</p> <p>Marta Rodr\u00edguez, who runs a <em>casa particular</em> (B&amp;B) in the Vedado neighbourhood of Havana, emphatically shakes her head of grey hair and gives an exaggerated \u201cthumbs down\u201d when asked about this year. She has lived in her second-floor flat for more than 30 years and has been renting out a room since 1999.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/cuba-update/giv-3902O8otCqVUn7B6\" data-alt=\"Cuba map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/cuba-update/giv-3902O8otCqVUn7B6\">Cuba map</a> </figure>  <p>She charges \u00a315-\u00a319 a night, but she also has to pay a monthly tax of \u00a326, whether or not there have been any guests. In addition, she cares for her husband, who has Alzheimer\u2019s. He receives a pension of 300 pesos (around \u00a38.50) a month, so the business has been a lifeline for them. Over the past few years she welcomed plenty of visitors from the US. \u201cWe were happy up to a certain point with Obama,\u201d she said, but noted that some Cubans were worried that the new relationship wouldn\u2019t last \u2013 and it didn\u2019t. With Trump, Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s situation has worsened. \u201cEvery day he [Trump] squeezes a little more. It is much more difficult to get things. Everything has been complicated.\u201d</p> <p>Although many tourists come through Havana, the entire island will feel the pain of these recent measures. The ending of regional flights will force Cuban-Americans visiting family, and independent travellers, to drive or take coaches to places such as Santiago de Cuba, the island\u2019s second city, some 12 hours from the capital \u2013 or they will simply decide not to go. The island\u2019s regional cities had shared in the tourism boom \u2013 Santiago de Cuba had become a stop on cruise ship itineraries, while on the opposite side of the island, Vi\u00f1ales transformed itself from a sleepy town to a gastronomic destination. Now these developments are also under threat.</p> <p>In addition, the economy has suffered from Venezuela\u2019s reduced oil production and tightened sanctions, in part as punishment for Cuba\u2019s support of the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. By the autumn this caused <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-fuel-explainer-idUSKBN1W91C3\" title=\"\">long waits at the fuel pumps.</a> Prices overall have risen, and people are complaining of shortages of foods including chicken and coffee. Rodr\u00edguez claims her outgoings have more than quadrupled, explaining that a bit of ham that cost around 50p last year, is now \u00a34.55. The government gave state employees and pensioners, some 2.75 million people, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/latamcaribbean/2019/08/28/raising-wages-in-cubas-budgeted-state-sector-is-risky-but-necessary/\" title=\"\">a pay rise this year</a>, but the cost of goods is eating away at modest increases, and price controls have been implemented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"930f09f0029b9d462e37335d25cc441dcb33289f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/930f09f0029b9d462e37335d25cc441dcb33289f/0_174_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Havana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A queue outside a Havana shop which only accepts US dollars for its products.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These problems are further exacerbated by the two-currency system. Cubans in the state sector are paid in Cuban pesos (CUP) while tourists and people working in the private sector use the convertible peso (CUC), which is pegged to the US dollar that it was meant to replace nearly two decades ago, with one CUC worth 24 CUP. The end of the CUC appears to be a step closer, as the government announced some initial reforms, including the banning of use of CUC at Cuba\u2019s airports. Once the CUC is gone, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy-idUSKBN1Y61Q8\" title=\"\">the island would use CUP and US dollars</a>. In the meantime, there will be less money to change, as the measures introduced in April also <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article229341009.html\" title=\"\">curbed the remittances people in the US can send to Cuba,</a> from an unlimited amount to $1,000 per person, every three months.</p> <p>All of this amounts to a huge challenge for Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, who succeeded Ra\u00fal Castro as president in April 2018. Despite his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DiazCanel\" title=\"\">attempts to communicate with the public,</a> \u2013 even going so far as to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBgGSQ6IrLY\" title=\"\">appear on the current affairs television programme</a> <em>Mesa Redonda</em> (Roundtable) in September to discuss the economic situation \u2013there is a sense that the president has not clearly articulated the country\u2019s direction through these problems. \u201cRight now they seem to be responding and maybe that\u2019s all one can expect them to do,\u201d says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MJ_Busta\" title=\"\">Michael Bustamante</a>, assistant professor of Latin American history at Florida International University in Miami.</p> <p>While this period seems to indicate that the reforms that started under Ra\u00fal Castro are over, it is not a return to the \u201cspecial period\u201d the island suffered after the end of the Soviet Union. \u201cWhile certainly a shock to the system and a grave one at that, this is not of the same kind of scale,\u201d says Bustamante. \u201cCuba today has investment partners elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Hopes that the Trump administration would not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/20/havana-cuba-raul-castro-barack-obama-us-relations\" title=\"\">undo the Obama normalisation</a> were misplaced. \u201cThe [US-Cuba] relationship has really been torn to threads,\u201d says Bustamante. Trump\u2019s real concern is south Florida. Although Cuban-Americans there have a wide range of views about US policy toward the island, according to Bustamante, the Republicans have calculated that the support of the hardliners will be enough to deliver the votes they need to win this key state in the 2020 presidential election, and so \u201cit stands to reason that we haven\u2019t seen the last of the escalatory measures as November 2020 approaches\u201d.</p> <p>Although times are tough, to Rodr\u00edguez, they are not as bad as the 1990s. \u201cPreviously, it was very hard. There was nothing,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut now other countries want to trade with Cuba.\u201d She remains hopeful that tourism will pick up \u2013 she has a few bookings from French visitors for December, though there is nothing lined up beyond that. \u201cThere are much fewer guests than before, but I have enough to sustain myself. I have nothing else. This is what I have to live.\u201d</p> <p><em>Names of Cubans have been changed to protect their identity</em></p> <p><em>Carrie Gibson is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/el-norte-9781611856330.html\" title=\"\">El Norte: The Epic and Forgotten Story of Hispanic North America</a></em></p>",

Garlanded with Christmas decorations, the city looks festive. Potholed streets have been repaved, and dilapidated buildings have been renovated. The bustling shopping district by Calle Galiano was lit up with an extensive light installation, and luxury hotels continued to open. Not all of the work was completed in time for the anniversary celebrations, but the remaining scaffolding gives a sense that Habana Vieja is undergoing an extensive facelift. Yet beneath the scrubbed-up surface, people in the city and across the island are bracing themselves for an indeterminate period in an economic limbo. The most recent blow to the island, announced in October, was the stopping of commercial flights between the US and the regional cities of Cuba from early December. Last April the US rolled back its \u201c\u2018people-to-people\u201d educational travel permits and prohibited cruise ships from calling into the island. These measures further deflated tourism after a surge that saw some 1.5 million people coming from the US, including Cuban-Americans visiting family, in 2017, driving overall numbers to 4.7 million visitors. However, after a year of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the numbers began to decline, and in 2019 tourist numbers have only just reached 4 million. Marta Rodr\u00edguez, who runs a casa particular (B&amp;B) in the Vedado neighbourhood of Havana, emphatically shakes her head of grey hair and gives an exaggerated \u201cthumbs down\u201d when asked about this year. She has lived in her second-floor flat for more than 30 years and has been renting out a room since 1999. She charges \u00a315-\u00a319 a night, but she also has to pay a monthly tax of \u00a326, whether or not there have been any guests. In addition, she cares for her husband, who has Alzheimer\u2019s. He receives a pension of 300 pesos (around \u00a38.50) a month, so the business has been a lifeline for them. Over the past few years she welcomed plenty of visitors from the US. \u201cWe were happy up to a certain point with Obama,\u201d she said, but noted that some Cubans were worried that the new relationship wouldn\u2019t last \u2013 and it didn\u2019t. With Trump, Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s situation has worsened. \u201cEvery day he [Trump] squeezes a little more. It is much more difficult to get things. Everything has been complicated.\u201d Although many tourists come through Havana, the entire island will feel the pain of these recent measures. The ending of regional flights will force Cuban-Americans visiting family, and independent travellers, to drive or take coaches to places such as Santiago de Cuba, the island\u2019s second city, some 12 hours from the capital \u2013 or they will simply decide not to go. The island\u2019s regional cities had shared in the tourism boom \u2013 Santiago de Cuba had become a stop on cruise ship itineraries, while on the opposite side of the island, Vi\u00f1ales transformed itself from a sleepy town to a gastronomic destination. Now these developments are also under threat. In addition, the economy has suffered from Venezuela\u2019s reduced oil production and tightened sanctions, in part as punishment for Cuba\u2019s support of the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. By the autumn this caused long waits at the fuel pumps. Prices overall have risen, and people are complaining of shortages of foods including chicken and coffee. Rodr\u00edguez claims her outgoings have more than quadrupled, explaining that a bit of ham that cost around 50p last year, is now \u00a34.55. The government gave state employees and pensioners, some 2.75 million people, a pay rise this year, but the cost of goods is eating away at modest increases, and price controls have been implemented. These problems are further exacerbated by the two-currency system. Cubans in the state sector are paid in Cuban pesos (CUP) while tourists and people working in the private sector use the convertible peso (CUC), which is pegged to the US dollar that it was meant to replace nearly two decades ago, with one CUC worth 24 CUP. The end of the CUC appears to be a step closer, as the government announced some initial reforms, including the banning of use of CUC at Cuba\u2019s airports. Once the CUC is gone, the island would use CUP and US dollars. In the meantime, there will be less money to change, as the measures introduced in April also curbed the remittances people in the US can send to Cuba, from an unlimited amount to $1,000 per person, every three months. All of this amounts to a huge challenge for Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, who succeeded Ra\u00fal Castro as president in April 2018. Despite his attempts to communicate with the public, \u2013 even going so far as to appear on the current affairs television programme Mesa Redonda (Roundtable) in September to discuss the economic situation \u2013there is a sense that the president has not clearly articulated the country\u2019s direction through these problems. \u201cRight now they seem to be responding and maybe that\u2019s all one can expect them to do,\u201d says Michael Bustamante, assistant professor of Latin American history at Florida International University in Miami. While this period seems to indicate that the reforms that started under Ra\u00fal Castro are over, it is not a return to the \u201cspecial period\u201d the island suffered after the end of the Soviet Union. \u201cWhile certainly a shock to the system and a grave one at that, this is not of the same kind of scale,\u201d says Bustamante. \u201cCuba today has investment partners elsewhere.\u201d Hopes that the Trump administration would not undo the Obama normalisation were misplaced. \u201cThe [US-Cuba] relationship has really been torn to threads,\u201d says Bustamante. Trump\u2019s real concern is south Florida. Although Cuban-Americans there have a wide range of views about US policy toward the island, according to Bustamante, the Republicans have calculated that the support of the hardliners will be enough to deliver the votes they need to win this key state in the 2020 presidential election, and so \u201cit stands to reason that we haven\u2019t seen the last of the escalatory measures as November 2020 approaches\u201d. Although times are tough, to Rodr\u00edguez, they are not as bad as the 1990s. \u201cPreviously, it was very hard. There was nothing,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut now other countries want to trade with Cuba.\u201d She remains hopeful that tourism will pick up \u2013 she has a few bookings from French visitors for December, though there is nothing lined up beyond that. \u201cThere are much fewer guests than before, but I have enough to sustain myself. I have nothing else. This is what I have to live.\u201d Names of Cubans have been changed to protect their identity Carrie Gibson is the author of El Norte: The Epic and Forgotten Story of Hispanic North America",

Behind him, Joe Gomez produced his best display of the season and a key role in a crucial clean sheet.</p> \n<p>Normal time ended in bewildering fashion when the Qatari referee, Abdulrahman al-Jassim, awarded Liverpool a stoppage-time penalty for a foul by Rafinha on Sadio Man\u00e9 as he shaped to shoot. VAR showed Man\u00e9 had been clipped a fraction outside the penalty area and, following a lengthy review by the on-field referee, the penalty and the booking for Rafinha were overturned. Man\u00e9 may have shot before contact was made but that did not explain the drop ball that followed from the referee.

The noise from them was incessant, although all that really mattered to the European champions was Virgil van Dijk being present to hear it. The commanding central defender was back in the side having missed the semi-final through illness. His first touch sent the ball quick and high over the top of the Flamengo defence. It was no accident. Liverpool were clearly under instruction to exploit their opponents\u2019 high defensive line at every opportunity and should have punished it twice inside the opening five minutes. Firmino, however, squandered a clear opportunity when sent clean through by Trent Alexander-Arnold and Naby Ke\u00efta did likewise when teed up by Mohamed Salah.</p> \n<p>When Alexander-Arnold flashed a low drive just wide of Diego Alves\u2019s goal from over 25 yards seconds later it seemed only a question of time before Liverpool\u2019s commanding opening paid dividends. It was a false dawn. Flamengo always looked dangerous given the quality of Bruno Henrique, \u00c9verton Ribeiro and the prolific marksman Gabriel Barbosa but were contained in the opening exchanges by the relentless pressing of Liverpool\u2019s midfield three. Gradually, however, they began to turn the tide, with Gerson and Willian Ar\u00e3o increasingly influential in midfield. Klopp\u2019s visible anger on the sidelines was not solely the result of al-Jassim\u2019s erratic refereeing. The Liverpool manager\u2019s sprint down the tunnel as soon as the half-time whistle blew was a clear sign of irritation with his team too.</p> \n<p>Liverpool\u2019s frustration had mounted as the first half progressed. Salah copped an earful from his manager for squandering a glorious chance to punish Flamengo on the counterattack. They were refused a clear free-kick on the edge of the penalty area when Ke\u00efta played a one-two with Salah and was taken out by Filipe Lu\u00eds and Man\u00e9, uncharacteristically quiet until late in the game, was booked after tangling with Rafinha.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dec65702ba4b125e42caf8980eac42c2e6cefd24\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dec65702ba4b125e42caf8980eac42c2e6cefd24/0_85_4778_2866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberto Firmino celebrates his winner against Flamengo by taking off his shirt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Firmino was booked for his goal celebrations.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noushad Thekkayil/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The second half opened with a flurry of chances and a repeat for Firmino. Collecting Henderson\u2019s chip forward the striker flicked the ball over the head of Rodrigo Caio and steered a half-volley beyond Alves. It would have been a beautiful goal but Firmino\u2019s shot struck the inside of a post and rolled across the goal to safety. Salah went close with an improvised touch on Alexander-Arnold\u2019s driven cross into the area before Flamengo responded strongly. Alisson produced a superb save when Ribeiro created a first chance of the night for Barbosa. His powerful shot was destined for a bottom corner until Alisson\u2019s strong right hand tipped the ball wide.</p> \n<p>Alisson thwarted Barbosa again when the Brazil forward executed a spectacular overhead kick but Liverpool finished stronger and, in extra time, Flamengo\u2019s 79th game of 2019 caught up with them. The decisive moment was created by Henderson\u2019s superb ball through the heart of the Brazilian defence to Man\u00e9. He squared for the unmarked Firmino, who cut back inside Caio and Alves before beating Rafinha\u2019s despairing dive on the line with a cool finish. The booking he received for removing his shirt in celebration was worth it. \u201cBlessed\u201d read the tattoo across the goalscorer\u2019s chest. Liverpool know exactly how that feels.</p>",

Flamengo had their chances too but, before being punished by one Brazil international in Firmino, they were thwarted by another in the imposing form of Alisson in Liverpool\u2019s goal. The Club World Cup was decided not only by Brazilians, however. Jordan Henderson was outstanding in Liverpool\u2019s midfield and supplied the cutting pass that led to Firmino\u2019s winner. Behind him, Joe Gomez produced his best display of the season and a key role in a crucial clean sheet. Normal time ended in bewildering fashion when the Qatari referee, Abdulrahman al-Jassim, awarded Liverpool a stoppage-time penalty for a foul by Rafinha on Sadio Man\u00e9 as he shaped to shoot. VAR showed Man\u00e9 had been clipped a fraction outside the penalty area and, following a lengthy review by the on-field referee, the penalty and the booking for Rafinha were overturned. Man\u00e9 may have shot before contact was made but that did not explain the drop ball that followed from the referee. Flamengo were unable to make the most of the reprieve, although the substitute Lincoln missed a fine chance to equalise in the final seconds of extra time. Liverpool knew what they were up against from the moment they emerged for their warm-up to piercing whistles from the estimated 15,000 Flamengo fans who had travelled. The noise from them was incessant, although all that really mattered to the European champions was Virgil van Dijk being present to hear it. The commanding central defender was back in the side having missed the semi-final through illness. His first touch sent the ball quick and high over the top of the Flamengo defence. It was no accident. Liverpool were clearly under instruction to exploit their opponents\u2019 high defensive line at every opportunity and should have punished it twice inside the opening five minutes. Firmino, however, squandered a clear opportunity when sent clean through by Trent Alexander-Arnold and Naby Ke\u00efta did likewise when teed up by Mohamed Salah. When Alexander-Arnold flashed a low drive just wide of Diego Alves\u2019s goal from over 25 yards seconds later it seemed only a question of time before Liverpool\u2019s commanding opening paid dividends. It was a false dawn. Flamengo always looked dangerous given the quality of Bruno Henrique, \u00c9verton Ribeiro and the prolific marksman Gabriel Barbosa but were contained in the opening exchanges by the relentless pressing of Liverpool\u2019s midfield three. Gradually, however, they began to turn the tide, with Gerson and Willian Ar\u00e3o increasingly influential in midfield. Klopp\u2019s visible anger on the sidelines was not solely the result of al-Jassim\u2019s erratic refereeing. The Liverpool manager\u2019s sprint down the tunnel as soon as the half-time whistle blew was a clear sign of irritation with his team too. Liverpool\u2019s frustration had mounted as the first half progressed. Salah copped an earful from his manager for squandering a glorious chance to punish Flamengo on the counterattack. They were refused a clear free-kick on the edge of the penalty area when Ke\u00efta played a one-two with Salah and was taken out by Filipe Lu\u00eds and Man\u00e9, uncharacteristically quiet until late in the game, was booked after tangling with Rafinha. The second half opened with a flurry of chances and a repeat for Firmino. Collecting Henderson\u2019s chip forward the striker flicked the ball over the head of Rodrigo Caio and steered a half-volley beyond Alves. It would have been a beautiful goal but Firmino\u2019s shot struck the inside of a post and rolled across the goal to safety. Salah went close with an improvised touch on Alexander-Arnold\u2019s driven cross into the area before Flamengo responded strongly. Alisson produced a superb save when Ribeiro created a first chance of the night for Barbosa. His powerful shot was destined for a bottom corner until Alisson\u2019s strong right hand tipped the ball wide. Alisson thwarted Barbosa again when the Brazil forward executed a spectacular overhead kick but Liverpool finished stronger and, in extra time, Flamengo\u2019s 79th game of 2019 caught up with them. The decisive moment was created by Henderson\u2019s superb ball through the heart of the Brazilian defence to Man\u00e9. He squared for the unmarked Firmino, who cut back inside Caio and Alves before beating Rafinha\u2019s despairing dive on the line with a cool finish. The booking he received for removing his shirt in celebration was worth it. \u201cBlessed\u201d read the tattoo across the goalscorer\u2019s chest. Liverpool know exactly how that feels.",

      "body": "<p>When Jos\u00e9 Mourinho arrived at Tottenham a month ago, his side trailed Chelsea by 12 points. Six league matches later, Spurs will go above Frank Lampard\u2019s side if they beat them at home on Sunday. The turnaround has been remarkable, not only in the way Spurs seem to have rediscovered their edge but in the withering of Chelsea. From apparently clear skies a crisis is approaching and the next two months feel critical for Lampard\u2019s managerial future.</p> <p>Nobody at Stamford Bridge is grumbling too much yet. Lampard, as one of the club\u2019s greatest heroes, was always going to be indulged more than some grumpy Italian in an ill-fitting tracksuit who chewed cigarette butts on the touchline. He has promoted youth and while, as Mourinho observed on the opening weekend, that can be a handy means of lowering expectations, it has also produced some thrilling football.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/chelsea-spurs-frank-lampard-jose-mourinho-bond-players\">I aspire to bond with players like Jos\u00e9 Mourinho does, says Frank Lampard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The transfer ban also contributed to the sense that this was somehow not quite a real season, a practice run for everyone. While his time at Derby suggests Lampard would have had faith in youth anyway, it offered a ready-made excuse. He lost Eden Hazard and let David Luiz and Gary Cahill go in the summer and was not able to replace them (albeit the deal for Christian Pulisic had already been agreed); he was operating under an obvious handicap. That restriction, though, has now been lifted, and there is ambitious talk of \u00a3150m to spend. This, suddenly, is real.</p> <p>There remains a profound will for Lampard to succeed. The crowd and the board will be inclined to patience. But as the season draws on, people may begin to remember that Maurizio Sarri, for all he was portrayed as a misfit, did lead Chelsea to the Europa League, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/24/chelsea-manchester-city-carabao-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">League Cup final</a> and third place in the Premier League. The squad Lampard inherited was not some ragtag bunch of no-hopers.</p> <p>This sudden dip in results is alarming, although it is probably no more reflective of Chelsea\u2019s wellbeing than the run of seven straight wins (in all competitions) through September and October. One type of failing, though, has remained consistent, and it was true also of Lampard\u2019s Derby. According to Opta, in terms of proportion of shots conceded, Derby were the second-most vulnerable side to the rapid counter in the Championship last season.</p> <p>This season, Chelsea are the fourth-most vulnerable Premier League side to the rapid counter (Manchester City are, by 0.002%, the third-most vulnerable, which is both unexpected and highly telling of the difficulties they have had with their gegenpressing this season).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92f1604467239b0f4ff3190262d59c90ab28543c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92f1604467239b0f4ff3190262d59c90ab28543c/0_31_2545_1527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"N\u2019Golo Kante (right) has largely papered over the cracks for Chelsea this season but hasn\u2019t been at his best lately.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">N\u2019Golo Kante (right) has largely papered over the cracks for Chelsea this season but hasn\u2019t been at his best lately.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chloe Knott - Danehouse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That could be a particular problem on Sunday given only Leicester have scored more goals on the counter than Spurs in the Premier League this season, while the three players who have blossomed since Mourinho\u2019s arrival \u2013 Dele Alli, Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min \u2013 all relish driving through space where an opposing midfield should be.</p> <p>Chelsea\u2019s susceptibility in that regard was apparent on the opening weekend at Old Trafford, when they were probably the better side against Manchester United in terms of general play, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/11/manchester-city-chelsa-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">yet lost 4-0</a>, shredded by United\u2019s rapid counters.</p> <p>If there has been an improvement since then it has been largely down to N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, whose positional sense and prodigious energy mean he can paper over at least some of the structural defects. After four years of supreme consistency, though, he has not quite been at his extraordinary best in recent weeks \u2013 which may or may not be related to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/27/ngolo-kante-denies-report-he-was-threatened-gun-row-agents\" title=\"\">continuing legal battle in France with one of his former representatives</a>.</p> <p>But it is not just counterattacks that are of concern: Chelsea are also unusually exposed at set plays. The proportion of the shots they concede from set plays is 14% higher than the average for the league as a whole (the proportion of the shots they concede from rapid counters is 26% higher than the league average).</p> <p>It is possible, of course, that Chelsea are exceptionally good at defending from open play. More likely, though, is that they fall down at the two aspects of defending that require rigorous organisation and regular drilling.</p> <p>That is a particularly galling fault, because it means Chelsea will often not get the results the rest of their game deserves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/tottenham-chelsea-match-preview-premier-league\">Tottenham v Chelsea: match preview</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much of their attacking play this season has been joyous \u2013 so good, in fact, that even with 31 goals from 17 games, they are underperfoming their expected goals by four. But that is undermined by leaking soft goals. It undid them most obviously at United, but also at City when they bossed periods of the game, and also at home to Valencia in the Champions League when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/17/chelsea-valencia-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">they lost 1-0</a> in a game in which the away side barely offered a threat.</p> <p>Perhaps that is no more than you would expect from a relatively inexperienced young manager, but the worry must be how closely the flaw correlates with the player Lampard was. It is true that an array of managers, from George Graham to Kenny Dalglish, John Beck to Valeriy Lobanovskyi, became successful by rejecting the players they had been. Lampard must be aware of the problem \u2013 indeed, it may be that Chelsea\u2019s recent loss of fluency (four goals from their last five games after 27 in 12) stems from an attempt to tackle it \u2013 but then everybody was aware of the Gerrard-Lampard conundrum, the inability of two of the best midfielders of their generation to play together, and nobody was able to solve it.</p> <p>Identifying problems of organisation is easy; actually being able to do the organising is what sets managers such as J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola above the rest \u2013 and even the latter is having problems this season.</p> <p>And that is why the next few weeks feel so vital. Assuming there are new signings, one of the mitigating factors will be gone, but it doesn\u2019t really matter who Chelsea sign if they remain so exposed to counterattacks and at set plays. For Lampard, the honeymoon is drawing to a close. This is when we find out how good a manager he really is.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Jos\u00e9 Mourinho arrived at Tottenham a month ago, his side trailed Chelsea by 12 points. Six league matches later, Spurs will go above Frank Lampard\u2019s side if they beat them at home on Sunday. The turnaround has been remarkable, not only in the way Spurs seem to have rediscovered their edge but in the withering of Chelsea. From apparently clear skies a crisis is approaching and the next two months feel critical for Lampard\u2019s managerial future. Nobody at Stamford Bridge is grumbling too much yet. Lampard, as one of the club\u2019s greatest heroes, was always going to be indulged more than some grumpy Italian in an ill-fitting tracksuit who chewed cigarette butts on the touchline. He has promoted youth and while, as Mourinho observed on the opening weekend, that can be a handy means of lowering expectations, it has also produced some thrilling football. The transfer ban also contributed to the sense that this was somehow not quite a real season, a practice run for everyone. While his time at Derby suggests Lampard would have had faith in youth anyway, it offered a ready-made excuse. He lost Eden Hazard and let David Luiz and Gary Cahill go in the summer and was not able to replace them (albeit the deal for Christian Pulisic had already been agreed); he was operating under an obvious handicap. That restriction, though, has now been lifted, and there is ambitious talk of \u00a3150m to spend. This, suddenly, is real. There remains a profound will for Lampard to succeed. The crowd and the board will be inclined to patience. But as the season draws on, people may begin to remember that Maurizio Sarri, for all he was portrayed as a misfit, did lead Chelsea to the Europa League, the League Cup final and third place in the Premier League. The squad Lampard inherited was not some ragtag bunch of no-hopers. This sudden dip in results is alarming, although it is probably no more reflective of Chelsea\u2019s wellbeing than the run of seven straight wins (in all competitions) through September and October. One type of failing, though, has remained consistent, and it was true also of Lampard\u2019s Derby. According to Opta, in terms of proportion of shots conceded, Derby were the second-most vulnerable side to the rapid counter in the Championship last season. This season, Chelsea are the fourth-most vulnerable Premier League side to the rapid counter (Manchester City are, by 0.002%, the third-most vulnerable, which is both unexpected and highly telling of the difficulties they have had with their gegenpressing this season). That could be a particular problem on Sunday given only Leicester have scored more goals on the counter than Spurs in the Premier League this season, while the three players who have blossomed since Mourinho\u2019s arrival \u2013 Dele Alli, Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min \u2013 all relish driving through space where an opposing midfield should be. Chelsea\u2019s susceptibility in that regard was apparent on the opening weekend at Old Trafford, when they were probably the better side against Manchester United in terms of general play, yet lost 4-0, shredded by United\u2019s rapid counters. If there has been an improvement since then it has been largely down to N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, whose positional sense and prodigious energy mean he can paper over at least some of the structural defects. After four years of supreme consistency, though, he has not quite been at his extraordinary best in recent weeks \u2013 which may or may not be related to a continuing legal battle in France with one of his former representatives. But it is not just counterattacks that are of concern: Chelsea are also unusually exposed at set plays. The proportion of the shots they concede from set plays is 14% higher than the average for the league as a whole (the proportion of the shots they concede from rapid counters is 26% higher than the league average). It is possible, of course, that Chelsea are exceptionally good at defending from open play. More likely, though, is that they fall down at the two aspects of defending that require rigorous organisation and regular drilling. That is a particularly galling fault, because it means Chelsea will often not get the results the rest of their game deserves. Much of their attacking play this season has been joyous \u2013 so good, in fact, that even with 31 goals from 17 games, they are underperfoming their expected goals by four. But that is undermined by leaking soft goals. It undid them most obviously at United, but also at City when they bossed periods of the game, and also at home to Valencia in the Champions League when they lost 1-0 in a game in which the away side barely offered a threat. Perhaps that is no more than you would expect from a relatively inexperienced young manager, but the worry must be how closely the flaw correlates with the player Lampard was. It is true that an array of managers, from George Graham to Kenny Dalglish, John Beck to Valeriy Lobanovskyi, became successful by rejecting the players they had been. Lampard must be aware of the problem \u2013 indeed, it may be that Chelsea\u2019s recent loss of fluency (four goals from their last five games after 27 in 12) stems from an attempt to tackle it \u2013 but then everybody was aware of the Gerrard-Lampard conundrum, the inability of two of the best midfielders of their generation to play together, and nobody was able to solve it. Identifying problems of organisation is easy; actually being able to do the organising is what sets managers such as J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola above the rest \u2013 and even the latter is having problems this season. And that is why the next few weeks feel so vital. Assuming there are new signings, one of the mitigating factors will be gone, but it doesn\u2019t really matter who Chelsea sign if they remain so exposed to counterattacks and at set plays. For Lampard, the honeymoon is drawing to a close. This is when we find out how good a manager he really is.",

They might fall a little short of Liverpool but they could easily best Manchester City, which is no small feat considering what is at their disposal.</p> <p>Guardiola will be hoping the club can put down a marker against Leicester, to show they are the superior side. When Leicester City won the league, it was the game at the Etihad that showed they had the true potential to see off all challengers, easily winning 3-1. Now they will be hoping they can repeat the trick. </p> <p>Should be a ruddy cracker!</p> <p><strong>Kick-off is 5.30pm (GMT).</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining me. Have a great Christmas! Here is Jamie Jackson\u2019s report ... Rodgers on the performance: In particular, in the first half we weren\u2019t good at all. I think it shows how good my group of players have done. It was a really good lesson for us tonight, for our young players. There are no complaints in terms of the result. It shows, for this young group, there is still a long way to go.\u201d On defensive performance: \u201cI thought Ben [Chilwell] had done really really well this evening. You also have to respect it\u2019s a big level of opponent. You see De Bruyne and the level he is at and it\u2019s a world class level.\u201d On penalty: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it again, to be honest.\u201d Kevin De Bruyne on going off: \u201cJust a little bit of cramp, it was a hard game. In the end my body said to take a rest.\u201d On the team performance: \u201cI think defensively, yes. I think there was a lot of pressure early on. They went 1-0 ahead but I think it was their only chance of the game.\u201d On Mahrez: \u201cOne against one, Riyad is one of the most dangerous wingers in the league.\u201d Riyad Mahrez on playing Leicester: \u201cI think it was a bit strange at the beginning. I think we played very good, they scored during our best moment but we came back.\u201d On Arteta: \u201cIt was difficult obviously because Mikel was an important member of staff in the club. He has taken his chance and we\u2019re happy for him.\u201d Mary Waltz is brining statistical complexities at this late hour: \u201cI am a math failure but Mr. Rice may want to factor in the ratio of fouls to possession.\u201d Liverpool are currently playing extra time in Doha, which is good news for Leicester. Even with the win, Manchester City are still a point behind Leicester but they will be looking to make overtaken them in the next few weeks. The Foxes face Liverpool on Boxing Day ... Steve Rice brings accurate stats: \u201cEach side has committed a similar number but of all the emails you have received you print the three promulgating the notion that only City foul.\u201d People see what they want to see. Mahrez and De Bruyne were just too good for Leicester. An incredible attacking display from two players proving that the hosts are still the most likely to challenge Liverpool for the title. Leicester just could not cope and a number of individuals had poor, which ensured they would never get anything out of the game despite Vardy giving them the lead. 90+2 mins: Carragher gives De Bruyne man of the match as he is replaced by Aguero. I might have given it to Mahrez for a change. They have both been excellent today. 90 mins: De Bruyne tries to take apart Leicester again but it ends with him going down with cramp. Four minutes added on. 89 mins: Is there a better midfielder in the world right now than De Bruyne? I am going to argue not. Phil Foden is coming on for Sterling. 87 mins: Leicester send a ball over the top for old times\u2019 sake but it has too much on it and Ederson comes out to collect off Praet\u2019s toe. 85 mins: Lots of passing side to side here now. More as we get it. 83 mins: City are keeping the ball here. It is all very easy and Leicester are looking pretty demoralised by it. 81 mins: Mahrez does too much on this occasion. He gets into the box and drops a shoulder to send the entire defence the wrong way but then takes another touch and shots rather than set up teammates in better positions. Jesus then chases the ball to the byline, whacks a cross which Schmeichel clears with his feet. 79 mins: Gundogan is having a sit down and is looking to be heading off. Rodri is coming on. Mary Waltz says: \u201cKlopp must be dreading the end of 2019. How could 2020 possibly be better.\u201d 77 mins: Vardy dispossesses Fernandinho in the box, gets to the byline from where he whacks the ball straight into Otamendi\u2019s stomach and City remove the danger. Who is man of the match? Mahrez or De Bruyne? Praet is on for Tielemans. 75 mins: De Bruyne controls a vicious pass from Mendy dead and then gets it out of his feet and aims one for the top corner but Schmeichel palms it over. 73 mins: Is it time to see Aguero? Give him a few minutes to get in the mood for a busy festive period. City have had 18 shots compared to Leicester\u2019s five which sums up the match. I suspect the passing stats are also laughable in City\u2019s favour. Gundogan plays in Mahrez, who smacks a shot from the edge of the area which hits Soyuncu right in the old crown jewels. He did not enjoy that. 71 mins: Gundogan goes into the book for a late challenge on Vardy. I am not sure it was worth but he did it anyway. What a player De Bruyne is! He flies past Soyuncu once again, gets into the box and picks out Jesus at the back post where he slides to divert the ball into the back of the net for his first home goal since January. 67 mins: Almost game over as Mendy gets in round the back, flashes a cross into the box which Mahrez runs onto and slaps a shot towards the corner but Schmeichel is equal to it and it lands safely with a defender who clears. I would argue he is doing his best to make a save and that it\u2019s pretty harsh to limit his ability to do so but I see your point. 65 mins: Mahrez is scaring the hell out of Chilwell every time he gets hold of the ball. This time he gets beyond the left-back but Ndidi is backing him up and dispossesses the Algerian. 63 mins: Barnes will be replaced by Albrighton, it would seem. 61 mins: Vardy collects the ball on the right wing, he waits a second and whips in a very dangerous cross into the corridor of uncertainty but Barnes can\u2019t get enough on it at the back post. Ederson also flies out and takes down Barnes, who gets injured in the process and he\u2019s heading off. 59 mins: It\u2019s Mahrez again causing trouble. Mendy pulls the ball back to De Bruyne who flicks it into the Algerian\u2019s path, he positions himself to get on top of a bouncing ball but fires it wide. Mike Dean is in charge! De Bruyne does well to charge down Soyuncu, drive into the box with the ball and then cut it back for Jesus but the referee blows up for something or nothing. De Bruyne gets very angry and Magic Mike plucks out a yellow card. 57 mins: Chilwell is having a bad game, it has to be said. Walker catches him out as he tries to let the ball dribble out of play, the City defender sends in a cross, there is an appeal for handball in the box which Leicester survive, before they belatedly clear the ball. It\u2019s a Christmas miracle! 55 mins: Sterling catches the Leicester defence off-guard by cutting in from the left, everyone thinks he\u2019s going to shoot but instead lays it into the path of Mahrez who hits a shot first time but makes a poor connection and it trickles to Schmeichel. 53 mins: De Bruyne whips in the free-kick from the right but the flag goes up for offside against Otamendi, which is pretty incompetent of him. 51 mins: I feel like the crowd have travelled to the Christmas markets in Manchester City and had a few mulled wines and are now very sleepy. Ndidi tries to wake them up by cynically taking down De Bruyne on the left flank and is subsequently booked for his illegal work. 49 mins: It is not as relentless as the opening 45 minutes as both teams try and play their way into the second half. 47 mins: A relatively quiet start the the second half but not much has changed. City are getting on the ball and Leicester are struggling to get forward. Here we go again! Geoff Wignall brings stats: \u201cMan City 1st half: 73% possession and still managed to commit 57% of the fouls. How very Pep.\u201d Morgan Dodd offers: \u201cMary is right [18.24]. BR took what he inherited (great talent, no doubt) and improved it. Neither Pep nor Klopp can say that\u2014both bought a lot. And Man City is currently a team based most around possession for possession sake and tactical fouling. How is that good for the game? Credit to BR and Klopp that they do not have such black marks at the moment.\u201d Gavin Coyle emails in: \u201cWith all this hysteria against Manchester City\u2019s fouls that are apparently a crime against humanity, can I congratulate Leicester for fouling the right way, almost Corinthian.\u201d Can Leicester change much? They just unable to cope with a team playing this well at such a high tempo. I think they just need to be more proactive in getting the ball back to whack towards Vardy. Mary Waltz says: \u201cRodgers has done a fantastic job with Leiceister and deserves kudos. But you know he bristles at not being included in the Klopp vs. Pep debates.\u201d Mac Millings has done this: To celebrate the festive season, I\u2019ve made you and your readers a little song... You know Basham and Ansu And Draxler, Eriksen, Koman and Kewell, Maradona, Lee Dixon; But Stuart McCall the most famous reindeer Fitz Hall? Mou-dolph and Harry Kanedeer Had a Dele Alli, Rose,Kant\u00e9, Firmino, San\u00e9 Hughes, Wijnaldum, Salah (Mo) Oliver Kahn, Der Kaiser, Eustace, Pfaff and Collins (James) They never let poor Mou-dolph Jonny, Nani, David James Juanfran, Oggy, Tiss, Nasri Sancho, Ke\u00efta, Shay , Mou-dolph, Withe, Sarr, Jones, Mark Bright Wanchope, Divock, Leighton, Wright. Stam, Dahlberg, Reina, Lovren, Juande Ramos, Sammy Lee, Mou-dolph and Harry Kanedeer Dunga, Downing, Summerbee! Eamonn Harrigan has an opinion I do not agree with: \u201cNo way is that a pen. The Man City player trod on Ricardo and fell over. VAR is a joke.\u201d I have really enjoyed that half. It\u2019s been played at a fantastic tempo and City are playing some excellent stuff while also looking in permanent jeopardy whenever the ball goes near Vardy. Mahrez has been the standout player so far against his former club. 45 mins: This has been an excellent half of football from the hosts. Leicester have done well to cope with them as well as they have, as City have not reached this level for a while. I would argue they are playing better than they did against Arsenal. Two minutes added on. An email from Colin Young: \u201cI agree City are notorious for deliberate fouls; they clearly have permission from Pep to, umm, \u2018Pepetrate\u2019 one deliberate foul per player. \u201cAgainst Arsenal last week, they were by far the better team but really took liberties with the rules of the game. I think Pep should be taken to task over this.\u201d A fine tactic: The German steps up and calmly places it to Schmeichel\u2019s left. It was perfectly sent into the corner with great pace. 42 mins: PENALTY TO MAN CITY! Sterling dribbles into the box, runs at Pereira who has slipped and then brings down Sterling in the process. It goes to VAR, who agree with Dean. 40 mins: De Bruyne lifts the ball over the top, which Sterling reaches but his control takes him away from goal and his pullback goes nowhere near a man in blue. City break on Leicester and the ball ends up with De Bruyne 25 yards from goal, he gets it out of his feet and whacks a fearsome shot which Schmeichel parries clear. Guardiola is hugging Rodgers on the touchline, in a manner I would describe as aggressive. The sort of thing the bloke from uni you hate would do. 38 mins: City are playing some excellent stuff, switching the play at ease and knocking it around at speed when they need to. City are really on top here but need a couple more considering how bad their defence is. 36 mins: De Bruyne does Soyuncu good and proper by flicking the ball around the Turkish defender and sprinting past him, forcing the Leicester player to drag him down just outside the area. Mahrez curls a powerful shot towards the top corner but it goes just wide. As Mary Waltz points out: \u201cVideo game football. What a treat!\u201d 34 mins: Mike Dean is doing his best to ensure one of the most exciting games you will see is slowed down at every possible opportunity. 32 mins: Guardiola is on the sidelines trying to whip up the City fans into a fury. It\u2019s not exactly church-like at the Etihad but the atmosphere could be better. The Algerian has been City\u2019s best player by a mile today and he once again cuts in from the right before firing a low shot at goal which deflects off Soyuncu, wrong-footing Schmeichel in the process, forcing the Dane watch it trickle into the goal. 28 mins: The hosts are playing pretty ruddy well and Mahrez flashes a dangerous cross along the six-yard box but there is no one there in blue to turn it home. Vardy almost makes it 2-0. A long pass is sent to him to race onto, he dribbles into the box, sells Otamendi a dummy and then gets enough room to fire a shot from a tight angle but it ends up going over. City really need a better plan than this to stop Vardy. 26 mins: Leicester clear a corner back out to De Bruyne who curls a cross to Sterling who sidefoots a volley at goal but Schmeichel stands up and repels it with his feet. 24 mins: Manchester City have been pretty dominant here and could have been ahead themselves but their deep flaws have cost them once again. It will not come as a surprise to many to learn that Manchester City cannot cope with Vardy. Barnes gets the ball on the halfway, whips a pass with the outside of his foot round Fernandinho which Vardy gets onto and the sprints away from the Brazilian before dinking the ball over Ederson. 20 mins: Tielemans launches the ball over the top for Vardy to latch onto, he takes it into the box and then pulls one back for Barnes to attack but it\u2019s too heavy for his teammate and City take control of the situation. Mike A emails to say: \u201cCan I complain about a tactical foul by Man. City even though one has yet to occur? Just wanted to be first in line.\u201d Complaining is one of life\u2019s great joys. 18 mins: Almost the opener from Jesus. Mahrez once again gets the better of Chilwell by sending him the wrong way, allowing the Algerian to reach the byline from where he jabs it back to Jesus who toe pokes the ball towards goal only to see Schmeichel push out a hand to stop the shot. A cross is then sent back into the box but Jesus\u2019 header does not worry Schmeichel as he easily gathers it. 16 mins: Mahrez is looking very lively. He does a few stepovers before firing a shot at goal but it hits a defender and kindly bounces into Schmeichel\u2019s arms. Mary Waltz is right: \u201cI know you are on pins and needles waiting for the Dean auto-biography like the rest of us.\u201d 14 mins: Mahrez whips in a corner, which makes its way out to Sterling at the back post. He wins the ball back, sends it to Mendy to lift in a deep cross, which Mahrez controls, allowing him to lay it off to De Bruyne who whacks a low shot against the outside of the post from the edge of the area. 12 mins: City are forced back by Leicester but they will not mind, as long as they\u2019re in position they will be happy. They build up slowly, until Mahrez cuts into the box and whacks a shot at goal but it\u2019s blocked. There are a couple of shouts for handball but it is certainly not a penalty. 10 mins: De Bruyne perfectly controls a pass from Mendy, gets it out of his feet and slips the ball through to Sterling who darts beyond Evans, but the defender recovers well and dispossess the forward just before he had the chance to shoot. City are pressing high, ensuring Leicester cannot play out from the back. 8 mins: Mahrez clips Maddison, who knew what he was doing when he took his first touch and waited for the contact. Both teams are looking pretty bright, as Walker and Chilwell dive into a 50:50, which the City man just about wins. Mike Dean makes Leicester take a throw-in again because he is Mike Dean. 6 mins: Ndidi looks to be sticking very close to De Bruyne when City are in possession. The Belgian is the man to stop and Ndidi is certainly a man who can stop him. 4 mins: Gundogan launches a first-time shot from around 35 yards out but it almost ends up in the second tier. Leicester are looking to sending early balls over the top and turn City. 2 mins: Evans launches a long ball down the pitch which goes straight out for a goal kick. Things can only get better. In other news, Bernardo seems to be playing pretty deep in the centre of midfield. Things get pretty frantic in the Leicester box after Mahrez gets round the back but they recover to just about remove the danger. Peep! Peep! Peep! Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! The teams are funnelling out onto the pitch. The home mascots are wearing blue Santa hats, which seems a little cruel. Mainly as one of them is bigger than Bernardo Silva. Would any of the City defence get into the Leicester team currently? I would argue not, which is a sign of how good the Foxes have recruited. Walker is probably the best of the the City back four but Pereira edges him in that position on current form. I don\u2019t even see there being a debate with the other three positions. Will this change today? Matt Dony, I assume a Liverpool fan, says: \u201cAt the start of the season, I could not have imagined that I would have been happy to see City win today. What a strange season.\u201d Has anyone purchased any decent football-related Christmas presents? I\u2019ve purchased some football-themed cushions. Sky have just reminded us of Kompany\u2019s winner in this fixture last season and now I need a little lie down. What a strike that was! I was basically sat right here for that one, too. It\u2019s a shame there is no more Kompany at City. Mary Waltz emails to say: \u201cShould be a great fixture. Elimination match for who gets to finish second to Liverpool. Also interesting is the ego contest between Pep and Brog.\u201d Jamie Redknapp describes the City midfield selection as \u201cbrave\u201d, which is not a great endorsement. I am also suspicious of whether Fernandinho and Otamendi can cope with Vardy\u2019s pace. Would it have been an idea to play Walker as a centre-back today? Guardiola is showing a bit more faith in Mendy now, mainly as he seems to have realised that Angelino isn\u2019t good enough. Now it\u2019s up to the Frenchman to find some form after a very inconsistent/underwhelming spell. The absolute lads. Who will finish second? Does anyone really care anymore? Leicester\u2019s squad is actually strong enough to keep them there but if City get back to full strength and find another centre-back in January, then they will become favourites to earn silver medals in May. I will be endeavouring to avoid all Christmas puns if I can help it. Naturally, some will slip out because I have been bombarded with festive adverts and haven\u2019t walked down a street without lights shaped like a tree for two months. IT\u2019S CHRISSSSSSTMAAAAAAAS! The midfield battle looks very interesting with City\u2019s Gundogan, De Bruyne, Bernardo up against Ndidi, Tielemans, Maddison. The game will be won and lost there and I am slightly suspicious the hosts might struggle to contain the Foxes. Aguero returns to the bench for Manchester City, while Gundogan is the main man in midfielder, with Rodri starting on the bench. Leicester bring in Barnes and Ayoze Perez for the match. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Fernandinho, Otamendi, Mendy, Gundogan, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Mahrez, Sterling, Jesus Subs: Bravo, Aguero, Zinchenko, Rodri, Cancelo, Foden, Garcia Leicester: Schmeichel, Chilwell, Ricardo, Evans, Soyuncu, Ndidi, Tielemans, Maddison, Perez, Barnes, Vardy. Subs: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Gray, Albrighton, Iheanacho, Praet. Good afternoon! Manchester City could have been forgiven for forgetting that there was an important Premier League game today, having spent the week in the shadow of their assistant manager. Now that Mikel Arteta\u2019s move to Arsenal has been confirmed, the focus is back on trying to finish second to Liverpool. There is a surprising challenger in the top four, coming in the form of Etihad visitors Leicester City. The Foxes sit above the hosts and even a win for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side wouldn\u2019t see them overtaken. Brendan Rodgers made the right signings and adjustments in the summer, allowing him to create a side who can cope with the rigours of a top-four battle. They might fall a little short of Liverpool but they could easily best Manchester City, which is no small feat considering what is at their disposal. Guardiola will be hoping the club can put down a marker against Leicester, to show they are the superior side. When Leicester City won the league, it was the game at the Etihad that showed they had the true potential to see off all challengers, easily winning 3-1. Now they will be hoping they can repeat the trick. Should be a ruddy cracker! Kick-off is 5.30pm (GMT).",

It has sold more print copies than any other adult title \u2013 fiction or non-fiction \u2013 in 2019, according to NPD BookScan, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/books/where-the-crawdads-sing-delia-owens.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Owens, 70, the co-author of three non-fiction books about her life as a scientist, received glowing reviews upon the novel\u2019s launch in 2018. The New York Times Book Review<em> </em>called it \u201cpainfully beautiful\u201d.</p> <p>But Crawdads, a coming-of-age story of a young woman living in the marshes of North Carolin, which involves an unexplained murder, took months to catch on.

      "bodyText": "A retired wildlife biologist who spent much of her career studying hyenas, lions and elephants in southern Africa has emerged \u2013 at the age of 70 \u2013 as one of the most successful authors of the year or any year, with her debut novel one of the sleeper hits of 2019. Delia Owens has now sold more than 4.5 million copies of her novel Where The Crawdads Sing, since it was published in August, 2018. In addition to several accolades, a book club endorsement from Reese Witherspoonhelped it blow away the competition, exceeding the combined sales of grandees Margaret Atwood, John Grisham and Stephen King this year. It has sold more print copies than any other adult title \u2013 fiction or non-fiction \u2013 in 2019, according to NPD BookScan, the New York Times reported. Owens, 70, the co-author of three non-fiction books about her life as a scientist, received glowing reviews upon the novel\u2019s launch in 2018. The New York Times Book Review called it \u201cpainfully beautiful\u201d. But Crawdads, a coming-of-age story of a young woman living in the marshes of North Carolin, which involves an unexplained murder, took months to catch on. By December last year, according to Publisher\u2019s Weekly, sales crossed just 186,000, with 39% of print sales coming from southern states. Publishers credit the endorsement of Witherspoon\u2019s Hello Sunshine book club for the delayed surge. Sales peaked in March at 75,000 copies in one week. Last week, the book landed back at No 1 on the New York Times\u2019 fiction bestseller list, a return to the top spot it previously held for 30 weeks. And now Witherspoon plans to produce and star in a feature film based on the story. Publishing experts are baffled by the scale of the book\u2019s success. A survey by the analysts Codex Group found that 55% of Crawdads readership identified as progressive; 30% as conservative; and 15% as centrists, suggesting that the story of a young woman wrestling with isolation and loneliness in lushly descriptive settings resonate beyond political boundaries and in defiance of falling sales of adult fiction. \u201cThis book has defied the new laws of gravity,\u201d Codex Group president Peter Hildick-Smith told the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s managed to hold its position in a much more consistent way than just about anything.\u201d Owens, who was born in Georgia but lives in Idaho, said her mother encouraged her to venture far into the oak forests, saying: \u201cGo way out yonder where the crawdads sing.\u201d But according to some, Crawdads has a clouded genesis. According to Slate, after spending 22 years in Africa with her husband, Mark, they were advised never to return to Zambia after they were wanted for questioning in connection with the murder of a poacher. The murder, which took place in 1995, was filmed by an ABC camera crew. Owens is not implicated, but her stepson and her husband were identified by some witnesses. The crime later became the subject of an 18,000-word story written by Jeffrey Goldberg and published in the New Yorker. Goldberg told Slate\u2019s Laura Miller he was surprised how Owens and her publishers have brushed over the episode. \u201cI got a copy of Crawdads and I have to say I found it strange and uncomfortable to be reading the story of a southern loner, a noble naturalist, who gets away with what is described as a righteously motivated murder in the remote wild,\u201d Goldberg noted. In an interview last year, Owens said she reads more non-fiction \u2013 biology and physics \u2013 than fiction. She said: \u201cThere is too much great, real science to be had. So when I read novels \u2013 to break away from the precision of science writing \u2013 I choose those with compelling story lines written descriptively.\u201d When sales surpassed a million this summer, Owens posted on her website that her connection with readers \u201chas filled my life\u201d. She said: \u201cBooksellers, giant ones and tiny ones, recommended Crawdads. And then came my readers. I treasure the connection I feel with you all. I cannot even express my gratitude, but I\u2019ll try with a simple thank you!\u201d",

The opposite emotion was about to be felt by the visitors. Sterling collected in the area and nipped inside Ricardo Pereira and was fouled. Dean pointed to the spot and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan executed the penalty expertly. The porous defence meant the hosts\u2019 best hope was to take the match to the Foxes when possible. Yet the lack of dominance that has been the tale of their season was again evident. The Manchester City of the last two campaigns have often enjoyed a clear supremacy. Not so this term and not so in this match. They were enjoying more possession but Leicester were still a threat. A scuffed Mahrez shot that dribbled to Schmeichel was indicative of one reason \u2013 slipshod finishing \u2013 why his team have not been the force they were. So too when Sterling and Jesus were each blocked off when they might have secured a third. The pattern continued: Mahrez failed to finish again, De Bruyne deliberated when he should have smashed the ball at goal and Jesus and Sterling could not close the deal. This was all nearly costly when a Vardy burst was followed with a cross that Barnes came close to finishing. Now, at last, a cutting edge was found. De Bruyne, who would hobble off in the final minute, slalomed through and delivered a ball that Jesus finished. This brought the comfort of a two-goal lead and the match was as good as over. When Vardy got in again he may not have scored but the hosts were reminded of their instability. Rodgers said: \u201cWe were disappointed first half but second half we were a bit better. We had a bit more courage to get on the ball and play.\u201d Now the Leicester manager must prepare to face Liverpool on Boxing Day at the King Power, with his team 10 points behind leaders who have a game in hand, too.",

      "bodyText": "US secretary of state Mike Pompeo on Saturday said Russia and China had blood on their hands after the two countries used a veto of a United Nations security council resolution to block cross-border aid deliveries from Turkey and Iraq to millions of Syrian civilians. \u201cThe Russian federation\u2019s and China\u2019s veto yesterday of a security council resolution that allows for humanitarian aid to reach millions of Syrians is shameful,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement. \u201cTo Russia and China, who have chosen to make a political statement by opposing this resolution, you have blood on your hands,\u201d he added. Russia, backed by China, on Friday cast its 14th UN security council veto since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011. In October, amid growing chaos in Syria, Donald Trump abruptly ordered all US troops to withdraw from the country\u2019s north to avoid a bloody conflict between Turkey and formerly US-backed Kurdish fighters. Vital cross-border aid to Syria suffered its latest threat after the UN security council was unable to overcome Russian and Chinese objections to the programme. The aid, which is sent over borders at four UN approved checkpoints and without the formal permission of the Syrian regime, is seen as critical as the humanitarian crisis in Idlib and north-east Syria continues to mount. Throughout the past fortnight, the UN security council has been considering two alternative resolutions on cross-border aid deliveries to Syria. On Friday, Russia, backed by China, cast its veto, to block cross-border aid deliveries to millions of Syrian civilians. The resolution drafted by Belgium, Kuwait and Germany would have allowed cross-border humanitarian deliveries for another year from two points in Turkey and one in Iraq. But Syrian ally Russia only wanted to approve the two Turkish crossings for six months. UN diplomats are eager to reach an agreement before Christmas, fearing it will be more difficult to solve the issue close to the deadline of 10 January since in the new year there will be a new UN security council membership. The decision to introduce cross-border aid deliveries to Syria was first made in July 2014 after the civil war made it impossible for civilians to access humanitarian aid. The assistant secretary-general of OCHA, the UN humanitarian agency, Ursula Mueller, said the humanitarian position was worse than last year, and reducing the number of crossings was not justified. She added: \u201cWithout the cross-border operation, we would see an immediate end of aid supporting millions of civilians. That would cause a rapid increase in hunger and disease, resulting in death, suffering and further displacement \u2013 including across-borders \u2013 for a vulnerable population who have already suffered unspeakable tragedy as a result of almost nine years of conflict.\u201d The UK ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, said: \u201cIf the UN does not help these communities, there is no evidence, no evidence at all to believe that the Syrian government either wants to or can or will provide that assistance.\u201d The International Rescue Committee, alongside a host of other aid agencies, has been urging the security council not to scale back on aid delivery.",

The wounded Indigenous man, Yadaka \u2013 who stumbles onto the heavily pregnant Molly\u2019s property where she is alone with her other children \u2013 is the harbinger of her identity, and party to a tender love that flourishes briefly, tragically, from their mutual loss. The novel introduces the fancy, politically progressive Englishwoman, Louisa, and husband, Nate Clintoff, who migrate for his new job keeping peace in the frontier alpine town of Everton \u2013 an unruly Deadwood-style joint of racial tension, prostitution and drunkenness. Purcell\u2019s third-person narrative is energised throughout by evocative, superbly realised first-person internal monologues by key characters, including Louisa and Nate. While Purcell says channelling Molly was second nature after the play, she found the prospect of writing Louisa daunting. \u201cI was a bit worried initially about how to give voice to Louisa ... you know, a white woman from London. I was a bit like, \u2018What\u2019s she got to say?\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBut once I got going I found it easier ... I just loved that process in terms of hearing what they all wanted to say and letting them go where they wanted to go.\u201d Another Indigenous writer, Bruce Pascoe, writes how Lawson \u201cignored Aboriginal people \u2026 one of the only times he mentioned them was to condemn them as cheats and scoundrels in The Drover\u2019s Wife\u201d. They now have their voice thanks to Leah Purcell \u2013 on stage, in the novel and, soon, on screen. \u2022 The Drover\u2019s Wife by Leah Purcell is out now through Penguin Random House",

The recent loss by Labour in the UK election has everyone scrambling to look for lessons that can be translated elsewhere such as to Australia and to the US for next year\u2019s presidential election. Mostly this involves very little logic and a lot of confirmation of previously held beliefs. For Australians looking at the ALP\u2019s loss in the 2019 election things are pretty grim, and the standard talk about needing to reconnect with the centre is thrown around pretty easily. That Bill Shorten was never actually a left-winger or ever had a reputation for being overly progressive is just dismissed with a shrug. The centre shall hold! For my part, the election only reminded me of the two rules of Australian federal elections \u2013 governments win the close ones, and when a party starts trying to make it a contest between opposing frontbenches, they are lost. Since the 1949 every time the opposition won \u2013 whether Menzies, Whitlam, Fraser, Hawke, Howard, Rudd or Abbott \u2013 they won big. Aiming to win 76 seats might seem to be the way to victory, but it never has been the case for an opposition \u2013 no opposition has ever won power with less than 54% of the seats (or at least 80 in the current parliament). If you\u2019re not hearing the words \u201cthe swing is on\u201d early in the broadcast, every time since the second world war that has meant the government has been re-elected. And if you need to give your leader cover by trying to compare ministers, you are dead because barely anyone outside their immediate family knows who the minister for health is, let alone the shadow minister. So get a leader who people like, and who has policies people like, and who is able to sell those likeable policies well. Maybe that means go for the centre; maybe that means embrace an issue which has the most passion and which gets people excited. But among the many problems for progressives is the need to also deal with the river of racism that now flows through our politics. Conservatives here and in the UK and the US have decided white nationalism is the way forward and so devoid of soul are those within the conservative side of politics in the English speaking world that for the most part they care next to nothing that such an approach has racists viewing them as the best suited to lead. For the philosophy of the conservatives is no longer of free markets or even traditional values; it is of annoying the left. Ram a bill through parliament without debate? Use parliamentary committees to pursue a fraudulent partisan campaign? Do we care that such things are contrary to all established conventions that conservatives purport to hold dear? Pfft. If it annoys the left, then go for it. Even better if it involves picking on the powerless. What this year has made clear is that there is no longer an actual political debate in this country, and barely one in the UK or US. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning This year\u2019s election was not a contest of ideas, it was a contest of the ALP\u2019s polices and the Liberal party\u2019s lies about them. Donald Trump showed that the media is helpless against a bald-faced lie proudly stated, and the Liberal party under Scott Morrison has applied the lesson so well you would almost suggest that lying was an innate ability of those within the party. Tim Wilson told the ABC that it didn\u2019t matter that the ALP did not have a policy of a death tax, it was fair game because \u201cthere are people within the party who want that policy\u201d. The conservatives have realised such lies will be spread by the media, ever worried about being balanced, where every claim, no matter how discredited, deserves some debate \u2013 even if it \u201cjust to let it be debunked\u201d. All the while on Facebook the lies are being spread, as some powerful journalists think their balance will provide any sort of counter. And so, for example, we ask not which policy will best address climate change but which will cost the most, regardless of the impact on emissions. To be honest, when you look at this year, you can understand why lying is a key part of the conservatives\u2019 armoury \u2013 it makes up for a lack of ability and achievement.

      "bodyText": "A few months ago, Russell Wantling pulled over to the side of the road near the southern Queensland town of Stanthorpe to speak to a family he saw carrying buckets of water from the town dam. Again and again, they lugged each bucketload up the dam wall and poured it into a tank strapped to the tray of an old ute. \u201cI just stopped and asked what they were doing,\u201d Wantling says. \u201cHe said to me that they had no water, he couldn\u2019t afford to buy water because he\u2019d lost his job. So I went to my wife and said \u2018we\u2019ve got to do something, this is terrible\u2019. \u201cThey talk about this Day Zero all the time, but it already is Day Zero.\u201d Wantling, a truck driver, now coordinates the handout of about 340,000litres of water a week in Queensland\u2019s granite belt region. He is one of several ordinary people trucking water to desperate and drought-ravaged parts of Queensland and New South Wales, where Day Zero has long come and gone. This is a familiar, hopeful story about the resilience of Australians and their communities, the sort condensed into our folklore at times of natural disaster and crisis. But it is also punctuated by anger and disbelief that the burden of supplying the most basic necessity to thousands of people in inland towns, on rural properties and in Indigenous communities has fallen mostly to community groups and charities. The longer they wait for rain, the more acutely people learn they cannot rely on interventions from local councils or governments. \u2018You have to swallow your pride\u2019 At the water shed run by Granite Belt Water Relief in Stanthorpe, people in old paddock bashers and newer four-wheel-drives queue for a 1,000L allocation of free water every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. Almost all come from outside town, beyond the reticulated water supply. They all tell slight variations of the same story, one after the other. The tanks are empty. No one is listening. The tanks on Amy Doherty\u2019s property have been dry since March. Until Wantling began his deliveries, she and her family were able to shower only once a week. About two months ago, she became sick and unable to work, Doherty says, as she lines up. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to come here to begin with. There was no way I could do it because I was too proud,\u201d Doherty says. \u201cI live with my mother and my two young kids and I said to my Mum, \u2018I can\u2019t do this any more. I cannot cope\u2019. \u201cWe had to have four horses put to sleep because we had no food, no water and our horses were just suffering. With less showering there were hygiene issues. It was hard. It was even hard to talk about it. But you have to swallow your pride, and that\u2019s even harder.\u201d Danny and Peta Johns and their son Balin also rely on the supply from the water shed. They have not had water in their dams for almost five months. \u201cWe moved from Victoria about five years ago and when we bought our house we were getting about 500ml of rain a year.

If it weren\u2019t people like these volunteers, then we don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do.\u201d Les Watnell says his property near Stanthorpe has had about 40mm of rainfall all year. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not working it\u2019s too expensive to get the tank filled. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to share our drinking water with our stock.

Among the more than 700 questions sent in, many focused on the consequences of the Christchurch attacks. Some asked what was being done to plug intelligence holes, while others were concerned the March attack had divided the country in a \u201cculture war\u201d that had the potential to split communities in a way that Brexit has in the UK. A large number of readers also asked questions about the housing crisis, growing inequality and child poverty in New Zealand \u2013 in particular, the crisis in social housing. The standout theme was that housing was becoming unaffordable and many wanted answers to how the government was planning to address it. As the country approaches a population of 5 million in 2020 \u2013 a milestone that many New Zealanders who responded to our callout had thought would take longer \u2013 there were a significant number of questions about what was being done to manage the growing numbers of citizens and residents. Would New Zealand change its immigration policy? Would there be any changes for international students? The environment was another major theme. Many readers asked how the prime minister intended to reduce New Zealand\u2019s carbon emissions. Others asked if Ardern thought the climate crisis had become too affiliated with left/right politics. The fractious Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu in August highlighted the emergency in the region, with small countries pleading with bigger nations such as Australia to act more aggressively on emissions. Ardern told the forum \u201cAustralia has to answer to the Pacific\u201d on climate change, saying that New Zealand was doing what it could to limit global emissions to 1.5C and expected others to do the same. Readers wanted to know how much difference New Zealand\u2019s efforts could make and how could Ardern influence other nations to follow her country\u2019s lead. Could the prime minister form/influence an alliance of smaller countries to band together to help reduce emissions? Some of the questions posed to Ardern focused on foreign influence in New Zealand. In June, Canterbury University China academic Prof Anne-Marie Brady said she was \u201cbeing watched\u201d and living in fear of Beijing. One reader asked what was being done to counter Chinese influence and should Ardern take a more principled stance towards Beijing, given the detention of 1m Uighurs and other minorities in camps in Xinjiang province? Readers also wanted to know what the government would do if re-elected to ensure a free and independent media in New Zealand and how the government intended to combat sexism in schools. But it wasn\u2019t all macro issues. One reader wanted to know something slightly more quotidian: what is the best away to cook snapper? The Guardian asked Simon Bridges to respond to readers\u2019 questions, but he declined.",

      "body": "<p>Last week 25,000 protesters gathered in Mewat, in the Indian state of Haryana, to begin the historic five-mile walk to Ghasera village. It was here, 72 years ago, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mahatma-gandhi\" title=\"\">Mahatma Gandhi</a> made the same journey during the turmoil of partition, visiting the area with the promise of a dignified life for local Muslims.</p> <p>While millions have retraced Gandhi\u2019s steps before, this time felt different. Against the backdrop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/17/the-guardian-view-on-modis-citizenship-law-dangerous-for-all\" title=\"\">a new Citizenship (Amendment) Act</a> (CAA) passed by the Indian parliament last week, which many believe is openly discriminatory against Muslims and relegates them to second-class citizens, honouring Gandhi\u2019s words of religious harmony and reconciliation felt like a powerful political statement. \u201cMewat has witnessed many protests, but this is the biggest in our life,\u201d resident Shahzad Khan told local media.</p> <p>As India <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/19/india-citizenship-law-protesters-across-country-defy-ban\" title=\"\">has </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/19/india-citizenship-law-protesters-across-country-defy-ban\" title=\"\">seen some of the biggest protests in four decades, </a>the image and legacy of Gandhi, known as the \u201cfather of India\u201d for his role in independence, has been omnipresent. Across India people have voiced fears that the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/india-to-bring-in-law-denying-citizenship-to-muslim-migrants\" title=\"\">act,</a> passed by prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s rightwing, Hindu nationalist, Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, risks destroying the secular, pluralistic India that Gandhi dedicated his life to building.</p> <p>It was no accident that on the same day that protesters marched in Mewat last week, thousands of demonstrators gathered at August Kranti Maidan in Mumbai, the spot from which Gandhi gave his famous \u201cQuit India\u201d speech to the British government in 1942.</p> <p>Among the millions who have taken to the streets defending Gandhi\u2019s inclusive vision of India has been Gandhi\u2019s great-grandson, Tushar Arun Gandhi. \u201cFor the first time in independent India,\u201d said Tushar Gandhi, \u201claws or systems are being attempted to be imposed which discriminate, which differentiate, on the basis of religion.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Today we are again fighting a battle of right against might, so it\u2019s very natural that Gandhi becomes the icon of the protest</p> <footer> <cite>Tushar Gandhi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tushar Gandhi has dedicated much of his life to his great-grandfather\u2019s legacy, establishing and running the Mahatma Gandhi Foundation in Mumbai, but he said with the passing of the new citizenship law something had shifted. \u201cEverybody has a turning point in their life. If <a href=\"https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/mk-gandhi-forcibly-removed-whites-only-train-carriage\" title=\"\">being thrown out of the train</a> was a turning point in my great-grandfather\u2019s life, I think this issue of trying to change the soul of my nation is the turning point in my life,\u201d he said. In 10 years, he added, this country \u201cwon\u2019t be India any more. It will be a fascist dictatorship.

      "bodyText": "Last week 25,000 protesters gathered in Mewat, in the Indian state of Haryana, to begin the historic five-mile walk to Ghasera village. It was here, 72 years ago, that Mahatma Gandhi made the same journey during the turmoil of partition, visiting the area with the promise of a dignified life for local Muslims. While millions have retraced Gandhi\u2019s steps before, this time felt different. Against the backdrop of a new Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) passed by the Indian parliament last week, which many believe is openly discriminatory against Muslims and relegates them to second-class citizens, honouring Gandhi\u2019s words of religious harmony and reconciliation felt like a powerful political statement. \u201cMewat has witnessed many protests, but this is the biggest in our life,\u201d resident Shahzad Khan told local media. As India has seen some of the biggest protests in four decades, the image and legacy of Gandhi, known as the \u201cfather of India\u201d for his role in independence, has been omnipresent. Across India people have voiced fears that the new act, passed by prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s rightwing, Hindu nationalist, Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, risks destroying the secular, pluralistic India that Gandhi dedicated his life to building. It was no accident that on the same day that protesters marched in Mewat last week, thousands of demonstrators gathered at August Kranti Maidan in Mumbai, the spot from which Gandhi gave his famous \u201cQuit India\u201d speech to the British government in 1942. Among the millions who have taken to the streets defending Gandhi\u2019s inclusive vision of India has been Gandhi\u2019s great-grandson, Tushar Arun Gandhi. \u201cFor the first time in independent India,\u201d said Tushar Gandhi, \u201claws or systems are being attempted to be imposed which discriminate, which differentiate, on the basis of religion.\u201d Tushar Gandhi has dedicated much of his life to his great-grandfather\u2019s legacy, establishing and running the Mahatma Gandhi Foundation in Mumbai, but he said with the passing of the new citizenship law something had shifted. \u201cEverybody has a turning point in their life. If being thrown out of the train was a turning point in my great-grandfather\u2019s life, I think this issue of trying to change the soul of my nation is the turning point in my life,\u201d he said. In 10 years, he added, this country \u201cwon\u2019t be India any more. It will be a fascist dictatorship. And, mind you, it will be a dictatorship using democratic process, and that is even more dangerous\u201d. Under the new legislation all Hindu, Christian, Jain, Buddhist and Sikh migrants who arrived from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan before 2014 will be allowed to claim Indian citizenship. However, the same will not apply for Muslim immigrants. In conjunction with a planned initiative by the BJP government to begin a national register of citizens (NRC), where every person in India will have to present paperwork to prove their Indian lineage, the new act means that it is only Muslims in India who face the possibility of being defined as \u201cinfiltrators\u201d, to either be deported or put into detention centres being built across the country. Tushar spoke of his pride at seeing Gandhi\u2019s image being brandished as thousands of protesters defied the bans on public gatherings by the authorities and turned out on to the streets in a wave of peaceful mass civil disobedience reminiscent of Gandhi\u2019s movement 90 years ago. \u201cJust think of the far-sightedness of that man in 1930,\u201d said Tushar. \u201cWhen he was asked to send out a message to mankind, he wrote, \u2018I want world sympathy in this battle of right against might,\u2019 and today we are again fighting a battle of right against might, so it\u2019s very natural that he becomes the icon of the protest.\u201d He was also adamant that the effects of the citizenship act would be felt far beyond India\u2019s borders. \u201cThere should be a debate on the ramifications of [the CAA] internationally,\u201d says Tushar. \u201cIt concerns every democracy and it concerns everybody who believes in inclusivity and in the liberal ideology.\u201d While Modi has often described himself as a follower of Gandhi, Tushar said that this was meaningless in the face of the Hindu nationalist agenda being pushed by Modi\u2019s BJP government, which aims to irreparably fracture the country down religious lines. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you profess, but what you practise that makes the world realise who you follow,\u201d he said of Modi. Over a week since the passing of the citizenship act, the protests in India have showed no sign of abating and indeed have gathered even more momentum over the weekend. Like so many, Tushar Gandhi said he would keep turning out on the streets to fight for an India where religion did not determine your status as a citizen. \u201cWe will have to keep up the momentum, we will actually have to increase the intensity of the protests if we are to bring this government to its knees,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you must remember this is an arrogant government. It is not going to come to its knees that easily.\u201d While the authorities are increasingly meeting the protests with suppression and violence, with the death toll from the demonstrations reaching 17 by Saturday, Tushar said it was more important than ever that Gandhi\u2019s legacy remain at the heart of the protests. \u201cA long-drawn-out agitation can only be sustained if it is peaceful and non-violent,\u201d he said.",

A beloved husband, dad and grandad, and a kind, gentle and private man, we are devastated by his loss but so very proud of all that he achieved and comforted by the many happy memories we shared. We will be making no further comment and kindly ask that the privacy of our family is respected at this extremely difficult time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Described by his England manager, Alf Ramsey, as being \u201c10 years ahead of his time,\u201d the East London-born Peters came through the ranks at West Ham. He made his debut in 1962 and won the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup with the club before moving to Tottenham in 1970 for a then British record fee of \u00a3200,000. Jimmy Greaves went in the other direction as part of the deal.</p> \n<p>Further trophies followed at Spurs, with Peters winning the League Cup twice and then the Uefa Cup in an all-English final against Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1972.</p> \n<p>His England career stretched across eight years. He broke into the team in the months leading up to the 1966 World Cup and impressed sufficiently to secure a place in the squad for the finals. After being omitted for the opening group game, against Uruguay, he came into the starting XI for the following match and kept his place.</p> \n<p>Peters put England 2-1 ahead in the final, a feat overshadowed by his West Ham club-mate Geoff Hurst\u2019s hat-trick. Known as \u201cThe Ghost\u201d for his ability to get unnoticed into scoring positions, Peters ended with 20 goals for his country. He played at the 1970 World Cup, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/09/world-cup-stunning-moments-gordon-banks-england-1970\" title=\"\">England lost 3-2 to West Germany</a> in the quarter-finals, having gone 2-0 up thanks to a Peters goal, after Bobby Charlton and then Peters were taken off by Ramsey.</p> \n<p>His final cap came in May 1974. Peters had captained the England side that drew with Poland and failed to qualify for that year\u2019s World Cup.</p> \n<p>Peters briefly and unsuccessfully managed Sheffield United in 1981 and later played non-league football before taking a job in the insurance business, in which he worked for 17 years before being made redundant.</p> \n<p>He spent time on the board at Tottenham and worked in the hospitality suites there and at West Ham.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Martin Peters, a member of England\u2019s 1966 World Cup-winning team, has died aged 76. The midfielder scored against West Germany in that final at Wembley and won 67 caps. Peters played most notably for West Ham United and Tottenham, although he also had a successful spell at Norwich City before finishing his professional career with Sheffield United. He made almost 900 appearances before retiring in 1981. In 2016 it was announced that he had Alzheimer\u2019s disease. A statement from members of Peters\u2019 family on West Ham\u2019s official website read: \u201cIt is with profound sadness that we announce that Martin passed away peacefully in his sleep at 4am this morning. A beloved husband, dad and grandad, and a kind, gentle and private man, we are devastated by his loss but so very proud of all that he achieved and comforted by the many happy memories we shared. We will be making no further comment and kindly ask that the privacy of our family is respected at this extremely difficult time.\u201d Described by his England manager, Alf Ramsey, as being \u201c10 years ahead of his time,\u201d the East London-born Peters came through the ranks at West Ham. He made his debut in 1962 and won the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup with the club before moving to Tottenham in 1970 for a then British record fee of \u00a3200,000. Jimmy Greaves went in the other direction as part of the deal. Further trophies followed at Spurs, with Peters winning the League Cup twice and then the Uefa Cup in an all-English final against Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1972. His England career stretched across eight years. He broke into the team in the months leading up to the 1966 World Cup and impressed sufficiently to secure a place in the squad for the finals. After being omitted for the opening group game, against Uruguay, he came into the starting XI for the following match and kept his place. Peters put England 2-1 ahead in the final, a feat overshadowed by his West Ham club-mate Geoff Hurst\u2019s hat-trick. Known as \u201cThe Ghost\u201d for his ability to get unnoticed into scoring positions, Peters ended with 20 goals for his country. He played at the 1970 World Cup, where England lost 3-2 to West Germany in the quarter-finals, having gone 2-0 up thanks to a Peters goal, after Bobby Charlton and then Peters were taken off by Ramsey. His final cap came in May 1974. Peters had captained the England side that drew with Poland and failed to qualify for that year\u2019s World Cup. Peters briefly and unsuccessfully managed Sheffield United in 1981 and later played non-league football before taking a job in the insurance business, in which he worked for 17 years before being made redundant. He spent time on the board at Tottenham and worked in the hospitality suites there and at West Ham.",

Not just me, everyone was pessimistic. I left on 22 December, and when our convoy arrived in [opposition-held] countryside, we were destroyed people; we fell apart. I went to Turkey for two or three months. I needed some time to relax, to breathe again, without losing friends, without anything that we suffered. I had pain in my back and legs, it took a long time to recover physically too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bfdaa7b736c7e6b4ca17e1fd982478b76a7c80b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bfdaa7b736c7e6b4ca17e1fd982478b76a7c80b/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ismail al-Abdullah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ismail al-Abdullah in al-Atareb, west of Aleppo, this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Esmael Abdullah.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But then I went back to the White Helmets. It wasn\u2019t a difficult decision. I felt I was addicted to rescue work. Maybe that sounds crazy but it\u2019s what happened. Normal life is very different from what we experienced in East Aleppo. There was nothing for me [in Turkey]. I was used to being on alert every day, saving people, tracking choppers, tracking bombers. It runs in our blood, this need to help, to do something for our country.</p> <p>After having a family, life has become more complicated, though. Sometimes I regret that I didn\u2019t leave the country, this chaos, for them to be safe, have a good life.</p> <p>Like other girls and boys born here in Syria, they do not even have IDs and for later we have no education, schools, universities, medical care. We were forced to leave our homes, and for what? The world disappointed us.

We were living in pitiful circumstances, but we found happiness falling in love in love. When we left, we went to northern Idlib because it is far from the bombing, near the Turkish border. My children and I had psychological problems, and our treatment was to stay away from the war. My son Hassan, who was six, woke me up one night shouting \u201cthere\u2019s a Russian war plane in the sky, it\u2019s going to bomb us\u201d. I went to him and realised he was sleeping, and this was a dream.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e641012db2534021e75b3b1bde79f532e093e44e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e641012db2534021e75b3b1bde79f532e093e44e/96_0_795_477/500.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Mehio at a football game for displaced children in Sarmada, north of Idlib, earlier this month.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu Mehio at a football game for displaced children in Sarmada, north of Idlib, earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Abu Mehio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They are back in school now, but the ones who are 11 and nine are only in second grade, because the schools in Aleppo were suspended.</p> <p>It was hard to find work for the first year. Many people I knew ended up going either to Turkey or returning to regime areas, because they couldn\u2019t find jobs. I wish I could return to my beloved Aleppo. I never regretted that I stayed, and I believe that I\u2019m going to return by God\u2019s will. I often look at the picture of our destroyed house where my brother was killed by the barrel bomb. When I see the pictures, I feel I am reliving it all, how we used to move from one basement to another, how I got so used to hearing people screaming from fear or injuries.</p> <h2>Asmar Halabi<br></h2> <p><strong>The orphanage director</strong><br></p> <p><em>Now living in </em><em>Izmir</em><em>, Turkey, with his wife, mother and niece, who was orphaned in the war. He got nearly 50 children safely out of Aleppo.</em><em> He has just welcomed his own first child, a daughter. He has a scholarship to study business management, which could offer a path to Turkish citizenship.</em></p> <p>A video went viral of the orphanage near the end of the siege; it caused a lot of problems. We suspected they were looking for the kids when they searched the evacuation buses, because they wanted to take them to regime areas for a media victory, so they could say they were the ones caring about civilians.</p> <p>We put the kids in several buses with adults so they would not be travelling as \u201cthe orphanage\u201d, just look like families. The last bus was me and eight kids. It took 24 hours, and no one was allowed out of the bus, so the kids had to pee in plastic bags, but we all made it out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b36b8945d07f7ecae97b3de46ce586610726c406\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b36b8945d07f7ecae97b3de46ce586610726c406/0_785_3539_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asmar Halabi with his 11-day-old daughter, Layana, at home in Izmir, Turkey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asmar Halabi with his 11-day-old daughter, Layana, at home in Izmir, Turkey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma Graham-Harrison/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We moved to Jarabulus [near the Turkish border], and they started to recover from the war.

They are getting stipends from the organisation to support them, and I\u2019m still in touch with almost all of them. My brother and sister had been in Turkey since 2014, and my mother wanted me to join them, so last year I moved here. We lost so many in our family [his father, three sisters and a brother-in-law], this was the least thing I could do for my mother. I have been unemployed, but now I have a scholarship and work permit for Istanbul. It means I have a future, and something to aim for.</p> <p>And in December I had my daughter. If I was in Syria, the responsibility would be frightening. I\u2019d fear something bad might happen, a rocket, barrel bomb, shelling. Now I am in Turkey I am so happy that she is here. Her name is Layana, which means good life and future. That is what we want for her. We had so much sadness before, now we want to look forward.</p> <h2>Abo Awad <br></h2> <p><strong>Taxi driver</strong> \u2013 <strong>missing</strong><br>Despite months of efforts to find Abo Awad, we cannot confirm whether he made it out of Aleppo alive or, if he was successful in escaping, where he is now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a7945d124d49e479eb22f93915ae6ec59ae819a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a7945d124d49e479eb22f93915ae6ec59ae819a/0_342_581_349/500.jpg\" alt=\"Abo Awad\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abo Awad was a taxi driver in eastern Aleppo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hussein Akoush</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the traumas of all wars is people left uncertain of their loved one\u2019s fates.

      "bodyText": "In December 2016, in the eastern half of Aleppo, a brutal siege was drawing to a bloody end. The last bombs were falling on its shattered streets, snipers were picking off their last victims. Besieged civilians, if they still had food, prepared their final meagre meals inside a city they had clung to for four painful years. Its horrors had become notorious; the UN\u2019s humanitarian chief called it \u201ca giant graveyard\u201d, yet when they finally left, many went with broken hearts. They knew they might never see their beloved city again, and left their dreams of a different Syria entombed in the rubble of its bombed-out homes. Aleppo was the last big urban centre held by the opposition, and with its capture, the hope of ousting President Bashar al-Assad effectively died, although the war raged on. At the height of the siege, when much of the reporting focused on fighting, civilians were still a majority of those trapped, and we wanted to give a sense of their daily life in this modern hell. The roads in and out were cut, but intermittent power and internet meant Skype calls still connected, so we let them speak directly to our readers. Three years have passed since the anniversary of Aleppo\u2019s fall, and the people we spoke to then are now scattered across Syria and beyond, one of them missing. For all of them, we found, the evacuation marked the end of one trauma, and the beginning of another. They struggled to find work, to adapt to a world without bombs and constant death. Friends and allies were scattered, their dreams for Syria and their city crushed, their sense of purpose destroyed overnight. Now as bombing intensifies once more in opposition-held Idlib, they see their own tragedy repeated thousands of times over. Their stories of exile and escape \u2013 told below in their own words \u2013 are a microcosm of what happened to Aleppo\u2019s revolution, and its dreams. To find out more about Aleppo and the Syrian civil war, please join us on 31 January for a special screening of Oscar-shortlisted documentary For Sama, followed by a Q&amp;A with film-maker Waad al-Kateab. She moved to Aleppo to study, but then joined a revolution, found love and gave birth. At its core, it poses a question to baby Sama: \u201cWill you blame me for staying here or blame me for leaving?\u201d Afraa Hashem The teacher Now living in Gaziantep, Turkey, with her husband and three children. She still works inside Syria on child protection and tackling violence against women. Their home is a shrine to Aleppo, the Syrian revolution, and the friends they lost. She appears in the Oscar-shortlisted documentary about Aleppo, For Sama. When the decision about evacuation came, we put everything in our car, ready to leave, but they bombed our neighbourhood again, and hit the car. Everything burned, my diaries, photos, all my possessions. It was as if the regime was telling me \u201cwe will destroy everything, you cannot even take your memories from Aleppo\u201d. All this period I was just crying, thinking, how can I leave my city? I stayed for four years, under shelling, steadfast, to tell all the world we have the right to freedom, democracy, to our dreams. I collected some soil from my friends\u2019 graves, to take with me in a jar. I asked them to forgive me \u2013 we failed to complete their mission.

It was hard to find work for the first year. Many people I knew ended up going either to Turkey or returning to regime areas, because they couldn\u2019t find jobs. I wish I could return to my beloved Aleppo. I never regretted that I stayed, and I believe that I\u2019m going to return by God\u2019s will. I often look at the picture of our destroyed house where my brother was killed by the barrel bomb. When I see the pictures, I feel I am reliving it all, how we used to move from one basement to another, how I got so used to hearing people screaming from fear or injuries. Asmar Halabi The orphanage director Now living in Izmir, Turkey, with his wife, mother and niece, who was orphaned in the war. He got nearly 50 children safely out of Aleppo. He has just welcomed his own first child, a daughter. He has a scholarship to study business management, which could offer a path to Turkish citizenship. A video went viral of the orphanage near the end of the siege; it caused a lot of problems. We suspected they were looking for the kids when they searched the evacuation buses, because they wanted to take them to regime areas for a media victory, so they could say they were the ones caring about civilians. We put the kids in several buses with adults so they would not be travelling as \u201cthe orphanage\u201d, just look like families. The last bus was me and eight kids. It took 24 hours, and no one was allowed out of the bus, so the kids had to pee in plastic bags, but we all made it out. We moved to Jarabulus [near the Turkish border], and they started to recover from the war. Their biggest concern there was \u201cwe want to go for a picnic and swim in the river, but you won\u2019t let us\u201d. After about two years, many of the children went to stay with grandparents, uncles, aunts. They are getting stipends from the organisation to support them, and I\u2019m still in touch with almost all of them. My brother and sister had been in Turkey since 2014, and my mother wanted me to join them, so last year I moved here. We lost so many in our family [his father, three sisters and a brother-in-law], this was the least thing I could do for my mother. I have been unemployed, but now I have a scholarship and work permit for Istanbul. It means I have a future, and something to aim for. And in December I had my daughter. If I was in Syria, the responsibility would be frightening. I\u2019d fear something bad might happen, a rocket, barrel bomb, shelling. Now I am in Turkey I am so happy that she is here. Her name is Layana, which means good life and future. That is what we want for her. We had so much sadness before, now we want to look forward. Abo Awad Taxi driver \u2013 missing Despite months of efforts to find Abo Awad, we cannot confirm whether he made it out of Aleppo alive or, if he was successful in escaping, where he is now. One of the traumas of all wars is people left uncertain of their loved one\u2019s fates. The United Nations says that in Syria more than 100,000 people have so far \u201cbeen detained, abducted or gone missing \u2014 largely, but not only, at the hands of the Syrian government\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "One of Donald Trump\u2019s top re-election advisers told influential Republicans in swing state Wisconsin that the party has \u201ctraditionally\u201d relied on voter suppression to compete in battleground states, according to an audio recording of a private event. The adviser said later that his remarks referred to frequent and false accusations that Republicans employ such tactics. But the report emerged just days after news that a conservative group is forcing Wisconsin to purge upwards of 230,000 people from state voter rolls more than a year earlier than planned, a move that would disproportionately affect Democrats before the 2020 election. And it came as the latest fund-raising totals showed that the Republican National Committee, spurred by aggressive anti-impeachment fundraising, heads into 2020 with more than seven times as much cash on hand as the Democratic National Committee \u2013 $63m for the RNC against $8.3m for the DNC, according to FEC filings, Axios reported. Justin Clark, a senior political adviser and senior counsel to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, made the remarks about voter suppression on 21 November as part of a wide-ranging discussion about strategies in the 2020 campaign, including more aggressive use of monitoring of polling places on election day in November 2020. \u201cTraditionally it\u2019s always been Republicans suppressing votes in places,\u201d Clark said at the event. \u201cLet\u2019s start protecting our voters. We know where they are ... Let\u2019s start playing offense a little bit. That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to see in 2020. It\u2019s going to be a much bigger program, a much more aggressive program, a much better-funded program.\u201d Asked about the remarks, by the Associated Press, which obtained the audio recording, Clark said he was referring to false accusations that the Republican party engages in voter suppression. \u201cAs should be clear from the context of my remarks, my point was that Republicans historically have been falsely accused of voter suppression and that it is time we stood up to defend our own voters,\u201d Clark said. \u201cNeither I nor anyone I know or work with would condone anyone\u2019s vote being threatened or diluted and our efforts will be focused on preventing just that.\u201d Clark made the comments on the audio file in a meeting of the Republican National Lawyers Association\u2019s Wisconsin chapter. Attendees included the state Senate\u2019s top Republican, Scott Fitzgerald, along with the executive director of the Wisconsin Republican party. Audio of the event at a country club in Madison obtained by the liberal group American Bridge was provided to AP by One Wisconsin Now, a Madison-based liberal advocacy group. The roughly 20-minute audio offers an insider\u2019s glimpse of Trump\u2019s re-election strategy, showing the campaign focusing on voting locations in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, which form the the so-called \u201cblue wall\u201d of traditional Democratic strength that Trump broke through to win in 2016. Republican officials publicly signaled plans to step up their Election Day monitoring after a judge in 2018 lifted a consent decree in place since 1982 that barred the Republican National Committee from voter verification and other \u201cballot security\u201d efforts. Critics have argued the tactics amount to voter intimidation. Across America, as it heads into this crucial election year, while some states have enacted policies that make it easier to cast a ballot, many have gone in the opposite direction. In 2016, Wisconsin had 62 paid Trump staff working to get out the vote; in 2020, it will increase to around 100, Clark said. Trump supports the effort, Clark said in the audio recording. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the tweets about voter fraud, blah, blah, blah,\u201d Clark said. \u201cEvery time we\u2019re in with him, he asks what are we doing about voter fraud? What are we doing about voter fraud?\u2019 The point is he\u2019s committed to this, he believes in it and he will do whatever it takes to make sure it\u2019s successful.\u201d Clark said Trump\u2019s campaign plans to focus on rural areas around mid-size cities like Eau Claire and Green Bay, areas he says where Democrats \u201ccheat\u201d. He did not explain what he meant by cheating and did not provide any examples. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Wisconsin. The dispute about purging voters is the latest in a series of voting rights brawls in Wisconsin, considered one of the most important states in the upcoming presidential election. In recent years, Republicans drew electoral districts that severely benefitted their party, unsuccessfully tried to limit early voting, and implemented a strict voter ID law. The law discouraged as many as 23,252 people in the state from casting a ballot in 2016, one estimate found. \u201cIf there\u2019s bad behavior on the part of one side or the other to prevent people from voting, this is bad for our democracy,\u201d Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said in reaction to Clark\u2019s comments. Wisconsin\u2019s attorney general, Democrat Josh Kaul, represented the Democratic National Committee in a 2016 New Jersey lawsuit that argued the GOP was coordinating with Trump to intimidate voters. Kaul argued then that Trump\u2019s campaign \u201crepeatedly encouraged his supporters to engage in vigilante efforts\u201d in the guise of ferreting out potential voter fraud. The Republican party disputed any coordination. Mike Browne, deputy director of One Wisconsin Now, said Clark\u2019s comments suggest the Trump campaign plans \u201cunderhanded tactics\u201d for 2020. Earlier this week Georgia proceeded with a mass purge of 300,000-plus voters from the rolls, despite an activist group founded by rising-star Democrat Stacey Abrams asking a court to halt the plan. Voter suppression as a tactic \u2013 from strict ID laws to closing polling places to purging voter rolls \u2013 is deliberately making it hard for minority communities in America, which traditionally lean towards the Democratic party, to exercise their right to vote, a Guardian\u2019s ongoing The Fight to Vote special series found.",

      "bodyText": "So that, my good friends, is your lot. Thanks for reading Clockwatch. Simon Burnton is currently MBMing Liverpool\u2019s Club World Cup final against Flamengo, while Will Unwin is on Manchester City v Leicester City duty. Enjoy, enjoy ... and happy holidays to one and all! Glamour round-up. Paul MacInnes was on the south coast this afternoon to witness Burnley snatch a late win. Here\u2019s his report. Celtic reestablished their five-point lead over Rangers by beating Aberdeen. Here\u2019s our report. Wolves moved into sixth place today with a gritty win at Norwich. Here\u2019s Tumaini Carayol\u2019s take. More on Peters. Remembering the man described by his boss Alf Ramsey as being \u201cten years ahead of his time\u201d. Martin Peters RIP. A genuine legend has passed away today. Martin Peters has died at the age of 76 after a battle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Peters won the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup with West Ham, and the Uefa Cup with Spurs, but of course will be best remembered as part of England\u2019s 1966 World Cup winning team. Peters scored the second goal in the 4-2 victory over West Germany in the final. He also wore the shirts of Norwich City and Sheffield United with distinction. Paul Doyle was at the Amex to see the upwardly mobile Blades rise to fifth in the Premier League table. This is his report. Louise Taylor was there to witness the end of Miguel Almiron\u2019s long goal drought. Here\u2019s her report on a day of Christmas cheer at St James\u2019 Park. We\u2019ve already flagged up Paul Wilson\u2019s report of the Everton-Arsenal lunchtime kick-off. Nick Ames was at Goodison too, and here\u2019s his take. The last merry missive from Simon McMahon before the holidays. \u201c4-0 Dundee United! Merry Christmas one and all!!!\u201d Ben Fisher was at Villa Park to witness the home side\u2019s capitulation. Here\u2019s his report on a great day for the Saints. Football League loose ends. Aforementioned matches ahoy! In the Championship, Fulham have hung on for a 2-1 win over Leeds. West Brom have been held 1-1 at home by Brentford. And Derby have lost their sixth away match on the bounce, going down 3-0 at Reading. Meanwhile in League Two, Forest Green have fought back to draw 2-2 with Swindon, while Exeter couldn\u2019t find a winner against Walsall, that to-and-fro fixture ending 3-3. FULL TIME: Bournemouth 0-1 Burnley. It\u2019s six defeats in seven for the Cherries, who are going to be dragged into a relegation battle unless they get their gamefaces on soon. Last week\u2019s unlikely win against Chelsea will given them some succour. Burnley meanwhile are comfy in mid-table. FULL TIME: Aston Villa 1-3 Southampton. What a huge result for Saints, who leapfrog out of the relegation places, pushing Villa into the bottom three. Villa need to sort their defence out, and fast. FULL TIME: Norwich City 1-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers. The same old story for City, who let another lead slip through their fingers and are now six points from safetly. FULL TIME: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-1 Sheffield United. It\u2019s 18 away matches unbeaten for the Blades, a club record! They move into fifth spot, just one place and point behind Chelsea in the Champions League spots. Meanwhile Scottish champs Celtic have beaten Aberdeen 2-1, restoring their five-point lead over Rangers at the top of the league. FULL TIME: Newcastle United 1-0 Crystal Palace. Miguel Almiron the goalscoring hero at last! It\u2019s eight home matches without defeat for the Toon, their best run since 2012. GOAL! Bournemouth 0-1 Burnley (Jay Rodriguez 89). VAR insisted on checking it for offside and handball. But Rodriguez was on, while the hand was attached to the arm of a Bournemouth player. Burnley appear to have snatched all three points! Glamour news. It\u2019s 4-1 to Barcelona against Alaves now, Luis Suarez winning and then scoring a penalty. Meanwhile the teams are in for the big 5.30pm kick-off between Manchester City and Leicester. Will Unwin is in the hotseat for that one, and has all the details - including the return of Sergio Aguero! Almiron is booked for taking off his shirt in wild celebration. It\u2019s the rules, you can\u2019t blame the ref, but imagine being the person who wrote that particular law. Imagine your worldview. Shame shame shame. MIGUEL ALMIRON GOAL!!! Newcastle United 1-0 Crystal Palace (Miguel Almiron 83). Almiron puts an end to his 28-match wait for his first Newcastle goal, rifling in from 12 yards! Andy Carroll hoists his team-mate into the air as St James\u2019 Park erupts! GOAL! Norwich City 1-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers (Raul Jimenez 81). The Canaries will rue those missed Teemu Pukki chances, as it\u2019s the same old story, another defeat snatched from the jaws of victory. GOAL! Aston Villa 1-3 Southampton (Jack Grealish 75). A dipping Grealish volley that can best be described as Le Tissieresque. Saints fans will appreciate the artistry, if nothing else. Fulham have retaken the lead against Leeds. Josh Onomah whacks one in on 69 minutes. With Leeds losing and leaders West Brom currently being held at home by Brentford, it looks like being a good day for the chasing pack. Glamour news. Lionel Messi has just made it 3-1 for Barcelona, who should now be home and hosed against Alaves. In Germany, Leipzig have sealed a 3-1 comeback win over Augsburg. Bayern Munich meanwhile left it late against Wolfsburg, but two goals in the last five minutes from Joshua Zirkzee and Serge Gnabry have secured the win for the reigning champions, currently in third place and trailing the leaders by four points. The jig looks up for the Dons at Parkhead. Their goalscorer Sam Cosgrove has just been sent off. They trail 2-1 and will have to play the last 20 minutes with ten men. Some good news for Liverpool fans: Virgil van Dijk has recovered from illness and is in the team to face Flamengo in the final of that shebang over in Qatar. Simon Burnton is on point. Exeter have completed their three-goal comeback against Walsall. Lee Martin has equalised on 64 minutes. Meanwhile Celtic have reclaimed the lead against Aberdeen, Odsonne Edouard the home hero at Parkhead on 66 minutes. It\u2019s 2-1. Over an hour in, and there have been no shots on target between Bournemouth and Burnley. What a business. Meanwhile a third for Leipzig: Yussuf Poulsen puts them 3-1 up against Augsburg with a minute to go, and they\u2019ll surely be top for Christmas. Gl\u00fchwein all round! Glamour news. Leipzig have taken the lead late on against Augsburg, Partik Schick making it 2-1. As things stand, they\u2019ll be the winter champions of the Bundesliga. Meanwhile Pere Pons has pulled a goal back for Alaves against Barcelona; it\u2019s 2-1 in that one too. GOAL! Norwich City 1-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers (Romain Saiss 60). Saiss slams in a header, and Norwich have let yet another lead slip, despite having dominated proceedings at Carrow Road. Regrets, they\u2019ve had a few. An equaliser for promotion-chasing Leeds at Fulham. Patrick Bamford with a tap-in at Craven Cottage. It\u2019s 1-1. Jack O\u2019Connell finds the net at Brighton for Sheffield United. But VAR rules it out for offside. That\u2019s the second time today that Albion have been rescued by the video ref. Can they take advantage and find an equaliser? GOAL! Aston Villa 0-3 Southampton (Danny Ings 51). Ings rounds Tom Heaton. Villa are a rabble, and they\u2019ll be in the relegation places come 5pm. \u201cAyr United are entering into the Christmas spirit at Tannadice as they gifted hosts and Scottish Championship leaders Dundee United a half-time lead they scarcely deserve,\u201d reports Simon McMahon, our old pal from Tayside. \u201cUnited for most of the first 45 looked like they had been on the sauce last night, and could well have been stuffed before they took a half time lead after a defensive error. Here\u2019s hoping we have a cracker of a second half in store.\u201d David McGoldrick still hasn\u2019t scored a Premier League goal for Sheffield United. He should have broken his duck at the Amex, having rounded Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan. But faced with an empty net, he could only slap the ball into the side netting. Oh David. His first goal, when it eventually comes, is bound to be a screamer, best look at it that way. Glamour news. It\u2019s half-time at Camp Nou, where Barcelona are now 2-0 up on Alaves, Arturo Vidal scoring the second just before the break. Meanwhile Bundesliga leaders Leipzig have just equalised against Augsburg, midway through the second half. Can they find the winner that would ensure they\u2019re crowned winter champions? And the League Two scores at the break. The match of the day is at Exeter, where Walsall were three up. But the hosts are coming right back at them. It promises to be a hell of a second half at the other (sort of) St James Park. The League One half-times. For your leisure and pleasure. Anyway, you\u2019ll be wanting some half-time scores, won\u2019t you. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the Championship. Some good news for at least one Aston Villa fan today. Live pictures on Sky Sports show a chap, draped in a claret and blue scarf, being handed a chocolate treat in an orange wrapper. That\u2019s a Double Decker, I\u2019ll be bound, and there are few better bars in your Clocko correspondent\u2019s book. Its delightful mix of chocolate, nougat and cereal never fails to hit the spot. At the Hawthorns, Championship leaders West Brom and fellow promotion chasers Brentford have just traded goals from corners in short order. Henrik Dalsgaard gave the Bees the lead on 43 minutes, but Darnell Furlong has levelled up in first-half injury time. Meanwhile in Scotland, the leaders Celtic and Aberdeen go in level at 1-1. The Premier League half-times. Aston Villa 0-2 Southampton Bournemouth 0-0 Burnley Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-1 Sheffield United Newcastle United 0-0 Crystal Palace Norwich City 1-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers Norwich are still leading Wolves at Carrow Road. But Teemu Pukki has missed a couple of decent chances, and they\u2019ll be worried about shipping another lead. As things stand, they\u2019ll be level on 15 points with plummeting Aston Villa, three shy of 17th-placed Saints and safety. Long time to go, though. Eoin Doyle has scored twice for League Two leaders Swindon Town at Forest Green. He\u2019s now found the net in ten consecutive games, and scored 21 times already this season. Swindon are 2-0 up and will end the day six clear of second-placed Exeter if they keep this up. A shock brewing in Scotland? Sam Cosgrove has equalised for Aberdeen at Celtic Park. A 35th-minute header very much against the run of play. Rangers, who saw off Hibs easily last night, will have all fingers crossed. Glamour news. In La Liga, Barcelona are leading Alaves by Antoine Griezmann\u2019s 14th-minute goal, while Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig are trailing at half-time, Florian Niederlechner with an early goal for Augsburg. GOAL! Aston Villa 0-2 Southampton (Jack Stephens 31). A much-deserved second for Saints. And another deadly dead-ball delivery by James Ward-Prowse, Jack Stephens flicking home from his corner. Villa are in all sorts of bother now. If only Saints sent out a team of 16-year-olds. Danny Ings and Shane Long continue to cause Aston Villa all sorts of bother. Southampton are well on top, but they\u2019ve only got the one goal to show for it. They\u2019ll not want to spurn another win there for the taking, just like they did at Arsenal a few weeks back. Still, Saints haven\u2019t been playing like a relegation team of late. That second-half comeback against Watford seems to have sparked a fire. GOAL! Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-1 Sheffield United (Oli McBurnie 23). Scotland\u2019s super-sharp shooter puts the Blades in front at the Amex, in the no-nonsense style, a long ball causing all sorts of confusion in the home defence. United will go fifth if they hold on for the win. GOAL! Aston Villa 0-1 Southampton (Danny Ings 21). What a striker Ings is. He\u2019s on a one-man mission to save Saints from the drop. He\u2019s also on hand to convert after Shane Long\u2019s shot is parried by Tom Heaton. If it ends like this, Saints will leapfrog Aston Villa, pushing them into the relegation zone in the process. GOAL! Norwich City 1-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers (Todd Cantwell 17). City\u2019s young star scores his fifth goal of the season from 12 yards. Carrow Road erupts. Norwich haven\u2019t been too expert in holding onto leads this season. How they could do with keeping this one. undefined Miguel Almir\u00f3n still hasn\u2019t scored for Newcastle United. But he\u2019s just gone very close against Crystal Palace. A curler sent goalwards, but without the necessary power to beat Vicente Guaita. Like the Leeds promotion, it\u2019s just a matter of time, surely. Surely. An early goal for the Scottish champions Celtic. Christopher Jullien with the opener against their bunnies Aberdeen. Meanwhile ever-entertaining Leeds - who have to return to the Premier League soon, they just have to - fall behind at Fulham, a result of Aleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s seventh-minute penalty. It looked as though Sheffield United had taken the lead at Brighton. John Egan had the ball in the net. But there was a handball as he bundled it in, and VAR chalked it off. Things already not looking good for Derby. Scott Malone has been sent packing for bringing down Yakou M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9. Charlie Adam knocks in the resulting penalty. Derby have lost their last five without scoring, so good luck to them. No early goals in the Premier League. So there\u2019s time to report a couple of results down the divisions. In League Two, Scunthorpe have won their local stramash with Grimsby 1-0, thanks to Kevin can Veen\u2019s second-half goal. Meanwhile in League One, Gillingham have beaten Buckinghamshire Franchise 3-1, leaving the men from Milton Keynes in the relegation zone. The teams are out at Villa Park, Dean Court, the Amex, St James\u2019 Park and Carrow Road. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. But while we wait, here\u2019s Paul Wilson\u2019s take on the early kick-off, the non-event at Goodison that leaves Carlo Ancelotti and Mikel Arteta with plenty to think about. The Arsenal representative of the Observer\u2019s fan network isn\u2019t totally convinced about the appointment of Mikel Arteta. Though it\u2019s safe to say that, with the sum total of zero matches played under his yoke so far, the jury is very much still out. \u201cIt has been strange, in the context of Arteta\u2019s appointment, to again hear many people talk of the appointment of untested young ex-players as managers, as if this was unusual,\u201d notes David Reynolds. \u201cIt seems to me this has always been standard practice. To take three rather notable examples, Brain Clough got the Derby job at 32, Bill Nicholson got the Spurs job at 39, and Alf Ramsay the Ipswich job at 34. All were league champions at these clubs within a few years.\u201d Here\u2019s a bit more on this morning\u2019s confirmation that Carlo Ancelotti will follow in the wake of genuine legends such as Harry Catterick, Howard Kendall and Mike Walker Joe Royle. The latter remains the last man to bring silverware to Goodison Park, the FA Cup in 1995. Should Ancelotti manage to snap Everton\u2019s potless quarter-century streak, he\u2019ll take his place on the list of Goodison greats with immediate effect. On the subject of fun ... Everton and Arsenal served up none of it. The lunchtime Premier League fixture ended up goalless, though that hasn\u2019t stopped the denizens of Goodison cheering outgoing caretaker Big Dunc\u2122 to the rafters. He shifts down the bench to make way for Carlo Ancelotti, who has plenty in his in-box. Also with much to do on today\u2019s evidence: Mikel Arteta. God speed, lads. Anyway, Arsenal rise to ninth, Everton 15th. For now. Simon Burnton was your eyes and ears. And finally the team news from Carrow Road, where Norwich make one change to the team that deservedly drew at Leicester. Ben Godfrey is replaced by Grant Hanley. No changes for Wolves in the wake of their unlucky defeat at home to Spurs last Sunday. Wolves have scored a goal in each of their last 16 matches, while Norwich score and ship them like nobody\u2019s business, so this one could be fun. To the Toon, who can go eight unbeaten at home for the first time in seven years if they avoid defeat today. Steve Bruce makes three changes in pursuit of this goal. Sean Longstaff, Jetro Willems and Christian Atsu make way for Jonjo Shelvey, Miguel Almiron and Florian Lejeune. Two changes for Crystal Palace after that draw with Brighton. Patrick van Aanholt and James McCarthy replace Scott Dann and Jairo Riedewald, the latter unsurprisingly given he was hooked at half-time on Monday evening. Brighton make one change to the side that should have won easily at rivals Crystal Palace on Monday evening. Dale Stephens has served his suspension and takes the place of Yves Bissouma, who played well at Selhurst Park if memory serves. Two changes for Sheffield United after their win against Aston Villa. Luke Freeman replaces the suspended John Fleck, while Oli McBurnie leads the line instead of Lys Mousset. Bournemouth name the same side sent out to beat Chelsea last weekend. That means Joshua King has recovered from the knock he picked up at Stamford Bridge. Burnley make one change to the side that beat Newcastle last week. Charlie Taylor comes in for Erik Pieters.

The first meaningful action in today\u2019s Premier League has just come at Goodison Park. It\u2019s a shot on target! But it\u2019s still goalless between Everton and Arsenal, who are serving up poor Simon Burnton some thin gruel. Good afternoon, girls and boys, and welcome to Christmas Clocko. You\u2019ve all been averagely behaved at best this year, so the traditional Saturday 3pm card has nothing whatsoever to do with the title race, and isn\u2019t particularly concerned with the tussle for the Champions League spots either. But there is a plum relegation six-pointer at Villa Park, so you do get a little treat. Santa is good to you. Never unkind. Aston Villa v Southampton Bournemouth v Burnley Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v Sheffield United Newcastle United v Crystal Palace Norwich City v Wolverhampton Wanderers Other matches are available, and who knows, we may even mention them. Onward! Upward!",

Why were they placed there?

He said: \u201cWe\u2019re finally getting new results on these places because of new technologies, allowing us to look at standing stones in a whole new light.\u201d</p> <p>The Callanish great circle is thought to have been erected in 3,000 BC, some 500 years before the major stone settings at Stonehenge, which is linked with another natural event: the solstices.

      "bodyText": "For thousands of years the Callanish standing stones erected on the remote Hebridean island of Lewis have remained a mystery. Why were they placed there? And for what purpose? Now archaeologists have uncovered dramatic new evidence that suggests our Neolithic ancestors were inspired to construct the megaliths as devotional monuments by the natural phenomenon of lightning strikes. A geophysical survey around one of the stones has astonished archaeologists by revealing a star-shaped pattern formed by one, or possibly multiple, earth-shaking lightning strikes. New technology has exposed a clear pattern covering an area of up to 20 metres in diameter, buried until now beneath peat bogs. The single stone, within \u201csite XI\u201d, is about 2.8km from the famous Callanish great circle in the island\u2019s Loch Roag area. Geophysical techniques have mapped buried features and the new evidence shows that this 1.5-metre-high stone was originally part of another circle with the lightning strike pattern at its centre. The stones\u2019 original positions have been revealed as magnetic anomalies in the survey. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited,\u201d said professor Vincent Gaffney, one of the archaeologists. \u201cThis was completely and utterly unexpected. Seeing the evidence for a massive strike, right in the middle of what now seems to be a stone circle, is remarkable.\u201d He added that such a lightning strike may have hit an upstanding feature \u2013 perhaps a tree or a rock \u2013 in \u201ca prehistorical equivalent of an act of God\u201d: \u201cIt does rather look as if lightning was part of the game in creating this stone circle.\u201d Dr Richard Bates, a geoscientist at St Andrews University, who is leading the project, described the discovery as highly exciting. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re finally getting new results on these places because of new technologies, allowing us to look at standing stones in a whole new light.\u201d The Callanish great circle is thought to have been erected in 3,000 BC, some 500 years before the major stone settings at Stonehenge, which is linked with another natural event: the solstices. More than 15 other sites on the island have been identified as possible satellite circles. With the geophysical survey, determining the chronology is difficult, said Bates. \u201cDid the lightning strike come first or did the building of the stone circle come first? The lightning strike occurred before peat started forming So we know it\u2019s pre-peat, which started to form around 3,000 years ago. It seems more than coincidence that these are occurring in the same place.\u201d Gaffney, from Bradford University\u2019s department of archaeological sciences, has also headed the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes project, surveying land around the Wiltshire monument. He described the new geophysical evidence as \u201cphenomenal\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this before. It just says so much about how our ancestors related to nature.

Carlo Ancelotti and Mikel Arteta inherit teams that need pretty much everything knocking into them: common sense, confidence, patterns of play, how not to miscontrol a five-yard pass into touch. They could not do that from up high and instead had to chew over a dire affair whose scruffiness may not be outdone all season.</p> <p>During one particularly grim sequence Ancelotti, sitting alongside Bill Kenwright, could be seen wanly shaking his head. Midway through another, a pensive bite on his spectacles. Too late, Carlo.

      "bodyText": "Two households, both alike in timidity. For Everton and Arsenal the shake-ups start on Sunday but there must have been times when their respective new managers, perched in the directors\u2019 box, wished they could include mind over matter in the list of skills for which they had been recruited. Carlo Ancelotti and Mikel Arteta inherit teams that need pretty much everything knocking into them: common sense, confidence, patterns of play, how not to miscontrol a five-yard pass into touch. They could not do that from up high and instead had to chew over a dire affair whose scruffiness may not be outdone all season. During one particularly grim sequence Ancelotti, sitting alongside Bill Kenwright, could be seen wanly shaking his head. Midway through another, a pensive bite on his spectacles. Too late, Carlo. He had already made a brisk first public appearance. His much-trailed arrival was confirmed an hour and 10 minutes before kick-off and it was not long before, as he was shown towards his seat, he could be seen grinning into a succession of cameraphone lenses. He made the time; Ancelotti may be a serial winner but he is clubbable, a twinkle never too far beneath those arched eyebrows, and knows how to charm his public. Attracting a manager of his calibre is a clear sign of the direction in which Everton wish to travel but a certain earthiness goes down well here and the club\u2019s inertia is hardly suited to airs and graces. This was more familiar territory to Arteta, whose five years spent here as a player moulded his career in English football, but his reception was of a lower key as he sat alongside the Arsenal technical director, Edu.

And why do some women try to professionally \u201cout-jock\u201d men?</p> <p>These were my thoughts when I read about how actress <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/19/ruth-wilson-the-affair-too-many-sex-scenes-toxic-uncomfortable\" title=\"\">Ruth Wilson left the television series <em>The Affair</em></a> because of what she claims is a toxic, inappropriate culture involving enforced sex scenes. As a fan of <em>The Affair</em>, I\u2019d wondered why Wilson left so abruptly, with only one season to go. The <em>Hollywood </em><em>Reporter</em> says that Wilson was labelled \u201cdifficult\u201d for objecting to relentless nude sequences (demanded of her far more often than her male co-stars). Wilson refused to do a \u201crapey\u201d scene against a tree. (A body double was used.) During filming of some sex scenes, monitors could be viewed by non-crew members.</p> <p>There\u2019s more <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/ruth-wilson-left-affair-hostile-environment-nudity-issues-1263553\" title=\"\">gruesome detail</a>, including a disputed report on Lena Dunham\u2019s now-defunct newsletter and website Lenny Letter, where producer/director of <em>The Affair</em>, Jeffrey Reiner, spoke to Dunham, praising her nudity in <em>Girls</em> (\u201cYou would show anything. Even your asshole\u201d), saying he wished she\u2019d encourage Wilson to \u201cshow her tits or at least some vag\u201d. Now it is reported that <em>The Affair</em>\u2019s showrunner, Sarah Treem, also pressured Wilson (and others) into nudity, making remarks such as \u201cYou look beautiful\u201d and \u201cEveryone is waiting for you\u201d.</p> <p>Excuse me while I throw up into a bin. Why can\u2019t women such as Wilson be beautiful <em>and</em> clothed \u2013 and why should they feel responsible for disrupting filming schedules for nude scenes they find so distressing they leave a hit show?</p> <p>If this is true (Treem denies it, saying she\u2019s a feminist), it\u2019s grotesque on multiple levels. Like the recent story about Emilia Clarke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/20/emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones-nude-scenes-were-terrifying\" title=\"\">dreading nudity on <em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, it seems that actresses who question the validity of nude scenes still risk being labelled \u201cdifficult\u201d. (Note the similarities with porn, where women must not only perform but do so enthusiastically or risk disrupting the male fantasy.) With <em>The Affair</em>, there\u2019s the added factor of alleged woman-on-woman betrayal. </p> <p>I suppose it happens and not just on television sets. In ill-judged attempts to \u201cprove themselves\u201d in high-octane, male-dominated work environments, there are some women who try to outdo the jocks \u2013 doing everything from telling coarser jokes and showing bigger \u201ckiller\u201d instincts to deriding other women for being \u201coversensitive/humourless\u201d via, in this instance, badgering them to do nude scenes. Maybe these women justify the grotty sexism to themselves, rationalising that it\u2019s not the same coming from a woman. Too right \u2013 it\u2019s <em>worse</em>.</p> <p>What a shame if Treem was part of this. Women in positions of power have the opportunity to support one another, not make it so that it isn\u2019t just men that women have to worry about. A woman compelling another woman to do nudity doesn\u2019t automatically make it \u201cfeminist\u201d. Woman-on-woman pressure isn\u2019t better. #MeToo has to include female behaviour too.</p> <h2>Child refugee pledges are abandoned with cruel ease</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b215f977dc37c6a4089d32c135c4fac0bc6a2807\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b215f977dc37c6a4089d32c135c4fac0bc6a2807/0_23_4156_2494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Dubs with Syrian refugee Ishmael\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Dubs with Syrian refugee Ishmael.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watch it \u2013 the Tories are going straight for the kids.

Rightly so, but then why the heavyhanded treatment of Flack? Back in the real world, domestic disputes tend to result in women being the battered victims. Police used to turn a blind eye and, even these days, it\u2019s difficult for cases to make it to court and culminate in a conviction. Yet, when a high-profile woman is allegedly the perpetrator, suddenly it\u2019s all systems go? Flack\u2019s alleged violence is not something to cheer, but is her fame playing too much of a part here? \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

According to the pollsters YouGov, Labour\u2019s share of the vote fell among the over-65s by even more than last time \u2013 to under 20% in 2019 from 24% in 2017. In 2010, Ipsos Mori said that 31% of over-65s voted Labour. This time, the Conservatives\u2019 vote share among the over-65s was more than 60%. It seems like an obvious conclusion to draw, but it can\u2019t be said loudly enough that the generational gap in voting between the Conservative and Labour parties, which hit a record level in 2017, grew again in this year\u2019s election. Such is the extent of the divide between the old and the young that age has become more important than class. Go back to the period between 1987 and 2010 and the Conservatives never scored higher than 48% among over-65s and Labour never scored lower than 31%. James Sloam, a reader in politics in the Democracy and Elections Centre at Royal Holloway, University of London, says the younger generations\u2019 overwhelming rejection of the Conservatives in favour of Labour, and to some extent in favour of the Liberal Democrats and Greens, was more than offset by older voters embracing the Conservatives as never before. In the \u201cred wall\u201d constituencies in the north where Labour did so badly in 2019 there are several trends that march hand in hand. Most of the towns are former coal mining centres that have failed to find alternative sources of employment over the past 35 years. Even where there are high levels of employment, especially in the north-east and the east coast around Hull, the jobs often pay the minimum wage or not much above it. This failure to bring good jobs to the towns has forced young people to leave and left older people behind. There is a Corbynite view that the Brexit issue means older people have only lent their votes and, with Brexit out of the way, a radical manifesto akin to the 2019 version can win them back. Yet the red-wall boomers are not so different to older people elsewhere in the country who have long since flocked to the Tories. Yes, they had a particularly strong affiliation with Brexit and backed Boris Johnson\u2019s determination to implement the 2016 referendum result. The Brexit effect cannot be dismissed. But when looking beyond Brexit to other issues that matter \u2013 apart from the NHS, which Theresa May and Johnson addressed, and effectively nullified, with their promises of much higher spending and new hospitals \u2013 older people put cultural issues higher than economic ones.

The most recent you\u2019ll hear out in the wild is probably the Darkness\u2019 Christmas Time (Don\u2019t Let the Bells End), and that came out in 2003. The fact that this coincides with the rise of <em>Pop Idol</em>, <em>X Factor</em> and other TV talent shows is not unconnected. For many years, the winner had a Christmas No 1 sewn up, though it was never a specifically festive song; they weren\u2019t about to risk post-December sales on a track that would lose its appeal as soon as the turkey was finished.

Those protesters might not have imagined that such contests would still exist in 2019, much less as a forum for contestants to \u201cadvocate for their social impact initiatives\u201d. While this is surely better than judging women for how well they can model a bikini, the pressure never ends: to be a looker is no longer enough, if Miss America must also now have two degrees and be studying for her PhD. For her live experiment, Schrier poured chemicals into flasks and made three big fluffy colourful flumes of gunk. It was She\u2019s All That, in reverse. In the 1999 teen film, Laney Boggs whips off her glasses and lets down her hair to reveal that she has always been beautiful. In Miss America, the beautiful woman put on her glasses and lab coat to reveal that she has always been smart. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

Dickson called the meeting to address Boeing\u2019s unrealistic timetable for returning the Max to service. He felt the planemaker was putting undue pressure on the agency to recertify the plane by the end of the year.</p> <p>The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher for Boeing. The 737 Max was previously its bestselling plane, with 580 deliveries during 2018. Boeing\u2019s overall deliveries had fallen by half during the first nine months of the year. It has nearly 4,500 on order, worth over $500bn at list prices (each costs about $121m).</p> <p>Since the grounding, the production rate had slowed by almost a fifth to 42 a month, with around 400 in total coming off the production line. The decision to suspend manufacturing has cast a huge cloud over the plane and raised doubts about when \u2013 or if \u2013 it will return to service.</p> <p>Airlines have withdrawn it from their schedules for several months. American Airlines this month pulled it until 7 April and Southwest, the biggest user of the plane, said the flying ban had cut its operating income by $830m this year.</p> <p>Other customers have launched legal action against Boeing. Timaero, an Irish company that sells and leases aircraft, has filed a lawsuit in the US seeking to cancel an order for 22 Max jets and damages of at least $185m. Documents filed on Tuesday in a US district court alleged that Boeing had acted fraudulently in selling the troubled aircraft. Turkish Airlines, which has 24 of the planes, is also believed to be preparing legal action.</p> <p>Boeing is expected to defend the suits, and industry experts believe customers will stick with the plane, and that the traumatic episode will fade from the memory once the Max is allowed to return to the skies.</p> <p>Ashwin Tiruvasu, senior industrials analyst at CreditSights, said in a note to clients: \u201cWhile we still expect Boeing\u2019s 737 customers to stick around, further disruptions to the delivery schedule will only generate further frustration as well as more charges in terms of compensation and a likely write-off as a result.\u201d</p> <p>It may be some time, though, until investors and customers are prepared to once again embrace the mantra: \u201cIf it\u2019s not Boeing, I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p>",

Last week, the EU\u2019s aviation safety chief, Patrick Ky, said Boeing should be subjected to scrutiny from international regulators, suggesting Europe had a more \u201cstructured and rigid\u201d approach than the FAA. However, according to reports, tensions boiled over at showdown talks this month between Steve Dickson, head of the FAA, and Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s chief executive. Dickson called the meeting to address Boeing\u2019s unrealistic timetable for returning the Max to service. He felt the planemaker was putting undue pressure on the agency to recertify the plane by the end of the year. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher for Boeing. The 737 Max was previously its bestselling plane, with 580 deliveries during 2018. Boeing\u2019s overall deliveries had fallen by half during the first nine months of the year. It has nearly 4,500 on order, worth over $500bn at list prices (each costs about $121m). Since the grounding, the production rate had slowed by almost a fifth to 42 a month, with around 400 in total coming off the production line. The decision to suspend manufacturing has cast a huge cloud over the plane and raised doubts about when \u2013 or if \u2013 it will return to service. Airlines have withdrawn it from their schedules for several months. American Airlines this month pulled it until 7 April and Southwest, the biggest user of the plane, said the flying ban had cut its operating income by $830m this year. Other customers have launched legal action against Boeing. Timaero, an Irish company that sells and leases aircraft, has filed a lawsuit in the US seeking to cancel an order for 22 Max jets and damages of at least $185m. Documents filed on Tuesday in a US district court alleged that Boeing had acted fraudulently in selling the troubled aircraft. Turkish Airlines, which has 24 of the planes, is also believed to be preparing legal action. Boeing is expected to defend the suits, and industry experts believe customers will stick with the plane, and that the traumatic episode will fade from the memory once the Max is allowed to return to the skies. Ashwin Tiruvasu, senior industrials analyst at CreditSights, said in a note to clients: \u201cWhile we still expect Boeing\u2019s 737 customers to stick around, further disruptions to the delivery schedule will only generate further frustration as well as more charges in terms of compensation and a likely write-off as a result.\u201d It may be some time, though, until investors and customers are prepared to once again embrace the mantra: \u201cIf it\u2019s not Boeing, I\u2019m not going.\u201d",

If you were there, please think carefully about whether you saw or heard anything out of the ordinary and have the confidence to come forward to us.\u201d Later that evening, a man in his 20s was stabbed to death on Bromley Road, Walthamstow, north-east London, and another suffered non-life threatening injuries. A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder. On Tuesday, Albert Amofa, 33, died two days after being knifed in the leg outside his house during a \u201cbotched\u201d car robbery in Croydon, south London. Last Saturday night, a man in his 40s died after being stabbed at a property in Dagenham, east London. A woman in her 50s was also found with non-life threatening injuries and a 59-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder. On 14 December, Dmytro Balaban, 28, was knifed and died in Brent, West London. Volodymyr Holovatskyi, 23, was arrested and charged with murder the following day. The Met recorded 135 homicides in 2018, while the Home Office recorded 141 homicides in the capital, including those in the City of London police area.",

      "body": "<p>In June this year I received an email inviting me to Carlow, Ireland, to receive an award from the Nolan clan. The award was in recognition of my writing career, a little gesture of thanks for promoting the Nolan name in the world. I was dimly aware of Irish clans, largely from gift shops near tourism hotspots, where you can sometimes buy a horribly expensive sweater or scarf emblazoned with the family crest of your choice. I had no idea that they were a real-life concern. </p> <p>I wasn\u2019t living anywhere in particular. I had recently left my house in London because I couldn\u2019t easily afford it and had tired of sharing with other people. So I answered my invitation from the clan immediately, accepting a little out of curiosity and a lot because in my transient state I would take any excuse to make my way back to Ireland, where I could loaf in my parents\u2019 homes and not think much about money for a week.</p> <p>The clan system was the primary way that Irish society was organised until the 17th century, and consisted of groups related by a common ancestor. The first modern iterations began to form in the second half of the 20th century, supported by interest both at home and from the diaspora. The clans\u2019 current iteration is focused on using technology to unite members, though in-person meet ups, like the one I was invited to, are still pivotal.</p> <p>My father, Jim Nolan, a playwright who still lives in our native Waterford, 90 minutes south of Carlow, expressed mock indignation that he hadn\u2019t been chosen for the Nolan honour, and seemed confused that I was going at all. I was confused myself, not being able to imagine what the gathering would entail or why it occurred.</p> <p>I knew from browsing the clan O\u2019Nolan Facebook page that a large proportion of the attendees would be coming from abroad. A man named Christopher Nolan (not the film director) based in upstate New York had invited me and was responsible for organising the event, and I wondered what compelled him to do so. The question I wanted to get to the bottom of, not intended unkindly, was: why do you bother? And not just for Christopher, who invested so much effort and time into realising it, but to the people who travelled from the US and Canada and elsewhere. What were they getting from it? What made them care?</p> <p>***</p> <p>As a child I disliked my name and believed it not glamorous enough for the many accolades and public notices I hoped to attract in the future. I coveted a more delicate, feminine name than the solid \u201cNolan\u201d, or one with attractive strangeness \u2013 like Paz De La Huerta, or the comparatively exciting Lindsay Lohan. I could not imagine a celebrity with my name \u2013 or perhaps more accurately, I could not imagine a cool celebrity with my name. There were the Nolan Sisters, after all, blandly grinning, eternally In The Mood For Dancing. They were the kind of Irish person I shuddered away from as soon as I knew how. </p> <p>More recently, I have cultivated a vague but definite mistrust of attachment to the distant past. I was very curious about the lives of my parents before my birth, and almost as interested in my grandparents; but beyond that I felt nothing much for relatives I never knew.</p> <p>And though I love Ireland, I am leery of nationalism \u2013 even our particular kind, which could be defended as retaliatory. I was lucky to have been born into a family of people I get along with, making it easy for me to love and privilege them. But I do not consider blood bonds to be inherently more valuable than those made in other ways. Instead, I prize openness and modernity, and abandoning tradition when it does not make personal sense.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The other Nolans and their spouses began to arrive in Carlow on 13 September, and I joined them the following day, feeling absurdly nervous, as though awaiting a first date. When the group arrived, a little shy of 20 (mostly older) people, they brought to mind the Americans who would wander through Trinity College Dublin when I had briefly attended it, shockingly interested in everything, shockingly enthusiastic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A boat had been arranged to give a scenic historical tour, but the boat was not big enough to contain all the Nolans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was struck by the physical awkwardness that had cursed me as a child, not knowing what to do with my hands, feeling obscenely aware of whether I was crossing my arms or resting them on my hips. I felt horribly compelled to foist hugs on the Nolan strangers, but resisted.</p> <p>A boat had been arranged to give a scenic historical tour, but the boat was not big enough to contain all the Nolans, and so Christopher and I, and Madeline Salter (nee Nolan) abstained. I was glad of this, already anxious and socially overwhelmed and wanting to take a first pass at politely asking Christopher why he bothered.</p> <p>Christopher is an eloquent, urbane, retired architect in his late 60s. He seems to travel near-constantly with his new professional pursuit, a record label, for which he produces and promotes musicians primarily from West Africa. He has been involved with the Nolan clan since 2005; he is the incoming clan chief (a rotating role), and has for four years organised the biannual gatherings. He tells me he finds it a powerful counteraction to what he calls \u201csocietal disintegration\u201d and \u201cthe trauma of dislocation\u201d, as well as a way to understand pre- and post-colonial migration. \u201cThe whole idea of clan is a topic that people can learn from if they get beyond just the genealogy aspect,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, why did this guy leave? Why did this woman leave at this time? Or, what does it mean that they stayed?\u201d</p> <p>Genealogy is a booming business, <a href=\"https://time.com/133811/how-genealogy-became-almost-as-popular-as-porn/\" title=\"\">second only to porn</a> as an online research project in the US. There is a sub-industry of genealogy tourism packages, some of which offer tests to locate the exact origin point of your ancestor, followed by a toured vacation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dabbf7f2f1cd2e6d9b0b15db6dd73425b512894f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dabbf7f2f1cd2e6d9b0b15db6dd73425b512894f/35_394_4281_2569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outgoing clan chief Catherina Nolan O\u2019Brien with the clan spear, and incoming chief Christopher Nolan with the clan staff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outgoing clan chief Catherina Nolan O\u2019Brien with the clan spear, and incoming chief Christopher Nolan with the clan staff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Harris/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On our Saturday in Carlow, local genealogist Bernie Walsh gave a presentation about research methodology. It was true, undoubtedly, that the international Nolans had come to the gathering as part of a holiday, but it was clear also that the genealogy was no incidental bonus. During the presentation they leaned forward, setting down pints, peering closer to the screen as Bernie projected a census. They asked politely for her to zoom in and find traces of the relatives they had already researched thoroughly enough to know were present. I concede that I probably invented, purely to entertain myself, the mild edge of competition when one woman referred to the fact that she had been able to go as far as 18 generations back. But it was certain that these were serious people who spend serious time on what it is probably patronising to call a hobby.</p> <p>After the talk we retired to get ready for the dinner and awards. I had enjoyed meeting the invariably gregarious Nolans, but felt no closer to understanding their pursuits. I was exhausted and struggling to relate to what was taking place. In my B&amp;B, I lay naked on the bed, watched three episodes of Friends and consumed the instant coffee and packaged biscotti. Give me that sweet homogenised globalisation, I thought. It\u2019s difficult enough to understand your actual family, let alone your 18-generations-ago possible-family.</p> <p>At dinner I sat next to Greg, a handsome, genial 30-year-old from Austin. I can imagine that in a different time of my life I would have proposed some drunken remotely incestuous making out with him by the end of the evening. Greg was in the UK for six months and his father, a genealogy enthusiast, had suggested he come to Ireland for the Nolan gathering. We huddled together at our table like kids at a wedding. When Greg referred to having interned at the State Capitol, I feared that an American with an interest in their Irish ancestry was likely to be rightwing, even one as young and fresh-faced as Greg, and I unsubtly asked leading questions until it emerged that he was a Democrat. We agreed that the Celtic font of the Nolan clan crest was unfortunately reminiscent of alt-right imagery, and he pointed out the potency of the word \u201cclan\u201d in an American context.</p> <p>That was the other thing \u2013 the politics. Christopher Nolan had told me that he liked the clan meet-ups for the absence of politics. \u201cI don\u2019t know Pa Nolan, or Madeline\u2019s politics, or they mine. You could assume them, but you don\u2019t know.\u201d I understand what he means, and yet nothing is quite without politics. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was blinking back tears, astonished by my capacity to be moved in this brightly lit hotel room full of strangers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ireland is used to justify a lot of American reactionism, most notably the widespread insistence on Irish singularity as immigrants (we built everything and then we assimilated; we\u2019re the good kind, not the welfare kind), and peddling the myth of \u201cIrish slavery\u201d to draw false equivalence with African American chattel slavery.

A newspaper article she found recently shows their first meeting in 1997. John was chief of the clan at one stage, and after he died, some of the other members asked Madeline if she might help out. She\u2019d like her own children to take an interest at some stage, she says, because she wants the values of kindness and decency passed on to them as they were to her. \u201cDaddy was a good man,\u201d she says. \u201cHe never did anything wrong to anybody, and he had morals, but he didn\u2019t force them on anyone. He tried to sort of give you them if you wanted them.\u201d</p> <p>Apart from me, the other award recipient was Des Nolan, an 83-year-old Galway man and retired teacher, who once successfully lobbied the government to get a restrictive angling law changed \u201cso that any boy or girl could wander down to the river and catch a fish\u201d. He made a beautiful speech that made me think of those ephemeral Irish things that are difficult to describe, to do with lyricism and nature and freedom. </p> <p>When Des had finished his speech, and my own award was being given, I found I was blinking back tears, astonished by my own capacity to be moved by anything in this brightly lit regional hotel room full of strangers. Ancestry is not a method of understanding one\u2019s self that I relate to personally, but the idea of using a place as a prism is familiar. I understand how countries and borders mean more than what they literally are. It\u2019s just that the past seems less relevant to me than it does to the other Nolans. The way the past stretched back unendingly was a comfort to me when I used to fear the future, but now I find it doesn\u2019t console me. Instead it makes me feel guilty, because it feels so much like the world is ending. All that, I think about the past, for nothing?</p> <p>But of course, even if the world does end, all that came before wouldn\u2019t have been for nothing. Goodness (and badness) exists for its own sake, not in relation to an end goal. Maybe there was no good answer that would satisfy me about why the Nolans bothered to come; maybe the ambivalence was perfectly fine; maybe it was enough that they\u2019d come at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2dbb1de20316d1474de51046bb63f24666df7dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2dbb1de20316d1474de51046bb63f24666df7dd/163_344_4829_2897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Desmond Nolan tries to remember the lyrics of an Irish folk song.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Desmond Nolan tries to remember the lyrics of an Irish folk song.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Harris/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I spent the rest of the night drinking with the hardcore Nolans willing to take advantage of the infinite opening hours of Irish hotel bars. The Nolan name still didn\u2019t feel like it meant anything to me beyond my own family, but I was enjoying myself anyway. That nice Irish trait of genuinely wanting to chat to any stranger you meet in the pub was taking hold, and there was suddenly nothing more interesting than how Kathy Nolan, a radiantly charming maths lecturer from Canada, had ended up here (\u201cI learned that my name meant \u2018nobility\u2019 a long time ago and I always said I would come to Ireland some day and claim my castle\u201d).</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that I understood better why the name mattered, or why people feel as they do about their DNA and their ancestry. It was that our meeting each other had become good in spite of the meaninglessness. As Christopher said, it was all these people with nothing really in common, and even though the one thing they did have in common did not awaken anything in me, it was good to be there with them anyway. I would not pore over census records or search out sites of mass war burial, but I would happily talk to the living people around me and drink with them until it was light out. Sometimes it feels good to do things that mean nothing until they begin to mean something. Like prayer, the meaning arrives slowly, surprisingly, and through the doing, not the believing.</p> <p>\u2022 Megan Nolan\u2019s debut novel, Acts Of Desperation, will be published by Jonathan Cape in 2021.</p> <p>If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

I understand how countries and borders mean more than what they literally are. It\u2019s just that the past seems less relevant to me than it does to the other Nolans. The way the past stretched back unendingly was a comfort to me when I used to fear the future, but now I find it doesn\u2019t console me. Instead it makes me feel guilty, because it feels so much like the world is ending. All that, I think about the past, for nothing? But of course, even if the world does end, all that came before wouldn\u2019t have been for nothing. Goodness (and badness) exists for its own sake, not in relation to an end goal. Maybe there was no good answer that would satisfy me about why the Nolans bothered to come; maybe the ambivalence was perfectly fine; maybe it was enough that they\u2019d come at all. I spent the rest of the night drinking with the hardcore Nolans willing to take advantage of the infinite opening hours of Irish hotel bars. The Nolan name still didn\u2019t feel like it meant anything to me beyond my own family, but I was enjoying myself anyway. That nice Irish trait of genuinely wanting to chat to any stranger you meet in the pub was taking hold, and there was suddenly nothing more interesting than how Kathy Nolan, a radiantly charming maths lecturer from Canada, had ended up here (\u201cI learned that my name meant \u2018nobility\u2019 a long time ago and I always said I would come to Ireland some day and claim my castle\u201d). It wasn\u2019t that I understood better why the name mattered, or why people feel as they do about their DNA and their ancestry. It was that our meeting each other had become good in spite of the meaninglessness. As Christopher said, it was all these people with nothing really in common, and even though the one thing they did have in common did not awaken anything in me, it was good to be there with them anyway. I would not pore over census records or search out sites of mass war burial, but I would happily talk to the living people around me and drink with them until it was light out. Sometimes it feels good to do things that mean nothing until they begin to mean something. Like prayer, the meaning arrives slowly, surprisingly, and through the doing, not the believing. \u2022 Megan Nolan\u2019s debut novel, Acts Of Desperation, will be published by Jonathan Cape in 2021.

      "body": "<p>My husband and I don\u2019t think we have the condition until, one day last month, hundreds of miles from home, we find ourselves outside our younger son\u2019s university accommodation at 11.30 on a Sunday morning. I am clutching supplies in a little brown paper bag. Our son knows we\u2019re in town, but isn\u2019t expecting this rude awakening. It\u2019s a surprise.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think we should have called first?\u201d I say as we approach the entrance, the inappropriateness of what we\u2019re doing dawning on me only now.</p> <p>My husband pulls a face; it\u2019s his moment of awakening, too. \u201cCall now,\u201d he says. \u201cTell him we\u2019re on our way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019re already here.\u201d</p> <p>We both suddenly see what we have become: two newbie empty-nester weirdos. For anyone to pitch up at an 18-year-old\u2019s gaff on a Sunday morning is never a good idea. For the parents to do so is intrusive and insensitive. I call anyway. We\u2019ve rustled up two blueberry muffins and an apple from the hotel breakfast buffet and picked up some fresh orange juice. Plus, we\u2019ve spent 20 minutes walking here. And he needs to know we care.</p> <p>At first he does not pick up. When he does, he says in a sleep-strangled drawl: \u201cMaybe could you just go away and come back later.\u201d</p> <p>Fair enough, even quite polite, in the circumstances. But I say: \u201cWell, actually, we\u2019re already outside. Maybe you could just nip to the door and then go back to bed?\u201d Cue a heartfelt groan. A few minutes later a hand appears through the opened door. The bag disappears.</p> <p>So, it\u2019s official then. We have Empty Nest Syndrome (ENS). Since our second son left for university in September we have joined \u201cthe left behind\u201d, to coin a spooky-sounding term from a 2018 study of this non-clinical condition, conducted in China. It sounds like a six-part TV drama: <em>One empty nest and two parents who will stop at nothing to clip their children\u2019s wings</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>China takes ENS very seriously. It's predicted that by 2030 there will be more than 200m empty-nesters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Episode one starts this Christmas with me pimping the nest within an inch of its life so that the boys weep at the downy, desirable thing called home and never want to leave again. That was the plan until, earlier this month, two different friends poisoned my ear within 24 hours of each other, casually remarking that this might be the last time my sons came home for Crimbo. Sorry, what? They might choose to have it elsewhere in the future, one said breezily, or with friends or squeezes, said the other.</p> <p>I am fully aware that children leave home, with some boomeranging back when it suits. I also know that parenting is a process of letting go, and not just of a disposable income. Migration is natural. But the idea that a cuckoo might entice my sons away with a more attractive festive roost makes me defensive, primally so. Plus, it ramps up the pressure to put on the best Christmas ever, and I already do a good one. But piling on the bling is a no-no, the end-of-childhood bell having already been sounded by my sons banning Poundshop junk, plastic and \u201chumorous\u201d gifts, such as wind-up Trump figurines, tabletop golf and novelty socks. This year, stockings must contain sustainable, sophisticated <em>objets</em>. Quality over quantity is the watchword. All very grown-up \u2013 and there\u2019s the rub. I appear to have joined what other ENS studies refer to as \u201cmidlife parents\u201d, \u201cempty nest older adults\u201d, and \u201cthe elderly whose children have left the old adults alone at home\u201d. <em>The elderly. The old adults</em>. No wonder I feel washed up. Time has been called on the chief focus of my existence for the past 20 years.</p> <p>It is predicted that by 2030 there will be more than 200m empty-nesters in China, a country that takes ENS very seriously, partly because the one-child policy implemented in 1980 (and terminated in 2015) means that for a vast swathe of empty-nesters there isn\u2019t even the salve of a nest half-full, a period of transition in which the children leave one by one, supposedly softening the blow. I\u2019ve had this, thanks to a two-year age gap between my sons. It hasn\u2019t made their launch any easier, possibly because I thought I would be glad when my second son \u201cmigrated\u201d. I looked forward to more time for myself. But I hadn\u2019t factored in the other bird in my nest: the husband.</p> <p>Forget all that indulgent \u201cme time\u201d, the empty nest, chirp the experts, is a chance to \u201creconnect\u201d and \u201crekindle\u201d your relationship. Ours is very satisfactory as it is, thank you very much. But no, we must plan adventures together, say husband-and-wife marital wisdom podcasters <a href=\"https://ourpeacefulfamily.com/\" title=\"\">Ashley and Marcus Kusi</a>, authors of <em>Our Bucket List Adventures: a Journal for Couples</em>. Hmmm. Bucket lists, with their implications of the Grim Reaper metering your time, are not for me. There is no way I am going to invite my husband to celebrate our mortality \u00e0 deux.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Since our sons have left, the fridge has been empty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cRepurpose yourself\u201d is another common recommendation, which makes me feel like upcycled furniture. Kim Smith, an American counsellor and author of <em>Embracing Next: an Empty Nest Enjoyment Guide</em>, says it\u2019s time to focus on the future. She\u2019s keen on the \u201cre\u201d prefix, too. \u201cReframe, refocus and refeather\u201d is her mantra for \u201cmaximising your enjoyment of the next chapter of life\u201d.</p> <p>US holistic psychotherapist Dina Molina, author of <em>Empty Nest, Sexy House</em>, talks of the \u201csexy power\u201d that is ours for the taking. Go out, she says, have fun with friends, renovate your home. <a href=\"https://www.getold.com/how-to-fill-an-empty-nest-with-your-own-style\" title=\"\">Erin Marshall</a>, a US interior designer, actually specialises in EN renovations. Avoid turning your house into a shrine by filling every wall with photographs of your kids; curate them on a single wall instead, she advises. After all, she implies, you don\u2019t want to look desperate.</p> <p>But maybe we are. A friend tells of how he recently traipsed across his son\u2019s town one sodden morning carrying bags of groceries for him. \u201cI felt like a bird taking worms to the nest,\u201d he tells me. Doing so sated his need to nurture, feed and provide, a need that he said can feel like a craving. Another parent has arranged an overnight business trip to her child\u2019s university 300 miles away so that she can fill her daughter\u2019s fridge, as she puts it, the night before her exams.</p> <p>I wish she\u2019d fill my fridge. Since our sons have left, it\u2019s empty. It used to be bursting with food \u2013 meat for the carnivore, fish for the pescatarian, beers in case mates came over, a freezer full of pizzas for late-night munchies. I find it ghoulishly fascinating that, having nurtured our two sons for two decades, I now seem unable to feed, let alone nurture, myself or my husband. I have to force myself to buy groceries and remind myself it\u2019s not fair to leave the husband to do all the cooking. On the upside, it is very nice to be waited on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I catch myself wanting my currency as a mother affirmed, which feels weird and needy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At least we don\u2019t cry during meals. An artist friend told me that when the eldest of her three children left home, she and her husband sat at the supper table with tears streaming down their faces, for weeks. So did the younger daughter, aged 16, and their son, 11. \u201cMy daughter missed her big sister,\u201d says the mother, \u201cand said she had lost her best friend. We were desolate.\u201d The mother went into therapy for six months.</p> <p>Grief is one of a litany of symptoms that includes sadness, loneliness, anxiety, restlessness, guilt, bodily aches and pains, anger, irritability and frustration. A dip in self-esteem is another which, compounded by a loss of social connections and a change in identity, is likened to the feelings experienced by the unemployed. For my part, I find myself questioning what, if anything, I can still offer my children, beyond love, a roof and a nice line in banana muffins; worse, I catch myself wanting my currency as a mother affirmed, which feels weird and needy. As ever, parenting is not about me, alas, or at least is not supposed to be.</p> <p>If only we didn\u2019t live as long as we now do, or involve ourselves in our children\u2019s lives as much as we do. Back in 1900, short life spans and children living at home meant the empty nest only lasted two years. In the 1970s, when sociologists first popularised the term empty nest, it was 13 years. Today, with male and female <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/bulletins/nationallifetablesunitedkingdom/2015to2017\" title=\"\">life expectancy</a> now at 79 and 83 respectively and the average age at which adult children fly the nest for good being 26, we\u2019re talking decades \u2013 and that, I realise, still gives me plenty of Christmases to gild the nest.</p> <p><em>Milkshakes and Morphine: a Memoir of Love and Life by Genevieve Fox is published by Vintage at \u00a38.99.

      "bodyText": "My husband and I don\u2019t think we have the condition until, one day last month, hundreds of miles from home, we find ourselves outside our younger son\u2019s university accommodation at 11.30 on a Sunday morning. I am clutching supplies in a little brown paper bag. Our son knows we\u2019re in town, but isn\u2019t expecting this rude awakening. It\u2019s a surprise. \u201cDo you think we should have called first?\u201d I say as we approach the entrance, the inappropriateness of what we\u2019re doing dawning on me only now. My husband pulls a face; it\u2019s his moment of awakening, too. \u201cCall now,\u201d he says. \u201cTell him we\u2019re on our way.\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019re already here.\u201d We both suddenly see what we have become: two newbie empty-nester weirdos. For anyone to pitch up at an 18-year-old\u2019s gaff on a Sunday morning is never a good idea. For the parents to do so is intrusive and insensitive. I call anyway. We\u2019ve rustled up two blueberry muffins and an apple from the hotel breakfast buffet and picked up some fresh orange juice. Plus, we\u2019ve spent 20 minutes walking here. And he needs to know we care. At first he does not pick up. When he does, he says in a sleep-strangled drawl: \u201cMaybe could you just go away and come back later.\u201d Fair enough, even quite polite, in the circumstances. But I say: \u201cWell, actually, we\u2019re already outside. Maybe you could just nip to the door and then go back to bed?\u201d Cue a heartfelt groan. A few minutes later a hand appears through the opened door. The bag disappears. So, it\u2019s official then. We have Empty Nest Syndrome (ENS). Since our second son left for university in September we have joined \u201cthe left behind\u201d, to coin a spooky-sounding term from a 2018 study of this non-clinical condition, conducted in China. It sounds like a six-part TV drama: One empty nest and two parents who will stop at nothing to clip their children\u2019s wings. Episode one starts this Christmas with me pimping the nest within an inch of its life so that the boys weep at the downy, desirable thing called home and never want to leave again. That was the plan until, earlier this month, two different friends poisoned my ear within 24 hours of each other, casually remarking that this might be the last time my sons came home for Crimbo. Sorry, what? They might choose to have it elsewhere in the future, one said breezily, or with friends or squeezes, said the other. I am fully aware that children leave home, with some boomeranging back when it suits. I also know that parenting is a process of letting go, and not just of a disposable income. Migration is natural. But the idea that a cuckoo might entice my sons away with a more attractive festive roost makes me defensive, primally so. Plus, it ramps up the pressure to put on the best Christmas ever, and I already do a good one. But piling on the bling is a no-no, the end-of-childhood bell having already been sounded by my sons banning Poundshop junk, plastic and \u201chumorous\u201d gifts, such as wind-up Trump figurines, tabletop golf and novelty socks. This year, stockings must contain sustainable, sophisticated objets. Quality over quantity is the watchword. All very grown-up \u2013 and there\u2019s the rub. I appear to have joined what other ENS studies refer to as \u201cmidlife parents\u201d, \u201cempty nest older adults\u201d, and \u201cthe elderly whose children have left the old adults alone at home\u201d. The elderly. The old adults. No wonder I feel washed up. Time has been called on the chief focus of my existence for the past 20 years. It is predicted that by 2030 there will be more than 200m empty-nesters in China, a country that takes ENS very seriously, partly because the one-child policy implemented in 1980 (and terminated in 2015) means that for a vast swathe of empty-nesters there isn\u2019t even the salve of a nest half-full, a period of transition in which the children leave one by one, supposedly softening the blow. I\u2019ve had this, thanks to a two-year age gap between my sons. It hasn\u2019t made their launch any easier, possibly because I thought I would be glad when my second son \u201cmigrated\u201d. I looked forward to more time for myself. But I hadn\u2019t factored in the other bird in my nest: the husband. Forget all that indulgent \u201cme time\u201d, the empty nest, chirp the experts, is a chance to \u201creconnect\u201d and \u201crekindle\u201d your relationship. Ours is very satisfactory as it is, thank you very much. But no, we must plan adventures together, say husband-and-wife marital wisdom podcasters Ashley and Marcus Kusi, authors of Our Bucket List Adventures: a Journal for Couples. Hmmm. Bucket lists, with their implications of the Grim Reaper metering your time, are not for me. There is no way I am going to invite my husband to celebrate our mortality \u00e0 deux. \u201cRepurpose yourself\u201d is another common recommendation, which makes me feel like upcycled furniture. Kim Smith, an American counsellor and author of Embracing Next: an Empty Nest Enjoyment Guide, says it\u2019s time to focus on the future. She\u2019s keen on the \u201cre\u201d prefix, too. \u201cReframe, refocus and refeather\u201d is her mantra for \u201cmaximising your enjoyment of the next chapter of life\u201d. US holistic psychotherapist Dina Molina, author of Empty Nest, Sexy House, talks of the \u201csexy power\u201d that is ours for the taking. Go out, she says, have fun with friends, renovate your home. Erin Marshall, a US interior designer, actually specialises in EN renovations. Avoid turning your house into a shrine by filling every wall with photographs of your kids; curate them on a single wall instead, she advises. After all, she implies, you don\u2019t want to look desperate. But maybe we are. A friend tells of how he recently traipsed across his son\u2019s town one sodden morning carrying bags of groceries for him. \u201cI felt like a bird taking worms to the nest,\u201d he tells me. Doing so sated his need to nurture, feed and provide, a need that he said can feel like a craving. Another parent has arranged an overnight business trip to her child\u2019s university 300 miles away so that she can fill her daughter\u2019s fridge, as she puts it, the night before her exams. I wish she\u2019d fill my fridge. Since our sons have left, it\u2019s empty. It used to be bursting with food \u2013 meat for the carnivore, fish for the pescatarian, beers in case mates came over, a freezer full of pizzas for late-night munchies. I find it ghoulishly fascinating that, having nurtured our two sons for two decades, I now seem unable to feed, let alone nurture, myself or my husband. I have to force myself to buy groceries and remind myself it\u2019s not fair to leave the husband to do all the cooking. On the upside, it is very nice to be waited on. At least we don\u2019t cry during meals. An artist friend told me that when the eldest of her three children left home, she and her husband sat at the supper table with tears streaming down their faces, for weeks. So did the younger daughter, aged 16, and their son, 11. \u201cMy daughter missed her big sister,\u201d says the mother, \u201cand said she had lost her best friend. We were desolate.\u201d The mother went into therapy for six months. Grief is one of a litany of symptoms that includes sadness, loneliness, anxiety, restlessness, guilt, bodily aches and pains, anger, irritability and frustration. A dip in self-esteem is another which, compounded by a loss of social connections and a change in identity, is likened to the feelings experienced by the unemployed. For my part, I find myself questioning what, if anything, I can still offer my children, beyond love, a roof and a nice line in banana muffins; worse, I catch myself wanting my currency as a mother affirmed, which feels weird and needy. As ever, parenting is not about me, alas, or at least is not supposed to be. If only we didn\u2019t live as long as we now do, or involve ourselves in our children\u2019s lives as much as we do. Back in 1900, short life spans and children living at home meant the empty nest only lasted two years. In the 1970s, when sociologists first popularised the term empty nest, it was 13 years. Today, with male and female life expectancy now at 79 and 83 respectively and the average age at which adult children fly the nest for good being 26, we\u2019re talking decades \u2013 and that, I realise, still gives me plenty of Christmases to gild the nest.

The prime minister took an RAF A330 plane for the one-day trip to the Baltic state on Saturday morning. Johnson served turkey and Yorkshire puddings to troops from the Queen\u2019s Royal Hussars at the Tapa military base near the capital, Tallinn, to thank them for their service. The soldiers, along with personnel from Estonia, France and Denmark, lead the Nato battlegroup to protect Europe\u2019s eastern border with Russia. Johnson held a bilateral meeting with his Estonian counterpart, J\u00fcri Ratas. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: \u201cThe leaders discussed the close partnership between the UK and Estonia, in particular our joint security and defence cooperation. The prime minister reaffirmed the UK\u2019s unconditional commitment to Estonia\u2019s regional security through Nato. \u201cThe two leaders discussed the need to work together to address shared global challenges and the prime minister invited prime minister Ratas to attend the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow next year.\u201d During his visit, Johnson was asked if he would look at how the Ministry of Defence spends its money after the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, warned serving personnel to be braced for cutbacks as part of his effort to secure more long-term investment in defence. Johnson said: \u201cI\u2019m a big supporter of our armed forces \u2013 I think they do a massive amount of good around the world.

The cabinet minister added: \u201cBy doing so we build our credibility with the Treasury and No 10 to say: \u2018Look, we have sorted out our house, when you give us some more money we will deliver on what we\u2019re trying to do and there will be no tricks.\u2019\u201d Wallace also confirmed reports that Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, will be involved in a reorganisation of defence procurement after the strategist wrote a number of scathing blogs about the MoD before joining the government.

There\u2019s things we can work on, but it\u2019s a good start for us. Mikel just wants us to be brave, take responsibility and work hard for each other. Those are the messages from him. I feel we did that today, and now there\u2019s a lot more we can work on. His philosophy and the things he wants to bring to the team, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be working hard on that this week. We knew it was going to be tough, we knew they were going to want to fight, so we had to be up for that challenge.

Duncan Ferguson said he wanted to be tucking into Christmas dinner with another three points in the bag, but as Everton games under their colourful caretaker manager go, this was quiet.</p> <p>As openings of new eras go, with both Carlo Ancelotti and Mikel Arteta watching from the stands, it was worryingly underwhelming. Everton saved one of their most insipid performances of a below average season for their freshly arrived new manager, while Arsenal gave an adequate account of themselves but no more, Freddie Ljungberg\u2019s challenging selection giving Arteta plenty to think about. The bad news for Ancelotti is that his new side looked as if they could play until Christmas without scoring a goal, and though credit is due to a callow Arsenal side for showing resilience the Italian must already be concerned about how Everton might perform against a proper Premier League side, not one showcasing their talent at under-23 level.</p> </blockquote> <p>Much more here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/everton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Everton and Arsenal frustrate and show Ancelotti and Arteta challenges</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T14:35:38.287Z\">at 2.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfe2bd78f085eda5c10bf80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T14:30:55.872Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Duncan Ferguson has a chat. </strong>He is extremely chirpy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ideally we wanted three points, but what a fantastic performance we put in.

Both sides struggled for a bit of quality, but we\u2019ve asked the same players to play week, in week out so they\u2019re a bit leggy today, but what a fantastic effort. They\u2019ve dug in and got a clean sheet for us. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve ended not with defeat, put it that way. I\u2019m delighted we got a draw.

His philosophy and the things he wants to bring to the team, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be working hard on that this week. We knew it was going to be tough, we knew they were going to want to fight, so we had to be up for that challenge. It\u2019s a promising group, and we\u2019ve just got to work hard, build on that performance, work on things on the training ground and keep going. Here\u2019s Paul Wilson\u2019s match report from Goodison Park: The best that could be said of this anticlimactic affair is that both Everton and Arsenal will be reasonably happy with a point apiece. Duncan Ferguson said he wanted to be tucking into Christmas dinner with another three points in the bag, but as Everton games under their colourful caretaker manager go, this was quiet. As openings of new eras go, with both Carlo Ancelotti and Mikel Arteta watching from the stands, it was worryingly underwhelming. Everton saved one of their most insipid performances of a below average season for their freshly arrived new manager, while Arsenal gave an adequate account of themselves but no more, Freddie Ljungberg\u2019s challenging selection giving Arteta plenty to think about. The bad news for Ancelotti is that his new side looked as if they could play until Christmas without scoring a goal, and though credit is due to a callow Arsenal side for showing resilience the Italian must already be concerned about how Everton might perform against a proper Premier League side, not one showcasing their talent at under-23 level. Much more here: Duncan Ferguson has a chat. He is extremely chirpy: Ideally we wanted three points, but what a fantastic performance we put in. We never quite had the legs, but it was a game of few chances but the boys didn\u2019t half dig in. I couldn\u2019t have asked for any more from them. They\u2019ve been incredible for me. Both sides struggled for a bit of quality, but we\u2019ve asked the same players to play week, in week out so they\u2019re a bit leggy today, but what a fantastic effort. They\u2019ve dug in and got a clean sheet for us. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve ended not with defeat, put it that way. I\u2019m delighted we got a draw. We\u2019re undefeated since I\u2019ve been in, so we\u2019re absolutely delighted. It\u2019s brilliant, it\u2019s fantastic for the club, isn\u2019t it? A guy of that pedigree coming in here. I can\u2019t wait to start working with him, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll learn a lot. I haven\u2019t spoken to him at all but hopefully we\u2019ll chat tonight with a glass of red wine. If I give him a few bowls of red wine I might become co-manager or something. 90+5 mins: Stoppage time was almost entirely stoppage, and it ends with no big breakthrough. The stalest of mates. 90+3 mins: Sidibe crosses from the right. Xhaka heads the ball, Richarlison heads Chambers, and the physios come on. 90+1 mins: Willock ends a brief festival of ball-surrendering with a booking for a foul on Sigurdsson. Again there didn\u2019t look like much contact or intent there. 90+1 mins: Into stoppage time. There\u2019ll be three more minutes of this. Please, make it stop. 89 mins: Rage from the crowd as Everton cunningly turn dangerous possession on the right flank to a 60-yard back-pass in the space of five seconds, and then Pickford boots the ball straight into touch. 88 mins: Digne\u2019s set-piece delivery is again poor, and the ball is headed clear. 87 mins: Chambers tries to clear a ball that has just been nicked off him by Holgate, gets a bit of the Everton player instead, and is booked. Everton have a tasty free-kick opportunity on the left flank. 84 mins: Xhaka has the ball in midfield, and has so much space and time to consider his options. There is absolutely no effort to close him down. None. In front of him, Lacazette starts a run in behind the defence. Xhaka looks up, waits until he is behind the defence, and then passes the ball forward. Offside. Terrible play by everyone. 82 mins: Mason Holgate tries a simple pass up the left flank, and sends it straight to a yellow shirt. Some of the passing in this game has been absolutely dreadful. 80 mins: Once again, an Everton substitute striker is substituted. Kean replaces Tosun, who blanks Duncan Ferguson and is straight down the tunnel. 78 mins: Lacazette comes on, and Aubameyang goes off. 76 mins: \u201cI\u2019m questioning whether Lacazette would be a more useful option as a focal point for this Arsenal offence right now,\u201d writes John Nekrasov. \u201cAuba is looking for quality balls in behind that he\u2019s never going to get and someone has to drop deeper to link play.\u201d Well it looks like Ljungberg has a similar opinion, as the Frenchman is getting ready. 75 mins: Sigurdsson becomes the third Everton player to be booked, for tripping Saka. 73 mins: Everton bring Michael Keane on for Delph, their second change of the afternoon. 71 mins: Aubameyang has another shot, from a Maitland-Niles cross, but it\u2019s rushed, high and wide. Replays show that, from the corner that followed that Calvert-Lewin shot a couple of minutes ago, the ball hit an Arsenal hand, but there was no hint of intent, and no penalty. \u201cHands up who got worried when they read \u2018Sidibe\u2019 and \u2018Ron Atkinson quote\u2019 in the same sentence?\u201d muses Stephen. 68 mins: Some decent work from Richarlison on the left, who picks out Calvert-Lewin on the edge of the area. His shot looks goalbound, but two Arsenal players launch themselves at it, and it hits Torreira. 66 mins: Arsenal make their first change, taking Smith Rowe off and bringing Willock on. With Pepe, Lacazette and Guendouzi still on the bench, French-speakers seem to be unpopular this week. 64 mins: The ball is played wide to Sidibe on the Everton right, who calls to mind the old Ron Atkinson quote about Carlton Palmer being able to \u201ctrap the ball further than I can kick it\u201d. Arsenal take it back. 62 mins: David Luiz brings Tosun down from behind. It\u2019s a common-or-garden calf-clip, not much to it, but the Brazilian has done quite a lot of fouling today without being booked, while Tom Davies was cautioned for approximately nothing. 60 mins: There has been a real momentum switch since half-time, with Arsenal now the least bad team (I did consider using the word \u201cbetter\u201d there, but decided it was inappropriate). 57 mins: Smith Rowe goes on a fine, driving run through midfield. It doesn\u2019t lead to anything, but is precisely the type of central midfield play that didn\u2019t happen at all in the first half and could really have helped. 54 mins: Now Sigurdsson\u2019s shot is deflected wide for a corner. It\u2019s all going on (though the corner is poor, and easily cleared). \u201cRegarding Allardyce\u2019s verdict, Pontus K\u00e5mark (who played for Leicester once upon a time) is in the Swedish studio and ripping Arsenal\u2019s defending into confetti,\u201d reports H\u00e5kan Burden. \u201cGeneral opinion in the studio is that this is the worst game this season. And despite Swedish media usually being very loyal towards Swedish players and trainers abroad, no one gets Ljungberg\u2019s selection for this game.\u201d 52 mins: Another shot on target! Incredible scenes! Torreira does well to carry the ball forward and then pass infield to Aubameyang, whose shot from the edge of the area is weak but does, at least, exist. 51 mins: A shot on target! And an excellent save! Arsenal win another corner, and it\u2019s flicked on at the near post to Aubameyang, just beyond the far, who turns it goalwards but Pickford pushes it away! 49 mins: Arsenal win their first corner of the match, as Nelson\u2019s cross is deflected behind. From the set-piece, his ball in is booted clear. 47 mins: A shot! And it\u2019s the least off-target of the game so far! It\u2019s a left-footer from Richarlison, which fizzes low across goal and wide of the far post. 46 mins: Another misplaced pass for those Aubameyang statistics. Delph then wins the ball of Xhaka with a sliding tackle. Xhaka hurdles it, and then goes down screaming and clutching his knee. 46 mins: Peeeeeeep! They\u2019re off! The players are back out! Just another 45 minutes of this to go! In this line-up, Aubameyang should be Arsenal\u2019s outstanding attacking player. Safe to say he has not stood out: On BT Sport, Sam Allardyce is laying into Everton: The basic errors, I don\u2019t think he would have expected of a Premier League outfit. To see as many as I\u2019ve just seen shocked me. Maybe they\u2019re a bit leggy, because they played in midweek and it went to penalties. But at the end of the day as professionals they deserve to be delivering a lot more than they\u2019re delivering. 45+3 mins: An emphatically goalless half. Things can only get better. 45+1 mins: Stoppage time has begun, and there will be two minutes of it, or thereabouts. 44 mins: Arsenal have a shot! Martinelli is found in space on the left, but he lashes his shot wide of the near post! The referee goes back to book Davies for a foul on Torreira in the build-up, which looks a ludicrous decision to me. There was little or no contact there. 44 mins: Davies gets into right side of the penalty area, and his cross might well have been turned in by Richarlison at the far post had it not thunked right into Tosun at the near. 42 mins: Everton pass the ball across the defence. In midfield, Sigurdsson wildly gesticulates towards Sidibe, telling him to bomb down the right wing. He doesn\u2019t, gets the ball anyway, turns and passes it back again. 39 mins: Everton have been a little bit more inventive, but there\u2019s not a lot in it. What we are watching, in short, is two teams in desperate need of new coaches and some fresh ideas. 35 mins: Arsenal get the ball to within 20 yards of Everton\u2019s penalty area, before slowly working it back to their defence. They really seem totally devoid of hope, idea or indeed clue when they attempt to attack. 33 mins: Sidibe is tripped by Martinelli on Arsenal\u2019s left wing but the referee waves play on, allowing Saka to pick up the ball and run unmolested to the edge of the area, but his cross curls out of play. 32 mins: Key match stats so far: Shots: Everton 4-0 Arsenal. Shots on target: Everton 0-0 Arsenal. 30 mins: Not much to do with this game (alright, nothing) but these two photos being tweeted within 30 seconds of each other couldn\u2019t go unmentioned. There\u2019s been no sign of rain at Everton, though. Quite the opposite, with glaring sunshine making Leno\u2019s life a bit uncomfortable. 28 mins: Another free-kick for Arsenal. Nelson crosses and Pickford comes out to punch. Neither goalkeeper has had much to do so far, but then Everton go up the other end and Leno has to come out to the right flank to tidy up and clear into touch. Saka kicks the ball away to stop Everton taking the throw-in before Leno is safely back in his goal, and thus becomes the first player to be booked. 26 mins: Digne takes out Martinelli on the right. So far there have been a lot of free-kicks in this game, and not much else. 22 mins: David Luiz takes out Calvert-Lewin out on Arsenal\u2019s left, conceding another free-kick. The home fans boo, but the referee keeps his cards pocketed. 21 mins: Arsenal really have done very little attacking. They pass the ball around in defence for a while, and then Chambers pumps a long-ball forward. Not a bad idea, as Arsenal snaffle the second ball, but they can\u2019t do anything with it. 19 mins: The home side have started well, and they push forward again only for Richarlison to go down over Luiz\u2019s challenge. From just outside the left-hand corner of the area, Sigurdsson curls a shot wide of the near post. 17 mins: Delph crosses again, and this time it flicks of David Luiz\u2019s head to Richarlison, on the right side of the area, who takes a touch to control, allowing Saka to get across to block the shot that follows. 16 mins: Meanwhile on Everton\u2019s left flank, the home side win a free-kick. Digne sends it into the area, successfully beating the first defender this time, but it\u2019s headed away. 14 mins: Now Martinelli is down and clutching his right ankle, after a collision with Sidibe out on Arsenal\u2019s left flank. 12 mins: The first shot of the game comes from the person who has played least of it. Tosun\u2019s first touch sets him up for a shot, and his second sends the ball whizzing way over the bar. 10 mins: Iwobi\u2019s day is done. He walks slowly from the field, to be replaced by Cenk Tosun, and it is fair to say that his big chance to show his former team what they\u2019re missing has not gone as he hoped. 8 mins: Digne\u2019s second corner, like his first, is volleyed clear at the near post, to the sound of loud grumbling from the stands. 8 mins: Iwobi remains on the pitch, and isn\u2019t noticeably limping. But then, he\u2019s not noticeably doing very much else either. Everton, though, win another corner. 6 mins: Alex Iwobi is clutching his right hamstring. Meanwhile Nelson gets into the box, but is closed down before he can get his shot away. 4 mins: Calvert-Lewin and Lucas Digne both try to reach a loose ball before Torreira gets it, and end up colliding at full pace. After a bit of treatment, both are fine. 3 mins: Everton win the game\u2019s first corner, but Lucas Digne\u2019s set-piece is really very poor, and volleyed clear at the near post. 2 mins: Very little in the way of early action. Instead I\u2019ve been flicking through archive photos to see if Arsenal always play in their away kit at Goodison. They seem to do so about half the time. Making it up as they go along. 1 min: Peeeeeep! Arsenal, in their bruised banana away kit, get the game started. The players are out, and kick-off is but moments away. Here\u2019s photographic evidence of Mikel Arteta\u2019s presence at Goodison Park: The players are in the tunnel! And here\u2019s photographic evidence of Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s presence at Goodison Park: Duncan Ferguson has a chat: We have to go for it don\u2019t we. We\u2019ve made a couple of changes, so we\u2019ll have to make sure we\u2019re in their faces and on the front foot. I\u2019ve not spoken to Carlo Ancelotti. He\u2019s had no input in the team, none at all. We\u2019re struggling with injury and sickness, but a couple of players have come back and I\u2019ve thought, fresh legs, fresh minds, let\u2019s bring them in. They\u2019ve went for a bit of youth, so it\u2019ll be an exciting game. Arsenal\u2019s team is seriously young. It\u2019s their youngest for a league game since May 2011, and that doesn\u2019t really count because it was the last game of the season and nobody seemed overly bothered about it. Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from Craven Cottage: Talking of Mesut Ozil, here\u2019s Andrew Anthony on the German controversy-magnet: Freddie Ljungberg has a chat. He says Ozil has a foot injury \u201cbut wouldn\u2019t have been in the team anyway\u201d: We know Mikel\u2019s going to be the manager so it\u2019s a bit of a special situation but we\u2019re going to do everything we can to get a good result. We\u2019ve spoken a little bit, we haven\u2019t spoken too much, but of course he\u2019s here, watching, and he wants the best for the team. For me, what I\u2019ve seen from Everton they\u2019re a little bit old-style. They play very direct, a lot of long-balls, a lot of fighting so I wanted to put a team out there that would work hard and fight to win the second ball if needed. Confirmation just in that Duncan Ferguson will remain at Everton as part of Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s coaching team. Here\u2019s the new Everton manager on Ferguson: \u201cThe work Duncan has done is a great credit to him. Strong organisation, strong discipline and the right motivation are some of the key ingredients in football and I\u2019m pleased he will be part of my backroom team moving forward.\u201d Three changes for Everton, for whom Delph, Sigurdsson and Sidibe come in, and Keane, Bernard and Coleman drop out. Arsenal meanwhile make five changes, a couple of them injury- or suspension-enforced, with Sokratis, Kolasinac, Guendouzi, Pepe and Ozil all dropping out, while Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Reiss Nelson and Gabriel Martinelli all start in an intriguing line-up. Everton: Pickford, Sidibe, Holgate, Mina, Digne, Davies, Delph, Iwobi, Sigurdsson, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Baines, Keane, Tosun, Bernard, Stekelenburg, Coleman, Kean. Arsenal: Leno, Maitland-Niles, Chambers, Luiz, Saka, Torreira, Xhaka, Nelson, Smith-Rowe, Martinelli, Aubameyang. Subs: Lacazette, Pepe, Mustafi, Martinez, Mavropanos, Willock, Guendouzi. Referee: Kevin Friend. Here\u2019s our news story on Ancelotti\u2019s appointment, which was announced at precisely 11.20am this morning: Hello world! Welcome to the big-club, former-player-turned-caretaker-manager, new-appointment-in-the-stands-for-this-one derby! Carlo Ancelotti, whose four-and-a-half-year contract at Everton, apparently worth some \u00a311.5m a season, was announced but moments ago, will cast his expert eye over his new charges this afternoon before completing legal formalities and being announced as the club\u2019s new manager. Meanwhile Mikel Arteta\u2019s arrival at Arsenal was confirmed yesterday, but his will be a watching brief today while Freddie Ljungberg takes charge of his final game. So, it\u2019s all very intriguing, though perhaps not as intriguing as this game would be if it were being played on Boxing Day, when both new managers will be in proper, full-on charge for the first time (Everton host Burnley and Arsenal travel to Bournemouth, since you ask). Here\u2019s the line-ups, as predicted by the Guardian yesterday. Actual real line-ups will follow, very shortly:",

Everton were particularly disappointing, given that this was Ferguson\u2019s last game in charge and Arsenal had obligingly fielded such an inexperienced side.</p> \n<p>When Alex Iwobi departed injured after 11 minutes without managing to make any impression on his old club, Ferguson sent Cenk Tosun on in his place and moved Richarlison to the wing. It was a bold attacking statement but it meant Gylfi Sigurdsson and Fabian Delph became too detached from the front three, with the former spending much of his time playing even deeper than the latter.</p> \n<p>Considering the levels of excitement reached here in the past couple of weeks it was dismally poor fare for the home side to serve up to the most illustrious manager in the club\u2019s history and the hope expressed in several half-time conversations was that Everton had not been reckless enough to allow any sort of cooling-off period in Ancelotti\u2019s contract.</p> \n<p>At least the second half turned out to be a little more eventful, even if it was the visitors who most visibly perked up, possibly realising they were not about to rattled by a stadium at fever pitch after all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f73ff0cd662e26b2d8f34a2656740c5b51967aa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f73ff0cd662e26b2d8f34a2656740c5b51967aa/433_645_4253_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mikel Arteta goes to take his seat as Carlo Ancelotti stands between Everton\u2019s chairman, Bill Kenwright, and majority owner, Farhad Moshiri\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mikel Arteta (top centre) goes to take his seat as Carlo Ancelotti (bottom centre) stands between Everton\u2019s chairman, Bill Kenwright, and majority owner, Farhad Moshiri.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Greenwood/BPI/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jordan Pickford produced a splendid reaction save to keep out a goalbound effort from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang immediately after the interval, and a couple of minutes later Lucas Torreira opened up the Everton defence on the left only to pick the wrong option in passing to the Arsenal captain when others were better placed to shoot.</p> \n<p>Everton took more than an hour to cause Arsenal any real concern, when Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison and Tosun all had a go from inside the area before the ball was cleared for a corner. VAR checked to see whether one of the shots had been deflected by Torreira\u2019s hand, but not even technology was able to give the home side any leverage in the game.</p> \n<p>Ferguson took the applause from the grateful home support at the final whistle and can take pride in staying technically unbeaten against four decent teams in his short run as caretaker. He would have vastly preferred to go out with a bang rather than a whimper, however, even if an Everton side capable of going 90 minutes at Goodison without a shot on target is now a problem for Ancelotti to solve.</p>",

The bad news for Ancelotti is that his new side looked as if they could play until Boxing Day without scoring and though credit is due to a callow Arsenal team for showing resilience, the Italian must already be concerned about how Everton might perform against Premier League opponents not quite as keen to showcase their U23 talent. \u201cIt was a point and a clean sheet, we haven\u2019t had too many of those,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cI told Freddie just before the end I wanted the whistle to go, because I think we were both happy with a point.\u201d Ljungberg said he had selected a side to win the game, but also to reward effort and determination in training. \u201cWe fought hard and I wanted to reward the players who make runs and do the dirty things,\u201d the Arsenal interim manager said, before confirming the injured Mesut \u00d6zil would have been left out anyway after his petulant display last week. A scrappy and forgettable first half passed without a shot on target, both teams trying hard to impress the onlookers in the posh seats but failing to come up with any attacking impetus or produce any moments of quality. Everton were particularly disappointing, given that this was Ferguson\u2019s last game in charge and Arsenal had obligingly fielded such an inexperienced side. When Alex Iwobi departed injured after 11 minutes without managing to make any impression on his old club, Ferguson sent Cenk Tosun on in his place and moved Richarlison to the wing. It was a bold attacking statement but it meant Gylfi Sigurdsson and Fabian Delph became too detached from the front three, with the former spending much of his time playing even deeper than the latter. Considering the levels of excitement reached here in the past couple of weeks it was dismally poor fare for the home side to serve up to the most illustrious manager in the club\u2019s history and the hope expressed in several half-time conversations was that Everton had not been reckless enough to allow any sort of cooling-off period in Ancelotti\u2019s contract. At least the second half turned out to be a little more eventful, even if it was the visitors who most visibly perked up, possibly realising they were not about to rattled by a stadium at fever pitch after all. Jordan Pickford produced a splendid reaction save to keep out a goalbound effort from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang immediately after the interval, and a couple of minutes later Lucas Torreira opened up the Everton defence on the left only to pick the wrong option in passing to the Arsenal captain when others were better placed to shoot. Everton took more than an hour to cause Arsenal any real concern, when Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison and Tosun all had a go from inside the area before the ball was cleared for a corner. VAR checked to see whether one of the shots had been deflected by Torreira\u2019s hand, but not even technology was able to give the home side any leverage in the game. Ferguson took the applause from the grateful home support at the final whistle and can take pride in staying technically unbeaten against four decent teams in his short run as caretaker. He would have vastly preferred to go out with a bang rather than a whimper, however, even if an Everton side capable of going 90 minutes at Goodison without a shot on target is now a problem for Ancelotti to solve.",

Very few voices are prepared to confront China, the economic superpower whose influence extends across the globe. The kind of people who can detail every infringement of Palestinian rights committed by Israel have managed to stay largely tight-lipped about the internment of one million Muslims in China. Very few Muslim countries have spoken out against China\u2019s actions, and many, including Saudi Arabia, have backed Beijing\u2019s crackdown as an \u201canti-terrorist\u201d measure.

Kola\u0161inac fought back before \u00d6zil drove the pair away in a car that also contained \u00d6zil\u2019s wife. Yet his disquiet goes back further than that, at least to May 2018 when he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/mesut-ozil-ilkay-gundogan-recep-tayyip-erdogan-picture\" title=\"\">photographed with the autocratic Erdo\u011fan</a> in the run-up to the Turkish general election.</p> <p>The photo was seen in Germany as an endorsement of Erdo\u011fan, who has purged large numbers of Turkish officials and has attacked Kurd militias in Syria. Having been the poster boy for German multiculturalism when Germany won the World Cup in 2014, \u00d6zil came in for some stinging criticism. A month later, after Germany had crashed out of the 2018 World Cup, the playmaker announced his retirement from international football, disillusioned with what he saw as a campaign of authorised racism. \u201cI am German when we win,\u201d he said, \u201can immigrant when we lose.\u201d</p> <p>He also defended the photo with Erdo\u011fan, claiming that he was simply paying respect to his ancestral homeland, and had only discussed football with the president. That explanation did not age well when in June this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2019/jun/08/arsenals-mesut-ozil-gets-married-with-turkish-president-as-best-man-video\" title=\"\">\u00d6zil married his fiancee</a>, former Miss Turkey Amine G\u00fcl\u0219e, in Istanbul, and Erdo\u011fan was his best man. In Germany it was seen as further evidence that \u00d6zil had embraced his Turkish identity at the expense of his German one. The German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s chief of staff said that \u00d6zil\u2019s relationship with Erdo\u011fan \u201cmakes one sad\u201d.</p> <p>\u00d6zil was born in a Turkish enclave in the city of Gelsenkirchen, not far from Dortmund. His grandparents, miners from Zonguldak in Turkey, had moved to the Ruhr coalfields as guestworkers in the 1960s. Both his parents were born in West Germany. For decades, the West German and then German national football teams had been symbols of a certain vision of German society: white, ethnically German, powerful but not blessed with great style or subtlety.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b55674b4400183b877508f6a9ec676d1dccdb1ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b55674b4400183b877508f6a9ec676d1dccdb1ad/0_133_2556_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Erdo\u011fan makes a speech at Mesut Ozil\u2019s wedding to former Miss Turkey Amine G\u00fcl\u0219e in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Erdo\u011fan makes a speech at Mesut Ozil\u2019s wedding to former Miss Turkey Amine G\u00fcl\u0219e in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Turkish President Press Office/HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That changed with \u00d6zil\u2019s generation, when the side began to reflect a more modern and diverse country. The 2014 World Cup winners played with breathtaking panache, and no one represented that change more than \u00d6zil, who was named German player of the year (an accolade he earned five times in six years).</p> <p>That summer he had completed his first year at Arsenal, having moved from Real Madrid for a club record transfer fee, and had led the Gunners to their first trophy in nine seasons. At 25, he had the world at his feet, playing as if he could see the future, such was his uncanny ability to anticipate the flow of the game. Slowly, that future seems to have slipped behind him. It\u2019s hard to know whether his decline can be attributed to off-field tensions or the increase in tactics that leave little room for \u00d6zil\u2019s languid creativity. Either way the result is an alienated player, and it\u2019s to \u00d6zil\u2019s credit that he has directed his angst outwards and brought attention to the Uighurs\u2019 miserable plight.</p> <p>However, it has left Arsenal with a problem. Do they bow to Chinese pressure and make contrite noises, further distancing themselves from \u00d6zil? What seems obvious is that they can\u2019t sell the player. No club in Europe will want to match the German\u2019s wages, given his indifferent form. And the only other place in the world that could afford him is \u2026 China.</p> <p>But just for now, we can overlook his current performances. On the issue of the Uighurs, \u00d6zil deserves the support of not just Arsenal fans but the world at large.</p>",

That explanation did not age well when in June this year \u00d6zil married his fiancee, former Miss Turkey Amine G\u00fcl\u0219e, in Istanbul, and Erdo\u011fan was his best man. In Germany it was seen as further evidence that \u00d6zil had embraced his Turkish identity at the expense of his German one. The German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s chief of staff said that \u00d6zil\u2019s relationship with Erdo\u011fan \u201cmakes one sad\u201d. \u00d6zil was born in a Turkish enclave in the city of Gelsenkirchen, not far from Dortmund. His grandparents, miners from Zonguldak in Turkey, had moved to the Ruhr coalfields as guestworkers in the 1960s. Both his parents were born in West Germany. For decades, the West German and then German national football teams had been symbols of a certain vision of German society: white, ethnically German, powerful but not blessed with great style or subtlety. That changed with \u00d6zil\u2019s generation, when the side began to reflect a more modern and diverse country. The 2014 World Cup winners played with breathtaking panache, and no one represented that change more than \u00d6zil, who was named German player of the year (an accolade he earned five times in six years). That summer he had completed his first year at Arsenal, having moved from Real Madrid for a club record transfer fee, and had led the Gunners to their first trophy in nine seasons. At 25, he had the world at his feet, playing as if he could see the future, such was his uncanny ability to anticipate the flow of the game. Slowly, that future seems to have slipped behind him. It\u2019s hard to know whether his decline can be attributed to off-field tensions or the increase in tactics that leave little room for \u00d6zil\u2019s languid creativity. Either way the result is an alienated player, and it\u2019s to \u00d6zil\u2019s credit that he has directed his angst outwards and brought attention to the Uighurs\u2019 miserable plight. However, it has left Arsenal with a problem. Do they bow to Chinese pressure and make contrite noises, further distancing themselves from \u00d6zil? What seems obvious is that they can\u2019t sell the player. No club in Europe will want to match the German\u2019s wages, given his indifferent form. And the only other place in the world that could afford him is \u2026 China. But just for now, we can overlook his current performances. On the issue of the Uighurs, \u00d6zil deserves the support of not just Arsenal fans but the world at large.",

But his mother is feeling \u201cfluish\u201d and his dad just wants to stay warm by the cranked-up propane heater. Nick goes on his own; a blizzard hits just as he\u2019s heading back, a white-out that makes the road freeze over and an eighteen-wheeler jackknife towards him \u201clike a wounded animal\u201d, for a moment the decision seems fatal ... but the truck misses and he manages to sleep off the worst of the weather by the side of the road. Yet when he gets home he will discover that, for other reasons, for the Hoel family, this Christmas is the end of the line.</p> <p>The history of Christmas is complicated and much of what we celebrate now seems to be a 19th-century invention \u2013 the trees and the birds, some of these traditions imported from Germany and some of them helped along by a certain famous writer. As the American satirical songwriter Tom Lehrer put it: \u201cKill the turkeys, ducks and chickens, / Mix the punch, Drag out the Dickens \u2026\u201d But the 20th and 21st centuries have added their own flavour, and novelists have learned to exploit its dramatic potential as the occasion for a particular kind of family misery. \u201cEven though the prospect sickens,\u201d Lehrer sings on, \u201cBrother, here we go again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbeb5b6a5e202114a71a830d061800c2f61e42ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbeb5b6a5e202114a71a830d061800c2f61e42ed/95_146_2945_1984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An engraving after Edwin Austin Abbey for A Christmas Carol, 1843.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An engraving after Edwin Austin Abbey for <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, 1843.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Granger/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s Jane Austen, unsurprisingly, who first shows us the slow-burn dramatic possibilities of the modern festive season. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/05/jane-austen-emma-changed-face-fiction\" title=\"\"><em>Emma</em></a>, all the elements are in place. The arguments about who goes where: \u201cMr Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas \u2013 though you know it is longer since they were with him, than with us.\u201d The negotiations over bedrooms: \u201cHave you thought my dear, where you shall put her \u2013 and what room there will be for the children?\u201d And cars: \u201cHow they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he could, but as his son and daughter\u2019s carriage were actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ...\u201d</p> <p>The problem, of course, is that Christmas is usually the time when two family weather fronts collide. Emma\u2019s sister, Isabella, has married John, the brother of her friend Knightley. Emma\u2019s father is a gently selfish hypochondriac, and Emma spends Christmas trying to smooth out the tensions in his relationship with his son-in-law. At the same time, she has her own battles to fight with Knightley \u2013 in which her protege, Harriet Smith, becomes a proxy for their arguments about marriage and a testing ground for their romantic intentions towards each other. <em>Emma</em> was published in 1815, but Austen had already discovered the concentrated dramatic possibilities of modern Christmas: where several months\u2019 worth of news and tension unspool, while people with starkly variegated obligations and relations to each other are cooped up together in a single house. You even get a little snow; the Christmas is white enough that Emma doesn\u2019t have to go to church.</p> <p>A hundred years later, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/25/sons-lovers-dh-lawrence-blake-morrison\" title=\"\"><em>Sons and Lovers</em>, DH Lawrence</a> explores the same dynamic but at the other end of the class ladder. William Morel, the oldest son and his mother\u2019s darling, gets a job in London and comes home for Christmas with his fiancee, Miss Western. She\u2019s a \u201csort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she was with the Morels she queened it\u201d. Spends hours getting dressed in the morning, pretends to lose her muff so that someone else can fetch it for her \u2013 \u201cit angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.\u201d But really she\u2019s only \u201cnervous and chattered from fear ... She felt strange, not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them. William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.\u201d The visit forces him to comparisons and re-evaluations. After Miss Western goes to bed, he sits with his mother in front of the fire and complains: \u201cIf only she wouldn\u2019t put on her blessed airs!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only her first awkwardness, my boy. She\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, mother,\u201d he replied gratefully. But his brow was gloomy. \u201cYou know, she\u2019s not like you, mother.

      "bodyText": "In Richard Powers\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning novel The Overstory, the Hoels have been farming a patch of Iowa for more than a century. A grandfather, several times great, planted a chestnut on the land when he first settled it, and ever since then Hoel men have been photographing that tree \u2013 one of the few survivors of the blight that eradicated the American chestnut in the early 20th century. A flipbook of those photos makes the young Nick Hoel want to be a painter. By the time he drives down from art school in Chicago to visit his grandparents for the holidays, the farm has been \u201clong-term leased to outfits run from offices hundreds of miles away ... But for a while ... the place will be all miracle births and saviours in mangers, as it was at Hoel Christmases for 120 years running\u201d. Christmas is, apart from everything else, a gift to novelists. It\u2019s a chance to bring together a wide cast of characters at a time when the sense of occasion allows them and the novelist to take the long view of their lives. Powers uses it here to tease or threaten the reader with intimations of generational disaster. On the day before Christmas Eve, Nick tries to jolly the \u201cold folks\u201d into seeing the American Landscapes exhibition in Omaha, an hour away. But his mother is feeling \u201cfluish\u201d and his dad just wants to stay warm by the cranked-up propane heater. Nick goes on his own; a blizzard hits just as he\u2019s heading back, a white-out that makes the road freeze over and an eighteen-wheeler jackknife towards him \u201clike a wounded animal\u201d, for a moment the decision seems fatal ... but the truck misses and he manages to sleep off the worst of the weather by the side of the road. Yet when he gets home he will discover that, for other reasons, for the Hoel family, this Christmas is the end of the line. The history of Christmas is complicated and much of what we celebrate now seems to be a 19th-century invention \u2013 the trees and the birds, some of these traditions imported from Germany and some of them helped along by a certain famous writer. As the American satirical songwriter Tom Lehrer put it: \u201cKill the turkeys, ducks and chickens, / Mix the punch, Drag out the Dickens \u2026\u201d But the 20th and 21st centuries have added their own flavour, and novelists have learned to exploit its dramatic potential as the occasion for a particular kind of family misery. \u201cEven though the prospect sickens,\u201d Lehrer sings on, \u201cBrother, here we go again.\u201d It\u2019s Jane Austen, unsurprisingly, who first shows us the slow-burn dramatic possibilities of the modern festive season. In Emma, all the elements are in place. The arguments about who goes where: \u201cMr Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas \u2013 though you know it is longer since they were with him, than with us.\u201d The negotiations over bedrooms: \u201cHave you thought my dear, where you shall put her \u2013 and what room there will be for the children?\u201d And cars: \u201cHow they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he could, but as his son and daughter\u2019s carriage were actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ...\u201d The problem, of course, is that Christmas is usually the time when two family weather fronts collide.

William Morel, the oldest son and his mother\u2019s darling, gets a job in London and comes home for Christmas with his fiancee, Miss Western. She\u2019s a \u201csort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she was with the Morels she queened it\u201d.

My brisk march from Place de la R\u00e9publique to a briefing at the Elys\u00e9e Palace on Tuesday took an hour; an early press conference at the chic Fouquet\u2019s restaurant on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es \u2013 roughly the same distance \u2013 took longer on heaving rush-hour pavements on which pedestrians and tourists trailing suitcases were joined by bikes, electric and non-electric scooters, electric uniwheels, even a few mopeds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"475b55f80317fef8e82832f6dbcd40358f1ab445\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/475b55f80317fef8e82832f6dbcd40358f1ab445/204_0_2130_3500/609.jpg\" alt=\"Parisians improvise as the city transport system struggles to cope.\" width=\"609\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parisians improvise as the city transport system struggles to cope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Le Parisien</em> newspaper produced an article entitled \u201cthe joys of walking\u201d. \u201cHad enough of packed transport?

Ten thousand steps a day? No problem. If only the torrential rain would stop.</p> <p>Riding a bike and crossing a road in Paris can be perilous at the best of times given the sometimes flexible approach to red traffic lights, but as vehicles gridlocked junctions, blocking crossings and bike lanes, everyone had to take their chance. The strikers\u2019 unions have called for solidarity, but on the city streets it was everyone for themselves. The soundtrack of central Paris became a cacophony of sirens, hooting, shouting and swearing accompanied by appropriate gestures. Mostly, we just shrugged and carried on. Some of us even smiled.</p> <p>Parisians raided damp cellars for long abandoned bicycles \u2013 which led to a sudden demand and consequent shortage of inner tubes, according to one city centre repair shop \u2013 and rode them without helmets. First-time scooter-users wobbled and weaved between traffic. The Paris fire brigade said that the huge increase in two-wheelers had led to a 40% increase in accidents, most of them not serious, fortunately, because traffic jams delayed paramedic teams from reaching the injured.</p> <p>For those who live in the suburbs but work in the city, getting to and from offices, cafes, restaurants and schools has been more problematic, leaving most exhausted before they even start work, and dead on their feet by the time they get home.</p> <p>As the protests continued into a third week, the government might have hoped that transport chaos fatigue would spark a backlash against the strikers (despite similar three-week protests in 1995 forcing the government \u2013 not the unions \u2013 to back down). It was also banking on turning public opinion against those, such as rail-workers, who enjoy special privileges and early retirement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Protesters argue the pension proposals erode hard-won workers\u2019 rights</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sentiment shifted in favour of the protesters, however, after prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe pulled an unexpected rabbit out of the political hat by announcing that the government wanted a \u201cpivotal\u201d retirement age of 64. This would mean the official retirement age remains at 62, but workers would be encouraged \u2013 not forced \u2013 to work a further two years. Protesters accused the authorities of increasing the retirement age by stealth and the move alienated France\u2019s biggest union, the CFDT which, until then, had not taken part in protests.

      "bodyText": "The British like to claim exclusive rights on \u201cDunkirk spirit\u201d\u2013 the ability to remain stoic and determined in a difficult situation. Today, after more than a fortnight of transport chaos and strikes over pension reforms, I can report that Parisians have shown themselves equally adept at keeping (reasonably) calm and carrying on in a crisis. The French have their own D-word; \u201cSyst\u00e8me D\u201d, standing for se d\u00e9brouiller, meaning to find a way of doing something when you haven\u2019t the means or material, or the more vulgar se d\u00e9merder, to manage, get by, figure it out. With most metro lines closed or severely disrupted and few buses and suburban trains, workers in the capital have got around using alternative means: cars, bicycles, electric scooters, mopeds and, failing everything else, on foot. Unlike London, Paris intra muros is concentrated and walkable. My brisk march from Place de la R\u00e9publique to a briefing at the Elys\u00e9e Palace on Tuesday took an hour; an early press conference at the chic Fouquet\u2019s restaurant on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es \u2013 roughly the same distance \u2013 took longer on heaving rush-hour pavements on which pedestrians and tourists trailing suitcases were joined by bikes, electric and non-electric scooters, electric uniwheels, even a few mopeds. Le Parisien newspaper produced an article entitled \u201cthe joys of walking\u201d. \u201cHad enough of packed transport? Bicycle too dangerous?\u201d it asked, alongside a helpful map showing how long it would take to walk between major points in the city. Ten thousand steps a day? No problem. If only the torrential rain would stop. Riding a bike and crossing a road in Paris can be perilous at the best of times given the sometimes flexible approach to red traffic lights, but as vehicles gridlocked junctions, blocking crossings and bike lanes, everyone had to take their chance. The strikers\u2019 unions have called for solidarity, but on the city streets it was everyone for themselves. The soundtrack of central Paris became a cacophony of sirens, hooting, shouting and swearing accompanied by appropriate gestures. Mostly, we just shrugged and carried on. Some of us even smiled. Parisians raided damp cellars for long abandoned bicycles \u2013 which led to a sudden demand and consequent shortage of inner tubes, according to one city centre repair shop \u2013 and rode them without helmets. First-time scooter-users wobbled and weaved between traffic. The Paris fire brigade said that the huge increase in two-wheelers had led to a 40% increase in accidents, most of them not serious, fortunately, because traffic jams delayed paramedic teams from reaching the injured. For those who live in the suburbs but work in the city, getting to and from offices, cafes, restaurants and schools has been more problematic, leaving most exhausted before they even start work, and dead on their feet by the time they get home. As the protests continued into a third week, the government might have hoped that transport chaos fatigue would spark a backlash against the strikers (despite similar three-week protests in 1995 forcing the government \u2013 not the unions \u2013 to back down). It was also banking on turning public opinion against those, such as rail-workers, who enjoy special privileges and early retirement. Sentiment shifted in favour of the protesters, however, after prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe pulled an unexpected rabbit out of the political hat by announcing that the government wanted a \u201cpivotal\u201d retirement age of 64. This would mean the official retirement age remains at 62, but workers would be encouraged \u2013 not forced \u2013 to work a further two years. Protesters accused the authorities of increasing the retirement age by stealth and the move alienated France\u2019s biggest union, the CFDT which, until then, had not taken part in protests. Macron is also reported to be unhappy with the move, putting him at odds with his PM. Recent opinion polls sent mixed messages: a majority (67%) still said they supported the idea of reforming the pension system but 57% didn\u2019t want the changes proposed by the government and more than half those polled (54%) supported the protests. Demonstrations last Wednesday drew between 615,000 and 1.5 million people across France, depending on who counted, down from the first pension protest on 5 December, but still a very respectable turnout. Those who hoped for a Christmas truce were disappointed as the week ended and, despite negotiations, both sides remained entrenched. The government has said it is determined to push through the reforms, which would replace the country\u2019s 42 different pension schemes with one \u201cuniversal points-based\u201d system over the next 18 years. Protesters argue that the proposals erode hard-won workers\u2019 rights.

Two people were confirmed dead in South Australia, and homes were destroyed and communities evacuated in what authorities described as \u201can awful day\u201d in which fires raged across three states, even creating their own thunderstorms in some parts of NSW. At Lithgow, about two hours\u2019 drive west of Sydney, residents were forced to flee as fires threatened the community of more than 10,000 people and destroyed several homes on the outskirts of the town. At 7pm, a person was reported unaccounted for in the Dargen area, near Lithgow, the ABC reported. Four firefighters in NSW were treated for heat exhaustion on Saturday, the ambulance service said, while another firefighter was reportedly injured after being struck by a truck in Richmond. On Saturday night, the Blue Mountains communities of Bilpin and Blackheath remained under threat, while southerly winds pushed a blaze away from Yanderra on Saturday afternoon. Fire fighters were expected to remain on the ground into the night. \u201cWe have seen property impacted and lost,\u201d the NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, told a press conference on Saturday afternoon. \u201cWe have 3,000 firefighters and emergency services personnel out there dealing with the fires, a bad weather day.\u201d Ahead of Saturday, authorities had been preparing for what they knew would be rarely-seen conditions. Catastrophic fire conditions were declared in the state, with high winds, above 40C temperatures, low humidity and long-term dryness in the bush combined to fan flames across the country. Catastrophic is the highest fire danger rating and is the equivalent of the conditions before the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria. Saturday was only the second time that greater Sydney had catastrophic conditions declared. As conditions worsened, major roads, including sections of the Princes Highway, Hume Highway and Greater Highway were closed during the day, with police warning people to stay off the roads despite the Christmas holiday rush. Train services on rail lines west of Sydney were also delayed and cancelled. By 4.30pm, seven fires in NSW were burning at emergency, including the more than 400,000-hectare Gospers Mountain mega-fire, and the Green Wattle Creek fire, where two firefighters died on Thursday when their truck overturned. A southerly change swept through at 5pm, making the fire even more erratic and changing the fire direction. Around this time, NSW authorities began warning of a bushfire-generated thunderstorm that had formed over Currowan and Tianjara fires in the Shoalhaven area, on the NSW south coast. The fire service said this would lead to increasingly dangerous fire conditions. Such storms, known as pyroCB, can produce embers hot enough to spark new fires 30km from the main fire. Fires also continued to burn in Victoria and South Australia. The South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, confirmed that two people had died in the state on Friday. One, a 24-year-old from Queensland, died in a car crash at Lameroo. Another person died in a fire in the Adelaide Hills that also seriously injured another. The Cudlee Creek fire in the Adelaide Hills, and a fire on Kangaroo Island, were both at emergency but were downgraded to watch and act. Twenty-three firefighters were also injured in South Australia, one seriously, and three trucks were destroyed. Five homes, 28 buildings and 16 vehicles had been destroyed. In Victoria, the Marthavale fire in East Gippsland quadrupled in size overnight, growing so large it created its own weather. Throughout Saturday, two emergency warnings were in place, for Ensay, Reedy Flat, Stirling, Holstons; and Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle, Stirling. The acting prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, would return to Australia on Saturday night, after he cut short a family holiday to Hawaii. The prime minister had apologised on Friday for \u201cany offence caused\u201d by the holiday, which began on Monday, and said he would return \u201cas soon as can be arranged\u201d. Morrison had originally planned to return to the prime minister\u2019s role on Monday night, but he boarded a plane back to Australia on Saturday and is expected to land in Australia later in the evening. Marshall, the SA premier, cancelled his own Christmas holiday as the fires swept South Australia. He was scheduled to leave for New Zealand this week but said he would remain in Adelaide. With Morrison away, McCormack conceded at a press conference that he agreed Australia needed to do more to combat the climate crisis, though he did not outline what that might be. But McCormack also hit out at what he called climate change \u201chysteria\u201d and linked the fires to other causes, including dry lightning strikes and self-combusting manure. Facing pressure over the federal government\u2019s role handling the crisis, the emergency management minister, David Littleproud, announced about 30 Canadian firefighters would join the local effort from Sunday. On Saturday morning, the federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, criticised Morrison for a lack of transparency around the trip. Albanese said \u201cmedia inquiries were met with misinformation, at best\u201d after Morrison\u2019s office initially told reporters he was not in Hawaii. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and police told residents to please delay travel and obey directions from authorities. \u201cToday is not the day to start your holiday,\u201d a police spokeswoman said. On Saturday, protesters gathered outside Kirribilli House, accusing Morrison of a lack of leadership on the fires and on combating climate change. The NSW RFS has set up a dedicated donations fund for the families of two firefighters who died on Thursday after their truck overturned near the Green Wattle Creek fireground. Fitzsimmons said that conditions were expected to improve after Saturday, but noted the fires would continue to burn unless the state received a much-needed downpour. \u201cWe will not get on top of these fires until we get some decent rain, we have said that for weeks and months,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>It is famous for smelling like \u201ca thousand dead elephants rotting in the sun\u201d, its petals resemble decaying flesh, and it is so rare that outside its natural habitat in Papua New Guinea, few botanists in the world have ever seen it in flower.</p> <p>Now this highly pungent orchid \u2013 <em>Bulbophyllum phalaenopsis</em><em> </em>\u2013 is in bloom for the first time in a glasshouse at <a href=\"https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Cambridge University Botanic Garden</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such an unusual plant,\u201d said head of horticulture Sally Petitt. \u201cThe reasons we cultivate it is because it\u2019s very rare, even in the wild.\u201d</p> <p>Up close, botanists say, the scent is reminiscent of dead rats decomposing next to rotting fish \u2013 a smell so surprising from such an innocent-looking plant that it is impossible to resist going back for a second and third whiff. \u201cThe smell will intensify over time,\u201d Petitt warned. \u201cIn the wild, it\u2019s pollinated by flies. That\u2019s why it\u2019s got that fetid carrion scent.\u201d</p> <p>The orchid\u2019s natural habitat in western Papua New Guinea, where it grows at altitudes of around 500 metres, is under threat. \u201cA lot of it is due to population expansion, people trying to claim land for redevelopment and housing, as well as forestry and crops. But it\u2019s also because of climate change,\u201d said Petitt.</p> <p>Visitors who wish to smell the flower will not have much time. The garden closes for a week for Christmas on Tuesday, and by the time it reopens, Petitt thinks its putrid odour will have disappeared. But she hopes that those who do catch a whiff will also get a sense of the need for plant conservation and the work botanic gardens do to preserve plant diversity \u2013 even when that involves nurturing a flower which, to her, smells like \u201cvery sweaty socks and shoes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db75cac1e54db7f86efcbb5e3e7dca7e16516b6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db75cac1e54db7f86efcbb5e3e7dca7e16516b6a/365_594_3720_2232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The glass house, which is home to the rare orchid, at Cambridge Botanic Garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The glass house, which is home to the rare orchid, at Cambridge Botanic Garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Bach/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any prejudices in the plant world,\u201d she said. \u201cAll plants are valued as being part of our rich and broad diversity.\u201d</p> <p>She worries about what the future holds for plants in the wild. \u201cIn botanic gardens, people are doing great research and finding so much out about plants all the time. That\u2019s uplifting. But when you think about the bigger global community, it can be quite depressing. A lot of the world\u2019s population don\u2019t have that same appreciation of the value of plants that we do in the botanic garden.\u201d</p> <p>Petitt finds it hard to imagine this will change. \u201cIt\u2019s not even ignorance. Some people are oblivious to [the fact] that, without plants, nothing else could exist,\u201d she said.</p> <p>During the July heatwave this year, temperatures in the garden reached the highest ever recorded by the <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/press-office/news/weather-and-climate/2019/new-official-highest-temperature-in-uk-confirmed\" title=\"\">Met Office </a>in the history of the UK \u2013 38.7C. For Petitt and other staff, it was a grim day.</p> <p>\u201cHaving the hottest day on record here has highlighted issues about climate change. It made it seem more real to people, particularly I think to members of the public\u2026 You really think: something dramatic and radical is happening to the climate for it to have got this hot here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3bdb75536cc9bea84f7c418d155c12c26854a13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3bdb75536cc9bea84f7c418d155c12c26854a13/0_275_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Botanist Sally Petitt with the Bulbophyllum phalaenopsis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Botanist Sally Petitt with the Bulbophyllum phalaenopsis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Howard Rice</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It focused her thoughts on the potential impact of the climate crisis on a garden that was first planted by Charles Darwin\u2019s tutor, John Stevens Henslow, in the 1830s. \u201cWe have since started looking much longer-term at how we approach climate and irrigation and management of plants.\u201d</p> <p>Already, she said, flowering times are changing and there are plants that are coming through on the garden\u2019s Mediterranean beds that they would not have tried growing in the past.</p> <p>She finds it difficult to predict what the future holds for the garden, which has been open to the public for 173 years and is home to some of the rarest plants in the world, including some that are now extinct in the wild. \u201cNobody can really say, absolutely, what impacts climate change will have.\u201d</p> <p>But she is optimistic that whatever happens, the garden will always offer a sanctuary \u2013 however smelly \u2013 for plants and humans alike, and that this will have its own modest impact on the planet.</p> <p>That is why a plant that stinks of rotting flesh felt like the best early Christmas present. \u201cI hope our visitors will go away with a greater understanding and appreciation of the natural world,\u201d she said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is famous for smelling like \u201ca thousand dead elephants rotting in the sun\u201d, its petals resemble decaying flesh, and it is so rare that outside its natural habitat in Papua New Guinea, few botanists in the world have ever seen it in flower. Now this highly pungent orchid \u2013 Bulbophyllum phalaenopsis \u2013 is in bloom for the first time in a glasshouse at Cambridge University Botanic Garden. \u201cIt\u2019s such an unusual plant,\u201d said head of horticulture Sally Petitt. \u201cThe reasons we cultivate it is because it\u2019s very rare, even in the wild.\u201d Up close, botanists say, the scent is reminiscent of dead rats decomposing next to rotting fish \u2013 a smell so surprising from such an innocent-looking plant that it is impossible to resist going back for a second and third whiff. \u201cThe smell will intensify over time,\u201d Petitt warned. \u201cIn the wild, it\u2019s pollinated by flies. That\u2019s why it\u2019s got that fetid carrion scent.\u201d The orchid\u2019s natural habitat in western Papua New Guinea, where it grows at altitudes of around 500 metres, is under threat. \u201cA lot of it is due to population expansion, people trying to claim land for redevelopment and housing, as well as forestry and crops. But it\u2019s also because of climate change,\u201d said Petitt. Visitors who wish to smell the flower will not have much time. The garden closes for a week for Christmas on Tuesday, and by the time it reopens, Petitt thinks its putrid odour will have disappeared. But she hopes that those who do catch a whiff will also get a sense of the need for plant conservation and the work botanic gardens do to preserve plant diversity \u2013 even when that involves nurturing a flower which, to her, smells like \u201cvery sweaty socks and shoes\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any prejudices in the plant world,\u201d she said. \u201cAll plants are valued as being part of our rich and broad diversity.\u201d She worries about what the future holds for plants in the wild. \u201cIn botanic gardens, people are doing great research and finding so much out about plants all the time. That\u2019s uplifting. But when you think about the bigger global community, it can be quite depressing. A lot of the world\u2019s population don\u2019t have that same appreciation of the value of plants that we do in the botanic garden.\u201d Petitt finds it hard to imagine this will change. \u201cIt\u2019s not even ignorance. Some people are oblivious to [the fact] that, without plants, nothing else could exist,\u201d she said. During the July heatwave this year, temperatures in the garden reached the highest ever recorded by the Met Office in the history of the UK \u2013 38.7C. For Petitt and other staff, it was a grim day. \u201cHaving the hottest day on record here has highlighted issues about climate change. It made it seem more real to people, particularly I think to members of the public\u2026 You really think: something dramatic and radical is happening to the climate for it to have got this hot here.\u201d It focused her thoughts on the potential impact of the climate crisis on a garden that was first planted by Charles Darwin\u2019s tutor, John Stevens Henslow, in the 1830s. \u201cWe have since started looking much longer-term at how we approach climate and irrigation and management of plants.\u201d Already, she said, flowering times are changing and there are plants that are coming through on the garden\u2019s Mediterranean beds that they would not have tried growing in the past. She finds it difficult to predict what the future holds for the garden, which has been open to the public for 173 years and is home to some of the rarest plants in the world, including some that are now extinct in the wild. \u201cNobody can really say, absolutely, what impacts climate change will have.\u201d But she is optimistic that whatever happens, the garden will always offer a sanctuary \u2013 however smelly \u2013 for plants and humans alike, and that this will have its own modest impact on the planet. That is why a plant that stinks of rotting flesh felt like the best early Christmas present. \u201cI hope our visitors will go away with a greater understanding and appreciation of the natural world,\u201d she said.",

Pace bowlers Archer and Broad looked distinctly under the weather as they arrived at Willowmoore Park but managed an initial 10-minutes of bowling in draining temperatures in the practice facilities. Both men later returned to bat, while left-arm spinner Leach took part in a slightly extended bowling session.</p>\n    <p>Saturday's morning session belonged to Pope, who converted his overnight score of 70 into a first hundred in England whites by adding 62 runs in 58 deliveries. It was an accomplished knock, comprising 22 boundaries and two sixes, and gave several glimpses of the sweet ball-striking skills which have marked the 21-year-old out as the most promising county batsman of his generation. <b>PA</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The most striking addition has been Bess, a clear indication that faith in Matt Parkinson, the Lancashire leg-spinner, is limited and that his selection was dubious.

South Africa are leaving nothing to chance either. They had a squad of 17 for the first two Tests and then their plans were disrupted by a hip injury to Temba Bavuma.

It might be the most star-studded ever. Amid the crisis surrounding the running of South African cricket the players of a decade ago have been given new roles. Graeme Smith has agreed to be their cricket director for the next three months. He has enlisted Mark Boucher as the coach, Jacques Kallis has a consultancy role as a batting coach and Charl Langeveldt is working with the bowlers. Between them they have 436 Test caps, of which Langeveldt contributes six.</p> \n<p>It is understandable South Africa should fall back on such reassuring figures at this time and it will be intriguing to see how much impact these giants of the past can have, even though they can no longer contribute any runs or wickets themselves. It is impressive that the big names are prepared to take up the burden; in England they usually head straight for the broadcasting boxes instead.</p> \n<p>There is no guarantee that a world-class cricketer will necessarily become a great coach. Different skills are required. In fact, brilliance on the field is far from essential. Recent England coaches \u2013 with the exception of Andy Flower \u2013 have had modest international records or none at all. David Lloyd played nine Tests, Duncan Fletcher had no such opportunities with Zimbabwe and neither the twice-appointed Peter Moores nor Trevor Bayliss played at international level.</p> \n<p>South Africa\u2019s concerns are not so dissimilar to England\u2019s and there is an element of anxiously putting a finger in the dyke after five consecutive defeats against Sri Lanka and India. This is reflected in the age of the potential debutants. Five of them are over 30, while the sixth, Beuran Hendricks, is 29. There are concerns about the upper order. Dean Elgar provides the glue in a manner that England hope his county colleague Rory Burns can match more regularly. Elgar\u2019s likeliest partner, Aiden Markram, has been badly hampered by a wrist injury sustained when smashing it against a wall in the pavilion in Pune against India, after declining to review an lbw that the TV cameras would have shown to be not out, a neat vignette of South Africa\u2019s recent frustrations.</p> \n<p>As with England there are several pace bowling options even though Lungi Ngidi is unfit but it is not clear which is the best one on a track that traditionally offers some encouragement to pace bowlers.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/19/england-final-warm-up-game-south-africa-cricket-tour-downgraded-flu-bug\">England\u2019s final warm-up game in South Africa downgraded due to flu bug</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The likeliest combination would have Kasigo Rabada supported by Vernon Philander and Anrich Nortje, with Keshav Maharaj providing the spin. However, it is just possible that both sides will consider shunning their spinner, especially so from the England standpoint if Jack Leach fails to recover properly from the flu.</p> \n<p>As ever there is pressure on the captains, who both bear the burden of being the key run-scorer in their team. Faf du Plessis is now 35 and being captain of a losing South Africa side can be debilitating. Expectations are always high. Joe Root is bolstered by a Test double century in his last outing in Hamilton but that does not entirely settle the debate about his output as captain. He knows that run-scoring will be trickier here.</p> \n<p>In the meantime the coaches of both sides will plot and fret on the balcony. As cricketers England\u2019s coaching setup, now headed up by Chris Silverwood (six Test matches), could hardly be expected to match that of the South Africans. But this does not matter a jot now. The players rather than the coaches will decide the outcome of this series and England just hope they have 17 \u2013 make that 19 \u2013 to choose from on Boxing Day morning.</p>",

He has enlisted Mark Boucher as the coach, Jacques Kallis has a consultancy role as a batting coach and Charl Langeveldt is working with the bowlers. Between them they have 436 Test caps, of which Langeveldt contributes six. It is understandable South Africa should fall back on such reassuring figures at this time and it will be intriguing to see how much impact these giants of the past can have, even though they can no longer contribute any runs or wickets themselves. It is impressive that the big names are prepared to take up the burden; in England they usually head straight for the broadcasting boxes instead. There is no guarantee that a world-class cricketer will necessarily become a great coach. Different skills are required. In fact, brilliance on the field is far from essential. Recent England coaches \u2013 with the exception of Andy Flower \u2013 have had modest international records or none at all. David Lloyd played nine Tests, Duncan Fletcher had no such opportunities with Zimbabwe and neither the twice-appointed Peter Moores nor Trevor Bayliss played at international level. South Africa\u2019s concerns are not so dissimilar to England\u2019s and there is an element of anxiously putting a finger in the dyke after five consecutive defeats against Sri Lanka and India. This is reflected in the age of the potential debutants. Five of them are over 30, while the sixth, Beuran Hendricks, is 29. There are concerns about the upper order. Dean Elgar provides the glue in a manner that England hope his county colleague Rory Burns can match more regularly. Elgar\u2019s likeliest partner, Aiden Markram, has been badly hampered by a wrist injury sustained when smashing it against a wall in the pavilion in Pune against India, after declining to review an lbw that the TV cameras would have shown to be not out, a neat vignette of South Africa\u2019s recent frustrations. As with England there are several pace bowling options even though Lungi Ngidi is unfit but it is not clear which is the best one on a track that traditionally offers some encouragement to pace bowlers. The likeliest combination would have Kasigo Rabada supported by Vernon Philander and Anrich Nortje, with Keshav Maharaj providing the spin. However, it is just possible that both sides will consider shunning their spinner, especially so from the England standpoint if Jack Leach fails to recover properly from the flu. As ever there is pressure on the captains, who both bear the burden of being the key run-scorer in their team. Faf du Plessis is now 35 and being captain of a losing South Africa side can be debilitating. Expectations are always high. Joe Root is bolstered by a Test double century in his last outing in Hamilton but that does not entirely settle the debate about his output as captain. He knows that run-scoring will be trickier here. In the meantime the coaches of both sides will plot and fret on the balcony. As cricketers England\u2019s coaching setup, now headed up by Chris Silverwood (six Test matches), could hardly be expected to match that of the South Africans. But this does not matter a jot now. The players rather than the coaches will decide the outcome of this series and England just hope they have 17 \u2013 make that 19 \u2013 to choose from on Boxing Day morning.",

      "body": "<p>Easily the most popular winner of Boxing Day\u2019s King George VI Chase would be Thistlecrack, now firmly into the loveable veteran stage of his career. He was the upstart when he won it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/26/brilliant-thistlecrack-smooth-winner-king-george-vi-chase-kempton-horse-racing\" title=\"\">as a novice chaser three years ago</a> with a tearaway performance so impressive that he seemed to have the game at his mercy, a memory made poignant by the knowledge that he has not won since.</p> <p>While the market has him pegged as a 14-1 shot and expects him to be run ragged by the flashy youngsters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/23/cyrname-altior-ascot-end-unbeaten-record-jump-racing\" title=\"\">Cyrname and Lostintranslation</a>, there is a sizeable gang of followers who have never lost faith: the Thistlecrackers, we might call them. They are given every reason for hope of a miracle at Kempton by the words of those close to the horse.</p> <p>\u201cHe is working brilliantly at the moment,\u201d says his trainer, Colin Tizzard, from his base on the Dorset-Somerset border. \u201cHonestly, he is brilliant. He would be probably as good as anything on our gallop at the moment, if not the best.\u201d</p> <p>This is not what one expects to hear about an 11-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/21/thistlecrack-out-cheltenham-gold-cup-tearing-tendon\" title=\"\">that missed the 2017 Gold Cup because of a tendon injury</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/21/thistlecrack-out-cheltenham-gold-cup-tearing-tendon\" title=\"\">the following year\u2019s race with a stress fracture</a>. When he finally got to the Cheltenham race in March, he failed to show anything like his best form and was pulled up for the first time.</p> <p>But Kempton has brought out the best in him, notably in last year\u2019s King George, when Might Bite, Native River, Politologue and Waiting Patiently were all better fancied. He beat them all and halfway up the home straight it looked as though he was going to pull off an improbable second success in the race. \u201cI did think he was going to win it,\u201d recalls Tom Scudamore, who has ridden him in every race since April 2015. \u201cWhen Clan Des Obeaux came alongside, I was thinking he hadn\u2019t always been the strongest of finishers. Unfortunately for me and Thistlecrack, he decided to turn over a new leaf that day.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/26/clan-des-obeaux-wins-tenth-king-george-vi-chase-paul-nicholls-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Clan Des Obeaux finished stylishly </a>and had a length and a half in hand at the line over Thistlecrack, who was a dozen lengths clear of everyone else. The winner benefited from a hold-up ride and the result may have been different had Thistlecrack been able to save a bit more for the last half-mile.</p> <p>But that has never been his way. When he won the 2016 race, he tore around Kempton in the manner of a child ripping open presents, as if there was no end to his energy and nothing to gain from restraint.</p> <p>His prodigious leap at the second fence will live in the memory long after he is retired. If he had learned professionalism by then, he would have fitted in an extra stride and popped over, instead of exuberantly hurling himself through the air. It ought to have undermined his finishing effort but the laws of the game seemed suspended that afternoon.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been an awesome racehorse,\u201d Scudamore says, \u201cto have won so many Grade Ones and a King George as a novice. Obviously, through injuries and what-have-you, he hasn\u2019t quite reached those heights we all thought he was going to do. It\u2019s hard to know what to expect this time but I sat on him last week and he seemed in good order. He ran a cracking race at Newbury last month, which was a great pipe-opener because he needed it really badly. He\u2019s normally going there as one of the favourites but this year it\u2019ll be slightly different.\u201d</p> <p>Tizzard also trains Lostintranslation, whose chance is more obvious, and for a while it looked as though he would switch the older horse away from the King George back into the staying hurdle division he once dominated.</p> <p>Only on Monday was the decision taken to have another crack at the midwinter championship race of steeplechasing.</p> <p>\u201cIt would have been an easier option and who\u2019s to say he won\u2019t go back to hurdles after this,\u201d says Tizzard. \u201cBut we talked about it with John and Heather [Snook, owners of Thistlecrack].

      "bodyText": "Easily the most popular winner of Boxing Day\u2019s King George VI Chase would be Thistlecrack, now firmly into the loveable veteran stage of his career. He was the upstart when he won it as a novice chaser three years ago with a tearaway performance so impressive that he seemed to have the game at his mercy, a memory made poignant by the knowledge that he has not won since. While the market has him pegged as a 14-1 shot and expects him to be run ragged by the flashy youngsters Cyrname and Lostintranslation, there is a sizeable gang of followers who have never lost faith: the Thistlecrackers, we might call them. They are given every reason for hope of a miracle at Kempton by the words of those close to the horse. \u201cHe is working brilliantly at the moment,\u201d says his trainer, Colin Tizzard, from his base on the Dorset-Somerset border. \u201cHonestly, he is brilliant. He would be probably as good as anything on our gallop at the moment, if not the best.\u201d This is not what one expects to hear about an 11-year-old that missed the 2017 Gold Cup because of a tendon injury and the following year\u2019s race with a stress fracture. When he finally got to the Cheltenham race in March, he failed to show anything like his best form and was pulled up for the first time. But Kempton has brought out the best in him, notably in last year\u2019s King George, when Might Bite, Native River, Politologue and Waiting Patiently were all better fancied. He beat them all and halfway up the home straight it looked as though he was going to pull off an improbable second success in the race. \u201cI did think he was going to win it,\u201d recalls Tom Scudamore, who has ridden him in every race since April 2015. \u201cWhen Clan Des Obeaux came alongside, I was thinking he hadn\u2019t always been the strongest of finishers. Unfortunately for me and Thistlecrack, he decided to turn over a new leaf that day.\u201d Clan Des Obeaux finished stylishly and had a length and a half in hand at the line over Thistlecrack, who was a dozen lengths clear of everyone else. The winner benefited from a hold-up ride and the result may have been different had Thistlecrack been able to save a bit more for the last half-mile. But that has never been his way. When he won the 2016 race, he tore around Kempton in the manner of a child ripping open presents, as if there was no end to his energy and nothing to gain from restraint. His prodigious leap at the second fence will live in the memory long after he is retired. If he had learned professionalism by then, he would have fitted in an extra stride and popped over, instead of exuberantly hurling himself through the air. It ought to have undermined his finishing effort but the laws of the game seemed suspended that afternoon. \u201cHe\u2019s been an awesome racehorse,\u201d Scudamore says, \u201cto have won so many Grade Ones and a King George as a novice. Obviously, through injuries and what-have-you, he hasn\u2019t quite reached those heights we all thought he was going to do. It\u2019s hard to know what to expect this time but I sat on him last week and he seemed in good order. He ran a cracking race at Newbury last month, which was a great pipe-opener because he needed it really badly. He\u2019s normally going there as one of the favourites but this year it\u2019ll be slightly different.\u201d Tizzard also trains Lostintranslation, whose chance is more obvious, and for a while it looked as though he would switch the older horse away from the King George back into the staying hurdle division he once dominated. Only on Monday was the decision taken to have another crack at the midwinter championship race of steeplechasing. \u201cIt would have been an easier option and who\u2019s to say he won\u2019t go back to hurdles after this,\u201d says Tizzard. \u201cBut we talked about it with John and Heather [Snook, owners of Thistlecrack]. They kept him on the move all summer, kept an element of fitness in him, so that he could have one run and go to the King George. So we\u2019re going to stick to our guns. He\u2019s a big, strong, old-fashioned horse. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s finished for one minute.\u201d Tizzard is always softly spoken but his Dorset tones have been gathering conviction as he reflects on his horse\u2019s chance. \u201cI\u2019m quite looking forward to him running.\u201d",

A day of catastrophic conditions, high-40s temperatures and mass road closures. Emergency-level fires were issued across three states: NSW, South Australia and Victoria. In SA, a second person was confirmed killed, and one seriously injured, in the Adelaide Hills. A man also died in a car crash yesterday at Lameroo. SA premier Steve Marshal confirmed the man was a 24-year old from Queensland, and the crash itself started a fire that injured a resident. 23 firefighters were also injured, one seriously. Five homes, 28 buildings and 16 vehicles have been destroyed. In Victoria, the Marthavale fire in East Gippsland quadrupled in size overnight, growing so large it created its own weather. The Brookville and Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle, Stirling fires went to emergency warning levels but were downgraded on Saturday night In NSW, the huge Gospers Mountain blaze and the Green Wattle Creek fire both returned to emergency after easing overnight There are four fires at emergency warning level: Gospers Mountain, Currowan fire, Owendale, and Upper Turon, Palmers Oaky. The Green Wattle Creek fire was downgraded to watch and act late on Saturday evening, with rain. The massive Gospers Mountain fire crossed Bells Line of Rd in Bilpin today, and has reportedly destroyed at least six homes in Lithgow. A strong southerly came through in the evening but while temperatures dropped, it caused the fires to behave erratically. Most of the major roads that closed during the day have reopened but people are being urged to delay Christmas travel. Prime minister Scott Morrison is believed to have landed back in Sydney tonight. His office has told reporters he is back, but he hasn\u2019t been spotted since the flight landed around 8pm AEDT tonight. He was spotted early this morning still in Hawaii Opposition leader Anthony Albanese said there had been no transparency around the trip, and \u201cmedia enquiries were met with misinformation, at best\u201d after the PM\u2019s office initially told reporters he was not in Hawaii The NSW RFS has set up a dedicated donations fund for the families of two firefighters who died on Thursday after their truck overturned near the Green Wattle Creek fireground. Stay safe, everyone. Brookville fire in Victoria downgraded to watch and act. The federal government is extending the emergency payments to people affected by fires in the Blue Mountains, Lithgow, and Singleton. We now have three fires at emergency warning level in New South Wales: Currowan fire, Gospers Mountain fire, and Upper Turon Rd, Palmers Oaky Amid all that rain, the Green Wattle Creek fire has been downgraded to watch and act. Here\u2019s the latest on the road closures in NSW from AAP: Transport for NSW on Saturday evening reopened the Hume Motorway between Sutton Forest and Narellan, as well as the Picton Road at the M1 and the Princes Highway between Falls Creek and north of Milton. In the Blue Mountains, the Great Western Highway earlier reopened in both directions between Katoomba and Lithgow but the Bells Line of Road and Chifley Road are closed between Kurrajong and Lithgow. Stretches of Megalong Road, Jenolan Caves Road, the Castlereagh Highway and Bowen Mountain Road remain shut. Train lines between Campbelltown and Moss Vale, to the south, and westwards between Katoomba and Bathurst have also been impacted. What a sight - rain! From Mike Bowers at the Green Wattle Creek fire near Bargo. Rain at the Green Wattle Creek fire, my colleague Mike Bowers reports. Just a sense of how close it is to Lithgow. Daily Telegraph reporting on the locations of the six homes lost in Lithgow. There are total fire bans in place from midnight tonight for the Northern Slopes and North Western areas of NSW. Some more photos from Kurrajong. The flight the PM was believed to be on has landed in Sydney from Hawaii. Obviously it\u2019ll be a while before we see anything from him. I\u2019m guessing there will probably be journalists waiting at the airport for him. That strong southerly is going to continue to have a big impact on the fires as RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said earlier. It\u2019s going to be a long night. On road closures, the Great Western Highway is open. The Hume Highway is due to open in the next half an hour, and the Princes Highway is due to open soon. Victor Highway is due to open, too, but a couple of local roads, including Bells Line of Rd will remain closed. People can check Traffic Live for the most current information. Meanwhile, the prime minister\u2019s flight back from Hawaii is about to land, according to this. It\u2019s been circling the airport because of the wind conditions in Sydney. Fitzsimmons says a number of roads remain closed, but RFS will work with police to get those roads open when it is safe to do so, so people can travel. He confirms one man is missing in the Dargan area. He said firefighters spoke to the man this morning, and he said he wants to stay there. His property has been enveloped in fire and he can\u2019t be found now. There\u2019s been multiple injuries including a firefighter hit by a vehicle on the Bells Line of Rd. He is okay, but may have a fracture. A number of other lacerations, injuries, and heat-related problems, but no serious injuries, Fitzsimmons says. We have an update from RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. He says the southerly is having a big impact on the Gospers Mountain fire on towns along the Bells Line of Rd in Bilpin and the surrounding areas. He says there are reports from multiple fire grounds of properties being damaged and destroyed. He says the numbers could be in the dozens. There are still hours to go with this strong southerly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time for that behaviour to settle down... We\u2019ve got a long night ahead.\u201d Just a quick update on the situation as on 7pm AEDT: There are four fires at emergency warning level in New South Wales: Currowan fire, Gospers Mountain fire, Green Wattle Creek and Upper Turon Rd, Palmers Oaky The Gospers Mountain fire is threatening Lithgow and Bilpin on the Bells Line of Rd in the Blue Mountains in particular, but there are many fronts A strong southerly change is dropping temperatures across NSW, but is making fire behave erratically Two emergency warnings in Victoria for fires in Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle, Stirling, and Brookville A couple of fires in South Australia are at a watch and act level, but one man died in a car crash and one was critically injured. You can see in this 7News report how the strong winds are carrying the fire over Bells Line of Road in Bilpin. New South Wales RFS is reporting one person unaccounted for in the Dargan area near Lithgow. The strong southerly change Luke mentioned before is making its way across Sydney. But while it is leading to a quick drop in temperatures, it will cause the fires to behave erratically. My colleague Jessica Hromas is out at the fires in Kurrajong. ABC is reporting at least five homes in Lithgow have been destroyed. We have not confirmed this yet. An emergency warning has been issued for Brookville in Victoria. The bushfire at Barmouth Spur is travelling northerly towards Brookville and embers are falling in Brookville, threatening homes. Josh Taylor here, taking over for Luke as we head into the evening. The bushfires are creating thunderstorms at the Currowan and Tianjara fires in the Shoalhaven, which is just awful. My colleague Graham Redfearn wrote about this phenomena yesterday. Graham explained that scientists are afraid the climate crisis will lead to a surge of these violent thunderstorms, known as PyroCBs. PyroCBs are able to generate their own lightning strikes, mass downdrafts of air, gusty winds and even hail blackened with soot. The plumes generated from pyroCBs can influence the atmosphere at heights of up to 15km. Embers still hot enough to start new fires can be shot out of a pyroCB at distances of 30km from the main fire. Blackheath resident Robert Smith told the Guardian how he left his home in the town after the fires neared. We were advised to leave our home in northern Blackheath about 3pm. Police had set up a road block in our street to keep people away, except residents, as emergency fire trucks charged towards the fire in Grose Valley. Giant plumes of smoke were visible, we didn\u2019t see flames. It was considered best for us to leave early. We were intending to stay to combat ember attacks but we didn\u2019t see any before the fire escalated with the strengthening wind. Traffic was minimal and orderly to Katoomba on Great Western Highway, although west-bound traffic was stopped by police to allow flashing emergency vehicles to tear west to Blackheath, Mt Victoria and Lithgow. We are waiting to see the cooler southerly change take effect before hopefully heading back later this evening. Here is a look at the water bombing effort Mike Bowers relayed to me earlier. Guardian Australia photographer Mike Bowers tells me crews at Yanderra, south of Bargo, have been keeping conditions at bay there. Five or six water bombers have been repeatedly dumping deluge after deluge as they fight to protect homes. For those of you outside of New South Wales, Lithgow is a town of about 12,000 people in the Central Tablelands region of the state. It\u2019s about two hours\u2019 drive west of Sydney. More from out of Lithgow from the local paper, the Bathurst Bulletin. And the RFS posted this earlier. We\u2019re in Kurrajong Heights, where a strike team is setting up ahead of a fire front just on the other side of the hill. The sky is dark, and it is eerily still, with ash falling from the sky. \u201cThe parts we\u2019re worried about being impacted are along here, and a road behind us,\u201d says Greg, who\u2019s leading the strike team here. \u201cAt the moment the rush is not as great as what we thought it was \u2026 It\u2019s about a km away.\u201d Asked if this is the main point of concern, Greg says \u201cit\u2019s everywhere\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s multiple points. It just continues to spot and we can\u2019t stop it.\u201d It\u2019s incredibly still now. Greg laughs. \u201cWhen you\u2019re still that\u2019s when you worry. It\u2019s the calm before the storm. Fires will make their own weather and when they haven\u2019t joined together and had the bonfire effect and there\u2019s a distance between them, usually the main fire front will make its own weather and start driving itself. Which means it sucks all the air from the surrounding areas. \u201cSo if it\u2019s quiet and still, that\u2019s when the worry is.\u201d Ashleigh Coskerie and Jonathon Evripidou live just down the hill. Andrew Helwig is their neighbour. The three have stayed to fight off ember attacks and spot fires on their houses. \u201cIt\u2019s looking pretty bad,\u201d says Evripidou. \u201cIf it comes through it\u2019s going to get 10 times worse, I know that. \u201cIt\u2019s just a waiting game.\u201d Coskerie says they heard their street over the scanner radio and had a moment of panic, but they feel better with so many crews outside. \u201cWe feel safer now we\u2019ve got all the guys in the street\u2026 They\u2019re right there if, you know.\u201d And some more. Awful scenes coming out of Lithgow right now. Now, Bowers says he is in Yanderra, near Bargo and fire is about to impact on properties there. Guardian Australia\u2019s photographer-at-large Mike Bowers was at Bargo, where he says the latest RFS temperature report had it at 41C. We are in Richmond where smoke is extraordinarily thick and the RFS\u2019s 737 Large Air Tanker is doing laps overhead, bombing the fire just a few suburbs away. The Richmond club is acting as the evacuation centre. There hasn\u2019t been an evacuation centre declared officially for this area yet and people are a bit confused about where they are supposed to go, but people are welcome at the Richmond club and many have just shown up with pets and family having left their homes either as a precaution or fleeing the fire. A couple has arrived with seven cats, and another man came down from Mount Bowen on his bike, we\u2019re told. Mary Lyons-Buckett is the deputy mayor of Hawkesbury, and tells us people are mainly coming from Bilpin, Mount Bowen \u2013 which was recently evacuated \u2013 and Kurrajong and Kurrajong Heights. \u201cOur local fire brigades, many of them went up north and have been fighting the fires in Port Macquarie and so on, and they have been fighting this fire in the valley for a good four or five weeks.\u201d \u201cFrom a community perspective there are really heightened emotions, people are tearful just speaking about it even if they aren\u2019t affected.\u201d In that press conference, RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons also confirmed that those Blue Mountains fires are now moving towards the populated Blackheath and Mt Victoria areas. Many residents say they are preparing to evacuate, and pictures have certainly showed the fire conditions there worsening in the past hour or two. Looking to the coming days and weeks ahead, BOM spokeswoman says there were be thunderstorms during Christmas Eve but that won\u2019t be \u201csignificant for fire dampening\u201d. Air quality in the Sydney area will improve to \u201cfair\u201d tomorrow, rather than \u201chazardous\u201d as it has been today. Asked when NSW can expect sustained rainfall, the spokeswoman says there is nothing significant forecast for the next month or two. Fitzsimmons also said that so far in greater Sydney area conditions had not quite reached \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. \u201cA couple of hours to go, hopefully we don\u2019t get there.,\u201d he says. But Fitzsimmons adds: \u201cToday has been an awful day. We have seen property impacted and lost.\u201d Morgan also says that paramedics have received six reports of children locked in cars of the past week, which has diverted them from other work. Dominic Morgan from Ambulance NSW says there are reports of four fire fighters who have suffered heat exhaustion. Their conditions range from minor to \u201cquite severe\u201d. Fitzsimmons notes the smoke that has engulfed the greater Sydney area has effectively served as an \u201cinsulator\u201d. He says that has been \u201cpreventing some of the temperatures getting as high we might have thought for this time of the day which is a good thing\u201d. Fitzsimmons says there will be improved \u2013 that is, milder \u2013 conditions including a dramatic temperature drop after today. Having said that, conditions are such that tomorrow, a couple of total fire bans for the northern area of New South Wales reflect the the local combination of hot, dry and windy conditions. We will not get on top of these fires until we get some decent rain, we have said that for weeks and months. Hi there, Luke Henriques-Gomes here again taking over from Naaman. I\u2019m sure I speak for all of you when I say thanks for your work here today, Naaman. Fitzsimmons says there are no reports of serious injuries. One firefighter needed treatment at the fire near Balmoral. There are also reports of homes being damaged or destroyed near Lithgow and reports of fires approaching buildings in Balmoral. NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons is providing a briefing as we speak. There are new fires, including south of Nowra, and another south of Tumut which began around noon. It\u2019s believed that fire was sparked by a torched car. He says major roads impacted by the fires include the Princes highway heading south, the Hume highway heading south from Sydney, and the Great Western highway heading out of Sydney. The SA premier, Steven Marshall, has cancelled his own planned Christmas holiday, according to AAP. Marshall had been scheduled to leave this week for a holiday in New Zealand. But he said today he would stay in Adelaide while the fire emergency was active. \u201cMy focus at the moment is not on my Christmas holidays,\u201d he said earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to make sure we get through this difficult period.\u201d There are reports now that NSW departmental employees have been telling people at evacuation centres not to speak to media. That\u2019s even if the residents are happy to talk. The ABC\u2019s Isobel Roe, Selby Stewart and Rhett Burnie have all shared their experiences of this happening yesterday. Staff at the centres were welcoming, they clarify. AAP reports that tonight\u2019s Big Bash match in Canberra may be called off due to smoke. Haze resulting from bushfires will be discussed in the pre-match medical briefing at Manuka Oval, where the game between Sydney Thunder and Adelaide Strikers is slated to start at 6.10pm AEDT, AAP reports. If visibility is too poor and/or Air Quality Index (AQI) data is too alarming, then play will not go ahead. The pre-match briefing at Manuka Oval is due to take place at 5.10pm AEDT on Saturday night. In weather news, the southerly has come through Nowra. It will reach Sydney at 5pm, the Hunter region at 8pm and the mid-north coast closer to midnight. This will change wind directions and worsen fires, the RFS and bureau say. SA veterinarians say it is \u201chorrendous\u201d in the state as they rescue wildlife, reports Royce Kurmelovs. The South Australian Veterinary Emergency Management (Savem) is a response and recovery agency for Australian wildlife that has been activated by the South Australian government. Savem is a volunteer group of veterinarians who work to rescue and treat wildlife caught up in bushfires. Dr Rachel Westcott, the groups\u2019s coordinator, said she had two staff doing reconnaissance today, with two strike teams of 25 or 30 people to be sent out tomorrow when access to the area has been permitted by the CFS. \u201cIt\u2019s horrendous \u2013 it\u2019s very bad,\u201d she said. \u201cI have not been out there yet. I\u2019m a practising vet, so I\u2019m wrapping up my work today so I can be there tomorrow. We have our operations manager and nursing coordinator surveying the situation.\u201d An updated emergency warning from Victoria: properties are now impacted in Tambo Crossing. The fire is travelling in a north-easterly direction and impacting private property in Tambo Crossing, the CFA says. \u201cThe Great Alpine Road is closed between Ensay and Bruthen. If you are leaving from the Ensay area, travel north towards Omeo on the Great Alpine Road.\u201d And the Tianjara fire has now changed direction. The southerly change has crossed the firegound and it is now moving north towards Terpentine Road. For those in Wandandian and Jerrawangala, it is too late to leave. There are six fires currently at emergency level in NSW, after conditions worsened this afternoon. The Grose Valley fire and Upper Turon Road fires were upgraded 20 minutes ago to emergency. At the Grose Valley fire, fire activity is increasing along Hat Hill Road in Blackheath. Fire activity is increasing all across the Upper Turon Road fireground and there is a risk of ember attack near Razorback Road and Cherry Tree Hill. The Currowan fire is increasing in both the north-east (Fishermans Paradise and Cunjurong Point) and south-west (Braidwood) corners of the fire. At the same time, the Green Wattle Creek fire, which was already at emergency, is approaching Yanderra. McCormack also confirms that Morrison will arrive back in Australia today. \u201cHe is on his way back to the country and that is a good thing,\u201d he says. \u201cNo-one could have envisaged the week we have had. \u201cEveryone is entitled to holiday \u2013 many people, not just politicians, take a break. He will be back today.\u201d Michael McCormack is asked if he believes we can do more to combat climate change. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d he says. But he says the important thing for now is \u201cto put fires out\u201d. He also says climate change is not the only factor. Other factors include lighting and even \u201cself-combusting horse manure\u201d \u2013 a point he made on Thursday as well. \u201cFor those running around saying we should abandon coal right now, what are we going to do with our electricity over summer if we shut them all down today? Coal provides almost two-thirds of our energy needs.\u201d As for the coalition of former fire chiefs, including Greg Mullins, who are urging action on climate change and a shift to renewables, McCormack says: \u201cLet\u2019s remember they are funded by Tim Flannery.\u201d But he agrees we do need more action on climate change \u2013 \u201cwhatever that may be\u201d, in the words of the reporter. Hi all, Naaman Zhou back here. Thanks to Luke Henriques-Gomes for his work on the blog just then. Michael McCormack fronted the media in Wagga Wagga earlier. The ABC is broadcasting the press conference now. Littleproud is also asked whether Australia should do more to combat climate change. He says the government is committed to meeting the Paris targets. When asked if, yes or no, the government believes more can be done, he dodges the question. But Littleproud says climate change has \u201cbeen a contributing factor\u201d to the current fires. You might remember these comments he made on the same topic three months ago. Littleproud has defended Scott Morrison for going on holiday to Hawaii during the fire crisis. Asked if he would have gone on holidays to Hawaii, Littleproud says: \u201cThe reality is the operational management of fires sits with the state governments and they do an exemplary job. \u201cWe need to get out of their hair at times. There comes times when too many politicians are around.\u201d David Littleproud, the minister for natural disaster and emergency management, is at Sydney airport awaiting the arrival of firefighters from Canada who will be on the ground helping their Australian counterparts from Sunday morning. Pressed on whether firefighting resources are adequate, Littleproud acknowledges that if the fires carry on, \u201cwe are going to continue to be stretched\u201d. The 30 Canadian firefighters will be joining nine from the United States who are also assisting the effort in NSW. Another dispatch from Royce Kurmelovs in Adelaide: Denis Noble, 76, spent yesterday fighting bushfires near his home in Charleston in the Adelaide Hills. Denis and his wife had only moved into the property a week ago when they watched the blaze come over the hill in the morning and slowly engulf the paddock across the road from his house. Their neighbours, who are in their 30s and 40s, helped fight the blaze. \u201cIt came slowly, inexorably towards us,\u201d Denis said. \u201cWe\u2019re oldies. They\u2019re full of energy and tearing around with buckets. Everybody pitched in to stop the fire and it stopped at the roadway. It was a good way to get to know the new neighbours.\u201d Denis\u2019s son, Andrew, who also works as a paramedic, has been fighting the Cudlee Creek fires with the CFS as part of the Basket Range CFS brigade, which are currently deployed around Birdwood. This morning Denis and his wife drove into Stirling as the power to their property had been cut and there was no mobile service. On the way they drove past two properties that had been destroyed. \u201cIt was devastating to see,\u201d Denis said. \u201cWe saw at least two houses that were just a pile of wreckage. It breaks your heart to see that, because you know it\u2019s been someone\u2019s residence for quite some time and you don\u2019t like to think of what they lost.\u201d An emergency warning has been issued for the fire at Tianjara, south-west of Nowra. The NSW RFS says: \u201cThe fire is burning towards Wandandian and Jerrawangala. It is too late to leave \u2013 seek shelter. Sussex Inlet Road is now closed. It is too dangerous to leave.\u201d Residents in Sussex Inlet are being urged to remain there. \u201cThere is no immediate threat to Sussex Inlet,\u201d the RFS says. Hi all, it\u2019s Luke Henriques-Gomes here. I\u2019ll be taking over from Naaman while he has a well-earned break. If you want to bring something to my attention, please send me an email at luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or get in touch on Twitter (@lukehgomes). A frank exchange of views here on Sunrise about Scott Morrison\u2019s holiday to Hawaii. \u201cHe decides to apologise yesterday. I didn\u2019t think he had any reason to apologise to anyone,\u201d says 2GB\u2019s Chris Smith. \u201cHawaii, that strip in Honolulu is so small, if you want to see someone who is in Hawaii, you just go to that strip and see them. It\u2019s a very small place.\u201d Smith declares it \u201cthe biggest beat-up I have seen in 40 years\u201d. Gretel Killeen says she is \u201cgobsmacked\u201d at both Smith and host Bazil Zempilas\u2019s opinion. \u201cI am confounded at what your understanding of leadership is?\u201d she asks. \u201cChris, yelling at me will not convince me. The majority of the country agrees ... the surveys show that.\u201d Protesters have gathered for a second day outside Kirribilli House in Sydney. Many are holding placards and posters attacking the prime minister for inaction on climate change and a lack of leadership during this week\u2019s bushfire crisis. Protesters are chanting: \u201cThe oceans are rising, no more compromising.\u201d Protesters also gathered on Thursday, when 13-year-old Izzy Raj-Seppings was given a move-on order from police. A day of catastrophic conditions, high-40s temperatures and mass road closures has so far panned out as authorities feared. Emergency-level fires are blazing across three states: NSW, South Australia and Victoria. In SA, a second person was confirmed killed, and one seriously injured, in the Adelaide Hills. A man also died in a car crash yesterday at Lameroo. SA premier Steve Marshal confirmed the man was a 24-year old from Queensland, and the crash itself started a fire that injured a resident. 23 firefighters were also injured, one seriously. SA firefighters still have up to 100 properties or calls to follow up on to see if others are affected. A fire on Kangaroo Island remains at emergency, while the Cudlee Creek fire was downgraded to watch and act. Five homes, 28 buildings and 16 vehicles have been destroyed. In Victoria, the Marthavale fire in East Gippsland quadrupled in size overnight, growing so large it created its own weather. It is still at emergency level. There are two emergency warnings in place: for Ensay, Reedy Flat, Stirling and Holstons; and Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle and Stirling. In NSW, the huge Gospers Mountain blaze and the Green Wattle Creek fire both returned to emergency after easing overnight. The NSW premier and police have told residents to please delay travel: \u201cToday is not the day to start your holiday.\u201d Prime minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to return to Australia by tonight, but was spotted at 7am AEDT still in Hawaii. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese said there had been no transparency around the trip, and \u201cmedia enquiries were met with misinformation, at best\u201d after the PM\u2019s office initially told reporters he was not in Hawaii. The NSW RFS has set up a dedicated donations fund for the families of two firefighters who died on Thursday after their truck overturned near the Green Wattle Creek fireground. Also in Lexton, this dispatch from the local camel sanctuary. The Lithgow area of the Gospers Mountain fire is now also at emergency. Fire activity is increasing in Bell, Clarence and Dargan. A few minutes ago, an emergency alert was issued for between Bilpin and Kurrajong Heights. The Gospers Mountain fire is a very large fire with many fronts, and conditions vary in different areas. The Green Wattle Creek fire \u2013 one of the fiercest fires this week \u2013 is back at emergency. There are now two fires at emergency in NSW. Two firefighters died on Thursday when their truck overturned on the way to the Green Wattle Creek fire, and two were seriously injured in a separate incident the same day when flames jumped into tree tops and overwhelmed their crew. The Marthavale fire in Victoria, which quadrupled in size overnight, became so big it began \u201cgenerating its own weather\u201d, the State Control Centre\u2019s Luke Heagerty told the ABC. \u201cThis fire was large enough to be generating some of its own weather \u2026 and was driving itself along purely with the energy created by the fire,\u201d he said. And elsewhere, in Lexton in the state\u2019s west, residents have shared stories of the evacuation. Julie Garden, the owner of the Stag Hotel, told the ABC: \u201cIt was a bit scary but we were OK. There were a lot of cars going to the football club and everyone was up and about hanging around for a while to see what was going to happen. We could just see a lot of smoke.\u201d Avoca Milk Bar owner Karan Verma said: \u201cWe closed around 8.30pm and at 10pm a woman called up crying.\u201d And this frightening footage from Adelaide. As poster Lucky Tran says: \u201cThousands of expats are now returning home to Australia for the holidays and seeing sights like this from the plane. Incredibly heartbreaking.\u201d The Gospers Mountain fire covers a very large area, and emergency warnings and conditions will vary in different parts of the area. The most dangerous area now is from Bilpin to Kurrajong Heights. Fire activity is increasing here, on the southern side of Bells Line of Road, the RFS says. The path is clear to Richmond, and a safer location is the Richmond Club on East Market Street. The threat has eased at Lithgow, Hermitage Flat, McKellars Park and Cobar Park. But people in all areas should be aware that embers can start spot fires ahead of the main fire front, and conditions can change. The predicted fire spread map is here. Many roads remain closed. Gospers Mountain has flared back to emergency level. It was burning at emergency level earlier this morning, before being downgraded to wach and act. The huge fire, burning over 459,848 hectares, is now back to emergency. Some parts of NSW will hit the mid 40s today, including the Sydney metropolitan, the bureau of meteorology says. Meanwhile the smoke is thick in Canberra, and there is not much rain forecast for the future. Firefighters across NSW are working today despite the grief of losing two of their colleagues and friends on Thursday. Flags were flown at half-mast on Friday after the two young fathers, Geoffrey Keaton, 32, and Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, 36, were killed when their truck turned over near the Green Wattle Creek fire. Their brigade, the Horsley Park Rural Fire Brigade, is already back on firegounds. \u201cIn true Horsley Park spirit, our crew are heading out today as part of a Cumberland Zone Strike Team in memory of Geoff and Andrew,\u201d the Horsley Park RFS posted on Facebook. NSW police are speaking now. Bells Line of Road, in the Blue Mountains, is closed and they do not know when it will be reopened. Train lines between McCarthur and Moss Vale are closed. Buses are running to replace them, but in some areas buses cannot enter. The Princes Highway going south is still open at this stage. \u201cWe really appreciate the public heeding calls to delay travel,\u201d a police spokeswoman says. It has helped police and firefighters cope, she says. \u201cToday is not the day to start your holiday. Delay your travel until tomorrow.\u201d From Royce Kurmelovs in Adelaide: SA Water are reporting that water has been restored to the Adelaide Hills region overnight. Water stopped flowing to some towns within the evacuation zone as SA power networks conducted a planned shutdown of the electricity supply as the blaze spread. This cut off power to the pumps, which stopped water from flowing, though no one is expected to have been affected. SA water crews have set up back-up generators that will see water return to Lenswood, Lobethal, Woodside and surrounding areas today. In the meantime, a temporary supply of water remains available for customers to collect opposite the Oakbank Hotel, 207 Onkaparinga Valley Road, Oakbank. SA premier Steven Marshall ended that press conference by saying: \u201cMy focus at the moment is not on my Christmas holidays, it\u2019s trying to make sure we get through this difficult period.\u201d Prominent racing identity John Glatz was also taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital, the SA premier said. The ABC is reporting that Glatz\u2019s friends and family said he was in a serious condition. Also in that press conference, CFS chief Mark Jobs said a dry lightning storm sparked eight separate fires on Kangaroo Island yesterday. That fire is now expected to burn for many more days. CFS crews have been bolstered by metropolitan fire services today as well. Twenty-three firefighters were injured yesterday, one seriously. CFS chief Mark Jobs confirmed the injured firefighter was seriously hurt and remained in hospital. \u201cAgainst the catastrophic conditions and the backdrop of unprecedented challenge, it is remarkable so few of the firefighters and emergency responders were injured,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful that none seem to have been terribly so.\u201d He said the Cudlee Creek fire in the Adelaide Hills had burned through 25,000 hectares by 8am this morning. \u201cThree CFS trucks were burned out yesterday.\u201d SA police have confirmed that a person has died in the Charleston area in the Adelaide Hills and another is injured. Yesterday, a man died in a car crash near Lameroo. Police are also in the process of visiting the area to see if any others are affected. There are 90 to 100 properties or calls they are following up on, police commissioner Grant Stevens says. \u201cIndications are at this stage that it may be a tree on power lines\u201d that sparked it and the fire is not suspicious. SA premier Steve Marshall confirmed that five homes, 28 buildings and 16 vehicles had been destroyed. Stevens says 27 tier-1 road closures are currently in place across the state. \u201cTier-1 road closures mean only emergency services personnel are able to enter those locations,\u201d he says. From Adelaide, correspondent Royce Kurmelovs has the latest: CFS crews have battled the flames in the Adelaide Hills well into the night as the fire has burnt unchecked across 25,000 hectares. While conditions eased overnight, those flying into Adelaide could see the flames from the air as the fire burned out of control. The area of Cudlee Creek is rough terrain, which has made the blaze difficult to control, while the extreme conditions of previous days has given it more ferocity. The blaze was downgraded to Watch and Act at 5am, though windy conditions this morning mean it remains uncontained. Residents of the area have been left with a nervous wait for news of their homes, with reports of many having been lost. Road closures remain in effect as large trees are blocking roads, while the ground continues to smoulder even in areas which may appear clear. A community meeting will be held at the Oakbank area school at 1.30pm and while there is no available information about property damage, the CFS will be deploying rapid damage assessment teams today to take stock. Meanwhile, the blaze sparked by a lightning strike on Kangaroo Island continues to burn. The CFS says there are \u201cquite a few\u201d fires burning in the area and that a reconnaissance flight is planned for today to assess the situation. The NSW RFS has set up an official fundraising portal for the families of the two volunteers \u2013 Geoffrey Keaton and Andrew O\u2019Dwyer \u2013 who were killed on Thursday while on duty at the Green Wattle Creek fire. The link is here. \u201cAll funds received will be equally distributed between the spouses of Geoffrey and Andrew, and tax receipts will be issued to donors,\u201d the RFS said. \u201cBoth Geoffrey and Andrew leave behind loving partners and very young children.\u201d Geoffrey Keaton was 32 years old, joined the RFS in 2006 and was deputy captain of the Horsley Park brigade. Andrew O\u2019Dwyer was 36 and joined the RFS in 2003. And at Bankwest Stadium in Sydney last night, a touching tribute was held for the two firefighters during the Western Sydney Wanderers v Western United A-League match. And for more on the communications kerfuffle and the PR disaster of the PM\u2019s trip, Amy Remeikis has the definitive read. Anthony Albanese has criticised Scott Morrison\u2019s office for a lack of transparency and for what he called \u201cmisinformation\u201d over the PM\u2019s Hawaii holiday. Earlier this week, Albanese said he would not attack the holiday itself, and Morrison was entitled to one, but it was the lack of information that was the issue. In a 2GB radio interview yesterday, Morrison said he would return \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and that he texted Albanese\u2019s office on Monday to let him know of his vacation. Today, Albanese has doubled down, as uncertainty still swirls as to precisely when Morrison will return to the top job. \u201cMichael McCormack, for a while there, his office wouldn\u2019t even confirm that he was acting PM,\u201d Albanese says. \u201cThe usual protocols have not been followed. \u201cMedia enquiries were met with misinformation, at best.\u201d The New Daily\u2019s Samantha Maiden had, after asking for confirmation, been told over text by the PM\u2019s office that Morrison was not in Hawaii and those claims were \u201cwrong\u201d. It was then confirmed the PM was in fact in Hawaii. And he was last sighted still on the island at 7am AEDT today. \u201cThis is the government that doesn\u2019t like scrutiny,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cIt hides from transparency and it is not good enough.\u201d \u201cThe problem with this government is that it is not prepared to acknowledge that this is not business as usual,\u201d Albanese says. He says the government needs to \u201cget its act together on climate change and energy\u201d. He adds that he would guarantee extra funding for fire services. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese is speaking now. He says he received a briefing yesterday from federal authorities that holidaymakers \u2013 especially in the Shoalhaven coast \u2013 should reconsider plans. \u201cIt will be a circumstance where we don\u2019t want people driving into dangerous areas,\u201d he says. 40C heat and heavy smoke in Canberra have sparked an official health alert from ACT Health \u2013 the second in a row after yesterday. It says: \u201cPeople who are sensitive to smoke, especially those with pre-existing heart and lung conditions, should take extra care and stay indoors where possible and take medication prescribed by their doctor.\u201d And across NSW, that heat is rising. And overnight, SA premier Steven Marshall confirmed that a man who was killed in a car crash yesterday was a 24-year-old from Queensland. Police said he crashed into a tree off the Mallee Highway near Lameroo about 2.30pm. ABC reports that four properties have been confirmed destroyed in South Australia. Two major fires are still burning and posing a threat to lives and homes. The Country Fire Service has advised that there is a threat to lives on the northern side of Kangaroo Island, where a fire is burning at emergency level. That includes Cape Forbin and Emu Bay, including Snelling Beach, King George Beach, Stokes Bay Hummocky Point, White Cliffs, Dashwood Bay, Smith Beach, Wisanger and the Emu Bay township. In Victoria, the Marthavale fire in East Gisppsland quadrupled in size overnight, according to the Country Fire Authority. Incident controller Bernard Barbetti told the ABC it flared up after a wind change. \u201cIt has spotted out into the private land but we\u2019ve had firefighters at Tambo Crossing overnight, and at Ensay, and at the moment we\u2019re not aware of any losses,\u201d he said. Emergency services commissioner Andrew Crisp said firefighters were facing \u201ca long, long way to go\u201d. The Mathavale-Barmouth Spur fire is currently at emergency. It is out of control and travelling in a north-easterly direction towards Ensay. The CFA is telling residents: \u201cThe Great Alpine Road is closed between Bruthen and Ensay. If you are leaving from the Ensay area, travel north towards Omeo on the Great Alpine Road. \u201cThere is increased fire activity throughout the landscape and many tracks in the surrounding area are closed. Avoid entering the forest areas as the situation may change rapidly due to spot fires.\u201d A relief centre is open at the Omeo Memorial Hall in Omeo. A round-up of the fires as they stand at the moment. In Victoria, two fires are at emergency, both in East Gippsland. In SA, a fire on Kangaroo Island is at emergency, while the Cudlee Creek fire in the Adelaide Hills is at watch and act. In New South Wales, two watch and act warnings are in place for Gospers Mountain fire and Green Wattle Creek. Gospers Mountain was only downgraded 30 minutes ago. There is an emergency warning in Victoria for the Marthavale-Barmouth Spur fire. The warning is for Ensay, Ensay North, Ensay South, Reedy Flat, Stirling and Holstons. In good news, the Gospers Mountain fire has been downgraded to watch and act. \u201cThe immediate threat has eased\u201d for Lithgow, Hermitage Flat, McKellars Park &amp; Cobar Park, the RFS says. Berejiklian also thanked people who had changed plans and avoided roads. \u201cThe best thing we can do to support all of our volunteers and emergency service personnel on the ground is to take their advice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to unintentionally get themselves in harm\u2019s way. I want to thank everyone who may have changed their plans or heeded advice because we don\u2019t want anyone to unintentionally find themselves or a loved one in danger today.\u201d There are road closures all across the country today. And in a press conference earlier today, the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, told residents to please be aware of the closures and avoid travel on roads in fire areas. \u201cWe are asking everybody not to travel on roads near the vicinity of an active fire unless you absolutely have to,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at the livetraffic.com website before you leave home today. Avoid the Princes Highway all together, there are active fires which could become very dangerous in a short amount of time.\u201d An RFS volunteer has just been on ABC Radio NSW, with much the same advice. He tells listeners, try and stay home with plenty of food and water. Postpone visiting relatives, or going on holiday, even though it is the time of year for it. Canadian crews are out there helping Australian volunteers today. The Sunday Telegraph\u2019s political editor, Annika Smethurst, has reported that prime minister Scott Morrison was spotted in a lift today in Hawaii \u2013 at about 7am Australian time. Yesterday he had promised to return \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to Australia from an overseas family holiday. He had originally been planning to return to the PM role \u2013 not necessarily to the country \u2013 by Monday night. Smethurst also says the PM\u2019s office says he will be back by later tonight. There is a community meeting today in Victoria for the Lexton fire. And there is a continuing emergency warning for the Gum Creek Road fire in Menzies in South Australia. In Victoria, the Chute, Lexton, Mount Lonarch fire has been downgraded to watch and act, after flaring to emergency last night. But the fire near Stirling, Tambo Crossing and Wattle Circle is still at emergency. And if you are wondering how you can donate to or help the firefighting effort, whether through time, money or otherwise, Guardian Australia yesterday published this guide based on fire authority and evacuation centre advice. And read this morning\u2019s feature from environment editor Adam Morton, on the climate of chaos. It explains how weather events and global warming have led to the scale of these horrible fires \u2013 and two record-breaking hot days. Finally, our interactive map on the size of the fires has been updated. An emergency warning has just been issued for the huge Gospers Mountain fire in NSW. Good morning and welcome to our continuing coverage of this week\u2019s heatwave and the ongoing bushfire crisis. It was a horror day yesterday and on Thursday. Two firefighters in NSW were killed on Thursday when their truck overturned near, and two were seriously injured in a separte incident near Bargo. On Friday, one person was confirmed killed in a car crash in South Australia in the fire zone, and eight fire fighters were injured. Today, conditions in NSW are set to worsen. Catastrophic conditions have been declared in NSW for Greater Sydney, Illawarra/Shoalhaven, and Southern Ranges. This is only the second time catastrophic conditions have ever been declared for greater Sydney. The first time was last month. Catastrophic conditions are the equivalent of the conditions during the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria. Fires continue to burn across multiple states. Stay safe out there, keep in tune to emergency radio, and follow the advice of your local fire authority.",

In July this year, he suggested she and three other women of colour \u2013 members of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/the-squad-name-origins-aoc-ilhan-omar-ayanna-pressley-rashida-tlaib\" title=\"\">the so-called Squad</a> of progressives newly elected to Congress \u2013 should \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/trump-rally-send-her-back-ilhan-omar\" title=\"\">go back</a>\u201d to the \u201cplaces from which they came\u201d. In some ways, Omar is the most visible of the four: she is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/ilhan-omar-hijab-congress-headwear\" title=\"\">first person ever to wear a hijab in Congress</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tsdhesi.com/\" title=\"\">Tan Dhesi</a>, Labour MP for Slough, understands the law of firsts: the 41-year-old is the first member of parliament to wear a turban and, like Omar, has a reputation for speaking out against anti-Muslim sentiment in government. In September, during prime minister\u2019s questions,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/boris-johnson-urged-to-apologise-for-muslim-women-letterboxes-article\" title=\"\"> Dhesi called on Boris Johnson to apologise</a> for his remarks about Muslim women looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d which, to cheers from the chamber, he called \u201cderogatory and racist\u201d.</p> <p>The two politicians meet for the first time in November via Skype \u2013 Dhesi from his constituency office, Omar from Washington DC. As minority ethnic members of government, the MP and the congresswoman are both keenly aware of what is at stake in their respective countries\u2019 forthcoming elections, and of what happens when political rhetoric lurches to the right. Both are campaigning on broad platforms for better welfare provision, less restrictive immigration policy and deeper government efforts to combat racism. Omar has had to confront accusations of antisemitism, after a tweet uncovered from 2012referred to Israel, in its actions in Gaza, as having \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/ilhan-omar-antisemitic-tweets-house-democrats-apology\" title=\"\">hypnotized the world</a>\u201d. She has since apologised for inadequately \u201cdisavowing the antisemitic trope I unknowingly used\u201d.</p> <p>These are difficult times and the two politicians seek, in their discussion, to reach across the Atlantic in a spirit of progressive solidarity. They discuss the experience of standing up to their country\u2019s leaders; of the role played by family background in their ability to represent marginalised communities; and of what it\u2019s like simply to look different from everyone else in one\u2019s workplace \u2013 as well as the question of whether Omar might be persuaded, one day, to visit Dhesi in Slough, a suggestion she greets with warm if somewhat baffled enthusiasm.</p> <p><strong>Tan Dhesi</strong> I was very touched when I heard we were going to do this. I thought, oh, brilliant.</p> <p>We\u2019re in the middle of a general election here, so let\u2019s see how that works out!</p> <p><strong>Ilhan Omar</strong> What is the timeline for your elections?</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>It should be every five years, but because the Conservatives lost their majority, they got forced into an election after only two and a half. I\u2019ve only been a member of parliament for that long.</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> And so everybody has to stand for re-election?</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>Yes. So I am no longer a member of parliament \u2013 I\u2019m a candidate. Hopefully we can be part of the sea change, and it\u2019ll be a Labour government this year. Then come next year, you guys are in, yeah?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re cheering for a change to happen in England!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"3f0c396c73a1bb897f4a3d22b9fb6954eb7a6fc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f0c396c73a1bb897f4a3d22b9fb6954eb7a6fc2/1274_532_996_996/500.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of Tan Dhesi, Labour MP for Slough\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"8f21a8472d1f9f5e34c844ef6391abc59c1a82a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f21a8472d1f9f5e34c844ef6391abc59c1a82a2/1185_1580_2374_2374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>IO</strong> Oh my God, I can\u2019t even begin to dream about that. We\u2019re cheering for a change to happen in England. And since my journey has been covered quite a lot \u2013 and it\u2019s been a wild one \u2013 maybe you can tell me a little bit about what got you interested in being a part of government and a public servant?</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>I was born and brought up here in the Slough area, but I actually studied in the Punjab, in India, for four years when I was young; my primary schooling was there, then I came back to the UK.</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> Where in Punjab? I don\u2019t know if you knew this about me, but I\u2019m a huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bollywood\" title=\"\">Bollywood</a> fan.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>No way!</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> So I feel like I\u2019ve been to India, even though I haven\u2019t.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>Well, I look forward to welcoming you to our ancestral village out there. We\u2019re near a city called Jalandhar: it\u2019s the hub of bhangra music. I went to university in Scotland, then returned down south. Since university I\u2019ve been a member of the Labour party. Then I became an elected councillor, then mayor of the town. And after about a decade, I became a member of parliament for Slough, where my parents emigrated in the 70s. Little could they have imagined their son would go on to become the MP for that town.</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> That\u2019s amazing. So we have a little bit of that in common. I worked for a city council member in the city of Minneapolis.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>Where were you born and brought up?</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> I was born in Somalia, in the capital city, and I lived there for eight years. Then the civil war happened, and my family had the misfortune of being the clan that was being cleansed, and we were chased out. We fled to Kenya and lived in a refugee camp for four years, before getting the opportunity to come to the US in 1995. So I\u2019ve been here for over two decades now.</p> <p>My interest has always been around the expansion of democracy; my family was born into colonised Somalia and had been part of a generation that had fought to gain independence and was distraught when dictatorship fell on the country after just seven years of democratic government. My grandfather, who helped raise me, was very excited to come to the US and participate in democracy, so at the age of 14 I would accompany him to vote and translate for him. He understood democracy but he didn\u2019t understand the language to access it. And I hated the fact that in a country that, on paper, had all of these rights extended to its citizens, in actuality had ways of limiting people\u2019s access. So my work became trying to make our country live up to its ideals, and shift the current reality for all of us.</p> <p>It was really daunting to be a young refugee kid who was also Muslim and black to come to the US \u2013 the land of opportunity \u2013 and realise for the first time that every identity of mine that I\u2019d been so proud of was held in contempt by many of my neighbours. I understood early on that the excitement my grandfather had about this country was enshrined in the constitution, and that it was up to all of us to make sure we had equal access to those guaranteed rights.</p> <p>My organising work has been around fighting economic inequality, and trying to make sure we\u2019re not just being tolerant, but being an accepting and welcoming country for all. I\u2019ve also dealt with a lot of the issues around police brutality, our mass incarceration problems, and our inability to care for our most vulnerable. It\u2019s been an interesting journey.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>The good thing is we share our politics \u2013 if I was talking to one of your Republican colleagues, this conversation would be more difficult!</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> In the US, the majority of the challenges I face are people pointing out I should be grateful. I\u2019m an immigrant to this country and it has welcomed me, and I should count my blessings and never point out any differences between the reality and the ideal.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if there is pushback [in the UK] when you talk about the inequalities that persist?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don't get elected because we\u2019re different. We get elected because we speak to the challenges our constituents face</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>TD </strong>Things have improved a lot since the days when our grandparents or our parents immigrated here. My grandparents \u2013 my mum\u2019s parents \u2013 came in the 60s, then my dad in the 70s. Mum and Dad got married and had to face a lot of discrimination: somebody wearing a turban couldn\u2019t drive a bus in the UK; they couldn\u2019t ride a motorcycle; they couldn\u2019t do many things in terms of a day job. So there was a struggle there.</p> <p>But thankfully there was also [support] from some people who had seen, for example, how the Sikh communities were preponderant within the British Indian army. Before 1947, Sikhs made up 20% of the army and the British Indian army constituted the largest volunteer army ever; more than one and a half million people fought during the first and second world wars. And because of that, many [British people in power] were sympathetic, so they helped those activists, as well as people on the left in the Labour party, to change the laws. </p> <p>While most of my life at school was positive, there were negatives. You\u2019d have racist incidents \u2013 for example, someone tried to pull off my turban.</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> Yeah, they would put gum on my hijab, or try to pull it off when I was in school.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>Something like that dents your self-confidence. And it takes you days, sometimes weeks, to recover. But we were strong; whether it\u2019s inner self-confidence or that we are able to focus on the positives, it\u2019s made us stronger. It\u2019s important that we didn\u2019t let those incidents scar us. You\u2019ve got a minority of people who are haters, who just don\u2019t like us or are not accepting. Because the word \u201ctolerant\u201d, like you said, is not the same as \u201caccepting\u201d. It\u2019s we\u2019re \u201ctolerating\u201d you.</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> Yes. \u201cWe put up with it.\u201d This is our country as well. We don\u2019t get to be made to feel like guests. Was there a law that needed to be changed for you to have your turban as a member of parliament?</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>No.</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> You\u2019re luckier than I am!</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>So many similarities. You were the first hijabi within the US Congress, and there had never been a single person wearing a turban in the British or European parliament. In our own way, we helped to break a glass ceiling.</p> <p>But I tell you what, for the most part my Labour colleagues are a very diverse set. There are people who\u2019ve worked in a whole array of industries, but they were very helpful, and showed me the various parliamentary protocols. I don\u2019t know how it is in your Congress, but in ours, everything you say has to be addressed via the Speaker.</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> It\u2019s the same here. You get censored if you address the member. You have to address the Speaker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c51eecf1f0ec35f0b914d9601216e4a528e1ee78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c51eecf1f0ec35f0b914d9601216e4a528e1ee78/13_49_4977_2985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tan Dhesi, Labour MP for Slough, and Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>TD </strong>I think there is a sense that in many of these institutions, you\u2019ve got elite people who are detached from reality, and it\u2019s more of an issue among the Conservatives here, some of whom, I think, would find it very difficult [to understand] what the average Joe has to face out on the street. Is it the same there?</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> Yes. The majority of people [in Congress] are millionaires; the majority are over 50; and the majority are white. And so our lived experience, as Congress as a whole, is very different to the majority of the people we represent. That\u2019s why I talk a lot about needing people to be in these rooms who have fluency in the day-to-day struggles of the people they seek to represent. It\u2019s not enough that we have diverse faces and voices; it also needs to be diverse lived experiences. For example, someone who took at least 10 years to complete a four-year degree \u2013 I understand that because I had two young babies right out of high school.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>Oh, right. How many children have you got?</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> I have three.</p> <p><strong>TD</strong> I\u2019ve only got two.</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> Yes, so to speak to the challenges that many of our young families are facing: they have to make a choice about going back to school, getting that degree in order to have the prosperity or maintain a job to be able to feed themselves. We\u2019re struggling here to raise the minimum wage to $15 (\u00a312). All of these challenges are things I\u2019ve had to live with, and folks in my neighbourhood had to live with \u2013 they\u2019re not just a story someone tells me \u2013 so I\u2019m more urgent in addressing them. And even trying to make sure I could sit as a member of Congress \u2013 because I was going to be the first person to wear a hijab, and we had a 181-year ban on headscarves. I was contemplating what it would look like for me to walk into a majority Republican caucus and them not allow me to sit.</p> <p>These are the kind of fears that some people have in trying to run for office. It\u2019s not just the tolerance or respect they might get from their constituents in sending them [to Washington]; it\u2019s also having to deal with what you will face once you get there. Because the powers that be get to control the narrative, and have the rules tilted in their favour.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>I tell you what, I\u2019m very, very proud of being part of this parliament, the most diverse ever.</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> Same here.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>We\u2019ve got more women, more ethnic minorities, more LGBT people, more people with disabilities than ever before, and a large part of that is because of the Labour party: 46% of all our MPs are women; we\u2019ve more minorities than the other parties and we are helping to push that agenda. What\u2019s happening in France [where wearing headscarves is banned in schools and other public institutions] is what you might call a warped interpretation of secularism that causes greater segregation, rather than integration. Unfortunately, on the continent in Europe, things are becoming more and more rightwing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the really negative things about being in opposition is we can\u2019t implement our radical transformative policies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a1c14302cffbe0a4a40ad5c2dc2277f615b6556\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a1c14302cffbe0a4a40ad5c2dc2277f615b6556/253_1403_3425_3425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tan Dhesi, Labour MP for Slough\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>IO</strong> They certainly are and I wanted to thank you for your impassioned speech in parliament. It\u2019s important we recognise that when someone is being harassed because they are Muslim, the Sikh community is not going to be safe, and any other religious minority is not going to be safe. And we see that here in the US; as Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate rhetoric have grown, the people that have been endangered are the people who look like Muslims, which is the Sikh community.</p> <p>The French situation \u2013 I didn\u2019t understand how tragic it was until I met a young woman who was Muslim, who was newly elected to a city council in France and came to Minnesota as part of a delegation. She had her headscarf on and I walked in with my hijab, and she started crying. I was running five minutes late and I thought I had disrespected her, so I was, like, I\u2019m sorry, I had to drop off my kids, I didn\u2019t mean to be late! And she said no, no, that\u2019s not why I\u2019m crying! I\u2019m crying because I saw pictures of you with your hijab, but I didn\u2019t imagine your country would allow you to actually walk into the House of Representatives wearing it. And she said she wore her hijab everywhere in the community, except when she has to represent them.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>Which is absolutely ridiculous.</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> And I think this sort of demoralising, dehumanising exercise is contrary to what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. If you are trying to create a more accepting, freeing society, then you can\u2019t limit the right to express oneself.</p> <p>When I was growing up in Somalia, it was very secular, in all the wrong ways. People were banned from wearing the hijab; that used to be the model in Turkey, as well. And what it did was create a whole society that was ready to rebel. And now we see that [spirit] being exploited by the religious fanatics who have done a 180-degree turn in Somalia, where now everyone is forced to wear a hijab. And I think there is a danger, any time you try to impose secularism or religious doctrine on people. Humans need to be allowed to freely exist as they want. We need to be tolerant of people\u2019s wishes.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>I think that is one of the reasons why I felt I had to call out the prime minister. It is diabolical that the most powerful person [in the country] can target women from one part of our community and say, you look like letterboxes or bank robbers. Because it makes them more susceptible to hate crime.</p> <p>I read that you won your seat by the largest majority of any woman in Congressional history. What did that feel like?</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> It\u2019s what we\u2019re able to do when we build these amazing grassroots movements. We increased voter turnout by 100,000 in our district, and were able to break state and national records. And what I tell my colleagues who want to censor me for speaking out about human rights and holding people accountable is that we are not asking for permission. We\u2019re not asking for people to give us the right to speak on behalf of our constituents. Of the 435 members of Congress, I got the seventh highest number of votes. I\u2019m quite proud of that.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>You should be!</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll see real structural change</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>IO</strong> It speaks to the work we put in. It\u2019s not that we get elected because we\u2019re different and special and interesting. We get elected because we speak to the heart of the challenges many of our constituents face. We are hopeful about the kind of changes that can be created once we collectively leverage our voice and power. This movement being built by the Labour party and progressive members of Congress is one that\u2019s going to sustain us. Because the solidarity of working people, of people who live on the margins of society, is a powerful one, and that\u2019s why the powers that be do everything they can to find ways to kill our reputations, to marginalise our voices, to diminish the kind of work we\u2019re putting in every single day \u2013 as we knock on doors and talk to constituents about what\u2019s really important.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>Definitely. We\u2019ve got the people power in terms of spending hours and hours on the doorsteps. It\u2019s a shame the election\u2019s in winter. </p> <p><strong>IO</strong> We always have elections in the winter and I\u2019m from Minnesota! [Laughs.]</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>Given our majorities, we can\u2019t be accused of just having sneaked in. We\u2019ve got a mandate and we can talk about the issues we want to talk about. I think one of the really negative things about being in opposition is that we can\u2019t implement our radical transformative policies. But you\u2019ve got longer to wait; what\u2019s it like? Is it frustrating?</p> <p><strong>IO</strong> It really is. But we take solace in the fact that we\u2019re able to create a new narrative about what\u2019s possible. We have been able to implement a people\u2019s agenda, because we are in the majority. I just endorsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\" title=\"\">Bernie Sanders</a> for president, so I\u2019m hopeful that we can get him into office and see the structural changes we\u2019ve been after. I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a complete joy to catch up with you, and to have a virtual meet and greet, and I look forward to an opportunity to have tea in my office, or in yours, in the near future.</p> <p><strong>TD </strong>Definitely! I look forward to hosting you!</p> <p>[We caught up with the pair after the election, in which Dhesi held his seat. How were they feeling?]</p> <p><strong>IO </strong>The result is an indication of how effective xenophobic rhetoric can be. The far right is on the rise in ways we haven\u2019t seen in decades. But it\u2019s important not to draw too broad a comparison: the UK is not the US and the Conservatives are not the Republicans. Here, we still don\u2019t have universal healthcare, we still have a president who denies climate change.</p> <p><strong>TD</strong> While I was pleased with our result in Slough, I was deeply disappointed with the national result. Brexit, the personality of party leaders and the fanning of nationalism caused us significant losses, although we had some success with our message around the NHS and protecting public services. Now we need to re-group and start the fightback.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "The wall outside Ilhan Omar\u2019s office is not like that of other members of Congress. In Washington DC, a blank corridor of congressional offices gives way, outside the door to the office of the Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, to a collage of cards, notes and handwritten posters offering variations on the slogan \u201cWe stand with Ilhan\u201d. The 37-year-old, who was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, and spent four years in a refugee camp before fleeing with her family to the US, has for the last year been the target of vicious rightwing attacks, not least by President Trump. In July this year, he suggested she and three other women of colour \u2013 members of the so-called Squad of progressives newly elected to Congress \u2013 should \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201cplaces from which they came\u201d. In some ways, Omar is the most visible of the four: she is the first person ever to wear a hijab in Congress. Tan Dhesi, Labour MP for Slough, understands the law of firsts: the 41-year-old is the first member of parliament to wear a turban and, like Omar, has a reputation for speaking out against anti-Muslim sentiment in government. In September, during prime minister\u2019s questions, Dhesi called on Boris Johnson to apologise for his remarks about Muslim women looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d which, to cheers from the chamber, he called \u201cderogatory and racist\u201d. The two politicians meet for the first time in November via Skype \u2013 Dhesi from his constituency office, Omar from Washington DC. As minority ethnic members of government, the MP and the congresswoman are both keenly aware of what is at stake in their respective countries\u2019 forthcoming elections, and of what happens when political rhetoric lurches to the right. Both are campaigning on broad platforms for better welfare provision, less restrictive immigration policy and deeper government efforts to combat racism. Omar has had to confront accusations of antisemitism, after a tweet uncovered from 2012referred to Israel, in its actions in Gaza, as having \u201chypnotized the world\u201d. She has since apologised for inadequately \u201cdisavowing the antisemitic trope I unknowingly used\u201d. These are difficult times and the two politicians seek, in their discussion, to reach across the Atlantic in a spirit of progressive solidarity. They discuss the experience of standing up to their country\u2019s leaders; of the role played by family background in their ability to represent marginalised communities; and of what it\u2019s like simply to look different from everyone else in one\u2019s workplace \u2013 as well as the question of whether Omar might be persuaded, one day, to visit Dhesi in Slough, a suggestion she greets with warm if somewhat baffled enthusiasm. Tan Dhesi I was very touched when I heard we were going to do this. I thought, oh, brilliant. We\u2019re in the middle of a general election here, so let\u2019s see how that works out! Ilhan Omar What is the timeline for your elections? TD It should be every five years, but because the Conservatives lost their majority, they got forced into an election after only two and a half. I\u2019ve only been a member of parliament for that long. IO And so everybody has to stand for re-election? TD Yes. So I am no longer a member of parliament \u2013 I\u2019m a candidate. Hopefully we can be part of the sea change, and it\u2019ll be a Labour government this year. Then come next year, you guys are in, yeah? IO Oh my God, I can\u2019t even begin to dream about that. We\u2019re cheering for a change to happen in England. And since my journey has been covered quite a lot \u2013 and it\u2019s been a wild one \u2013 maybe you can tell me a little bit about what got you interested in being a part of government and a public servant? TD I was born and brought up here in the Slough area, but I actually studied in the Punjab, in India, for four years when I was young; my primary schooling was there, then I came back to the UK. IO Where in Punjab? I don\u2019t know if you knew this about me, but I\u2019m a huge Bollywood fan. TD No way! IO So I feel like I\u2019ve been to India, even though I haven\u2019t. TD Well, I look forward to welcoming you to our ancestral village out there. We\u2019re near a city called Jalandhar: it\u2019s the hub of bhangra music. I went to university in Scotland, then returned down south. Since university I\u2019ve been a member of the Labour party. Then I became an elected councillor, then mayor of the town. And after about a decade, I became a member of parliament for Slough, where my parents emigrated in the 70s. Little could they have imagined their son would go on to become the MP for that town. IO That\u2019s amazing. So we have a little bit of that in common. I worked for a city council member in the city of Minneapolis. TD Where were you born and brought up? IO I was born in Somalia, in the capital city, and I lived there for eight years. Then the civil war happened, and my family had the misfortune of being the clan that was being cleansed, and we were chased out. We fled to Kenya and lived in a refugee camp for four years, before getting the opportunity to come to the US in 1995. So I\u2019ve been here for over two decades now. My interest has always been around the expansion of democracy; my family was born into colonised Somalia and had been part of a generation that had fought to gain independence and was distraught when dictatorship fell on the country after just seven years of democratic government. My grandfather, who helped raise me, was very excited to come to the US and participate in democracy, so at the age of 14 I would accompany him to vote and translate for him. He understood democracy but he didn\u2019t understand the language to access it. And I hated the fact that in a country that, on paper, had all of these rights extended to its citizens, in actuality had ways of limiting people\u2019s access. So my work became trying to make our country live up to its ideals, and shift the current reality for all of us. It was really daunting to be a young refugee kid who was also Muslim and black to come to the US \u2013 the land of opportunity \u2013 and realise for the first time that every identity of mine that I\u2019d been so proud of was held in contempt by many of my neighbours. I understood early on that the excitement my grandfather had about this country was enshrined in the constitution, and that it was up to all of us to make sure we had equal access to those guaranteed rights. My organising work has been around fighting economic inequality, and trying to make sure we\u2019re not just being tolerant, but being an accepting and welcoming country for all. I\u2019ve also dealt with a lot of the issues around police brutality, our mass incarceration problems, and our inability to care for our most vulnerable. It\u2019s been an interesting journey. TD The good thing is we share our politics \u2013 if I was talking to one of your Republican colleagues, this conversation would be more difficult! IO In the US, the majority of the challenges I face are people pointing out I should be grateful. I\u2019m an immigrant to this country and it has welcomed me, and I should count my blessings and never point out any differences between the reality and the ideal. I don\u2019t know if there is pushback [in the UK] when you talk about the inequalities that persist? TD Things have improved a lot since the days when our grandparents or our parents immigrated here. My grandparents \u2013 my mum\u2019s parents \u2013 came in the 60s, then my dad in the 70s. Mum and Dad got married and had to face a lot of discrimination: somebody wearing a turban couldn\u2019t drive a bus in the UK; they couldn\u2019t ride a motorcycle; they couldn\u2019t do many things in terms of a day job. So there was a struggle there. But thankfully there was also [support] from some people who had seen, for example, how the Sikh communities were preponderant within the British Indian army. Before 1947, Sikhs made up 20% of the army and the British Indian army constituted the largest volunteer army ever; more than one and a half million people fought during the first and second world wars. And because of that, many [British people in power] were sympathetic, so they helped those activists, as well as people on the left in the Labour party, to change the laws. While most of my life at school was positive, there were negatives. You\u2019d have racist incidents \u2013 for example, someone tried to pull off my turban. IO Yeah, they would put gum on my hijab, or try to pull it off when I was in school. TD Something like that dents your self-confidence. And it takes you days, sometimes weeks, to recover. But we were strong; whether it\u2019s inner self-confidence or that we are able to focus on the positives, it\u2019s made us stronger. It\u2019s important that we didn\u2019t let those incidents scar us. You\u2019ve got a minority of people who are haters, who just don\u2019t like us or are not accepting. Because the word \u201ctolerant\u201d, like you said, is not the same as \u201caccepting\u201d. It\u2019s we\u2019re \u201ctolerating\u201d you. IO Yes. \u201cWe put up with it.\u201d This is our country as well. We don\u2019t get to be made to feel like guests. Was there a law that needed to be changed for you to have your turban as a member of parliament? TD No. IO You\u2019re luckier than I am! TD So many similarities. You were the first hijabi within the US Congress, and there had never been a single person wearing a turban in the British or European parliament. In our own way, we helped to break a glass ceiling. But I tell you what, for the most part my Labour colleagues are a very diverse set. There are people who\u2019ve worked in a whole array of industries, but they were very helpful, and showed me the various parliamentary protocols. I don\u2019t know how it is in your Congress, but in ours, everything you say has to be addressed via the Speaker. IO It\u2019s the same here. You get censored if you address the member. You have to address the Speaker. TD I think there is a sense that in many of these institutions, you\u2019ve got elite people who are detached from reality, and it\u2019s more of an issue among the Conservatives here, some of whom, I think, would find it very difficult [to understand] what the average Joe has to face out on the street. Is it the same there? IO Yes. The majority of people [in Congress] are millionaires; the majority are over 50; and the majority are white. And so our lived experience, as Congress as a whole, is very different to the majority of the people we represent. That\u2019s why I talk a lot about needing people to be in these rooms who have fluency in the day-to-day struggles of the people they seek to represent. It\u2019s not enough that we have diverse faces and voices; it also needs to be diverse lived experiences. For example, someone who took at least 10 years to complete a four-year degree \u2013 I understand that because I had two young babies right out of high school. TD Oh, right. How many children have you got? IO I have three. TD I\u2019ve only got two. IO Yes, so to speak to the challenges that many of our young families are facing: they have to make a choice about going back to school, getting that degree in order to have the prosperity or maintain a job to be able to feed themselves. We\u2019re struggling here to raise the minimum wage to $15 (\u00a312). All of these challenges are things I\u2019ve had to live with, and folks in my neighbourhood had to live with \u2013 they\u2019re not just a story someone tells me \u2013 so I\u2019m more urgent in addressing them. And even trying to make sure I could sit as a member of Congress \u2013 because I was going to be the first person to wear a hijab, and we had a 181-year ban on headscarves. I was contemplating what it would look like for me to walk into a majority Republican caucus and them not allow me to sit. These are the kind of fears that some people have in trying to run for office. It\u2019s not just the tolerance or respect they might get from their constituents in sending them [to Washington]; it\u2019s also having to deal with what you will face once you get there. Because the powers that be get to control the narrative, and have the rules tilted in their favour. TD I tell you what, I\u2019m very, very proud of being part of this parliament, the most diverse ever. IO Same here. TD We\u2019ve got more women, more ethnic minorities, more LGBT people, more people with disabilities than ever before, and a large part of that is because of the Labour party: 46% of all our MPs are women; we\u2019ve more minorities than the other parties and we are helping to push that agenda. What\u2019s happening in France [where wearing headscarves is banned in schools and other public institutions] is what you might call a warped interpretation of secularism that causes greater segregation, rather than integration. Unfortunately, on the continent in Europe, things are becoming more and more rightwing. IO They certainly are and I wanted to thank you for your impassioned speech in parliament. It\u2019s important we recognise that when someone is being harassed because they are Muslim, the Sikh community is not going to be safe, and any other religious minority is not going to be safe. And we see that here in the US; as Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate rhetoric have grown, the people that have been endangered are the people who look like Muslims, which is the Sikh community. The French situation \u2013 I didn\u2019t understand how tragic it was until I met a young woman who was Muslim, who was newly elected to a city council in France and came to Minnesota as part of a delegation. She had her headscarf on and I walked in with my hijab, and she started crying. I was running five minutes late and I thought I had disrespected her, so I was, like, I\u2019m sorry, I had to drop off my kids, I didn\u2019t mean to be late! And she said no, no, that\u2019s not why I\u2019m crying! I\u2019m crying because I saw pictures of you with your hijab, but I didn\u2019t imagine your country would allow you to actually walk into the House of Representatives wearing it. And she said she wore her hijab everywhere in the community, except when she has to represent them. TD Which is absolutely ridiculous. IO And I think this sort of demoralising, dehumanising exercise is contrary to what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. If you are trying to create a more accepting, freeing society, then you can\u2019t limit the right to express oneself. When I was growing up in Somalia, it was very secular, in all the wrong ways. People were banned from wearing the hijab; that used to be the model in Turkey, as well. And what it did was create a whole society that was ready to rebel. And now we see that [spirit] being exploited by the religious fanatics who have done a 180-degree turn in Somalia, where now everyone is forced to wear a hijab. And I think there is a danger, any time you try to impose secularism or religious doctrine on people. Humans need to be allowed to freely exist as they want. We need to be tolerant of people\u2019s wishes. TD I think that is one of the reasons why I felt I had to call out the prime minister. It is diabolical that the most powerful person [in the country] can target women from one part of our community and say, you look like letterboxes or bank robbers. Because it makes them more susceptible to hate crime. I read that you won your seat by the largest majority of any woman in Congressional history. What did that feel like? IO It\u2019s what we\u2019re able to do when we build these amazing grassroots movements. We increased voter turnout by 100,000 in our district, and were able to break state and national records. And what I tell my colleagues who want to censor me for speaking out about human rights and holding people accountable is that we are not asking for permission. We\u2019re not asking for people to give us the right to speak on behalf of our constituents. Of the 435 members of Congress, I got the seventh highest number of votes. I\u2019m quite proud of that. TD You should be! IO It speaks to the work we put in. It\u2019s not that we get elected because we\u2019re different and special and interesting. We get elected because we speak to the heart of the challenges many of our constituents face. We are hopeful about the kind of changes that can be created once we collectively leverage our voice and power. This movement being built by the Labour party and progressive members of Congress is one that\u2019s going to sustain us. Because the solidarity of working people, of people who live on the margins of society, is a powerful one, and that\u2019s why the powers that be do everything they can to find ways to kill our reputations, to marginalise our voices, to diminish the kind of work we\u2019re putting in every single day \u2013 as we knock on doors and talk to constituents about what\u2019s really important. TD Definitely. We\u2019ve got the people power in terms of spending hours and hours on the doorsteps. It\u2019s a shame the election\u2019s in winter. IO We always have elections in the winter and I\u2019m from Minnesota! [Laughs.] TD Given our majorities, we can\u2019t be accused of just having sneaked in. We\u2019ve got a mandate and we can talk about the issues we want to talk about. I think one of the really negative things about being in opposition is that we can\u2019t implement our radical transformative policies. But you\u2019ve got longer to wait; what\u2019s it like? Is it frustrating? IO It really is. But we take solace in the fact that we\u2019re able to create a new narrative about what\u2019s possible. We have been able to implement a people\u2019s agenda, because we are in the majority. I just endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, so I\u2019m hopeful that we can get him into office and see the structural changes we\u2019ve been after. I\u2019m excited. It\u2019s been a complete joy to catch up with you, and to have a virtual meet and greet, and I look forward to an opportunity to have tea in my office, or in yours, in the near future. TD Definitely! I look forward to hosting you! [We caught up with the pair after the election, in which Dhesi held his seat. How were they feeling?] IO The result is an indication of how effective xenophobic rhetoric can be. The far right is on the rise in ways we haven\u2019t seen in decades. But it\u2019s important not to draw too broad a comparison: the UK is not the US and the Conservatives are not the Republicans. Here, we still don\u2019t have universal healthcare, we still have a president who denies climate change. TD While I was pleased with our result in Slough, I was deeply disappointed with the national result. Brexit, the personality of party leaders and the fanning of nationalism caused us significant losses, although we had some success with our message around the NHS and protecting public services. Now we need to re-group and start the fightback. \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

And I believe this \u2013 Brexit \u2013 provides the most plausible way of summing up Labour\u2019s defeat in one word.</p> <p>Precisely, the problem was that Labour massively underestimated how much leave voters wanted Brexit, while overestimating how much remainers wanted to stop Brexit. Millions and millions of people still want Britain to leave the EU. In December thus far, remain is <a href=\"https://statsforlefties.blogspot.com/p/brexit-polls.html\" title=\"\">averaging</a> 53% and leave is averaging 47% in polls; although remain is ahead in the polls, leave voters showed that they were prepared to vote collectively to ensure that Brexit happens. Remain voters, however, showed that they were not willing to vote collectively to stop Brexit.</p> <p>In 2017, Labour won 41% of the vote by <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/kug7qzc4lh/InternalResults_170615_VoteSwitchers_W.pdf\" title=\"\">winning the support </a>of 55% of remain voters and 24% of leave voters. In 2019, according to a post-election poll by YouGov, Labour <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/wl0r2q1sm4/Results_HowBritainVoted_2019_w.pdf\" title=\"\">won</a> 49% among remainers (-6pts), with 21% of remainers voting Liberal Democrat (+9pts) and 19% supporting the Conservatives (-6pts). Labour\u2019s lead over the Tories among remainers in 2019 (30pts) was thus exactly the same as in 2017 (30pts). But among leave voters, the Conservatives\u2019 lead over Labour increased from 41pts to 60pts, with the party winning 74% of the leave vote (+9pts), and just 14% voting for Labour (-10pts). Just 17% of the voters who supported remain in 2016 and Labour in 2017 <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/wl0r2q1sm4/Results_HowBritainVoted_2019_w.pdf\" title=\"\">voted</a> for an explicitly pro-remain party in 2019, that is to say the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, SNP or Green. But 39% of those who voted leave in 2016 and Labour in 2017 supported an explicitly pro-Brexit party in 2019.</p> <p>Meanwhile, of the 54 seats that the Conservatives gained from Labour, 52 of them were in areas that voted leave in 2016; the Tories only gained two seats that voted remain from Labour, both by small margins, and in both of those seats the Green party vote was larger than the Conservative majority. In total, the Tories won 65 seats in which the combined Labour, SNP, Lib Dem, Plaid Cymru and Green vote was larger than the Conservative vote. If remainers had been united, the Conservatives would have won 300 seats and the other parties would have won 331, the 18 Northern Irish MPs and the Speaker making up the rest of the 650.</p> <p>So what can Labour learn for 2024?</p> <p>First, Corbynomics was not the reason for Labour\u2019s defeat: 81% of voters <a href=\"https://statsforlefties.blogspot.com/2019/11/polling-round-up-2019-general-election_26.html\" title=\"\">support</a> an increase in spending on the NHS, 66% support tax rises for those earning more than \u00a380,000 a year, 66% support building 150,000 council homes and 59% support a green industrial revolution. Labour\u2019s policies are popular, and it is worth noting that Labour won more votes with a leftwing manifesto in 2019 than it won with a centrist manifesto in 2015 and 2010. Abandoning Corbyn\u2019s policies and returning to a centrist policy agenda will not gain the party votes. The fact that the Lib Dems gained no seats in the 2019 election shows that the electorate has no interest in centrist policies.</p> <p>Second, the 2019 election has effectively made it impossible for Labour to win a majority in 2024. To win 326 seats, Labour would need to gain 124 seats, including 35 seats that it lost by 15pts or more last week. The last time that Labour gained that many seats was in 1997. It is, of course, possible for Labour to return to power as a minority government, but a Labour majority is very unlikely.</p> <p>Third, Labour did not lose as a result of being insufficiently pro-remain. The party\u2019s lead over the Conservatives among remain voters (30pts) was unchanged from what it was in 2017, and Labour lost far more leavers than remainers. And of the 124 seats that Labour needs to gain in order to win a majority in 2024, 86 voted leave. Electing a pro-remain centrist as leader is not the solution: Labour must focus on winning back leave voters.</p> <p>Finally, Labour should look to the future; it should not become obsessed with Brexit. The next election will take place four years after Brexit, and the question of whether we will leave or remain will have been definitively settled. Labour will not win in 2024 by quixotically re-running the 2016 referendum over and over again; it will only win if it looks forward to the future, and champions a leftwing vision for Britain\u2019s future outside the EU.</p> <p>\u2022 Ell Smith is the founder of <a href=\"https://statsforlefties.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\">Stats for Lefties</a>, a blog and podcast that examines polls and elections</p>",

They achieved all of this despite 72% of voters disapproving of the government\u2019s performance, despite Boris Johnson\u2019s negative approval rating, and despite nine years of austerity. How did this happen? Many observers have declared that the 2019 result was down to the unpopularity of one person \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 and that Labour\u2019s leftwing policies meant that the party was unelectable. One problem with this is that Labour\u2019s policies are, in fact, overwhelmingly popular: significant majorities of voters support funding the NHS, raising the minimum wage, building council homes and other such social democratic policies. While the evidence shows that Corbyn\u2019s leadership was unpopular, this sense of leadership was profoundly linked to his Brexit position, gifting the Conservatives the \u201cdither and delay\u201d line they were able to use so effectively.

In 2019, according to a post-election poll by YouGov, Labour won 49% among remainers (-6pts), with 21% of remainers voting Liberal Democrat (+9pts) and 19% supporting the Conservatives (-6pts). Labour\u2019s lead over the Tories among remainers in 2019 (30pts) was thus exactly the same as in 2017 (30pts). But among leave voters, the Conservatives\u2019 lead over Labour increased from 41pts to 60pts, with the party winning 74% of the leave vote (+9pts), and just 14% voting for Labour (-10pts). Just 17% of the voters who supported remain in 2016 and Labour in 2017 voted for an explicitly pro-remain party in 2019, that is to say the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, SNP or Green. But 39% of those who voted leave in 2016 and Labour in 2017 supported an explicitly pro-Brexit party in 2019. Meanwhile, of the 54 seats that the Conservatives gained from Labour, 52 of them were in areas that voted leave in 2016; the Tories only gained two seats that voted remain from Labour, both by small margins, and in both of those seats the Green party vote was larger than the Conservative majority. In total, the Tories won 65 seats in which the combined Labour, SNP, Lib Dem, Plaid Cymru and Green vote was larger than the Conservative vote. If remainers had been united, the Conservatives would have won 300 seats and the other parties would have won 331, the 18 Northern Irish MPs and the Speaker making up the rest of the 650. So what can Labour learn for 2024? First, Corbynomics was not the reason for Labour\u2019s defeat: 81% of voters support an increase in spending on the NHS, 66% support tax rises for those earning more than \u00a380,000 a year, 66% support building 150,000 council homes and 59% support a green industrial revolution. Labour\u2019s policies are popular, and it is worth noting that Labour won more votes with a leftwing manifesto in 2019 than it won with a centrist manifesto in 2015 and 2010. Abandoning Corbyn\u2019s policies and returning to a centrist policy agenda will not gain the party votes. The fact that the Lib Dems gained no seats in the 2019 election shows that the electorate has no interest in centrist policies. Second, the 2019 election has effectively made it impossible for Labour to win a majority in 2024. To win 326 seats, Labour would need to gain 124 seats, including 35 seats that it lost by 15pts or more last week. The last time that Labour gained that many seats was in 1997. It is, of course, possible for Labour to return to power as a minority government, but a Labour majority is very unlikely. Third, Labour did not lose as a result of being insufficiently pro-remain. The party\u2019s lead over the Conservatives among remain voters (30pts) was unchanged from what it was in 2017, and Labour lost far more leavers than remainers. And of the 124 seats that Labour needs to gain in order to win a majority in 2024, 86 voted leave. Electing a pro-remain centrist as leader is not the solution: Labour must focus on winning back leave voters. Finally, Labour should look to the future; it should not become obsessed with Brexit. The next election will take place four years after Brexit, and the question of whether we will leave or remain will have been definitively settled. Labour will not win in 2024 by quixotically re-running the 2016 referendum over and over again; it will only win if it looks forward to the future, and champions a leftwing vision for Britain\u2019s future outside the EU. \u2022 Ell Smith is the founder of Stats for Lefties, a blog and podcast that examines polls and elections",

      "body": "<p>European politicians seeking to rebuild their ravaged societies in the immediate aftermath of the second world war had their work cut out for them. The conflict had devastated the continent, levelling cities, destroying economies, and uprooting 40 million people. It had spawned a series of civil wars in which occupiers and collaborators fought resistance movements for control of soon-to-be liberated territories. But Europe\u2019s new leaders had to contend with more than just material ruin and blood-soaked politics. The Red Army had won the ground war in Europe and by 1945 its soldiers had liberated Warsaw, Prague, Berlin, Vienna and Budapest and were a presence from the Danish island of Bornholm to the Bulgarian littoral of the Black Sea. Looming over the political efforts at stabilisation and reconstruction, amid escalating tensions between Moscow and Washington, was the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.</p> <p>Stalin\u2019s ambitions for postwar Europe have been the subject of extensive debate. Some have argued that the Kremlin had a clear ideological commitment to projecting Soviet power as far and as ruthlessly as possible; others have maintained that Soviet policies were made on the hoof \u2013 improvised reactions to the introduction in 1947 of the Truman doctrine and the Marshall plan. Norman Naimark cleaves to the second of these views. \u201cThere is very little evidence,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat Stalin had a preconceived plan for creating a bloc of countries in Europe with a common Soviet-style system.\u201d In Naimark\u2019s account, Stalin was no dogmatic tyrant determined to foist communist dictatorships on hapless and exhausted countries but rather a \u201chyperrealist\u201d, who was ready to endorse governing coalitions of communists with other parties of the left and even the right just as long as they did not become hostile to the Soviet Union.

He gave in to the Soviet demand that Finnish leaders who had sent their armies to join the German assault on Leningrad be tried as war criminals, but also resolutely insisted on the right of Finns to govern themselves as an independent nation. In Italy, the Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti, who had spent the war years in Moscow and enjoyed Stalin\u2019s confidence, oversaw the peaceful transformation of an underground army of resistance fighters into a mass political party, steered the country away from the abyss of a civil war, and even entered into coalition governments with the Christian Democrats. If the political dramas in Helsinki, Warsaw, Vienna, Rome and Berlin played out in the shadows cast by Soviet and American power, they were, nevertheless, \u201cEuropean history, in the sense that \u2026 the agency of Europeans mattered and mattered a lot\u201d. Berlin was a case in point. When Stalin blockaded allied access to the city in June 1948, the charismatic mayor, Ernst Reuter, emerged as a resourceful and resilient champion of the western Berliners. As the shortages began to bite, he rallied them not to give in to Soviet pressure, declaring \u201ccruel, brutal, aggressive powers will not beat us to our knees\u201d. On the international stage, he cast Berlin as a vital outpost of freedom that had, both morally and strategically, to be defended. Thanks to the ensuing allied airlift, the blockade not only failed but served to rehabilitate the Germans in the eyes of western powers and to destroy any lingering attachment to the idea that the Soviet Union was an ally. At the founding of Nato in 1949, US President Harry Truman declared: \u201cBerlin had been a lesson to us all.\u201d</p> <p>But even if the Kremlin lacked a clear game plan for Europe, the latitude it was prepared to offer reflected its own strategic priorities. As long as neighbouring Sweden remained a neutral power, Finland was spared the fate of a \u201cfrontline nation\u201d and could be allowed to manage its own affairs; Poland, situated directly on the Soviet Union\u2019s western flank and the springboard for two invasions in the first half of the 20th century, could not. So the Communist leader Wladyslaw Gomulka\u2019s attempts to pursue a \u201cPolish road to socialism\u201d were thwarted by the Kremlin and he found himself arrested for \u201crightist nationalist deviations\u201d (even if he did go on to enjoy a comeback in the years after Stalin\u2019s death).

      "bodyText": "European politicians seeking to rebuild their ravaged societies in the immediate aftermath of the second world war had their work cut out for them. The conflict had devastated the continent, levelling cities, destroying economies, and uprooting 40 million people. It had spawned a series of civil wars in which occupiers and collaborators fought resistance movements for control of soon-to-be liberated territories. But Europe\u2019s new leaders had to contend with more than just material ruin and blood-soaked politics. The Red Army had won the ground war in Europe and by 1945 its soldiers had liberated Warsaw, Prague, Berlin, Vienna and Budapest and were a presence from the Danish island of Bornholm to the Bulgarian littoral of the Black Sea. Looming over the political efforts at stabilisation and reconstruction, amid escalating tensions between Moscow and Washington, was the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Stalin\u2019s ambitions for postwar Europe have been the subject of extensive debate. Some have argued that the Kremlin had a clear ideological commitment to projecting Soviet power as far and as ruthlessly as possible; others have maintained that Soviet policies were made on the hoof \u2013 improvised reactions to the introduction in 1947 of the Truman doctrine and the Marshall plan. Norman Naimark cleaves to the second of these views. \u201cThere is very little evidence,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat Stalin had a preconceived plan for creating a bloc of countries in Europe with a common Soviet-style system.\u201d In Naimark\u2019s account, Stalin was no dogmatic tyrant determined to foist communist dictatorships on hapless and exhausted countries but rather a \u201chyperrealist\u201d, who was ready to endorse governing coalitions of communists with other parties of the left and even the right just as long as they did not become hostile to the Soviet Union. The cold war emerged because Soviet geopolitical ambitions (and anxieties) were ultimately at loggerheads with those of the western powers. Beneath the familiar narrative of a continent inexorably pulled apart by mutually hostile superpowers, Naimark zooms in on the political history of seven countries and cities to argue that they were not simply squares on the chessboard on which the Americans and the Soviets competed for supremacy. He shows that, in the years between 1945 and 1949, the future of the continent was also wrought by national politicians who picked their way through the political and diplomatic rubble of their own wartorn societies in a bid to (re)assemble fragile but ultimately enduring governments.

      "bodyText": "Everton confirmed the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti as their new manager on a four-and-a-half-year contract just before Saturday\u2019s goalless draw against Arsenal. Ancelotti watched from the Goodison Park stands before formally taking up his position on Sunday. He succeeds Marco Silva, who was sacked this month, and his arrival will be regarded as a significant coup for the club and its majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri. Everton are 15th in the Premier League and had feared becoming embroiled in a relegation fight until a recent upturn under the caretaker manager, Duncan Ferguson. \u201cThis is a great club with a rich history and a very passionate fan base,\u201d Ancelotti told Everton\u2019s website. \u201cThere is a clear vision from the owner and the board to deliver success and trophies. That is something that appeals to me as a manager and I am thrilled at the prospect of being able to work with everybody at the club to help make that vision a reality.\u201d Ancelotti, whose first match in charge will be the home meeting with Burnley on Boxing Day, will inherit an improved situation from Ferguson. The former Everton striker has overseen impressive performances against Chelsea, Manchester United and Leicester \u2013 as well as the more sterile draw with Arsenal \u2013 and Ancelotti confirmed he will remain part of the staff. \u201cI have seen from the performances in the last two weeks that the players are capable of so much. The work Duncan has done is a great credit to him. Strong organisation, strong discipline and the right motivation are some of the key ingredients in football and I\u2019m pleased he will be part of my backroom team moving forward.\u201d Speaking after the Arsenal game, Ferguson outlined his excitement at working with Ancelotti. \u201cWe knew before the game the club were about to appoint an unbelievable manager, that gave everyone a lift,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted a world-class manager and now we\u2019ve got one, I can\u2019t wait to start working with him and learning from him. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything about my position yet but I\u2019ve had a quick word with the new boss and he seems happy with me. I haven\u2019t any advice for him, it\u2019s not for me to tell such a legendary manager what to do, but he\u2019s watched the last few games, he knows there is a good spirit here. He came into the dressing room at the end of the game and gave a lovely speech to the players.\u201d Less than two weeks have passed since Ancelotti was dismissed by Napoli and his quick return to top-level football is the latest move in the 60-year-old\u2019s long and successful career. Ancelotti has won the Champions League twice with Milan and once with Real Madrid, while he has won Serie A with Milan, the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich and Ligue 1 with Paris Saint-Germain. This will be Ancelotti\u2019s second stint with a Premier League club. His arrival at Chelsea in 2009 led to the club\u2019s first domestic double in the 2009-10 season. His final game, coincidentally, came at Goodison Park on 22 May 2011 after the club finished as runners-up in his second season. Marcel Brands, Everton\u2019s director of football, hailed Ancelotti\u2019s arrival. \u201cHe is the perfect appointment for us,\u201d he said. \u201cHe embraces our vision for the club and we are sure his enthusiasm to take the helm at Goodison together with his tactical abilities and well-renowned man-management will make him successful.\u201d Ancelotti was joined in the directors\u2019 box by the new Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, who will also take on his new role on Sunday.",

The animation of his picture book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/nov/18/snowman-raymond-briggs-christmas-c4\" title=\"\">The Snowman</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/nov/18/snowman-raymond-briggs-christmas-c4\" title=\"\">, first screened in 1982</a>, is now as traditional as mince pies and family rows. Stage shows, adverts, toys, toilet paper \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a worldwide industry,\u201d he marvels. \u201cChina, Japan: a world of Snowmen. The whole blessed world.\u201d Time has done nothing to soften his irritation with the cheerful satsuma-nosed figure. \u201cI was fed up with it years ago. I\u2019m even more fed up with it now it\u2019s been going on for nearly 40 bloody years.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, there\u2019s not a frond of tinsel to be seen in Briggs\u2019s original, which ends with a mournful heap of melted snow. It was the animation that brought in troops of dancing snowmen around a jolly Santa Claus \u2013 and it took many \u201cliquid lunches\u201d before Briggs agreed to sell the film rights to producer John Coates. \u201cEvery five minutes he\u2019d raise the topic and I\u2019d say no because I knew he\u2019d commercialise it. Which he did. Done very well, at the same time.\u201d Briggs had already conjured a far more characteristic vision of the festive season in 1973\u2019s <em>Father Christmas</em>, which featured a solitary old curmudgeon toiling through bad weather on his sleigh in oilskins, complaining all the way. \u201cBloody awful job,\u201d Briggs says. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a bit grumpy.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that the Snowman book and film have merged in the public imagination is a further source of frustration. \u201cIt annoys me that people think the book\u2019s success is based on the film. It\u2019s the other way around, for God\u2019s sake! Not that I care,\u201d he adds rather unconvincingly. The <em>Snowman</em> film is what\u2019s responsible for all the \u201cpiles of Snowman tat\u201d he\u2019s been sent over the decades (a neighbour used to sell the overflow on eBay for charity). \u201cSnowmen creep in everywhere!\u201d he says. His reluctant fondness is perhaps indicated by the souvenir mug that crops up in a drawing for his new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/12/time-for-lights-out-raymond-briggs-review\" title=\"\">Time for Lights Out</a></em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07d780dbfdc1aefbbb06b34ec5ebf13585ff22ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d780dbfdc1aefbbb06b34ec5ebf13585ff22ca/238_162_1997_2751/726.jpg\" alt=\"Raymond Briggs\u2019 Time for Lights Out\" width=\"726\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A page from Raymond Briggs\u2019s new book, Time for Lights Out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Raymond Briggs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/31/raymond-briggs-snowmen-bogeymen-milkmen-review-a-timely-look-at-an-eccentric-life\" title=\"\">You could call it an autobiography</a>; in his own words it\u2019s a \u201chotchpotch\u201d of drawings and verse, still lifes and scribbles, observations, memories and quotations. All of them face head on, with unblinking clarity and a certain grim humour, the universal drama of ageing and death. Nearly 86 and frail but chipper, Briggs is now contending, as he gallantly puts it, with \u201ca touch of Parkinsonism\u201d, and has a live-in carer (\u201cwonderful woman, I couldn\u2019t do without her\u201d). He has been working on the book over the past decade and a half, setting it aside for long periods while caring for his long-term partner, Liz Benjamin, who died in 2015.</p> <p>The book concentrates as much on words as images. \u201cIt just happens sometimes, you\u2019re writing and it starts turning into verse. I was amazed, really. I don\u2019t call it poetry because it\u2019s not.\u201d Drawn entirely in soft grey pencil, it begins with the shared domesticity of old age and the joys of a daily walk (\u201cGreat clots of primroses everywhere! Good job this book\u2019s not in colour. I\u2019d have to paint the bloody things\u201d). It goes on to investigate the mysteries of old men\u2019s hair, the frailties of age and ill health, the passing of time and the stubborn endurance of objects (\u201cthe breadboard I use today, and the knife, have been with me all my life\u201d).

In a section called \u201cSoon\u201d he thinks ahead, to the inevitable care home and even to the grave, but always maintaining a mordant humour. \u201cFuture Ghosts\u201d imagines his house being cleared after his death: \u201cThere must have been / some barmy old bloke here / long-haired, artsy-fartsy type, / did pictures for kiddy books / or some such tripe.\u201d Sweet sketches and verse about his step-grandchildren \u2013 \u201ca shaft of light amid the gloom of old age\u201d \u2013 are a welcome interlude.</p> <p>He\u2019s publishing it, he says, as a work in progress. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ever going to have enough life to finish it properly, so I thought I\u2019d better get it out now.

Ludicrous!\u201d</p> <p>But any raggedness seems entirely fitting for a book created from a vantage point of both magisterial confidence and profound uncertainty \u2013 looking back on a life of extraordinary artistic achievement from the vulnerability of old age. There are smudges and rubbings out, feints and wavering handwriting; impressionistic scribbles, in which the dog Jess is a joyous scrawl of life-force energy, contrast with calm vistas of landscape.

I counter that presumably it is meant to be faint. \u201cNot THAT faint,\u201d he snaps back. \u201cIt\u2019s too fucking faint we could say! Oh dear.\u201d</p> <p><em>Time for Lights Out</em> is also extraordinarily frank about the physical indignities of old age \u2013 at one point, he is post-op in hospital at 3am, weeping, \u201cwith a Dr White\u2019s sanitary towel / stuck up my bum\u201d. (A nurse comforts him with a cuddle.) In a society that tends to shy away from the realities of death and decrepitude, the honesty is shocking. The emotional nakedness of the book is startling, too \u2013 there is no filter on his most raw, self-betraying memories. He writes about his impatience with Jean, or thinking at his father\u2019s deathbed, \u201cDon\u2019t sit swinging your legs like a little boy. Get on with it, and die.\u201d</p> <p>But then Briggs has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/09/raymond-briggs-lifetime-achievement-award-the-snowman\" title=\"\">breaking taboos from the start of his career</a>, even in his children\u2019s books; showing Father Christmas on the toilet, then rejoicing in the yuck factor of his fantastical 1977 grimefest <em>Fungus the Bogeyman</em>. \u201cI was going to do an alphabet book \u2013 A is for apple. And then I thought, why does it have to be so perfect? Why can\u2019t the apple have a maggot sticking out of the top? And that\u2019s how I became immersed in bogeydom.\u201d In <em>Ethel and Ernest</em>, he was strikingly matter-of-fact about his wife\u2019s mental illness \u2013 and no reader will forget the stark, devastating drawing of his mother\u2019s dead body on a hospital trolley. That same readiness to look horror in the eye, and get it down on paper in a domestic context, was what made <em>When the Wind Blows</em>, his 1982 graphic novel about an old couple during nuclear war, so powerful. (He\u2019s left politics behind now: \u201cI thought a United States of Europe was rather a nice idea, but I don\u2019t think about all that now. Too old.\u201d)</p> <p>I wonder if this frankness is a reaction against the buttoned-up decorum of the previous generation, and in particular his mother, a former lady\u2019s maid who prized euphemism above unpleasantness and would chase her long-haired son around with a comb, but Briggs has never liked dwelling on his motivations. \u201cIt\u2019s not a campaign. I just do what I want to do.\u201d The closest he\u2019ll come to a self-diagnosis is the definition of a \u201ccreative sociopath\u201d that he seized on some years ago and still has pinned up on the wall. \u201c\u2018Artistic people \u2026 can appear self-absorbed, impulsive, impatient and intolerant\u2019,\u201d he reads aloud. \u201cBrilliant. That\u2019s me to a tee.\u201d</p> <p>Briggs grew up in Wimbledon with his mother and milkman father, and initially wanted to become a reporter. Then, inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/04/secrets-of-much-loved-wartime-cartoonist-giles-revealed-in-new-book\" title=\"\">Giles</a> and other cartoonists, \u201cI became interested in drawing as well. All the things I wanted to do even at that early age were to do with print \u2013 printed writing, printed drawing, the press. I wasn\u2019t interested in daubing oil paint. No good with the damn stuff, sticky and awkward.\u201d His ambition to become a lowly cartoonist met with outrage at an interview for the Wimbledon School of Art, but they let him in anyway. \u201cIt was all Italian Renaissance \u2013 I always preferred the northern school, Bruegel and Rembrandt and whatnot. The Italians were mythical; I preferred the ordinariness.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t see any difference between doing children\u2019s and adult books.

In <em>Time for Lights Out,</em> which from the title on explores the correlations between childhood and old age, the subjects that have moved him all his career become only more intensely felt. Not least is the fascination with his parents, whose possessions endure as much as their memories. We discover that the mirror his dad brought home on the back of his bike before Raymond was born, mounted on the mantelpiece with such pride in <em>Ethel and Ernest</em>, now lurks in Briggs\u2019s garage, nearly nine decades on. \u201cClumsy and ugly / not even quaint or kitsch \u2026 How can I throw it away?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d93daf39a79ff056d6a7e01251077179b705ad7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d93daf39a79ff056d6a7e01251077179b705ad7f/135_92_2246_2913/771.jpg\" alt=\"Raymond Briggs\u2019 Time for Lights Out\" width=\"771\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Raymond Briggs\u2019s Time for Lights Out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Raymond Briggs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a bit obsessed with your parents,\u201d accuses his contradictory alter ego Prodnose, who pops up throughout the book telling Briggs off for being bad-tempered or a dirty old man.

      "bodyText": "Famously, Raymond Briggs hates Christmas; it\u2019s one of the ironies of modern publishing that this self-described \u201cgrumpy old man\u201d has become inextricably linked with the juggernaut of the festive season. The animation of his picture book The Snowman, first screened in 1982, is now as traditional as mince pies and family rows. Stage shows, adverts, toys, toilet paper \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a worldwide industry,\u201d he marvels. \u201cChina, Japan: a world of Snowmen. The whole blessed world.\u201d Time has done nothing to soften his irritation with the cheerful satsuma-nosed figure. \u201cI was fed up with it years ago. I\u2019m even more fed up with it now it\u2019s been going on for nearly 40 bloody years.\u201d Of course, there\u2019s not a frond of tinsel to be seen in Briggs\u2019s original, which ends with a mournful heap of melted snow. It was the animation that brought in troops of dancing snowmen around a jolly Santa Claus \u2013 and it took many \u201cliquid lunches\u201d before Briggs agreed to sell the film rights to producer John Coates. \u201cEvery five minutes he\u2019d raise the topic and I\u2019d say no because I knew he\u2019d commercialise it. Which he did. Done very well, at the same time.\u201d Briggs had already conjured a far more characteristic vision of the festive season in 1973\u2019s Father Christmas, which featured a solitary old curmudgeon toiling through bad weather on his sleigh in oilskins, complaining all the way. \u201cBloody awful job,\u201d Briggs says. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a bit grumpy.\u201d The fact that the Snowman book and film have merged in the public imagination is a further source of frustration. \u201cIt annoys me that people think the book\u2019s success is based on the film. It\u2019s the other way around, for God\u2019s sake! Not that I care,\u201d he adds rather unconvincingly. The Snowman film is what\u2019s responsible for all the \u201cpiles of Snowman tat\u201d he\u2019s been sent over the decades (a neighbour used to sell the overflow on eBay for charity). \u201cSnowmen creep in everywhere!\u201d he says. His reluctant fondness is perhaps indicated by the souvenir mug that crops up in a drawing for his new book, Time for Lights Out. You could call it an autobiography; in his own words it\u2019s a \u201chotchpotch\u201d of drawings and verse, still lifes and scribbles, observations, memories and quotations. All of them face head on, with unblinking clarity and a certain grim humour, the universal drama of ageing and death. Nearly 86 and frail but chipper, Briggs is now contending, as he gallantly puts it, with \u201ca touch of Parkinsonism\u201d, and has a live-in carer (\u201cwonderful woman, I couldn\u2019t do without her\u201d). He has been working on the book over the past decade and a half, setting it aside for long periods while caring for his long-term partner, Liz Benjamin, who died in 2015. The book concentrates as much on words as images. \u201cIt just happens sometimes, you\u2019re writing and it starts turning into verse. I was amazed, really. I don\u2019t call it poetry because it\u2019s not.\u201d Drawn entirely in soft grey pencil, it begins with the shared domesticity of old age and the joys of a daily walk (\u201cGreat clots of primroses everywhere! Good job this book\u2019s not in colour. I\u2019d have to paint the bloody things\u201d). It goes on to investigate the mysteries of old men\u2019s hair, the frailties of age and ill health, the passing of time and the stubborn endurance of objects (\u201cthe breadboard I use today, and the knife, have been with me all my life\u201d). Briggs returns to his childhood during the second world war; to his evacuation to the countryside, and to his parents, previously immortalised in the 1998 graphic memoir Ethel and Ernest. There are memories of his wife, Jean Taprell Clark, whose schizophrenia meant that they decided not to have children, and who died of leukaemia in 1973. Briggs includes heartbreakingly beautiful photographs and a love letter she wrote to him from hospital. In a section called \u201cSoon\u201d he thinks ahead, to the inevitable care home and even to the grave, but always maintaining a mordant humour. \u201cFuture Ghosts\u201d imagines his house being cleared after his death: \u201cThere must have been / some barmy old bloke here / long-haired, artsy-fartsy type, / did pictures for kiddy books / or some such tripe.\u201d Sweet sketches and verse about his step-grandchildren \u2013 \u201ca shaft of light amid the gloom of old age\u201d \u2013 are a welcome interlude. He\u2019s publishing it, he says, as a work in progress. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ever going to have enough life to finish it properly, so I thought I\u2019d better get it out now. Bit of a dodge, really.\u201d With more time and energy, \u201cI\u2019d finish off some of the drawings that are only scribbles. You start drawing it, then you leave it, but you never get round to finishing it off. Everything takes so bloody long when you\u2019re old. I\u2019ve just spent half an hour getting dressed. Ludicrous!\u201d But any raggedness seems entirely fitting for a book created from a vantage point of both magisterial confidence and profound uncertainty \u2013 looking back on a life of extraordinary artistic achievement from the vulnerability of old age. There are smudges and rubbings out, feints and wavering handwriting; impressionistic scribbles, in which the dog Jess is a joyous scrawl of life-force energy, contrast with calm vistas of landscape. In studies of that long-lived breadboard, or a light switch or door handle, decades of wear and emotion are miraculously made visible. Briggs is delighted to have it out in the world - though he does manage to summon some customary annoyance about the misty drawing of a man reading to a small child beneath the first piece, \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d, which riffs on the contrast between childhood bedtime stories and life\u2019s final \u201clights out\u201d. \u201cYou can hardly see the bloody thing it\u2019s so badly printed,\u201d he complains. I counter that presumably it is meant to be faint. \u201cNot THAT faint,\u201d he snaps back. \u201cIt\u2019s too fucking faint we could say! Oh dear.\u201d Time for Lights Out is also extraordinarily frank about the physical indignities of old age \u2013 at one point, he is post-op in hospital at 3am, weeping, \u201cwith a Dr White\u2019s sanitary towel / stuck up my bum\u201d.

He writes about his impatience with Jean, or thinking at his father\u2019s deathbed, \u201cDon\u2019t sit swinging your legs like a little boy. Get on with it, and die.\u201d But then Briggs has been breaking taboos from the start of his career, even in his children\u2019s books; showing Father Christmas on the toilet, then rejoicing in the yuck factor of his fantastical 1977 grimefest Fungus the Bogeyman. \u201cI was going to do an alphabet book \u2013 A is for apple. And then I thought, why does it have to be so perfect? Why can\u2019t the apple have a maggot sticking out of the top?

He tied up the mother of the family, ignoring the pleas of the three children present, stole money and objects, then turned a gun on the father, Donald Mills, shooting him dead.</p> <p>When Judge David Williams <a href=\"https://www.sentinel-echo.com/news/london-man-receives--year-sentence-in-shooting-death/article_1c6704d0-db7e-11e7-9cf7-bfc044178426.html\">sentenced Baker in December 2017</a> to 19 years in prison for reckless homicide, burglary and impersonating a police officer, he said he would have given a longer punishment if he could. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing law for 30-something years, and I\u2019ve never seen a more compelling or complete case, the evidence was just overwhelming.\u201d</p> <p>Fast-forward just two years and Patrick Baker is a free man, released by Kentucky\u2019s outgoing governor in act that has been dubbed \u201cextreme pardon\u201d. The brutal killing is just one of the extraordinary elements of the eleventh-hour move by Matt Bevin, a Republican in the Donald Trump mould who even by his own controversial record has astonished and angered his state with his pardons.</p> <p>It was the final manoeuvre of a governor who was <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2016/11/08/control-kentucky-house-up-grabs/93344114/\">elected in 2016</a> on Trump\u2019s coat-tails, making Kentucky the last southern state in America to turn Republican, only to be voted out of office last month. What motivated a politician who has spent the past three years waging bitter wars with teachers, trade unionists, voters, liberals, scientists and reproductive rights advocates suddenly display such profuse mercy towards prisoners has become the talk of Kentucky.</p> <p>Even his own previously loyal Republican peers have expressed bewilderment. The top Republican in the state senate has called for an investigation of Bevin\u2019s \u201cextreme pardons and commutations\u201d.</p> <p>Mitch McConnell, the US senator from Kentucky better known as the Republican trying to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-impeachment-trial-mitch-mcconnell-rebuffs-chuck-schumers-request-for-witnesses/\">stymie Trump\u2019s impeachment trial</a> in Congress, has <a href=\"https://www.staugustine.com/nationworld/20191214/ex-gov-matt-bevin-defends-flurry-of-pardons-as-kentucky-lawmakers-call-for-investigation\">denounced the release </a>of \u201cheinous criminals\u201d in his home state as \u201cinappropriate\u201d.</p> <p>Speculation of what drove Bevin to his action initially focused on money, after the Louisville-based <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/11/bevin-issued-hundreds-pardons-and-commutations-final-day/4399770002/\">Courier Journal discovered</a> that the family of Patrick Baker had donated $21,500 to Bevin\u2019s political campaign funds before the commutation. Suspicion of pecuniary incentives then turned to moral outrage of a different sort after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/20/matt-bevin-kentucky-pardoned-child-rapist\">Bevin tried to explain on local radio</a> why he had pardoned Micah Shoettle after only 18 months of his 23-year sentence for rape.</p> <p>\u201cThere was zero evidence,\u201d Bevin told the radio host, adding that the girl\u2019s hymen had been intact.</p> <p>That provoked a whole new chorus of indignation, including from paediatricians who pointed out that rape cannot be proved or disproved by examination of the hymen.</p> <p>That was just the start of it. As intrepid local journalists began to dig into the mountain of pardoned cases, <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-governor/2019/12/18/bevin-pardons-murderers-and-child-rapists-among-most-controversial/2686266001/\">other apparent horrors</a> emerged.</p> <p>They included further sexual offenders. Dayton Jones, who Bevin set free after three years of a 15-year sentence, had pleaded guilty to raping a boy aged 15 whose bowel he ruptured with a sex toy. Charles Phelps had his name removed from the sex offender registry by Bevin having pleaded guilty in 2013 to child abuse images offences and sexual conduct with minors.</p> <p>The gruesome details of the violent crimes committed by some of those selected for commutation did not stop there. Delmar Partin was convicted of beheading a female co-worker and hiding her mutilated body in a barrel; Irvin Edge had hired a hitman to murder his business partner at home in front of his family; Blake Walker had killed his own parents.</p> <p>Most of the lucky 428 singled out by Bevin were non-violent. When the Courier Journal came to <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2019/12/20/bevin-commutations-nearly-all-drug-offenders-released-were-white/2677651001/\">analyse </a>the beneficiaries of his largesse, the paper found that 336 of them were on non-violent drug sentences.</p> <p>But therein lay another discrepancy. Within that group, 95% were white. That\u2019s in a state in which 20% of inmates on drug convictions are African American or from some other minority community.</p> <p>The newspaper calculated there were almost 1,000 black or other minority prisoners who would have qualified for Bevin\u2019s largesse. He chose 16.</p> <p>On one level, there is something fitting about the storm of controversy in which Bevin has finished his governorship given that disputes seemed to follow him around throughout his term in office. At the height of a recent measles epidemic, he let it be known that he had <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kentucky-governor-said-he-intentional-exposed-his-nine-kids-to-chickenpox\">exposed each of his nine children</a> to a neighbor\u2019s chickenpox so that they would contract the disease as an alternative to getting vaccinated.</p> <p>\u201cThey were miserable for a few days, and they all turned out fine,\u201d he said, while telling the federal government to get its nose out of people\u2019s private business. That anti-vaxxer sentiment expressed by Kentucky\u2019s then governor earned him a riposte from a leading paediatrician who remarked: \u201cWe\u2019re no longer living in the 17th century\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this year, when Kentucky schools were closed to protect children from the -20F (-29C) wind chills, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/al-roker-slams-nitwit-governor-matt-bevin-for-his-cold-weather-comments\">Bevin publicly complained</a>: \u201cC\u2019mon now. I mean, what happened to America? We\u2019re getting soft.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/27/matt-bevin-governor-time-office/1104020002/\">On policy</a>, he followed the classic Trump textbook, ramming through \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws that prevent trade unions gathering fees as a condition of employment, denouncing teachers on strike for exposing kids in their charge to sexual abuse and physical danger, supporting efforts to suppress the vote among minority communities, limiting access to Medicaid and banning abortion at 20 weeks.</p> <p>The toxic combination earned him Trump\u2019s adoration \u2013 the US president <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/11/04/donald-trump-rallies-matt-bevin-tight-kentucky-election/4155302002/\">unsuccessfully campaigned</a> on Bevin\u2019s behalf in the recent gubernatorial race \u2013 but it also gained him the mantle of one of the most <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2019/01/10/americas-most-and-least-popular-governors-q4-2018/\">unpopular governor</a><a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2019/01/10/americas-most-and-least-popular-governors-q4-2018/\">s</a> in the US.</p> <p>Last week Bevin posted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattBevin/status/1205618893492019201\">a long screed on Twitter</a> in which he sought to explain his pardons. He began by evoking the spirit of redemption and second chances, and the ambition to help offenders seek rehabilitation.</p> <p>He went on to insist that during his years as governor he had invested hundreds of hours to reviewing petitions for pardon. \u201cContrary to that which has been falsely stated by many, not a single person was released who had not already been scheduled for a specific release date,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He denied any financial motive, calling any such suggestion \u201chighly offensive and entirely false\u201d.</p> <p>The Twitter thread does not appear to have satisfied his detractors, or calmed the widespread shock at a Republican\u2019s last-minute flurry of pardons.

      "bodyText": "In May 2014, Patrick Baker and two accomplices set out to rob a house in Knox county, Kentucky. Baker knew the hardest part of the home invasion would be getting past the front door, so he devised a plan to dress up as police officers conducting a routine investigation. Once inside the Mills family home, Baker revealed his true colours. He tied up the mother of the family, ignoring the pleas of the three children present, stole money and objects, then turned a gun on the father, Donald Mills, shooting him dead. When Judge David Williams sentenced Baker in December 2017 to 19 years in prison for reckless homicide, burglary and impersonating a police officer, he said he would have given a longer punishment if he could. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing law for 30-something years, and I\u2019ve never seen a more compelling or complete case, the evidence was just overwhelming.\u201d Fast-forward just two years and Patrick Baker is a free man, released by Kentucky\u2019s outgoing governor in act that has been dubbed \u201cextreme pardon\u201d. The brutal killing is just one of the extraordinary elements of the eleventh-hour move by Matt Bevin, a Republican in the Donald Trump mould who even by his own controversial record has astonished and angered his state with his pardons. It was the final manoeuvre of a governor who was elected in 2016 on Trump\u2019s coat-tails, making Kentucky the last southern state in America to turn Republican, only to be voted out of office last month. What motivated a politician who has spent the past three years waging bitter wars with teachers, trade unionists, voters, liberals, scientists and reproductive rights advocates suddenly display such profuse mercy towards prisoners has become the talk of Kentucky. Even his own previously loyal Republican peers have expressed bewilderment. The top Republican in the state senate has called for an investigation of Bevin\u2019s \u201cextreme pardons and commutations\u201d. Mitch McConnell, the US senator from Kentucky better known as the Republican trying to stymie Trump\u2019s impeachment trial in Congress, has denounced the release of \u201cheinous criminals\u201d in his home state as \u201cinappropriate\u201d. Speculation of what drove Bevin to his action initially focused on money, after the Louisville-based Courier Journal discovered that the family of Patrick Baker had donated $21,500 to Bevin\u2019s political campaign funds before the commutation. Suspicion of pecuniary incentives then turned to moral outrage of a different sort after Bevin tried to explain on local radio why he had pardoned Micah Shoettle after only 18 months of his 23-year sentence for rape. \u201cThere was zero evidence,\u201d Bevin told the radio host, adding that the girl\u2019s hymen had been intact. That provoked a whole new chorus of indignation, including from paediatricians who pointed out that rape cannot be proved or disproved by examination of the hymen. That was just the start of it. As intrepid local journalists began to dig into the mountain of pardoned cases, other apparent horrors emerged. They included further sexual offenders. Dayton Jones, who Bevin set free after three years of a 15-year sentence, had pleaded guilty to raping a boy aged 15 whose bowel he ruptured with a sex toy. Charles Phelps had his name removed from the sex offender registry by Bevin having pleaded guilty in 2013 to child abuse images offences and sexual conduct with minors. The gruesome details of the violent crimes committed by some of those selected for commutation did not stop there. Delmar Partin was convicted of beheading a female co-worker and hiding her mutilated body in a barrel; Irvin Edge had hired a hitman to murder his business partner at home in front of his family; Blake Walker had killed his own parents. Most of the lucky 428 singled out by Bevin were non-violent. When the Courier Journal came to analyse the beneficiaries of his largesse, the paper found that 336 of them were on non-violent drug sentences. But therein lay another discrepancy. Within that group, 95% were white. That\u2019s in a state in which 20% of inmates on drug convictions are African American or from some other minority community. The newspaper calculated there were almost 1,000 black or other minority prisoners who would have qualified for Bevin\u2019s largesse. He chose 16. On one level, there is something fitting about the storm of controversy in which Bevin has finished his governorship given that disputes seemed to follow him around throughout his term in office. At the height of a recent measles epidemic, he let it be known that he had exposed each of his nine children to a neighbor\u2019s chickenpox so that they would contract the disease as an alternative to getting vaccinated. \u201cThey were miserable for a few days, and they all turned out fine,\u201d he said, while telling the federal government to get its nose out of people\u2019s private business. That anti-vaxxer sentiment expressed by Kentucky\u2019s then governor earned him a riposte from a leading paediatrician who remarked: \u201cWe\u2019re no longer living in the 17th century\u201d. Earlier this year, when Kentucky schools were closed to protect children from the -20F (-29C) wind chills, Bevin publicly complained: \u201cC\u2019mon now. I mean, what happened to America? We\u2019re getting soft.\u201d On policy, he followed the classic Trump textbook, ramming through \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws that prevent trade unions gathering fees as a condition of employment, denouncing teachers on strike for exposing kids in their charge to sexual abuse and physical danger, supporting efforts to suppress the vote among minority communities, limiting access to Medicaid and banning abortion at 20 weeks. The toxic combination earned him Trump\u2019s adoration \u2013 the US president unsuccessfully campaigned on Bevin\u2019s behalf in the recent gubernatorial race \u2013 but it also gained him the mantle of one of the most unpopular governors in the US. Last week Bevin posted a long screed on Twitter in which he sought to explain his pardons. He began by evoking the spirit of redemption and second chances, and the ambition to help offenders seek rehabilitation. He went on to insist that during his years as governor he had invested hundreds of hours to reviewing petitions for pardon. \u201cContrary to that which has been falsely stated by many, not a single person was released who had not already been scheduled for a specific release date,\u201d he said. He denied any financial motive, calling any such suggestion \u201chighly offensive and entirely false\u201d. The Twitter thread does not appear to have satisfied his detractors, or calmed the widespread shock at a Republican\u2019s last-minute flurry of pardons. The sister of the murdered home owner, Donald Mills, was blunt after she learnt that Patrick Baker was now out. \u201cMatt Bevin can rot in hell,\u201d she said.",

Chinese leader Yuan Yechun (nine-under) is on course with Adam Scott (seven-under), while two-times defending champion Cameron Smith (five-under) was even through five holes.</p> <p>Flanagan was through the front nine in 30, before narrowly missing a number of birdie putts and one eagle chance that would have seen him flirt with a magical sub-60 shot round. He had a long birdie putt on the 18th to claim the record outright, which slid past and meant a simple par to close a memorable round.</p> <p>Now based in San Antonio, Flanagan\u2019s wife is expecting their first child in mid-January and he said, after missing a number of cuts in recent tournaments, he was treating Saturday\u2019s round as a free swing. And while he knows the intensity will likely lift in front of larger galleries on Sunday, Flanagan insists he won\u2019t overplay it.</p> <p>\u201cIt got to a point today where I\u2019ve been playing so bad and trying so hard that I thought I\u2019d just go out there and not try at all, and all of a sudden, you loosen up over the ball,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be different tomorrow. I\u2019ll have to get back to being intense again but stay relaxed enough that it\u2019s no big deal if things don\u2019t work out. I\u2019ve got a baby due in five weeks, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be thinking about but obviously I\u2019d love to go out there and win so it\u2019s finding that balance again.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><em> - with thanks to AAP</em><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab5297552a5f3ca7ca747f5ed6a4547f4721dfd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab5297552a5f3ca7ca747f5ed6a4547f4721dfd5/0_249_4085_2450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Flanagan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Flanagan reads the green on day three of the 2019 Australian PGA Championship at the RACV Royal Pines Resort.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfda3698f087e8308e623da\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T04:50:55.108Z\">4.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">W-League: FT: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Brisbane Roar</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This was the game originally meant for Friday night but moved to Saturday morning because of the extreme heat in Melbourne.

Yesterday, New Zealand\u2019s two-day <strong>cricket</strong> warm-up in Melbourne became a one-dayer (to be played tomorrow), the <strong>gallops</strong> at Moonee Valley were called off and the <strong>W-League</strong> game between Melbourne Victory and Brisbane Roar was moved from Friday night to this morning (it\u2019s been run and won, with no winner except football itself). The rest of the day looks like this: <strong>A-League</strong> (three games, including the happening-right-now Wellington-Sydney FC game), <strong>Big Bash League</strong> (two games, or one if the smoke haze in Canberra doesn\u2019t subside), plus <strong>Australian PGA</strong> golf and whatever else we can fit in.

      "bodyText": "One of the better days of A-League action, with three hugely enjoyable fixtures. Table-topping Sydney FC survived a tricky trip to Wellington, where only an own goal and then a shocking open-goal miss keep the champions\u2019 undefeated run intact. The Phoenix good value for their 2-2 draw, and arguably could have had more, as they enjoy their own six-game undefeated run. Ola Toivonen with a brace to decide a pulsating Melbourne derby 2-1 over high-flying rivals, City in a result that could just kickstart the Victory\u2019s spluttering season. And an eight-goaler to finish the day in the West, as Popovic\u2019s premiers showed they\u2019re starting to click as well, dispatching the Jets 6-2. Goalless in the W-League between Melbourne Victory and Brisbane Roar while smoke has wreaked havoc in the Big Bash League, with Sydney Thunder being denied a chance to run down Adelaide\u2019s reasonable first-inning total. Adam Scott leads the PGA of Australia into the final day tomorrow, and plenty of sport happening elsewhere. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more of the same, on Sportwatch! And finally an update on the Big Bash match from Manuka - which has officially been abandoned now. Here\u2019s AAP: Heavy smoke has denied Sydney Thunder a Big Bash League victory over Adelaide Strikers, with their chase halted in Canberra after 4.2 overs because of concerns about air quality and visibility. The ladder-leading Thunder, set a target of 162, reached 1-40 when umpires stopped play at Manuka Oval on Saturday night. The match was abandoned soon after, meaning the points were split. The Thunder already had enough runs on the board to be declared winners after five overs but BBL rules dictate a minimum of five overs is required in the second innings to constitute a game. Thunder captain Callum Ferguson, who finished 27 not out, fumed when umpires Paul Wilson and Sam Nogajski told him they were halting play during Rashid Khan\u2019s opening over. \u201cHe\u2019s just annoyed, as you could imagine,\u201d Thunder coach Shane Bond told Fox Cricket. And there\u2019s the whistle. A mercy blow, really. It should have been seven - it could even have threatened the Jets\u2019 own 8-2 record for the highest scoring A-League game of all-time. They weren\u2019t bad, the Jets, but they faded badly in the second half. Popovic issued a challenge to his players to add more cutting edge up front. Didn\u2019t they just. Castro and Fornaroli leading they way with two a piece. \u201cI think we are coming, we are taking confidence. The chemistry in the team is still increasing.\u201d That\u2019s the words of \u201cMaestro\u201d, Diego Castro. A-League, you\u2019ve been warned. 90 + 1 min: Just four minutes more for the Jets before they\u2019re put out of their misery. Fornaroli is still hungering for his hat-trick, but it\u2019s a good save from Moss to deny him, at the expense of a corner. The Jets partially clear their lines, but Kilkenny looks to rework something. Eventually they get clear, the visitors. A-League - VAR overrule! Perth Glory 6-2 Newcastle Jets Ugh. Go away. After another interminable wait, VAR has chalked it off for a perceived handball about 17 minutes before the goal was scored. That\u2019s incredibly tough on Meredith. You feel for the player - and the Glory players are incensed. Well, as angry as you can be when you\u2019re in utter cruise control. A-League - Goal! Perth Glory 7-2 Newcastle Jets (Meredith) 85 min: Ach. And to think this game was at one stage 3-2. They\u2019ve wilted in the West, the Jets. It\u2019s a first ever A-League goal for James Meredith, the Socceroo and former Championship star. And they\u2019re in seventh heaven, the Glory. A-League - Goal! Perth Glory 6-2 Newcastle Jets (Castro) 83 min: Well, he\u2019d asked his side to look a little more lethal in front of goal, and haven\u2019t his chargers stood up today for Tony Popovic. It\u2019s the skipper, Castro with another fine solo effort. Jake Brimmer with a charge out of midfield, but they allowed the Spaniard too much space at the edge of the box, and he curled a second terrific effort past Moss. And some news from the world of tennis, where former champion Boris Becker has heaped huge praise on Alex de Minaur ahead of Australia and Germany\u2019s ATP Cup clash: 77 min: To their credit, the Jets continue to push. With the well-documented absence of their star signing Wes Hoolahan it\u2019s an added body blow to lose their Panamanian striker Abdiel Arroyo to a hamstring niggle over the past few weeks. He gives them a different dimension up front, and they sorely miss him today. Dimi Petratos draws a sharp save out of Liam Reddy. He won\u2019t stop working, the older of the four Petratos siblings on the books of the Jets. No further updates from Manuka Oval in Canberra, where as it stands the Big Bash clash between the Sydney Thunders and the Adelaide Strikers remains \u201csuspended\u201d due to poor air quality / visibility from nearby bushfires. As mentioned, we aren\u2019t too far away from the late fixture in the West kicking off - we\u2019ll bring you live action from that one, shortly. A-League - Goal! Perth Glory 5-2 Newcastle Jets (Fornaroli) 70 min: No luck involved in this one - as Fornaroli finds space around the edge of the box, shifts the ball, stands up two covering defenders, and thumps home past Moss! It\u2019s a great finish, and after a season in exile, the Uruguayan is starting to find his shooting stride again. They have to be careful, Newcastle. It\u2019s been a rollercoaster match - they have to stay strong and not let this one get away. A-League - 65 min: You can\u2019t fault the visitors for effort, as Angus Thurgate twists and turns and tries to fashion something. There\u2019s a terrific ethos around the Jets club these days - but after that 4-0 dismantling last week at home to City there is the danger of heads starting to drop around the club. They do have Brisbane at home next week though, should this one get away from them. A-League - Goal! Perth Glory 4-2 Newcastle Jets (Fornaroli) 57 min: Ach. They can\u2019t buy a trick, the Jets. Ernie Merrick must have walked under a ladder, carrying a black cat, whilst spilling salt and not throwing it over his left shoulder. It\u2019s relatively innocuous as the ball falls for Fornaroli after Castro is well-marshalled inside the box. He scuffs his shot, the Uruguayan, but it takes just enough a deflection to wrong foot \u2018keeper Moss. That\u2019s a very, very soft goal to cop. What a morale-buster. A-League: Goal! Perth Glory 3-2 Newcastle Jets (Ugarkovic) 51 min: My, oh my. Just when you think they\u2019re down and out they rise from the canvas once again, the Jets. It\u2019s a lovely combination between Dimi Petratos and the defensive midfielder Steven Ugarkovic who continues his run. A nice one-two in a tight space, good control, and a simple rolled finish. Lovely stuff and what a game this is turning into! We\u2019re still game suspended in the Big Bash match from Canberra - no change to the air quality/visibility due to smoke there. The late Scorchers v Renegades game from Perth will start shortly. A-League - second half! Goal! Perth Glory 3-1 Newcastle Jets (Chianese) 45 min: Oh my. We\u2019re were scarcely back in our seats, and whatever Ernie Merrick said at half-time has gone out the window! It\u2019s a poor giveaway by substitute John Koutroumbis - the youngster\u2019s hardly been on the pitch - but he\u2019s cost his side. The rapid Joel Chianese pounces on the error and slides home. What a start for the hosts! The late Big Bash fixture from the West won\u2019t be smoke-affected, where the Scorchers are hosting the Renegades. It\u2019s Marsh v Marsh as skipper Mitch takes on his brother Shaun who rolls out for Melbourne. Rival captain Aaron Finch has won the bat toss but, and elected to send the home side in first. A-League - Perth Glory 2-1 Newcastle Jets - half-time: There\u2019s the whistle over in the West. They\u2019ve been good value for it, the visitors, but two clinical finishes from set pieces remain the difference. Perth largely controlling the game, but the Jets looking sharp in transition. Castro\u2019s peach of a freekick the difference. Big 45 to come. Big Bash - Thunder 1/40 (4.2), Hales 11*, Ferguson 27* Game suspended. This is a big call. The umpires have called time off - due to air quality and smoke. The game can still continue it things clear up, but the Thunder side aren\u2019t too happy - the laws of Big Bash mandate that 5 overs constitutes a game. Had it been suspended that would have handed the game to the Thunder. A-League - 40 min: Well, it\u2019s not exactly cruise control, but you can imagine this is where Perth wants it. His sides are normally excellent at defending a lead. First step is to hold until half-time. Big Bash - Thunder 1/28 (3), Hales 6*, Ferguson 22* Ooph. With Khawaja gone after two balls you\u2019d call it a good start for the Strikers, but it\u2019s only poked the beast. In comes Callum Ferguson, and he\u2019s gone at it like a bull in a china shop. Five fours off Peter Siddle and the unsuspecting Wes Agar who goes for 14. He\u2019s going at a strike rate of over 200, Ferguson. Pretty solid response. A-League - Goal! Perth Glory 2-1 Newcastle Jets (Kilkenny, pen) 33 min: It takes something special to earn the penalty responsibilities in a team containing Castro and Fornaroli, but he\u2019s ice-cool, the man they call Killa. He rolls it along the ground with Moss committed the other way. Very calm. And like that, Perth are back in front! A-League - 31 min: Meredith charges into the box, but he\u2019s brought down by Kantarovski. Was that a penalty? Referee Adam Kersey points to the spot! VAR double checks, but it\u2019s upheld. A lengthy wait though, as players have perhaps become accustomed to. It\u2019s Neil Kilkenny v Glen Moss. A-League: Goal! Perth Glory 1-1 Newcastle Jets (Topor-Stanley) 25 min: It\u2019s a freekick opportunity at the other end, can Petratos match Castro\u2019s effort? He chips for a teammate, it looks a set move. He finds Jackson who heads back across goal, and who\u2019s there - the veteran 300+ gamer Topor-Stanley to nod home: we\u2019re back level! A fair reward for their efforts so far, you\u2019d say. Big Bash - Thunder 1/0 - Khawaja out for a duck! And that\u2019s not how the run chase was meant to start! It\u2019s outside off and the experienced national teamer chases it. Carey dives hard for the catch, it flicks off his wrist but Cameron White adjusts brilliantly to hold the catch! He didn\u2019t panic, he let it hit him in the chest, before catching on the juggle! Huge moment. A-League: Goal! Perth Glory 1-0 Newcastle Jets (Castro) 15 min: They give up a freekick in a dangerous area, the Jets, and up steps the diminutive Spaniard. It\u2019s a sumptuous curling effort that gives Glen Moss no chance - nestling just inside the post! A beautiful strike - and how cruel. They thought they were ahead, Merrick\u2019s men, but now they\u2019re behind. Castro. Class. A-League - 11 min: And have they taken the lead, the Jets?! Hoffman celebrates - he\u2019s delighted - but the lineman has his flag up - non le gusto. VAR takes a look - there did seem to be a slight deflection from Juande, does that play the Jets utility onside? Apparently not. A let off for the home side - that came against the run of play. A-League - Perth Glory v Newcastle Jets: 8 min: So, we\u2019re underway in the West, and it\u2019s a contained start from both sides given the heat. Attrition isn\u2019t normally a term you use for games involving Ernie Merrick, but perhaps circumspection is more the term? Big Bash - Strikers 5/161 (20), White 9*, Wells 55* End of innings: It\u2019s a terrific late cameo from Jonathan Wells who shows both power and guile to bring up his fifty. It was a strange innings - they started poorly, rallied, then looked okay, then slumped, then came home okay? That\u2019s Big Bash I guess. This one still very much in the balance then - it\u2019s a big total, but the Thunder has the firepower to do it, and it looks a decent wicket. We\u2019re not too far away from A-League action, where it\u2019s the home side Glory looking to go three wins on the spin, have won just one of their first seven and momentarily hitting the bottom of the table. The Jets for their part are on a two-game losing streak - it will be hard to beat Perth at home though, you\u2019d imagine. Big Bash - Strikers 5/123 (16.4), White 0*, Wells 28* Oh my. Plenty of talk about Rashid Khan\u2019s unorthodox batting strokes - well that was as ugly as you\u2019ll see. Swatting at a high one first ball, and he only lobs it right into the mitts of Gilkes. Two quick wickets for Morris, and suddenly this one has swung sharply towards the Thunder. Can the vastly experienced Cameron White bring his new team home? Big Bash - Strikers 3/121 (16) Carey 45*, Wells 26* Some solid big overs now, and this is building nicely for the Strikers. Carey with a clever ramp shot off Tremain, before Wells opens the shoulders and slog-sweeps to cow corner. All comes down to these last four overs though - can they push on? And right on cue, Carey goes big - but he doesn\u2019t find the rope! Green gets under it, and out comes Rashid Khan to weave some magic. Strike rate of near 170. We do have a third A-League fixture coming up from the West, where it\u2019s Perth hosting Newcastle. We\u2019ll pick up the action from that in 15-20 minutes or so. And of course a later BBL fixture, but that might go beyond my bedtime. And staying with cricket, the Boxing Day mystery has been solved - who\u2019s coming in to the Australian team for Josh Hazlewood you ask? Ask no more. Big Bash - Strikers 3/86 (13), Carey 28*, Wells 8* A big over for the Strikers, 13 off it, to bounce back from the loss of their man-in-form, Weatherald. The opener fell for 42 (33) after the Thunder were able to pin him back a little after that bright individual start. Sams with the key wicket - he\u2019s got terrific figures of 2/9 off three. They still need to accelerate from here if that want a big score though, the Strikers. And there\u2019s the final whistle - Victory have held on! How key could this game be for there season - after all the tumult, all the frustration - is this, finally, the game that launches the Kurz-era at Melbourne Victory? Ola Toivonen with a brace - Kamsoba and Nabbout could have scored a hatful more - before Harrison Delbridge\u2019s header made for a nervy last thirty. Victory take the bye next weekend - let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t slow their momentum. 90 + 2 min: They try to spring forward again, City. They were second on the table coming into this, Victory in eighth. A win here will only lift them to seventh, mind, but it will see Sydney FC\u2019s gap at the top move to six points. A-League - 90 min: Four minutes added is the extras. And again, it\u2019s Thomas scrambling as Galloway fires a fierce shot from long distance! That\u2019s not far away from the City right back, the Victory \u2018keeper puffs his cheeks in relief. Now it\u2019s the substitute Atkinson who receives it in the box after fine work from fellow sub Wales - but it ends in the grateful grasp of Thomas. A-League - 88 min: It\u2019s Kruse one-on-one with Glover but from an acute angle - and the City custodian stands tall! Good save, but at the expense of a corner. City clear, go long and it\u2019s at the feet of Metcalfe. He races into the box, and what an excellent last-ditch tackle from the 300-game man, Leigh Broxham! A-League - 86 min: Fine work from Metcalfe, who shrugs a would be tackler and pings a fine ball into the box for City, but it\u2019s just over his teammates. Lawrence Thomas was scrambling! There\u2019s still time for City - a big 5-10 minutes to run in the Melbourne derby. A-League - 84 min: And again! City are really riding their luck chasing this one. It was a poor sliced clearance from Glover who races out to clear, but only finds the feet of Kamsoba. He rolls it goalwards - but it goes agonisingly wide of the post! Victory fans must have their hearts in their mouths. And now there\u2019s a corner for City. Can they get the equaliser? No, well defended. A-League - 81 min: Oh my! A bad miss from Nabbout! He could have sealed the derby. It was brilliant work from Adama Traore who led Galloway on a merry dance before firing in a perfect cross. The striker made contact from about two metres out - but it was too faint, and it glances past Glover\u2019s far post. Big miss. And for fans of foils, check out this from earlier in the week. First it was data analysis in darts, now - fencing visualisation: A-League - 78 min: Another mini flashpoint as Kruse pulls Delbridge to ground after the two tangle. It may not be a full house (see: controversy over away ticket price-gauging) but there\u2019s a terrific atmosphere inside \u201cMelbourne Rectangular Stadium\u201d, and they\u2019re witnessing a game to match. City pushing for the equaliser, Victory desperate to hold on, but still looking to hit on the counter. Its cut and counter-thrust out there, like an Olympic fencing tilt. A-League - 72 min: Okay, let\u2019s stay now with the Melbourne derby for the final twenty, because there\u2019s a LOT going on out there. Kamsoba drives into the box and is only denied by a sharp save from Glover, before Delbridge lunges in on the Burundi international - is it a penalty? NO, says the referee and the VAR! Big Bash - Strikers 2/41 (6), Weatherald 29*, Carey 5* And after that poor start it\u2019s turned into the Jay Weatherald show, as the Strikers opener has gone BANG, going after both Chris Green and Jono Cook. Six fours already - could this be the spine around which the Strikers can build an innings? Golf: PGA of Australia - Adam Scott heads leaderboard into final day And to wrap on the day from Royal Pines. Here\u2019s our eyes at the course courtesy AAP: Adam Scott produced the moment of the tournament to grab the outright lead at Royal Pines, where he\u2019ll attempt to seal a second Australian PGA Championship on Sunday. The former world No 1 lurked several shots off the lead all day before exploding late with brilliant birdies on the 16th and 18th to finish 10-under for the tournament and three-under for the day, one clear of Wade Ormsby. Chasing his first title in more than four years, Scott drilled a five-metre birdie putt in front of the boisterous 16th \u2018party hole\u2019 par three crowd before his approach landed one metre from the flag on the last. World No 18 and 2013 tournament winner Scott lapped up the gallery\u2019s affection but, frustrated by a run of near misses in a consistent 2019, is determined to finish the job on Sunday. \u201cI made a good move at it (on the 18th) and it all worked out - you\u2019d hope for that tomorrow to happen but you just never know,\u201d he said. \u201cThis golf course can bite you so it\u2019s important you execute your shots well when you\u2019re down in the valleys of sin around these greens.\u201d And here\u2019s how the final day leaderboard reads: A-League - 61 min: And Victory\u2019s big skipper, Toivonen, does succumb to that groin injury, but not before another delay to try and take the heat out of this contest a little. On comes the Dane, Jakob Poulsen, prompting a reshuffle that sees Kamsoba pushed higher and Kruse and/or Nabbout moving more centrally. A few cards being shown, as Nabbout, Lesiotis and Luna all followed each other shortly into the book. Big last 30 to this now. A-League: Goal! Melbourne City 1-2 Melbourne Victory (Delbridge) 56 min: Hello! It\u2019s not like this game needed a spark - it was already a decent contest - but with a City goal, then is officially GAME ON again. A marauding run from right back from Scott Galloway earns the home side a corner, and up lopes the big timber - Harrison Delbridge - to nod home his first ever A-League goal! Big Bash - Strikers 2/9 (2.0), Weatherald 1*, Carey 1* Ugh. And not the start the visitors would have liked. Sydney Thunder won the toss and elected to sent the Strikers in and hasn\u2019t that worked out well for them. Salt and Short out cheaply, Sams and Cook the wicket-takers. A-League 52 min: A break in play and a bit of niggle, unsurprisingly between the vocal Scott Jamieson and Leigh Broxham, after the Albanian import Migden Basha stays down following a typically \u201crobust\u201d derby tackle from the City skipper. And if you missed how Glenn \u201cnot the Big Show despite James Brayshaw\u2019s insistence at the moniker\u201d Maxwell went last night after his time away from the game, you\u2019d have to say: pretty well. At risk of going \u201cfull Adam Collins\u201d just put him in the bloody team already. A-League: Melbourne derby - second half! 45 min: We\u2019re back, and so is Ola Toivonen despite that niggling groin injury. Marco Kurz will hope his talismanic captain can hang out there for at least another 15-20 to help his team\u2019s chances of defending this 2-0 lead. And to clarify, that\u2019s former lead-out man Mark Renshaw, not to be confused with Brisbane Heat BBL bowler Matt Renshaw. Which is as tidy as segue as I can find to say - we have live cricket action just around the corner as well. A first look at Adelaide Strikers in the BBL - I want to say opening round, but it\u2019s just one big round that happens every day, forever - right? They take on the Sydney Thunder shortly. Hi all! Cheers Scott another solid shift at the coal face. Always happy to be the Mark Cavendish to your Mark Renshaw. And speaking of happy, how good was it to see this man back in an Australian football stadium. Domo arigato, Ange Postecoglou. A-League: HT: Melbourne City 0-2 Melbourne Victory An entertaining first half and Victory are good value for their two-goal lead. In Australian sporting parlance, they\u2019ve come to play. It\u2019s been a team effort thus far but Toivonen just knows exactly where to be at every moment. It\u2019s been a ripper of an afternoon. The evening will be even better. Especially with Richard Parkin in the central commentary position. All yours, Parko! A-League: GOAL! Melbourne City 0-2 Melbourne Victory (Toivonen, 41\u2019) It\u2019s that man. Again. His back must be very sore, indeed. Nice ball to the right flank from Basha and City fail to deal with Nabbout\u2019s subsequent cross, Toivonen in the right spot to head home from right in front. VAR takes a look for offside but no dice. That\u2019s a 2-0 lead for Victory. A-League: 39 mins: Melbourne City 0-1 Melbourne Victory Now Nabbout goes down, upended by Noone. Another free, but the card stays in the ref\u2019s pocket. This is turning into a good old-fashioned bash-up. A-League: 33 mins: Melbourne City 0-1 Melbourne Victory The heat hasn\u2019t gone out of this game by any means. City are thrusting forward and Basha looks intent on stopping them all on his own. He\u2019s getting very physical out there, using his arms and legs to repel City\u2019s forward moves, but no card is forthcoming, much to Jamieson\u2019s chagrin. A few minutes earlier, Victory fans held their breath as Toivonen went down and stayed down. But he looks fine to continue. Golf: Flanagan blows the lid on the mystery of golf After carding a 63 on \u2018moving day\u2019 at the Australian PGA, to go from the cut-line to within one shot of the lead, Nick Flanagan opened up with a few words that seem bland enough, but on second glance demystify everything that makes golf such a bugger of a sport to play. I wasn\u2019t trying to make a ton of birdies, was just trying to get it on the greens and kind of give myself putts today, and I tended to hit it closer than I had the last two days and I made all the putts. Basically, get the ball on the green and putt it into the hole. I think I get it. A-League: GOAL! Melbourne City 0-1 Melbourne Victory (Toivonen, 15\u2019) It\u2019s that man Toivonen, who with more than half of Melbourne Victory\u2019s goal tally this season adds another to give tangible reward to his team\u2019s excellent start to this game. Beautiful gather from Kamsoba, beautiful cross from Nabbout and a beautiful header from Toivonen to beat the keeper at the far post. If Victory are to go all the way here, Toivonen must play a blinder. And this is a good start. A-League: 10 mins: Melbourne City 0-0 Melbourne Victory A very, very bright start to this derby, end-to-end stuff and lightning fast at that. The best early chance goes to Victory, and goes begging, as Kamsoba\u2019s volley is expertly stopped by Glover with Nabbout spraying the return shot wide. It\u2019s almost time for the A-League derby in Melbourne. Roles have been somewhat reversed of late, with big brother Victory struggling and upstart City fling high. But Victory\u2019s form at AAMI Park in these fixtures can\u2019t be ignored. Maybe the real Victory will stand up this evening. Teams: MELBOURNE CITY (4-3-3): Tom Glover (GK); Scott Galloway, Harrison Delbridge, Curtis Good, Scott Jamieson; Andrian Luna, Joshua Brillante, Connor Metcalfe; Marcelo Cabrera, Jamie Maclaren, Craige Noone. SUBS: Dean Bouzanis (GK), Rostyn Griffiths, Florin Berenguer, Nathaniel Atkinson, Lachlan Wales, Ramy Najjarine, Richard Windbichler. MELBOURNE VICTORY (4-2-3-1): Lawrence Thomas (GK); Anthony Lesiotis, James Donachie, Tim Hoogland, Adama Traore; Migjen Basha, Leigh Broxham; Andrew Nabbout, Elvis Kamsoba, Robbie Kruse; Ola Toivonen. SUBS: Brendan White (GK), Storm Roux, Corey Brown, Jakob Poulsen, Brandon Lauton, Jay Barnett. The Women\u2019s World Cup could be played every two years instead of every four, according to Fifa musings. Really, can\u2019t think of a good reason why not. Cricket: Pattinson poised for Boxing Day return Australia coach Justin Langer has removed any lingering doubt that James Pattinson will replace the injured Josh Hazlewood in the line-up for the Boxing Day Test. Langer raised eyebrows when he brought veteran quick Peter Siddle into the 13-man squad this week, but he confirmed Pattinson will get the nod ahead of Michael Neser and Siddle. \u201cI am really looking forward to seeing Patto bowl and bowl well in this Boxing Day Test, which is his home ground as well,\u201d Langer told 6PR on Saturday. - with thanks to AAP A thoroughly entertaining game. Sydney FC\u2019s six-game winning run comes to an end, Wellington\u2019s unbeaten run extends to six. Taylor\u2019s own goal was no way for the Phoenix to cough up their lead but at least, from their point of view, they didn\u2019t cough up all the points. They didn\u2019t deserve to. On this evidence, the Nix are a finals team. And another goal for Le Fondre to strengthen his golden boot claims. Good stuff all round. A-League: 90 mins: Wellington 2-2 Sydney FC It\u2019s not exactly dying down, this one. Sydney FC are pushing for the three points, as you\u2019d expect, but Wellington are taking a backward step, when one would expect them to safeguard the point. Three minutes of added time. Who\u2019s the best male footballer in the world? It\u2019s always a messy debate. A-League: 80 mins: Wellington 2-2 Sydney FC Lovely ball from Caceres releases Ninkovic deep inside the box, but the keeper guards his near post to a nicety and the Sydney FC man\u2019s shot cannons into the side netting. From afar, that would\u2019ve looked like a goal. Always does. A-League: 76 mins: Wellington 2-2 Sydney FC Still anyone\u2019s game in Wellington. But it could, should, have been 3-2 to Wellington, with D\u00e1vila missing a sitter from close range. Another substitution for Sydney FC - Barbarouses replaced by Buhagiar - but the Phoenix bench remains unmoved. How about Glenn Maxwell\u2019s return to cricket in the BBL last night? The break has done the man no harm whatsoever and it\u2019s to be hoped he gets better and better from here. A fully fit and firing Glenn Maxwell makes Australia\u2019s T20 World Cup squad every day of the week and twice on Sundays. A-League: GOAL! Wellington 2-2 Sydney FC (Taylor OG, 56\u2019) Oh dear. Ninkovic\u2019s first involvement results in a free-kick just outside the box, on the right. Brattan whips in a danger ball, which clears all intended targets before deflecting off the Nix skipper and into the net. All square. A-League: 52 mins: Wellington 2-1 Sydney FC Wellington still hold their half-time lead and they\u2019ve started the second half much the brighter, with a definite chance to Sotirio barely seconds after the resumption. There\u2019s also been a yellow card, with Grant cautioned for sliding into D\u00e1vila, and a substitution - Ninkovic on for Baumjohann. A goal down, Sydney FC call on Winston Wolf. Australian PGA update - Flanagan on fire Expecting father Nick Flanagan will do his best to continue playing pressure-free golf in Sunday\u2019s Australian PGA Championship finale after equalling the course record to launch into contention. The former US Amateur champion carded a bogey-free nine-under 63 to equal Ross McGowan\u2019s mark and go from one-over to eight-under and a shot back from Saturday\u2019s overnight leader. Chinese leader Yuan Yechun (nine-under) is on course with Adam Scott (seven-under), while two-times defending champion Cameron Smith (five-under) was even through five holes. Flanagan was through the front nine in 30, before narrowly missing a number of birdie putts and one eagle chance that would have seen him flirt with a magical sub-60 shot round. He had a long birdie putt on the 18th to claim the record outright, which slid past and meant a simple par to close a memorable round. Now based in San Antonio, Flanagan\u2019s wife is expecting their first child in mid-January and he said, after missing a number of cuts in recent tournaments, he was treating Saturday\u2019s round as a free swing. And while he knows the intensity will likely lift in front of larger galleries on Sunday, Flanagan insists he won\u2019t overplay it. \u201cIt got to a point today where I\u2019ve been playing so bad and trying so hard that I thought I\u2019d just go out there and not try at all, and all of a sudden, you loosen up over the ball,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be different tomorrow. I\u2019ll have to get back to being intense again but stay relaxed enough that it\u2019s no big deal if things don\u2019t work out. I\u2019ve got a baby due in five weeks, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be thinking about but obviously I\u2019d love to go out there and win so it\u2019s finding that balance again.\u201d - with thanks to AAP This was the game originally meant for Friday night but moved to Saturday morning because of the extreme heat in Melbourne. The Roar had been in good touch lately, winning their past two and scoring five goals in the process, but they couldn\u2019t find a way past the Victory defence today. The draw did neither team a huge favour, with both outside the top four and in need of three-point injections. It was still pretty warm when the first whistle was blown at 10.30am, around 32C, but decidedly cooler than the 40C+ players would\u2019ve faced yesterday. A-League: HT: Wellington 2-1 Sydney FC A-League: GOAL! Wellington 2-1 Sydney FC (D\u00e1vila, 37\u2019) Well, there\u2019s been three goals to this point in time but a) Sportwatch hit the snooze button seven or eight times too many this morning and b) who starts games at 2.45pm? Anyway, a massive upset is on the cards here. The Phoenix, who trailed after Adam Le Fondre\u2019s opener on 14 minutes, have hit back with strikes to Reno Piscopo and Ulises D\u00e1vila. Wellington haven\u2019t beaten the league leaders across the ditch since 2013, but have won their past two home games. Game on. Afternoon, sports fans. I trust you\u2019re keeping safe and well clear of this horrible heat. If you\u2019re joining me from the UK, crank up the central heating and pop the kettle on. Sport hasn\u2019t been immune to the effects of the dangerously high temperatures besetting many parts of Australia. Yesterday, New Zealand\u2019s two-day cricket warm-up in Melbourne became a one-dayer (to be played tomorrow), the gallops at Moonee Valley were called off and the W-League game between Melbourne Victory and Brisbane Roar was moved from Friday night to this morning (it\u2019s been run and won, with no winner except football itself). The rest of the day looks like this: A-League (three games, including the happening-right-now Wellington-Sydney FC game), Big Bash League (two games, or one if the smoke haze in Canberra doesn\u2019t subside), plus Australian PGA golf and whatever else we can fit in.

This is a slight variation on Mum\u2019s recipe \u2013 I\u2019ve added all the classic achari pickling spices to make this a perky and enlivening dish, and an antidote to Christmas Day feasting.

But as we journeyed through the country I was taken aback by the vast and ethereal landscapes. And at 19th-century <a href=\"https://www.visitscotland.com/info/accommodation/stonefield-castle-hotel-p189871\" title=\"\">Stonefield Castle</a>, with sweeping turrets and elegant well-tended gardens, near the lovely fishing village of Tarbert, my Scottish love affair began. Delicious seafood from the neighbouring Loch Fyne and glasses of malbec consumed over scrabble in the library made the weekend even more magical. No need for a car: from Glasgow, take the number 926 bus from Buchanan bus station straight to the front door \u2013 a three-hour ride but very scenic. <br><strong>\u2022 </strong><em>Doubles from \u00a374 B&amp;B, <a href=\"http://www.bespokehotels.com/stonefieldcastle\" title=\"\">bespokehotels.com</a></em><br><strong>Gabrielle Shaw</strong></p> <h2>Volcanic lake, Azores</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"233540015d43d3b0691b241fe09b5b9b8294fef8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/233540015d43d3b0691b241fe09b5b9b8294fef8/0_248_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Azores, Sao Miguel, rear view of man looking at the Lagoa do Fogo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lagoa do Fogo on S\u00e3o Miguel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was lucky enough to visit the S\u00e3o Miguel (the largest island), Pico and Faial this summer and was blown away by the natural beauty, stunning food and excellent wine (a carafe of vinho verde is just \u20ac5).

But as we journeyed through the country I was taken aback by the vast and ethereal landscapes. And at 19th-century Stonefield Castle, with sweeping turrets and elegant well-tended gardens, near the lovely fishing village of Tarbert, my Scottish love affair began. Delicious seafood from the neighbouring Loch Fyne and glasses of malbec consumed over scrabble in the library made the weekend even more magical. No need for a car: from Glasgow, take the number 926 bus from Buchanan bus station straight to the front door \u2013 a three-hour ride but very scenic. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a374 B&amp;B, bespokehotels.com Gabrielle Shaw Volcanic lake, Azores I was lucky enough to visit the S\u00e3o Miguel (the largest island), Pico and Faial this summer and was blown away by the natural beauty, stunning food and excellent wine (a carafe of vinho verde is just \u20ac5). In particular, Lagoa do Fogo on S\u00e3o Miguel stands out as being one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. I was surprised that the islands are still quiet and unspoilt by mass tourism. Julia Coastal bolthole, Normandy On a recent trip to \u00c9tretat we found the most special maison d\u2019h\u00f4tes, Castel de la Terrasse. Estelle, the owner, gave us warm welcome and showed us to our perfect chambre, French Line. Our view over the roof tops to the bay with its chalk needles and back across rolling hills was sublime. Everything was gorgeous, including our locally sourced organic breakfast, served in the ornate dining room by Bernadette. The location of the Castel is ideal for exploring the dramatic C\u00f4te d\u2019Albatre, and the town, loved by impressionist artists Monet and Pissaro, and by le grand \u00e9crivan Guy de Maupassant, for its beauty. \u2022 Doubles from \u20ac135 B&amp;B, casteldelaterasse.com Gay Appleby Serenity at the summit, Norway In September I walked the celebrated route to Pulpit Rock (after a ferry and bus from Stavanger). But on local advice, the next day I turned left after the zipline (from the same starting point as the Pulpit Rock walk), through trampled undergrowth and past a stop sign. Then the markings for the hike up 718-metre Moslifjellet show themselves. I found the quietness and proximity to wilderness a fantastic shock and was suddenly aware of all the unfamiliar wildlife around me. The summit provides spectacular views of the archipelago and fjords. \u2022 visitnorway.com Richard Matousek Stacking up the sights, Caithness As the crow flies, the UK\u2019s most northeasterly point of Duncansby Head, in Caithness, is closer to Oslo than London. A short walk south from the lighthouse car park reveals dramatic cliffs overlooking a group of jagged sea stacks. Stake out the aurora borealis in winter and look out for seal pups camouflaged on the shores below. The Stacks Bistro at John O\u2019Groats, which bakes cakes and biscuits everyday, is a popular choice for warming up afterwards.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m closing my private psychotherapy practice after 20 years. How many conversations have I had with clients over that time? Thousands, and each one different. Sometimes delightful, exciting and energising; often frustrating, disappointing and exhausting. There is no template: the dialogue is minted fresh every time the door opens. So what have I learned?</p> <h2><strong>Getting started: learning to say less</strong></h2> <p>I began my training the week after conducting my father\u2019s funeral. We hadn\u2019t been particularly close, although I suspect we loved each other deeply without being able to express it. I felt in exactly the right place to have discussions about life, death, love, loss and everything that matters deeply but isn\u2019t always easy to express. In healthy, worthwhile therapy we give ourselves permission to go to the risky, shadow side of our lives, client and therapist both.</p> <p>When I began, I\u2019m sure I used to spray words about unnecessarily. I remember wittering on at my first session with Pedro \u2013 a real live client! \u2013 about my training and background, taking up far too much time. Pedro waited politely but had no need for my waffle. He trusted me to listen to his concerns; trusted me more than I trusted myself.</p> <p>But I soon learned to say less \u2013 much less. Silence is a rare commodity in most of our lives and for a client to sit without the necessity to speak can be a luxury. There can still be meaningful psychological connection. The longest time I spent with a client when neither of us spoke was 18 minutes. It was, he said later, \u201csuch a refuge\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Honesty is the best policy</strong></h2> <p>\u201cTell the truth\u201d has to be my mantra. Maybe not the whole truth, the whole time. There\u2019s often an internal monologue (Is it too cold in here? She said Brian \u2013 is that her husband or her son? How many minutes are there left? Is it better to pick up on that reference now, or shelve it and come back to it later?) but mostly the concentration is total and the process all-consuming. In that space, it can be surprisingly straightforward to tell the immediate, unfiltered truth. To say, \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m shocked\u201d or, \u201cIsn\u2019t that different from what you said last week?\u201d Or even: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I entirely believe you.\u201d</p> <p>Which is very different from accusing someone of lying or, worse, being a liar (one is a comment on a single statement, the other a judgment of their character). I might add: \u201cI wonder why that is. What are your thoughts?\u201d or, \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s something else you\u2019re not telling me,\u201d which opens up an inquiry rather than shutting it down. Such a comment can be accepted or easily batted away by the client. It can feel risky, but without risk there will probably not be progress.</p> <h2><strong>My turn on the couch</strong></h2> <p>On 31 December 2015, I was involved in an accident on a dark country road. My car hit a pedestrian. The man died. I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/05/i-became-a-killer-fatal-road-accident-forgiveness\" title=\"\">shattered by the event</a>, profoundly traumatised. Disabled by shock, I craved a tenderness and care that I couldn\u2019t define. I tried going for massages; there was a silent therapeutic conversation in the physical contact, a soothing of my soul. But to help me find a path to recovery, I knew I also needed long-term talking therapy.</p> <p>I had a shortlist of potential counsellors, all of whom looked suitable in theory. The reality was a revelation. One had left her phone on, so it rang during our meeting, with me in a torrent of tears. She didn\u2019t apologise, and I felt worthless. Another sat in front of a wall covered in framed certificates. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a display of power,\u201d I said. She shrugged it off without addressing the issue, and I felt dismissed. At the end of my meeting with another, she said she couldn\u2019t stand up as she was in extreme physical pain brought on by hearing about my accident. I had needed her to offer strength, not vulnerability; I felt cheated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I've made mistakes I cringe to recall. I once told a client, 'That\u2019s the third time you\u2019ve interrupted me.' She fled</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In one consulting room, there was clear glass along the base of a wall, so the feet of strangers could be seen passing in the corridor. I felt exposed and unsafe. I met another therapist on the 27th floor of a smart block in London. When I commented on the view and asked, \u201cHow long have you lived here?\u201d he twisted and squirmed, trying neither to acknowledge nor deny my assumption that it was his home. I felt angry: just tell the truth.</p> <p>The final person on my list, Caroline, was gentle, kind and patient. As I sank deeper into an anguished account of my story, I knew this was where I could expose my pain. While allowing me to relate the details of my ordeal, Caroline helped me filter what I needed to say from what I didn\u2019t, to assert some slight degree of control after the chaos. But her empathy was the decisive element. As we parted I said, \u201cI feel warmed by you.\u201d We worked together for a year and, with her support, I began to function again.</p> <h2><strong>Is it OK to hug a client?</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve made some mistakes I cringe to recall. I once said to a client, \u201cThat\u2019s the third time you\u2019ve interrupted me.\u201d It was factually correct, but there were so many gentler ways I could have opened up a line of inquiry about communication. She fled after that session, never to return. I\u2019m not surprised.</p> <p>Physical contact is an area fraught with potential danger. Most clients don\u2019t expect any touch. Some offer a hand as they arrive or leave. William, a few years younger than me, would ask shyly for a brief hug at the end. Fair enough. But over time the hugs became tighter, the contact longer. Gradually they melted into an embrace that contained the subtle tremor of sensuality; of sex. I was confused, yet flattered. I felt myself being silently, surreptitiously seduced. A session would focus on William\u2019s marriage, children, childhood, career. Then came the writing of a cheque, arranging our next appointment, the walk to the door\u2026 and that hug.</p> <p>For several weeks I failed to address the issue. I was in two minds: reluctant to let the state of affairs continue but wary of damaging the good work we\u2019d done with a false accusation. Agonies of guilt gnawed at me. Was I complicit? How should I respond? Eventually, I told him I felt uncomfortable about the physicality we\u2019d developed. I shared my own confusion and remorse, and he was generous, absolving me of blame. He also filled in the missing parts. \u201cWhen I was a little boy and wanted to sit on my dad\u2019s knee, he would push me away.\u201d His features crumpled into those of the rejected child. \u201cI\u2019ve come to see you as the loving father I wish I\u2019d had. When we part, I\u2019m terrified to let go. I\u2019m scared you won\u2019t be there next week.\u201d Then he turned his sad face to me and said: \u201cIf I ask to sit on your knee, will you push me away?\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNo, William,\u201d I said. \u201cI won\u2019t push you away.\u201d There was challenge and acceptance in our eyes. William was a tall, strong man and I wondered if my Ikea chair would bear the weight. And my knees, come to that, as well as our relationship. But it felt vital not to reject him. He perched awkwardly on me and we shared another hug, briefer this time, without the layers of sexual need. He cried a little. It felt just right, for both of us. William didn\u2019t look for erotic connection any more. Even hugs weren\u2019t necessary. He knew I\u2019d be there next week. And the next and the next, until he was ready to end therapy.</p> <h2><strong>Expect the very unexpected</strong></h2> <p>In training, so many hypothetical scenarios are discussed. What would you do if your client made racist comments, said they loved you, told you they\u2019d raped someone? (And, yes, all of these things happened.) There aren\u2019t correct or incorrect responses; it\u2019s the airing of the possibilities, and often the discovery of one\u2019s own prejudices, that matter. That\u2019s the theory, anyway; then comes real life. There have been countless moments when I\u2019ve heard a voice in my head whispering: \u201cWe didn\u2019t cover <em>this</em> at college\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Sara, who had been a client for several weeks, stood up at the end of one session and looked down with horror at a saucer-sized stain of blood on the cream fabric of the chair. Her period had started. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat shall I do, take the cover home? I can wash it and bring it back tomorrow?\u201d I felt it incumbent on me to be as matter-of-fact as possible, full of reassurance. It was a simple thing for me to wash and bleach it and dry and iron it for the morning. Sara did disappear for a while but then returned to therapy for another year. The incident was only briefly referred to, in terms that suggested nothing further needed to be discussed. We had managed it successfully between us.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lucy slid from her chair, got down on all fours and crawled over to me, curling herself around my ankles</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What would you do if a client behaved like a dog? Lucy was a highly qualified professional who had talked for several sessions about her family, childhood and current partner. She often mentioned her pet labrador, Buddy, and their relationship of trust and love. Once she even brought him to a session. The whole dynamic changed with a third breathing creature in the room; I confess I resented his presence.</p> <p>One day, in a tough session with many tears and much pain, Lucy told me she wished she could feel as safe and loved as Buddy, and said I would be a wonderful master. She slid from her chair, got down on all fours and crawled over to me, curling herself around my ankles. At first I did nothing ; then I reached down and laid my hand on her shoulder. She shuddered and pressed herself against my touch. For several minutes we didn\u2019t move or speak. Then she stood up, returned to her chair and said, \u201cThank you for allowing me to do that. It felt wonderful.\u201d The simplicity of the gesture is often out of all proportion to the effect.</p> <p>Years earlier, as a client in training, I had occasion to benefit from a therapist\u2019s confident improvisation. I arrived on my motorbike for a session soaking wet and furious. \u201cI\u2019m not staying!\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m so pissed off with myself for not wearing my waterproofs. I\u2019ll pay you and go. I need to dry out.\u201d My therapist, Vernon, was having none of my self-indulgence. \u201cWould you like to borrow some sweat pants and a jumper? You can put those wet things on the radiator for an hour.\u201d I gazed at him; could it be that straightforward? It was. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t even begin to think what Freud would make of this,\u201d he said with a twinkle.</p> <h2><strong>Keeping an open mind and an open heart</strong></h2> <p>Time spent with clients can be frustrating and unsatisfactory. But the conversations have, mostly, been good for the client and rewarding for me. As I close my practice after 20 years and browse through some of the comments I\u2019ve received, I\u2019m reminded of this.</p> <p>Bobby was a young man I worked with on and off for eight years; he would attend a few weekly sessions, then fade away for months. In the consulting room, he would tentatively approach the core of his pain and always sidestep at the crucial moment.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m closing my private psychotherapy practice after 20 years. How many conversations have I had with clients over that time? Thousands, and each one different. Sometimes delightful, exciting and energising; often frustrating, disappointing and exhausting. There is no template: the dialogue is minted fresh every time the door opens. So what have I learned? Getting started: learning to say less I began my training the week after conducting my father\u2019s funeral. We hadn\u2019t been particularly close, although I suspect we loved each other deeply without being able to express it. I felt in exactly the right place to have discussions about life, death, love, loss and everything that matters deeply but isn\u2019t always easy to express. In healthy, worthwhile therapy we give ourselves permission to go to the risky, shadow side of our lives, client and therapist both. When I began, I\u2019m sure I used to spray words about unnecessarily. I remember wittering on at my first session with Pedro \u2013 a real live client! \u2013 about my training and background, taking up far too much time. Pedro waited politely but had no need for my waffle. He trusted me to listen to his concerns; trusted me more than I trusted myself. But I soon learned to say less \u2013 much less. Silence is a rare commodity in most of our lives and for a client to sit without the necessity to speak can be a luxury. There can still be meaningful psychological connection. The longest time I spent with a client when neither of us spoke was 18 minutes. It was, he said later, \u201csuch a refuge\u201d. Honesty is the best policy \u201cTell the truth\u201d has to be my mantra. Maybe not the whole truth, the whole time. There\u2019s often an internal monologue (Is it too cold in here? She said Brian \u2013 is that her husband or her son? How many minutes are there left? Is it better to pick up on that reference now, or shelve it and come back to it later?) but mostly the concentration is total and the process all-consuming. In that space, it can be surprisingly straightforward to tell the immediate, unfiltered truth. To say, \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m shocked\u201d or, \u201cIsn\u2019t that different from what you said last week?\u201d Or even: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I entirely believe you.\u201d Which is very different from accusing someone of lying or, worse, being a liar (one is a comment on a single statement, the other a judgment of their character). I might add: \u201cI wonder why that is. What are your thoughts?\u201d or, \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s something else you\u2019re not telling me,\u201d which opens up an inquiry rather than shutting it down. Such a comment can be accepted or easily batted away by the client. It can feel risky, but without risk there will probably not be progress. My turn on the couch On 31 December 2015, I was involved in an accident on a dark country road. My car hit a pedestrian. The man died. I was shattered by the event, profoundly traumatised. Disabled by shock, I craved a tenderness and care that I couldn\u2019t define. I tried going for massages; there was a silent therapeutic conversation in the physical contact, a soothing of my soul. But to help me find a path to recovery, I knew I also needed long-term talking therapy. I had a shortlist of potential counsellors, all of whom looked suitable in theory. The reality was a revelation. One had left her phone on, so it rang during our meeting, with me in a torrent of tears. She didn\u2019t apologise, and I felt worthless. Another sat in front of a wall covered in framed certificates. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a display of power,\u201d I said. She shrugged it off without addressing the issue, and I felt dismissed. At the end of my meeting with another, she said she couldn\u2019t stand up as she was in extreme physical pain brought on by hearing about my accident. I had needed her to offer strength, not vulnerability; I felt cheated. In one consulting room, there was clear glass along the base of a wall, so the feet of strangers could be seen passing in the corridor. I felt exposed and unsafe. I met another therapist on the 27th floor of a smart block in London. When I commented on the view and asked, \u201cHow long have you lived here?\u201d he twisted and squirmed, trying neither to acknowledge nor deny my assumption that it was his home. I felt angry: just tell the truth. The final person on my list, Caroline, was gentle, kind and patient. As I sank deeper into an anguished account of my story, I knew this was where I could expose my pain. While allowing me to relate the details of my ordeal, Caroline helped me filter what I needed to say from what I didn\u2019t, to assert some slight degree of control after the chaos. But her empathy was the decisive element. As we parted I said, \u201cI feel warmed by you.\u201d We worked together for a year and, with her support, I began to function again. Is it OK to hug a client? I\u2019ve made some mistakes I cringe to recall. I once said to a client, \u201cThat\u2019s the third time you\u2019ve interrupted me.\u201d It was factually correct, but there were so many gentler ways I could have opened up a line of inquiry about communication. She fled after that session, never to return. I\u2019m not surprised. Physical contact is an area fraught with potential danger. Most clients don\u2019t expect any touch. Some offer a hand as they arrive or leave. William, a few years younger than me, would ask shyly for a brief hug at the end. Fair enough. But over time the hugs became tighter, the contact longer. Gradually they melted into an embrace that contained the subtle tremor of sensuality; of sex. I was confused, yet flattered. I felt myself being silently, surreptitiously seduced. A session would focus on William\u2019s marriage, children, childhood, career. Then came the writing of a cheque, arranging our next appointment, the walk to the door\u2026 and that hug. For several weeks I failed to address the issue. I was in two minds: reluctant to let the state of affairs continue but wary of damaging the good work we\u2019d done with a false accusation. Agonies of guilt gnawed at me. Was I complicit? How should I respond? Eventually, I told him I felt uncomfortable about the physicality we\u2019d developed. I shared my own confusion and remorse, and he was generous, absolving me of blame. He also filled in the missing parts. \u201cWhen I was a little boy and wanted to sit on my dad\u2019s knee, he would push me away.\u201d His features crumpled into those of the rejected child. \u201cI\u2019ve come to see you as the loving father I wish I\u2019d had. When we part, I\u2019m terrified to let go. I\u2019m scared you won\u2019t be there next week.\u201d Then he turned his sad face to me and said: \u201cIf I ask to sit on your knee, will you push me away?\u201d I didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNo, William,\u201d I said. \u201cI won\u2019t push you away.\u201d There was challenge and acceptance in our eyes. William was a tall, strong man and I wondered if my Ikea chair would bear the weight. And my knees, come to that, as well as our relationship. But it felt vital not to reject him. He perched awkwardly on me and we shared another hug, briefer this time, without the layers of sexual need. He cried a little. It felt just right, for both of us. William didn\u2019t look for erotic connection any more. Even hugs weren\u2019t necessary. He knew I\u2019d be there next week. And the next and the next, until he was ready to end therapy. Expect the very unexpected In training, so many hypothetical scenarios are discussed. What would you do if your client made racist comments, said they loved you, told you they\u2019d raped someone? (And, yes, all of these things happened.) There aren\u2019t correct or incorrect responses; it\u2019s the airing of the possibilities, and often the discovery of one\u2019s own prejudices, that matter. That\u2019s the theory, anyway; then comes real life. There have been countless moments when I\u2019ve heard a voice in my head whispering: \u201cWe didn\u2019t cover this at college\u2026\u201d Sara, who had been a client for several weeks, stood up at the end of one session and looked down with horror at a saucer-sized stain of blood on the cream fabric of the chair. Her period had started. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat shall I do, take the cover home? I can wash it and bring it back tomorrow?\u201d I felt it incumbent on me to be as matter-of-fact as possible, full of reassurance. It was a simple thing for me to wash and bleach it and dry and iron it for the morning. Sara did disappear for a while but then returned to therapy for another year. The incident was only briefly referred to, in terms that suggested nothing further needed to be discussed. We had managed it successfully between us. What would you do if a client behaved like a dog? Lucy was a highly qualified professional who had talked for several sessions about her family, childhood and current partner. She often mentioned her pet labrador, Buddy, and their relationship of trust and love. Once she even brought him to a session. The whole dynamic changed with a third breathing creature in the room; I confess I resented his presence. One day, in a tough session with many tears and much pain, Lucy told me she wished she could feel as safe and loved as Buddy, and said I would be a wonderful master. She slid from her chair, got down on all fours and crawled over to me, curling herself around my ankles. At first I did nothing ; then I reached down and laid my hand on her shoulder. She shuddered and pressed herself against my touch. For several minutes we didn\u2019t move or speak. Then she stood up, returned to her chair and said, \u201cThank you for allowing me to do that. It felt wonderful.\u201d The simplicity of the gesture is often out of all proportion to the effect. Years earlier, as a client in training, I had occasion to benefit from a therapist\u2019s confident improvisation. I arrived on my motorbike for a session soaking wet and furious. \u201cI\u2019m not staying!\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m so pissed off with myself for not wearing my waterproofs. I\u2019ll pay you and go. I need to dry out.\u201d My therapist, Vernon, was having none of my self-indulgence. \u201cWould you like to borrow some sweat pants and a jumper? You can put those wet things on the radiator for an hour.\u201d I gazed at him; could it be that straightforward? It was. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t even begin to think what Freud would make of this,\u201d he said with a twinkle. Keeping an open mind and an open heart Time spent with clients can be frustrating and unsatisfactory. But the conversations have, mostly, been good for the client and rewarding for me. As I close my practice after 20 years and browse through some of the comments I\u2019ve received, I\u2019m reminded of this. Bobby was a young man I worked with on and off for eight years; he would attend a few weekly sessions, then fade away for months. In the consulting room, he would tentatively approach the core of his pain and always sidestep at the crucial moment. Only when we were faced with our imminent ending did he summon the courage to tell me about sexual abuse in his childhood. All he needed me to do in those final sessions was to witness his story, to meet him just where he was. Later, Bobby wrote to thank me: \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of your capacity to hear what I was trying to say, to swim alongside, to let me meander but gently steer me towards a moment of clarity, honesty and safety. I see now how extraordinary this was, how rare.\u201d He spoke of feeling loved. Carl Rogers, creator of the person-centred approach to therapy, called for \u201cunconditional positive regard\u201d but also spoke of \u201cnon-possessive love\u201d. That, for me, is the core of the best therapeutic work. My job has been to accept each client, to welcome them with an open mind and open heart. To all the clients from first (1999) to last (2019), the briefest (one session) and the longest (299), the most engaging and the hardest to encounter, your integrity and courage have enriched my life. I will miss the tears, the laughter \u2013 and the silences. All names have been changed. \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Neither of us are homelessness experts by any means, but we\u2019ve had long-term connections to homelessness whether through being homeless (Lavelle) or doing voluntary work with homeless people (Hattenstone).</p> <p>We\u2019ve discovered so many alarming, recurring patterns while researching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/the-empty-doorway\">The Empty Doorway</a> \u2013 people let out of prison or hospital on to the streets and dying, charities or councils providing supported accommodation that is inadequately supported, people denied potentially life-saving addictionor mental health treatments because of cuts, drug addicts or alcoholics being chucked out of accommodation because they are drinking or taking drugs (surprise, surprise!), charities refusing emergency shelter to EEA nationals or people who don\u2019t come from the local area or are not eligible to benefits; kids from care ending up on the streets at an alarming rate. And on it goes.</p> <p>Every person we have written about has been, to a lesser or greater extent, a victim of austerity and cuts. We\u2019re not saying that they wouldn\u2019t have been addicts, homeless or mentally ill without austerity, or that they wouldn\u2019t have died horribly early, but we are saying it didn\u2019t need to be this way.</p> <p>So what do we need to make homeless deaths less likely? If we were politicians, we might reduce it to the following soundbite: cash, care and competence. Yes, lots of money does need to be invested into homelessness (not least, to properly establish <a href=\"https://www.homeless.org.uk/our-work/national-projects/housing-first-england\">Housing First</a>, the scheme to fast-track homeless people in to permanent accommodation). We need caring people working in the caring services, supported by managers and executives who do not live in fear of losing government contracts. And finally we need competence. However cash-strapped councils or charities are, there is no excuse for some of the things we have seen. The bottom line is if you\u2019re a charity accommodating somebody who you know is suicidal check on them regularly. Jake Humm had been dead for at least two days before the YMCA DownsLink group decided to look in on him.</p> <p>We\u2019ve also realised that we\u2019re not the macho, scrupulously objective journalists you might see in movies. But we kind of knew that before. There have been so many times we\u2019ve rung each others in tears or broken down when talking about these people. Seriously, it\u2019s embarrassing when somebody who has just lost a loved one has to comfort you because you can\u2019t cope with the horror of their story.</p> <p>What has been incredibly rewarding is the discovery that our readers are even more amazing than we thought. At the start, we worried that there would be no appetite to read such bleak stories. Thankfully, we were proved wrong, We know lots of you have kept reading (terrifyingly, we can analyse all the figures online these days). So many of you have reached out to us on social media to tell us you are glad you have learned about this or that life, or you knew the people we have written about.</p> <p>At a time when journalists are constantly being told that readers have short attention spans, that you only want gossip or uplifting stories because everyday life is so crap, your feedback has been incredibly heartening \u2013 your willingness to read through long, distressing stories that you know are going to end unhappily, and your eagerness to engage with them. So many of you have told us this is why they buy the paper or read us online \u2013 and that means the world to us.</p> <p>This feels like it is the most meaningful project we have done in journalism \u2013telling stories that normally go unrecorded, and finding out that so many of these people had incredible if stunted lives \u2013 the gifted physicist Hamid Farahi Alamdari, the artist Clive Dalrymple who was a CND activist and got convicted of stealing bath water, the rapper Jake Humm and the much-loved outreach worker Sharron Maasz, for starters.</p> <p>But more than anything, what will remain with us is the people we have met \u2013 those families and friends who did all they could for their loved ones and found that it still wasn\u2019t enough. Many felt a terrible mix of grief and guilt. Yet, we have never met a group (and sadly they are a group) of such kind, tortured and emotionally literate people. All of them have shared their memories and photographs to enable us to create rounded portraits of lives lost or stolen (captured with such humanity by the illustrator Alan Vest).</p> <p>We have also been privileged to hear from readers who have been homeless themselves, and have managed to recover their lives, and readers who have paid tributes to homeless people they knew who have died. In future, we would like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/the-empty-doorway\">The Empty Doorway</a> on the Guardian\u2019s Cities website to be seen as a shared space for a community of people with a common interest \u2013 and often a common loss.</p> <p>A the heart of this community will always be those homeless people who lost their lives and the loved ones who have done so much to make sure they are not forgotten. So a special thanks to Cathy Teese for telling us about her niece Aimee who died in Liverpool, Joules Humm for telling us about his son Jake, who died in Brighton; Alexandra Davis for telling us about her brother Kane Walker who died in Birmingham; Gabor Kasza for telling us about his friend Gyula Remes who died opposite the Houses of Parliament, Lee-Maria Hughes for telling us about her sister Catherine Kenny who died in Belfast, Saeed Farahi Alamdari for telling us about his brother Hamid who died in Harlow, Monica Gregory for telling us about her friend Sharron Maasz who died in Oxford, Ray Dalrymple and Aloma Owens, brother and half-sister of Clive Dalrymple who died in Manchester, and the Starr family for telling us about Mark who died in Glasgow.</p> <p>This is where we have dispensed with any distant, cold-eyed journalism. None of these people are subjects or contacts to us. They have become trusted and trusting friends. So we\u2019d like you all to raise a glass to these incredible people and the loved ones they have lost, and hope that change can start here.</p> <ul> <li><p>You can read the series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/the-empty-doorway\">here</a> on the Guardian\u2019s Cities website.</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

We\u2019ve discovered so many alarming, recurring patterns while researching The Empty Doorway \u2013 people let out of prison or hospital on to the streets and dying, charities or councils providing supported accommodation that is inadequately supported, people denied potentially life-saving addictionor mental health treatments because of cuts, drug addicts or alcoholics being chucked out of accommodation because they are drinking or taking drugs (surprise, surprise!), charities refusing emergency shelter to EEA nationals or people who don\u2019t come from the local area or are not eligible to benefits; kids from care ending up on the streets at an alarming rate. And on it goes. Every person we have written about has been, to a lesser or greater extent, a victim of austerity and cuts. We\u2019re not saying that they wouldn\u2019t have been addicts, homeless or mentally ill without austerity, or that they wouldn\u2019t have died horribly early, but we are saying it didn\u2019t need to be this way. So what do we need to make homeless deaths less likely? If we were politicians, we might reduce it to the following soundbite: cash, care and competence. Yes, lots of money does need to be invested into homelessness (not least, to properly establish Housing First, the scheme to fast-track homeless people in to permanent accommodation). We need caring people working in the caring services, supported by managers and executives who do not live in fear of losing government contracts. And finally we need competence. However cash-strapped councils or charities are, there is no excuse for some of the things we have seen. The bottom line is if you\u2019re a charity accommodating somebody who you know is suicidal check on them regularly. Jake Humm had been dead for at least two days before the YMCA DownsLink group decided to look in on him. We\u2019ve also realised that we\u2019re not the macho, scrupulously objective journalists you might see in movies. But we kind of knew that before. There have been so many times we\u2019ve rung each others in tears or broken down when talking about these people. Seriously, it\u2019s embarrassing when somebody who has just lost a loved one has to comfort you because you can\u2019t cope with the horror of their story. What has been incredibly rewarding is the discovery that our readers are even more amazing than we thought. At the start, we worried that there would be no appetite to read such bleak stories. Thankfully, we were proved wrong, We know lots of you have kept reading (terrifyingly, we can analyse all the figures online these days). So many of you have reached out to us on social media to tell us you are glad you have learned about this or that life, or you knew the people we have written about. At a time when journalists are constantly being told that readers have short attention spans, that you only want gossip or uplifting stories because everyday life is so crap, your feedback has been incredibly heartening \u2013 your willingness to read through long, distressing stories that you know are going to end unhappily, and your eagerness to engage with them. So many of you have told us this is why they buy the paper or read us online \u2013 and that means the world to us. This feels like it is the most meaningful project we have done in journalism \u2013telling stories that normally go unrecorded, and finding out that so many of these people had incredible if stunted lives \u2013 the gifted physicist Hamid Farahi Alamdari, the artist Clive Dalrymple who was a CND activist and got convicted of stealing bath water, the rapper Jake Humm and the much-loved outreach worker Sharron Maasz, for starters. But more than anything, what will remain with us is the people we have met \u2013 those families and friends who did all they could for their loved ones and found that it still wasn\u2019t enough. Many felt a terrible mix of grief and guilt. Yet, we have never met a group (and sadly they are a group) of such kind, tortured and emotionally literate people. All of them have shared their memories and photographs to enable us to create rounded portraits of lives lost or stolen (captured with such humanity by the illustrator Alan Vest). We have also been privileged to hear from readers who have been homeless themselves, and have managed to recover their lives, and readers who have paid tributes to homeless people they knew who have died. In future, we would like The Empty Doorway on the Guardian\u2019s Cities website to be seen as a shared space for a community of people with a common interest \u2013 and often a common loss. A the heart of this community will always be those homeless people who lost their lives and the loved ones who have done so much to make sure they are not forgotten. So a special thanks to Cathy Teese for telling us about her niece Aimee who died in Liverpool, Joules Humm for telling us about his son Jake, who died in Brighton; Alexandra Davis for telling us about her brother Kane Walker who died in Birmingham; Gabor Kasza for telling us about his friend Gyula Remes who died opposite the Houses of Parliament, Lee-Maria Hughes for telling us about her sister Catherine Kenny who died in Belfast, Saeed Farahi Alamdari for telling us about his brother Hamid who died in Harlow, Monica Gregory for telling us about her friend Sharron Maasz who died in Oxford, Ray Dalrymple and Aloma Owens, brother and half-sister of Clive Dalrymple who died in Manchester, and the Starr family for telling us about Mark who died in Glasgow. This is where we have dispensed with any distant, cold-eyed journalism. None of these people are subjects or contacts to us. They have become trusted and trusting friends. So we\u2019d like you all to raise a glass to these incredible people and the loved ones they have lost, and hope that change can start here. You can read the series here on the Guardian\u2019s Cities website.",

      "body": "<p>George Eliot is intensely present in her novels. She is there, watching and listening to her characters, often drawing us aside to try to explain their actions. Wise, ironical, psychologically subtle, she speaks to us in the first person. If she is sometimes sententious, it is because she is passing on hard-won lessons. We can feel sure that the narrator of an Eliot novel is the author, reaching out to her readers.</p> <p>As her novel\u2019s title confesses, Kathy O\u2019Shaughnessy is another of Eliot\u2019s readers who has become a devotee. Her biofiction is a kind of homage, timed to coincide with the bicentenary of Eliot\u2019s birth. After a short prologue, in which Marian Evans, in her early 30s, arrives in London to work for John Chapman, editor of the Westminster Review, there is a jolt forward in time to cover the whole of her life as the novelist \u201cGeorge Eliot\u201d. The novel gives special attention to the half-fearful, half-mischievous charade of authorial concealment, in the period when her first two works of fiction, <em>Scenes of Clerical Life</em> and <em>Adam Bede</em>, were published to acclaim, but almost no one knew her true identity. It goes on to fictionalise Eliot\u2019s years of fame, as she turned, in the eyes of many, from novelist to sage.</p> <p>O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s title refers not just to her own literary passion. The book depicts the ways in which Eliot drew others in devotion to her. The most important was George Henry Lewes, a married man deserted by his wife; Eliot fearlessly challenged the conventions of her age by living as \u201cMrs Lewes\u201d for 25 years. Working from their surviving letters, O\u2019Shaughnessy successfully recreates their literary comradeship; their true intimacy proves harder to represent. Major roles are also given to some of her female admirers, especially the feminist Edith Simcox, who sat (quite literally) at her feet and expressed her fevered devotion to \u201cmother\u201d in her autobiographical <em>Monument to the Memory of George Eliot</em>. And there is the adoring Johnny Cross, 20 years Eliot\u2019s junior, who began as her financial adviser but ended up, after Lewes\u2019s death, as her husband. Famous men such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/henryjames\" title=\"\">Henry James</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anthonytrollope\" title=\"\">Anthony Trollope</a> trip in and out, but, not being exactly in love with Eliot, are only bit-part players.</p> <p>In Eliot-like fashion, the narration moves between the viewpoints of different characters, though we are most often in the head of \u201cMadonna\u201d herself. Some of the time her thoughts seem too much like the admiring novelist\u2019s own opinions. \u201cWas anybody else doing what she was doing? She asked herself \u2026 Her realism struck deeper than Dickens\u2019 and Thackeray\u2019s.\u201d At other times, her private musings are surprisingly believable \u2013 as when she is solacing herself after Lewes\u2019s death by reading through the <em>Divine Comedy </em>with Cross, whom she is tutoring in Dante\u2019s Italian, and falling for him as she does so.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The narrative is\u00a0larded with passages from Eliot\u2019s journals \u2013 there is\u00a0a\u00a0great deal of\u00a0Eliot uncontestably in\u00a0the novel</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The novelist enters where biographers cannot tread.

      "bodyText": "George Eliot is intensely present in her novels. She is there, watching and listening to her characters, often drawing us aside to try to explain their actions. Wise, ironical, psychologically subtle, she speaks to us in the first person. If she is sometimes sententious, it is because she is passing on hard-won lessons. We can feel sure that the narrator of an Eliot novel is the author, reaching out to her readers. As her novel\u2019s title confesses, Kathy O\u2019Shaughnessy is another of Eliot\u2019s readers who has become a devotee. Her biofiction is a kind of homage, timed to coincide with the bicentenary of Eliot\u2019s birth. After a short prologue, in which Marian Evans, in her early 30s, arrives in London to work for John Chapman, editor of the Westminster Review, there is a jolt forward in time to cover the whole of her life as the novelist \u201cGeorge Eliot\u201d. The novel gives special attention to the half-fearful, half-mischievous charade of authorial concealment, in the period when her first two works of fiction, Scenes of Clerical Life and Adam Bede, were published to acclaim, but almost no one knew her true identity. It goes on to fictionalise Eliot\u2019s years of fame, as she turned, in the eyes of many, from novelist to sage. O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s title refers not just to her own literary passion. The book depicts the ways in which Eliot drew others in devotion to her. The most important was George Henry Lewes, a married man deserted by his wife; Eliot fearlessly challenged the conventions of her age by living as \u201cMrs Lewes\u201d for 25 years. Working from their surviving letters, O\u2019Shaughnessy successfully recreates their literary comradeship; their true intimacy proves harder to represent. Major roles are also given to some of her female admirers, especially the feminist Edith Simcox, who sat (quite literally) at her feet and expressed her fevered devotion to \u201cmother\u201d in her autobiographical Monument to the Memory of George Eliot. And there is the adoring Johnny Cross, 20 years Eliot\u2019s junior, who began as her financial adviser but ended up, after Lewes\u2019s death, as her husband. Famous men such as Henry James and Anthony Trollope trip in and out, but, not being exactly in love with Eliot, are only bit-part players. In Eliot-like fashion, the narration moves between the viewpoints of different characters, though we are most often in the head of \u201cMadonna\u201d herself. Some of the time her thoughts seem too much like the admiring novelist\u2019s own opinions. \u201cWas anybody else doing what she was doing? She asked herself \u2026 Her realism struck deeper than Dickens\u2019 and Thackeray\u2019s.\u201d At other times, her private musings are surprisingly believable \u2013 as when she is solacing herself after Lewes\u2019s death by reading through the Divine Comedy with Cross, whom she is tutoring in Dante\u2019s Italian, and falling for him as she does so. The novelist enters where biographers cannot tread. Eliot\u2019s feelings as Cross courts her, about which we know very little, are rendered in convincing complexity, O\u2019Shaughnessy having schooled herself in Eliot\u2019s respect for human contradictoriness. The novel gives us plenty on the honeymoon in Venice, where Cross notoriously threw himself from an upstairs window of their hotel into the Grand Canal.

During a January 2018 sentencing, dozens of his victims gave impact statements in court in Michigan, facing their accuser with an array of emotions.

Denhollander\u2019s work has expanded beyond the world of sports, though, and she\u2019s been especially critical of the Southern Baptist Convention and the abuse within its ranks.</p> <p>This week Denhollander spoke with the Guardian about her ongoing advocacy work and the progress she hopes to still see.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s been more than three years now since you came forward and this movement started. How do you feel about everything USA Gymnastics has done since?</strong></p> <p>Disappointed. They have completely refused any shred of transparency and accountability. They have refused to identify even one thing that went wrong. They have refused to identify even one coach that was abusive or one abusive situation, to point to something and say, <em>hey, we shouldn\u2019t have allowed that</em>. And if you cannot even acknowledge the problem, you cannot fix the problem.</p> <p>I get asked all the time, what\u2019s the single most important thing we can do to combat abuse? And most of the time when people ask that question, they\u2019re thinking policy: What policy provision do we need in place? But the single most important thing you can do [isn\u2019t policy]. It\u2019s to communicate that it matters, because that\u2019s what changes the culture around you. That\u2019s what communicates to predators that they will not be harbored and they won\u2019t be safe. That\u2019s what communicates to the people who would mishandle or cover up allegations of abuse that there will be consequences if they don\u2019t report it properly. And that\u2019s what communicates to survivors that [they\u2019re] going to be heard and listened to, and it\u2019s safe to speak up. If you did not communicate that, you haven\u2019t done the most basic thing you need to start to change the culture around you.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/17/figure-skating-john-coughlin-and-the-disturbing-reality-of-athlete-on-athlete-abuse\">Figure skating, John Coughlin and the disturbing reality of athlete-on-athlete abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>And I take it you don\u2019t feel like that has happened.</strong></p> <p>They really still do believe they have a publicity problem. That\u2019s what they\u2019re acting like. \u2026 So it has been nothing but gross disappointment.</p> <p><strong>When it comes to the tension between policy v communication, did you always feel that communication trumped policy?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve understood [that communication is what needs to change] for years and years. I think part of it is because communication is my passion: the communication of ideas and the consequence of ideas. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve studied and been passionate about for a long time. Even when I was starting to work through my own abuse and looking at the cultural dynamics and just trying to determine what do I do\u2026 I already had that focus on the consequences of ideas and the communication of ideas. That really is at the root of everything we do. We talk a lot about actions, but behind those actions are ideas. And if you don\u2019t have your ideas right, the actions are not going to follow. Either they won\u2019t be the right actions, or you\u2019ll have the right actions on paper but no heart motivation to follow them.</p> <p><strong>Do you think, then, that there\u2019s a misconception among the general public that this is more of a policy problem than anything else?</strong></p> <p>I think we have a significant problem in this culture with being emotionally driven by whatever is in the media cycle and then forgetting about it the next minute. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unique to the issue of abuse. We\u2019re a very soundbite-oriented culture; we\u2019re a very celebrity-oriented culture. That often leads people to\u2026 be easily swayed by the soundbites rather than really digging into the real issue. And in addition to that, I think it does lead to a situation where people emotionally feel like they have done something [simply by feeling that abuse is bad]. But they haven\u2019t actually done anything. We don\u2019t like to have to dig into things and put time and effort into a battle that\u2019s not easily won. And so I think there\u2019s an extent where people want [talk of abuse] to go away quickly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t talk about the permanency of the damage. And the reality is that these people are never going to be who they would have been</p> <footer> <cite>Rachael Denhollander</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In terms of the organizations themselves\u2026 they really do believe that these are largely publicity problems. There\u2019s just no understanding of trauma, of emotional abuse, verbal abuse, psychological abuse. It\u2019s just it\u2019s not there. The framework for understanding abuse is completely gone. But those who are in authority are intentionally not educating themselves. And chosen ignorance is the greatest form of cowardice.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel like that lack of action and understanding has created a situation where more abuse could still occur?</strong></p> <p>How much worse can it get? If this wasn\u2019t enough, what is it going to take? I do not have any hope for those who are in leadership at USAG. I don\u2019t have any hope for the vast majority of elite coaches who were participated in the system, who knew what was going on, who put their girls through this\u2026 and didn\u2019t say anything. They have chosen over and over and over again an abusive framework. They\u2019ve made that choice repeatedly. They\u2019re not standing up and speaking out against it now. The athletes still to this day are left standing alone.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think coaches and others within leadership have come to believe that the abusive framework they employed is the only way to win or succeed?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s the lazy way out. You create a bunch of little girls that you can control and manipulate, who behave and perform like robots. It makes your job a whole lot easier.</p> <p><strong>I know you and others work hard to keep this story in the news. What concrete goals do you hope to achieve even as USA Gymnastics seems to refuse to make real change?</strong></p> <p>Public pressure and public outrage [drive] change. And if the public doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s nothing anybody can do about it. I would like to see a lot more productivity in the leadership. [The United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee] is a creation of statutes. [It\u2019s] run with taxpayer dollars and with sponsor dollars. It\u2019s time for the Senate to act\u2026 and it is time for sponsors to act. If you don\u2019t want to be participating in a culture of abuse, don\u2019t fund an organization that is abusing children.

      "bodyText": "In 2016, former gymnast Rachael Denhollander filed a report with the Michigan State University police department and a Title IX complaint with the school. She alleged that Dr Larry Nassar had sexually assaulted her more than a decade earlier when she\u2019d been his patient \u2013 and in doing so, Denhollander became the first of more than 265 women to come forward alleging abuse by Nassar. Nassar will spend the rest of his life in prison after being convicted on charges of child pornography, sexual assault and sexual assault of minors. During a January 2018 sentencing, dozens of his victims gave impact statements in court in Michigan, facing their accuser with an array of emotions. Denollander was one of them, asking simply: \u201cHow much is a little girl worth?\u201d By that point, Denhollander was already one of the most vocal and best-known of Nassar\u2019s victims; a lawyer, she\u2019s moved into advocacy work full-time since coming forward three years ago. Denhollander\u2019s work has expanded beyond the world of sports, though, and she\u2019s been especially critical of the Southern Baptist Convention and the abuse within its ranks. This week Denhollander spoke with the Guardian about her ongoing advocacy work and the progress she hopes to still see. It\u2019s been more than three years now since you came forward and this movement started. How do you feel about everything USA Gymnastics has done since? Disappointed. They have completely refused any shred of transparency and accountability. They have refused to identify even one thing that went wrong. They have refused to identify even one coach that was abusive or one abusive situation, to point to something and say, hey, we shouldn\u2019t have allowed that. And if you cannot even acknowledge the problem, you cannot fix the problem. I get asked all the time, what\u2019s the single most important thing we can do to combat abuse? And most of the time when people ask that question, they\u2019re thinking policy: What policy provision do we need in place? But the single most important thing you can do [isn\u2019t policy]. It\u2019s to communicate that it matters, because that\u2019s what changes the culture around you. That\u2019s what communicates to predators that they will not be harbored and they won\u2019t be safe. That\u2019s what communicates to the people who would mishandle or cover up allegations of abuse that there will be consequences if they don\u2019t report it properly. And that\u2019s what communicates to survivors that [they\u2019re] going to be heard and listened to, and it\u2019s safe to speak up. If you did not communicate that, you haven\u2019t done the most basic thing you need to start to change the culture around you. And I take it you don\u2019t feel like that has happened. They really still do believe they have a publicity problem. That\u2019s what they\u2019re acting like. \u2026 So it has been nothing but gross disappointment. When it comes to the tension between policy v communication, did you always feel that communication trumped policy? I\u2019ve understood [that communication is what needs to change] for years and years. I think part of it is because communication is my passion: the communication of ideas and the consequence of ideas. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve studied and been passionate about for a long time. Even when I was starting to work through my own abuse and looking at the cultural dynamics and just trying to determine what do I do\u2026 I already had that focus on the consequences of ideas and the communication of ideas. That really is at the root of everything we do. We talk a lot about actions, but behind those actions are ideas. And if you don\u2019t have your ideas right, the actions are not going to follow. Either they won\u2019t be the right actions, or you\u2019ll have the right actions on paper but no heart motivation to follow them. Do you think, then, that there\u2019s a misconception among the general public that this is more of a policy problem than anything else? I think we have a significant problem in this culture with being emotionally driven by whatever is in the media cycle and then forgetting about it the next minute. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unique to the issue of abuse. We\u2019re a very soundbite-oriented culture; we\u2019re a very celebrity-oriented culture. That often leads people to\u2026 be easily swayed by the soundbites rather than really digging into the real issue. And in addition to that, I think it does lead to a situation where people emotionally feel like they have done something [simply by feeling that abuse is bad]. But they haven\u2019t actually done anything. We don\u2019t like to have to dig into things and put time and effort into a battle that\u2019s not easily won. And so I think there\u2019s an extent where people want [talk of abuse] to go away quickly. In terms of the organizations themselves\u2026 they really do believe that these are largely publicity problems. There\u2019s just no understanding of trauma, of emotional abuse, verbal abuse, psychological abuse. It\u2019s just it\u2019s not there. The framework for understanding abuse is completely gone. But those who are in authority are intentionally not educating themselves. And chosen ignorance is the greatest form of cowardice. Do you feel like that lack of action and understanding has created a situation where more abuse could still occur? How much worse can it get? If this wasn\u2019t enough, what is it going to take? I do not have any hope for those who are in leadership at USAG. I don\u2019t have any hope for the vast majority of elite coaches who were participated in the system, who knew what was going on, who put their girls through this\u2026 and didn\u2019t say anything. They have chosen over and over and over again an abusive framework. They\u2019ve made that choice repeatedly. They\u2019re not standing up and speaking out against it now. The athletes still to this day are left standing alone. Why do you think coaches and others within leadership have come to believe that the abusive framework they employed is the only way to win or succeed? It\u2019s the lazy way out. You create a bunch of little girls that you can control and manipulate, who behave and perform like robots. It makes your job a whole lot easier. I know you and others work hard to keep this story in the news. What concrete goals do you hope to achieve even as USA Gymnastics seems to refuse to make real change? Public pressure and public outrage [drive] change. And if the public doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s nothing anybody can do about it. I would like to see a lot more productivity in the leadership. [The United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee] is a creation of statutes. [It\u2019s] run with taxpayer dollars and with sponsor dollars. It\u2019s time for the Senate to act\u2026 and it is time for sponsors to act. If you don\u2019t want to be participating in a culture of abuse, don\u2019t fund an organization that is abusing children. It\u2019s that simple. Switching gears, can you take yourself back, mentally, to when you decided to speak out and realized that advocacy work could be a future. How does the reality of what that life has been like over the past few years compare with what you imagined? I wish I could say that it\u2019s been a surprise, that I\u2019ve been I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised, [that] I thought it was going to be worse. I can\u2019t. I really did foresee all of the difficulty and the amount of corruption uncovered in law enforcement and in these organizations across the board. I anticipated all of it. In terms of the life shifts for me and the doors that have opened, I did not anticipate that. That has been a whirlwind. I\u2019m deeply grateful for that. I am, but I wish it wasn\u2019t necessary.

I never wanted my sexual assault to be dinner-table conversation across the world. And just the level of graphic detail that\u2019s out there, the photographs, the videos \u2013 I still find it very re-victimizing and very difficult. But in addition to that, just being immersed in all of the corruption and the evil and the pain, working with these organizations who time and time and time again turn their backs on the survivors and on the kids that are under their protection [has been difficult].

      "body": "<p>As you are obviously very aware, we are in the final countdown to the most exciting, glittery, delightful holiday of the year. Yes! I\u2019m talking about Hanukah! Can I get a woop woop?</p> <p>Hanukah, which begins tomorrow night, is the only religious holiday I know of where the less observant you are, the larger it looms in your religious consciousness. Because, in truth, it\u2019s a pretty minor holiday in the Jewish calendar. Yet with the pluck of a wildly ambitious reality TV star, it has pushed its way to the forefront of the Jewish holiday lineup. Among the non-chosen people, it might even be better known than Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Pesach, the Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett of the group, now overshadowed by Hanukah\u2019s Rylan Clark-Neal.</p> <p>This is because (for reasons I will shortly get to) it is the favoured holiday of the assimilated Jew. But first allow me to play Hebrew school teacher for a moment while I tell you the story of Hanukah: according to the first and second book of the Maccabees (which FYI has nothing to do with <a href=\"https://www.themaccabees.co.uk\" title=\"\">The Maccabees</a>), Hanukah celebrates a small group of Jews who refused to worship the gods of their Greek-Syrian oppressors and thus refused to assimilate. Alas for poor old Hanukah itself, however, it has, in a classic Jewish joke of a twist, become the most assimilated of the Jewish holidays because of its proximity to Christmas. So a holiday that was once about maintaining one\u2019s proud Jewish heritage has, in the minds of many, become Santa Claus with candles. Hell, the Hallmark channel now even makes <a href=\"https://www.algemeiner.com/2019/11/17/hallmark-channel-set-to-premiere-hanukkah-movies-for-first-time/\" title=\"\">Hanuk</a><a href=\"https://www.algemeiner.com/2019/11/17/hallmark-channel-set-to-premiere-hanukkah-movies-for-first-time/\" title=\"\">ah-themed romcoms</a>. (Who was it who said that those Zionists, even if they lived in this country for a very long time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2018/aug/24/jeremy-corbyns-2013-remarks-on-some-zionists-not-understanding-english-irony-video\" title=\"\">don\u2019t understand English irony</a>? Because I\u2019ve lived in this country for fricking ages and I am all over the irony here.)</p> <p>Assimilation has slightly tricky connotations these days. Like being a centrist, it was once touted as a sensible compromise but is now viewed as a problematic and self-defeating. And it goes further: urging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/13/integration-racism-assimilation-britain-heritage\" title=\"\">immigrants or minorities to assimilate</a> is now seen as tantamount to racism, a euphemistic way of shouting at foreigners on public transport to speak <em>English</em>, we\u2019re in <em>England</em>, for fook\u2019s sake.</p> <p>Yet the undeniable fact is that I am utterly assimilated. Nine years of Hebrew school means I know my way around the Hebrew alphabet. But I also have a collection of Christmas tchotchkes so extensive, they have their own storage box. Do you need at least four Santa snow globes? Or a selection of artfully decorated dreidls? Got you a woman who can do both.</p> <p>For most of my life I\u2019ve had conflicted feelings about my assimilation, but the reasons have changed. Even though I grew up in New York (a city so Jewish Jesse Jackson once referred to it, charmingly, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/27/us/jackson-admits-saying-hymie-and-apologizes-at-a-synagogue.html\" title=\"\">\u201cHymietown\u201d</a>), my childhood social circle was remarkably unJewish. Next to my friends, who were mainly blond and spent summers at tennis camp, I saw myself as a semitic little freak, condemned to spend weekends in a dark synagogue with my dark hair, learning to write an ancient language no one I knew spoke. (And that includes my parents.)</p> <p>Although my mother dutifully took me to Hebrew school and ensured I was batmitzvahed, the reason I am so assimilated is because my parents are. My mother loves Pesach and Rosh Hashanah (nobody loves Yom Kippur), but she loves Christmas at least as much. If you think my Christmas tchotchke collection is extensive, you should see my mother\u2019s; after all, I only have her overspill.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/commentisfree/2019/dec/07/emma-thompson-last-christmas-perfect-brexit-festive-movie\">Emma Thompson\u2019s ludicrous Last Christmas is the perfect Brexit festive movie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once I started to make more Jewish friends, at university in the UK and as an adult in London, it was the \u201cassimilated\u201d part of my identity I began to resent, rather than the \u201cJewish\u201d half. I envied friends who grew up with the undiluted version, who could lapse into Yiddish without a pause, who didn\u2019t have to double-check whether you go to synagogue on the Friday or Saturday or both. How enviable to grow up with such a clear view of oneself, I\u2019d think. I\u2019d occasionally go to Jewish social centres where friendly people would talk to me in Hebrew and I\u2019d have to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying but I can write it out phonetically? Does that count?\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, I obviously didn\u2019t want it that much, because I never did anything about it. I somehow kept neglecting to go to synagogue while at the same time finding time to get a Christmas tree every year. I even shacked up with a goy \u2013 <em>oy vey</em>! But when my kids were born, I was damned if they weren\u2019t going to feel Jewish, and I immediately put them down for Hebrew school, even if I have yet to take them. So last weekend I was horrified when one of them announced, correctly, that he was \u201cChristian <em>and</em> Jewish\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re Jewish, because your mother is Jewish!\u201d I hissed. He looked at me with all the condescension a four-year-old can muster: \u201cIt\u2019s good, Mummy. It means we can celebrate Christmas <em>and</em> Hanukah.\u201d </p> <p>And given I was hanging a star on our Christmas tree at the time, I could hardly argue. But it\u2019s \u201cMommy\u201d, not \u201cMummy\u201d, kid, OK? There\u2019s only so much assimilation that\u2019s allowed around here. </p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.</p>",

Because I\u2019ve lived in this country for fricking ages and I am all over the irony here.) Assimilation has slightly tricky connotations these days. Like being a centrist, it was once touted as a sensible compromise but is now viewed as a problematic and self-defeating. And it goes further: urging immigrants or minorities to assimilate is now seen as tantamount to racism, a euphemistic way of shouting at foreigners on public transport to speak English, we\u2019re in England, for fook\u2019s sake. Yet the undeniable fact is that I am utterly assimilated. Nine years of Hebrew school means I know my way around the Hebrew alphabet. But I also have a collection of Christmas tchotchkes so extensive, they have their own storage box. Do you need at least four Santa snow globes? Or a selection of artfully decorated dreidls? Got you a woman who can do both. For most of my life I\u2019ve had conflicted feelings about my assimilation, but the reasons have changed. Even though I grew up in New York (a city so Jewish Jesse Jackson once referred to it, charmingly, as \u201cHymietown\u201d), my childhood social circle was remarkably unJewish. Next to my friends, who were mainly blond and spent summers at tennis camp, I saw myself as a semitic little freak, condemned to spend weekends in a dark synagogue with my dark hair, learning to write an ancient language no one I knew spoke. (And that includes my parents.) Although my mother dutifully took me to Hebrew school and ensured I was batmitzvahed, the reason I am so assimilated is because my parents are. My mother loves Pesach and Rosh Hashanah (nobody loves Yom Kippur), but she loves Christmas at least as much. If you think my Christmas tchotchke collection is extensive, you should see my mother\u2019s; after all, I only have her overspill. Once I started to make more Jewish friends, at university in the UK and as an adult in London, it was the \u201cassimilated\u201d part of my identity I began to resent, rather than the \u201cJewish\u201d half. I envied friends who grew up with the undiluted version, who could lapse into Yiddish without a pause, who didn\u2019t have to double-check whether you go to synagogue on the Friday or Saturday or both. How enviable to grow up with such a clear view of oneself, I\u2019d think. I\u2019d occasionally go to Jewish social centres where friendly people would talk to me in Hebrew and I\u2019d have to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying but I can write it out phonetically? Does that count?\u201d Anyway, I obviously didn\u2019t want it that much, because I never did anything about it. I somehow kept neglecting to go to synagogue while at the same time finding time to get a Christmas tree every year. I even shacked up with a goy \u2013 oy vey! But when my kids were born, I was damned if they weren\u2019t going to feel Jewish, and I immediately put them down for Hebrew school, even if I have yet to take them. So last weekend I was horrified when one of them announced, correctly, that he was \u201cChristian and Jewish\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re Jewish, because your mother is Jewish!\u201d I hissed. He looked at me with all the condescension a four-year-old can muster: \u201cIt\u2019s good, Mummy. It means we can celebrate Christmas and Hanukah.\u201d And given I was hanging a star on our Christmas tree at the time, I could hardly argue. But it\u2019s \u201cMommy\u201d, not \u201cMummy\u201d, kid, OK? There\u2019s only so much assimilation that\u2019s allowed around here. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.",

      "bodyText": "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s civil liabilities just got more complicated. As he and his bankrupt film studio thought they were closing in on a bargain $47m class-action settlement with more than 30 actors and former employees over claims of sexual misconduct, three women have established separate legal actions against the disgraced movie producer. All three women, Kaja Sokola, Wedil David and Jane Doe \u2013 a pseudonym for the same woman who will testify against Weinstein when he is tried next month on charges of rape, predatory sexual assault and criminal sexual act \u2013 claim, like many before them, that Weinstein assaulted them. They maintain that the settlement lets Weinstein off too lightly and are determined to prevent that. \u201cMy clients believe the current settlement is inadequate in terms of the amounts of money for the victims, and doesn\u2019t provide for any understanding of how many will participate or how much each individual will receive,\u201d Doug Wigdor, attorney for the trio, told the Guardian. Sokola is claiming under New York\u2019s Child Victims Act, as she was 16 at the time of the alleged assaults. In court documents filed on Thursday, Sokola, now 33, told how she was introduced to Weinstein in 2002 at an event associated with her model agency a month after arriving from Poland aged 16.

David claims Weinstein raped her in 2016 and masturbated in front of her both that year and a year earlier, including once during a meeting about a prospective acting job at the Montage hotel in Beverly Hills. Doe claims that Weinstein sexually assaulted her under the premise of discussing acting opportunities in 2002. Weinstein has consistently denied all claims of non-consensual sex, and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges against him. So far more than 80 women have accused him of sexual assault or harassment, including Rosanna Arquette, Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Mira Sorvino. But the latest court filing on behalf of Sokola, whose allegations (under a Jane Doe) first appeared in the 2018 class-action lawsuit that accused Weinstein and the board of his former film company of a pattern of sexual misconduct, point to a split in approaches. Under the current settlement deal being offered, Weinstein is not required to put up any of his own money or offer an admission of guilt. Additionally, company executives would be shielded from further claims and just $6.2m of the $47m would go to 18 of the alleged victims, with no one individual receiving over $500,000. But newly enacted child victims legislation, which extends the age at which a victim can bring a claim for past crimes to 55, has reinvigorated efforts to hold Weinstein to account \u2013 as well as The Weinstein Company and its executives and Miramax\u2019s parent firm, Disney \u2013 on the grounds that all of them had acted to protect the movie producer despite knowledge of his conduct. The complaint goes on to claim that \u201cnumerous employees and executives of Miramax and Disney were aware of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s pattern of misconduct, but the companies that employed him utterly failed to supervise him, and they continued to empower him with their prestige and resources and allowed him to find more victims, including Kaja Sokola.\u201d Disney did not reply to a request for comment at time of publication. Unlike many claims against Weinstein and his employers in the class-action suit, Sokola and Davis\u2019s claims fall within the civil statute of limitations. Doe, a 16-year-old at the time of the alleged assault in 2002, is able to claim against Miramax\u2019s then owner, Disney. The company, says Wigdor, \u201cbears responsibility legally for the negligence that ultimately permitted Harvey Weinstein to sexually assault our client\u201d. In breaking away from the proposed class-action settlement, Sokola, Davis and Doe\u2019s attorneys described it as \u201coffensive and one-sided\u201d and called on other victims and the New York attorney general to abandon the settlement and join their effort. \u201cWhere companies had actual knowledge of the sexual predator\u2019s acts, then took steps to hide those acts from the larger public and enabled that person to continue by keeping them employed or building penalties for future transgressions into Harvey Weinstein\u2019s contract, that sets reasonable grounds to hold those companies responsible,\u201d Wigdor said. And that, Wigdor said, should also be seen in the context of a post-#MeToo environment in which employers and board members can be held accountable for the actions of a sexual predator or for permitting a sexually predatory environment to develop. \u201cOne of the ways of trying to minimize or curtail these power-dynamic situations is for companies to take greater control of, and responsibility for, the acts of its executives. That\u2019s really what we are trying to do in addition to holding Harvey Weinstein accountable.\u201d",

Clinton drew a measly audience of \u201c500 people\u201d to her prime-time rally, according to the president\u2019s version of events.

And we won Michigan. And word is we\u2019re much higher in the polls in Michigan than we ever were in 2016.\u201d</p> <p>The tale is not true. Trump\u2019s rally drew a <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/11/08/donald-trump-holds-late-night-rally-grand-rapids/93447114/\">crowd of 4,200</a>, while Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/hillary-clinton-us-election-night-reaction\">notched up</a> 4,600. But the story was red meat to his Michigan audience last week who cheered Trump\u2019s fantasy memory as if it presaged another victory in this key battleground state in 2020.</p> <p>However, the current reality in Michigan for the now impeached president is a bit different. Polls <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/Michigan.html\">consistently show</a> Trump trailing top Democratic candidates in Michigan, which he won in 2016 by a mere 12,000 votes. Meanwhile, his approval numbers have <a href=\"https://ssl2002.webhosting.comcast.net/epic-mra/press/Stwd_Survey_Aug2019_Media_Freq.pdf\">remained underwater</a>.</p> <p>There are few scenarios in which a candidate can win the White House without taking this rust belt state next year, and Democrat operatives here hope Trump\u2019s impeachment would further bolster the party, motivate the base, and sway independents. But the actual impact of the historic impeachment vote is hard to predict. Many voters across Michigan\u2019s political spectrum questioned whether impeachment had delivered the intended results. Some even predict it will help Trump in 2020.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5db32e5d4e6d406a233e56c31f533af568b71013\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5db32e5d4e6d406a233e56c31f533af568b71013/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A supporter raises their hands in a heart gesture as Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, on 18 December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A supporter raises their hands in a heart gesture as Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, on 18 December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDid Democrats do the right thing?

      "bodyText": "As the historic impeachment vote played out in Washington last week, Donald Trump stood in front of a raucous audience at a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, and relayed an anecdote from the 2016 election day that fired up the baying crowd. He and Hillary Clinton had each rolled into the crucial swing state for their final campaign stops hours before the first ballots were cast. Clinton drew a measly audience of \u201c500 people\u201d to her prime-time rally, according to the president\u2019s version of events. Conversely, he drew 32,000 supporters to a Grand Rapids arena despite not taking the stage until 1am. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that night,\u201d he boasted. \u201cWe did it. And we won Michigan. And word is we\u2019re much higher in the polls in Michigan than we ever were in 2016.\u201d The tale is not true. Trump\u2019s rally drew a crowd of 4,200, while Clinton\u2019s notched up 4,600. But the story was red meat to his Michigan audience last week who cheered Trump\u2019s fantasy memory as if it presaged another victory in this key battleground state in 2020. However, the current reality in Michigan for the now impeached president is a bit different. Polls consistently show Trump trailing top Democratic candidates in Michigan, which he won in 2016 by a mere 12,000 votes. Meanwhile, his approval numbers have remained underwater. There are few scenarios in which a candidate can win the White House without taking this rust belt state next year, and Democrat operatives here hope Trump\u2019s impeachment would further bolster the party, motivate the base, and sway independents. But the actual impact of the historic impeachment vote is hard to predict. Many voters across Michigan\u2019s political spectrum questioned whether impeachment had delivered the intended results. Some even predict it will help Trump in 2020. \u201cDid Democrats do the right thing? Oh yeah. For sure. Is it going to help them win an election? I\u2019m not so sure about that,\u201d said Tom Martin, a Democrat from the Detroit suburb of Warren. \u201cIt just seems like another fight, and how many more of those will there be? And how many other things are there to think about?\u201d Nationally, voters are split on the question of impeachment and removal from office, while a consistent majority has said Trump committed an impeachable offense. In Michigan, the reality is less clear. Charlie Smith, a Republican who was shopping for Christmas gifts on Thursday at a mall in Macomb, said he saw a split among conservatives and liberals on the issue. Impeachment might sway some \u201cuninformed\u201d independents, he said, but he also called Trump a \u201cdriving force in the economy\u201d. \u201cThe overall factor when it comes down to voting is, \u2018Hey, how am I doing economically?\u2019 Everything is going well right now. He\u2019s doing well by the country,\u201d Smith added. Macomb county, just outside Detroit, is under close scrutiny as it is one of several dozen critical swing counties nationwide in which Barack Obama won a majority before voters then switched sides to help deliver the 2016 election to Trump. Just as it\u2019s difficult to win the general election without taking Michigan, it\u2019s hard to win Michigan without securing Macomb. There are doubts that impeachment moved the needle for the Democrats there. \u201cI find it a little hard to believe that Democrats got anything out of it,\u201d said Bill Belanger, a state political analyst. \u201cFor people who turned from Obama to Trump, maybe there\u2019s some disillusionment with him. But they already have a lot of other good reasons to be disillusioned.\u201d The impeachment inquiry could backfire in that it\u2019s also feeding the president\u2019s base, said Trump supporter and Macomb resident Archie Atkinson. \u201cIt\u2019s going to motivate me, and people in my circle have all said we\u2019re going to get Trump back in,\u201d he said. \u201cImpeachment is a lot of it.\u201d That\u2019s consistent with the mood at Trump\u2019s Wednesday rally, where an estimated 10,000 fervent supporters took part in what was an upbeat celebration of their candidate on a night when their president became only the third in US history to be impeached.

      "body": "<h2>Manchester City</h2> <p>Without doubt we\u2019ve dipped below the standards we set over the last two seasons, but there\u2019s no panic. Our (relative) woes can be attributed to an accumulation of a few separate problems: Laporte/San\u00e9\u2019s injuries, the Bernardo Silva saga, no new centre-half, and certain players\u2019 decline. It\u2019s not a structural issue. Hopefully we can recover our level in the second half of the season \u2013 though losing Mikel Arteta is a concern. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/premier-league-fans-half-term-reports-arsenal-liverpool\">Premier League fans\u2019 half-term reports. Part one: Arsenal to Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>Some of De Bruyne\u2019s performances have been incredible: his assists against Spurs, his all-round performance against Watford, that goal at St James\u2019 Park and his showing at the Emirates. The best player in the league is back. Sterling started the season on fire but his level has dropped a little of late. The other bright spark has been Phil Foden. Flops? John Stones\u2019 downward trajectory is a big concern.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>Of course. He\u2019s still the best manager around. City fans calling for his head need to be careful what they wish for. My main two criticisms are the decision not to replace Vincent Kompany, and that he\u2019s had too much faith in the old guard. Foden and Eric Garcia haven\u2019t been used enough. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019? </strong>Kompany ripping the ball into the top corner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/06/manchester-city-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Leicester in May</a>. What a moment. I haven\u2019t celebrated a goal like that since Ag\u00fcero in 2012. The perfect way for an icon to bow out. Top bins.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Lloyd Scragg </strong><a href=\"https://ninetythreetwenty.com/\" title=\"\">NinetyThreeTwenty.com</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lloyd_scragg\" title=\"\">@lloyd_scragg</a></p> <h2>Manchester United</h2> <p>Frustrating. We\u2019ve beaten top teams but been turned over by Palace, Bournemouth, Newcastle and West Ham. We\u2019ve also gone ahead in six out of the seven games that we have drawn: we can\u2019t kill off teams or defend a lead. Aside from that, though, you can see green shoots: this team have potential. If the board supports Ole in next couple of windows while getting rid of the deadwood, we wont be far away from competing again. <strong>6.5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>McTominay has really grown in stature: you can see he has the character and potential to be our captain. Rashford has been in a rich vein of form and Daniel James has exceeded all our expectations out wide. As for Paul Pogba, though: Reds are convinced he has gone into some sort of witness protection scheme. He\u2019s a big-name player with a poor attitude who Jos\u00e9 described as a virus. He needs to go.</p> <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>Ole clearly has a plan in how he wants to his build his team and how he wants them to play. What he doesn\u2019t have is a plan B when we are struggling to break teams down. His substitutions can be slightly baffling. He\u2019s still cutting his teeth, though, and needs a couple more windows to shape his team. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019? </strong>I\u2019ll never forget the way Pep celebrated Sterling\u2019s goal in the Champions League quarter\u2011final against Spurs, only to sink to his knees after it was ruled out for offside. Football can be so cruel, can\u2019t it?</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Shaun O\u2019Donnell</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4d422d149c0b4710469bd95689fc1f9e09357b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b4d422d149c0b4710469bd95689fc1f9e09357b/0_21_5472_3282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott McTominay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott McTominay: future captain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Newcastle</h2> <p>The negative style and lack of threat is frustrating the hell out of most fans \u2013 as is the all-pervading dearth of ambition from the owner. That said, the predicted post-Rafa implosion, at least on the pitch, failed to materialise. Our team can deliver gutsy performances: they seem to play for each other and the fans. <strong>5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>Allan Saint-Maximin is one of the few in our squad who can excite the crowd, but there have only been rare glimpses of end product. It\u2019s great to see Andy Carroll back and if he can stay injury free (here\u2019s hoping) he might become a talisman for better things to come. Steve Bruce seems to have revitalised Ciaran Clark and Jonjo Shelvey, and you also have to give credit to defenders Jetro Willems, Fabian Sch\u00e4r and Federico Fern\u00e1ndez. Unfortunately Joelinton hasn\u2019t yet lived up to his price tag \u2013 the position of lone striker doesn\u2019t exactly suit him \u2013 while new right-back Emil Krafth has failed to establish himself. To add to our worries, Sean Longstaff hasn\u2019t been the same player after coming back from injury.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>Nobody can say Steve Bruce\u2019s heart isn\u2019t in it, and he gets some sympathy for having to work under Ashley. Unfortunately, his record so far is consistent with his reputation as a journeyman manager who has had little success at average clubs. Trying to win games with more than a 30% possession rate might help his approval ratings. <strong>5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019? </strong>Matty Longstaff\u2019s screamer against Man United \u2013 oh joy! To see a young Geordie lad <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/newcastle-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">mark his debut with a match-winning thunderbolt</a> brought a tear to the eye.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>David </strong>and<strong> Richard Holmes</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f859b3f81555859eb43c42f76e42d203d9aebee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f859b3f81555859eb43c42f76e42d203d9aebee/0_39_1976_1186/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matty Longstaff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matty Longstaff: tearjerker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Norwich</h2> <p>Considering we\u2019re 19th, we\u2019re reasonably OK with how things have panned out. Expectations were always realistic given our financial limitations, but we hoped we could surprise one or two with our pleasing-on-the-eye football and doggedness. As it\u2019s transpired, we\u2019ve struggled with both to varying degrees, but we have had a few notable successes along the way \u2013 notably the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/norwich-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">home win over Manchester City</a>. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops</strong> Teemu Pukki has been the undoubted star with his clever movement and clinical finishing. He\u2019s basically carried on where he left off last season and we\u2019re lucky to still have him. Others who have excelled are Tim Krul, Kenny McLean and Todd Cantwell. No one has flopped as such but a few have struggled to step up \u2013 Marco Stiepermann among them.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>Oddly, yes, we are happy with Daniel Farke. He has plenty of credit in the bank after getting us here on a shoestring budget in the first place and had to contend with a horrendous injury crisis in the first couple of months of the season. He\u2019s stayed true to his principles, which we like. He\u2019ll do for us. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019 </strong>It has to be the sight of the Championship trophy lift at Villa Park last season. Trophies are hard to come by when you\u2019re Norwich, so it was special: particularly when the style of football that won it was so exhilarating. The images will live long in the memory.</p> <p>\u2022<strong> Gary Gowers </strong><a href=\"http://norwichcity.myfootballwriter.com/\" title=\"\">NorwichCity.myfootballwriter.com</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gary_Gowers\" title=\"\">@gary_gowers</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/norwichcitymfw?lang=en\" title=\"\">@NorwichCityMFW</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d40847f28ed0ea333114735c330502b229994f89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d40847f28ed0ea333114735c330502b229994f89/0_82_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Farke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Farke with the trophy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sheffield United</h2> <p>It couldn\u2019t have gone much better. We look every bit like we belong at this level and have played exciting, full-throttle football in virtually every game. Even for me as an optimist, it\u2019s been an astonishingly good start. <strong>10/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops</strong> Honestly, everyone has been a star. Every single player has looked the part and some of them, such as George Baldock, John Lundstram and John Fleck, have taken huge steps forward. Lys Mousset is surely one of the summer\u2019s best signings, with five goals and three assists in his first five starts. As for flops, it might have been nice for some of our other signings to have a bigger impact, but the fact is they\u2019ve been kept out of the team by the bulk of last season\u2019s XI.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>I can only score him up to 10? Easily the best Blades manager of my time as a supporter, and surely has to be in the conversation as our greatest ever after just three and a half seasons. <strong>10/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019?</strong> Late in last season\u2019s promotion run we went to Hull for a must-win game against a team with excellent home form. Classic banana-skin potential \u2013 until we found ourselves 3-0 up at half\u2011time and with promotion in touching distance. A few people around me had something in their eye at that point \u2013 I may or may not have been one of them.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ben Meakin </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bladespod?lang=en\" title=\"\">@bladespod</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"241d00e9edc4e7737e203f26de92d91bb987d19f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/241d00e9edc4e7737e203f26de92d91bb987d19f/0_121_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Baldock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Baldock: looks the part.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/JMP/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Southampton</h2> <p>It felt like a promising pre-season \u2013 but things have gone south again. Thrashing Pompey in the Carabao Cup was the highlight and, despite a recent run of half-decent performances, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/14/southampton-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the defeat to West Ham</a>, who were apparently in crisis when they arrived, has left everybody fearing a long, hard slog for the rest of the season. A generous <strong>2/10</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>Danny Ings has been our standout performer, and I say that as someone who was sceptical about paying \u00a320m for him. Without his goals (and a few VAR interventions) we\u2019d be adrift already. Some promising signs from Boufal and Djenepo, otherwise that\u2019s it for the \u201cstars\u201d. Flops is a much longer list. Gunn lost his place after the Leicester humiliation (and a season save ratio of 55%), our centre-backs have been rotated out frequently because they\u2019re all terrible, and our captain, H\u00f8jbjerg, is leading by (bad) example \u2013 incapable of passing to a team mate.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>He played a mediocre hand pretty well for most of the second half of last season.

You can sense the club sees this season as a solid opportunity to establish ourselves, both domestically and on the continent, so it\u2019s a good time to invest. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>Before his injury, Boly was by far our standout player. So much so that panic set in when he suffered a fairly serious injury. Players have filled in admirably in his absence, though, with Moutinho and Traor\u00e9 arguably the stars since. Jes\u00fas Vallejo, on loan from Real Madrid, has really struggled in his appearances so far, though. He arrived with pretty high expectations but it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if his loan was ended early in January.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>There\u2019s a reason Arsenal were heavily linked with a move for him.

      "bodyText": "Manchester City Without doubt we\u2019ve dipped below the standards we set over the last two seasons, but there\u2019s no panic. Our (relative) woes can be attributed to an accumulation of a few separate problems: Laporte/San\u00e9\u2019s injuries, the Bernardo Silva saga, no new centre-half, and certain players\u2019 decline. It\u2019s not a structural issue. Hopefully we can recover our level in the second half of the season \u2013 though losing Mikel Arteta is a concern. 7/10 Stars/flops Some of De Bruyne\u2019s performances have been incredible: his assists against Spurs, his all-round performance against Watford, that goal at St James\u2019 Park and his showing at the Emirates. The best player in the league is back. Sterling started the season on fire but his level has dropped a little of late. The other bright spark has been Phil Foden. Flops? John Stones\u2019 downward trajectory is a big concern. Happy with the manager? Of course. He\u2019s still the best manager around. City fans calling for his head need to be careful what they wish for. My main two criticisms are the decision not to replace Vincent Kompany, and that he\u2019s had too much faith in the old guard. Foden and Eric Garcia haven\u2019t been used enough. 7/10 Moment of 2019? Kompany ripping the ball into the top corner against Leicester in May. What a moment. I haven\u2019t celebrated a goal like that since Ag\u00fcero in 2012. The perfect way for an icon to bow out. Top bins. \u2022 Lloyd Scragg NinetyThreeTwenty.com @lloyd_scragg Manchester United Frustrating. We\u2019ve beaten top teams but been turned over by Palace, Bournemouth, Newcastle and West Ham. We\u2019ve also gone ahead in six out of the seven games that we have drawn: we can\u2019t kill off teams or defend a lead. Aside from that, though, you can see green shoots: this team have potential. If the board supports Ole in next couple of windows while getting rid of the deadwood, we wont be far away from competing again. 6.5/10 Stars/flops McTominay has really grown in stature: you can see he has the character and potential to be our captain. Rashford has been in a rich vein of form and Daniel James has exceeded all our expectations out wide. As for Paul Pogba, though: Reds are convinced he has gone into some sort of witness protection scheme. He\u2019s a big-name player with a poor attitude who Jos\u00e9 described as a virus. He needs to go. Stars/flops Ole clearly has a plan in how he wants to his build his team and how he wants them to play. What he doesn\u2019t have is a plan B when we are struggling to break teams down. His substitutions can be slightly baffling. He\u2019s still cutting his teeth, though, and needs a couple more windows to shape his team. 7/10 Moment of 2019? I\u2019ll never forget the way Pep celebrated Sterling\u2019s goal in the Champions League quarter\u2011final against Spurs, only to sink to his knees after it was ruled out for offside. Football can be so cruel, can\u2019t it? \u2022 Shaun O\u2019Donnell Newcastle The negative style and lack of threat is frustrating the hell out of most fans \u2013 as is the all-pervading dearth of ambition from the owner. That said, the predicted post-Rafa implosion, at least on the pitch, failed to materialise. Our team can deliver gutsy performances: they seem to play for each other and the fans. 5/10 Stars/flops Allan Saint-Maximin is one of the few in our squad who can excite the crowd, but there have only been rare glimpses of end product. It\u2019s great to see Andy Carroll back and if he can stay injury free (here\u2019s hoping) he might become a talisman for better things to come. Steve Bruce seems to have revitalised Ciaran Clark and Jonjo Shelvey, and you also have to give credit to defenders Jetro Willems, Fabian Sch\u00e4r and Federico Fern\u00e1ndez. Unfortunately Joelinton hasn\u2019t yet lived up to his price tag \u2013 the position of lone striker doesn\u2019t exactly suit him \u2013 while new right-back Emil Krafth has failed to establish himself. To add to our worries, Sean Longstaff hasn\u2019t been the same player after coming back from injury. Happy with the manager? Nobody can say Steve Bruce\u2019s heart isn\u2019t in it, and he gets some sympathy for having to work under Ashley. Unfortunately, his record so far is consistent with his reputation as a journeyman manager who has had little success at average clubs. Trying to win games with more than a 30% possession rate might help his approval ratings. 5/10 Moment of 2019? Matty Longstaff\u2019s screamer against Man United \u2013 oh joy! To see a young Geordie lad mark his debut with a match-winning thunderbolt brought a tear to the eye. \u2022 David and Richard Holmes Norwich Considering we\u2019re 19th, we\u2019re reasonably OK with how things have panned out. Expectations were always realistic given our financial limitations, but we hoped we could surprise one or two with our pleasing-on-the-eye football and doggedness. As it\u2019s transpired, we\u2019ve struggled with both to varying degrees, but we have had a few notable successes along the way \u2013 notably the home win over Manchester City. 6/10 Stars/flops Teemu Pukki has been the undoubted star with his clever movement and clinical finishing. He\u2019s basically carried on where he left off last season and we\u2019re lucky to still have him. Others who have excelled are Tim Krul, Kenny McLean and Todd Cantwell. No one has flopped as such but a few have struggled to step up \u2013 Marco Stiepermann among them. Happy with the manager? Oddly, yes, we are happy with Daniel Farke. He has plenty of credit in the bank after getting us here on a shoestring budget in the first place and had to contend with a horrendous injury crisis in the first couple of months of the season. He\u2019s stayed true to his principles, which we like. He\u2019ll do for us. 7/10 Moment of 2019 It has to be the sight of the Championship trophy lift at Villa Park last season. Trophies are hard to come by when you\u2019re Norwich, so it was special: particularly when the style of football that won it was so exhilarating. The images will live long in the memory. \u2022 Gary Gowers NorwichCity.myfootballwriter.com / @gary_gowers / @NorwichCityMFW Sheffield United It couldn\u2019t have gone much better. We look every bit like we belong at this level and have played exciting, full-throttle football in virtually every game. Even for me as an optimist, it\u2019s been an astonishingly good start. 10/10 Stars/flops Honestly, everyone has been a star. Every single player has looked the part and some of them, such as George Baldock, John Lundstram and John Fleck, have taken huge steps forward. Lys Mousset is surely one of the summer\u2019s best signings, with five goals and three assists in his first five starts. As for flops, it might have been nice for some of our other signings to have a bigger impact, but the fact is they\u2019ve been kept out of the team by the bulk of last season\u2019s XI. Happy with the manager? I can only score him up to 10? Easily the best Blades manager of my time as a supporter, and surely has to be in the conversation as our greatest ever after just three and a half seasons. 10/10 Moment of 2019? Late in last season\u2019s promotion run we went to Hull for a must-win game against a team with excellent home form. Classic banana-skin potential \u2013 until we found ourselves 3-0 up at half\u2011time and with promotion in touching distance. A few people around me had something in their eye at that point \u2013 I may or may not have been one of them. \u2022 Ben Meakin @bladespod Southampton It felt like a promising pre-season \u2013 but things have gone south again. Thrashing Pompey in the Carabao Cup was the highlight and, despite a recent run of half-decent performances, the defeat to West Ham, who were apparently in crisis when they arrived, has left everybody fearing a long, hard slog for the rest of the season. A generous 2/10. Stars/flops Danny Ings has been our standout performer, and I say that as someone who was sceptical about paying \u00a320m for him. Without his goals (and a few VAR interventions) we\u2019d be adrift already. Some promising signs from Boufal and Djenepo, otherwise that\u2019s it for the \u201cstars\u201d. Flops is a much longer list. Gunn lost his place after the Leicester humiliation (and a season save ratio of 55%), our centre-backs have been rotated out frequently because they\u2019re all terrible, and our captain, H\u00f8jbjerg, is leading by (bad) example \u2013 incapable of passing to a team mate. Happy with the manager? He played a mediocre hand pretty well for most of the second half of last season. He\u2019s playing a very similar hand rather badly this time around. Defensive issues haven\u2019t come close to being fixed. So, while accepting he\u2019s really not got much to work with, it\u2019s 5/10 so far. Moment of 2019? Slim pickings this year. I did enjoyed the memes after the Pompey v Sunderland play-off game with the idiot who tried to start a fight with Lee Cattermole \u2013 but I\u2019m scraping the barrel here \u2026 \u2022 Steve Grant Total Saints Podcast @SteveGrant1983 Tottenham Painful defeats (Bayern, Brighton, Colchester), exhilarating, thumping wins (Palace, Red Star, Burnley); at least things haven\u2019t been boring. Spurs were 12 points from the top four when Pochettino was sacked but a win at home to Chelsea will put us in a Champions League spot having qualified for this season\u2019s knockouts. Far from disastrous then, if below expectations. An upwardly mobile 6/10. Stars/flops Harry Kane has been decent by his standards, which are higher than most, and the real Dele Alli (rather than his brother) has been turning up of late. Son Heung-min has been the standout, though \u2013 what a goal against Burnley.

As for flops: Roberto has been a catastrophe; Anderson looks completely lacking in confidence; Yarmolenko started well but now looks way off form; Fornals is improving but took ages to settle; while Haller hasn\u2019t produced the goals you\u2019d expect for \u00a345m. Oh, and Jack Wilshere is, predictably, always injured. Happy with the manager? The Southampton game bought Pellegrini some time, but he hasn\u2019t delivered value for his \u00a37m salary. He has been unlucky with injuries but he\u2019s also bafflingly unwilling to change his 4-2-3-1. 4/10 Moment of 2019? David Martin breaking down in tears after making his debut at 33, then running over to his dad, Alvin, in the stand. That\u2019s what playing for West Ham should mean. \u2022 Pete May Author of Goodbye to Boleyn hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk Wolves A fairly slow start, but we\u2019ve since managed to produce strong performances in both the Premier League and Europa League \u2013 something that we were warned couldn\u2019t be done. The squad still needs some development in the coming window, though. You can sense the club sees this season as a solid opportunity to establish ourselves, both domestically and on the continent, so it\u2019s a good time to invest. 8/10 Stars/flops Before his injury, Boly was by far our standout player. So much so that panic set in when he suffered a fairly serious injury. Players have filled in admirably in his absence, though, with Moutinho and Traor\u00e9 arguably the stars since. Jes\u00fas Vallejo, on loan from Real Madrid, has really struggled in his appearances so far, though. He arrived with pretty high expectations but it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if his loan was ended early in January. Happy with the manager? There\u2019s a reason Arsenal were heavily linked with a move for him. He\u2019s too good for them, though. I\u2019m running out of superlatives for him, if I am honest. 9/10 Moment of 2019? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever quite felt anything like when Diogo Jota scored the second in the FA Cup quarter-final win against Manchester United. It still gives me goose bumps now \u2026 \u2022 Louie Silvani ThroughTheThirds.blogspot.com @louiesilvani4 \u2022 Part one: Arsenal to Liverpool",

      "body": "<h2>Arsenal</h2> <p>Oh for a return to the gloom of being bored by top-four finishes and regular trophies. It\u2019s not just all those fans who filed out at half-time against Man City who are far too entitled: it seems that from top to bottom our club is populated by working stiffs who expect to be rewarded for showing up. Under the ownership of our absentee landlord the heart of our club has been eviscerated, replaced by an infectious apathy. It\u2019s not just the poor results in our worst start to a season since the 70s, it\u2019s the pitiful lack of spirit. <strong>2/10</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/premier-league-fans-half-term-reports-manchester-city-wolves\">Premier League fans\u2019 half-term reports. Part two: Man City to Wolves</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>The unbridled enthusiasm of Gabby Martinelli has been just about the only highlight. Sadly the rest seem to have adopted the same uncommitted attitudes of David Luiz and Xhaka.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>I\u2019m really not sure if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/20/arsenal-appoint-mikel-arteta-as-manager-to-replace-unai-emery\">Mikel Arteta</a> is capable of commanding the levels of fear and respect needed to turn this sinking ship round. More\u2019s the point, after Emery\u2019s failure, I\u2019m not sure if the suits who appointed Unai are suitable custodians of our club. I can\u2019t ever envisage them appointing the sort of confrontational character we really need, for fear of rocking the business boat. <strong>5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Favourite moment of 2019? </strong>In a year where there\u2019s been a dearth of gloating opportunities, seeing the former Gunner Serge Gnabry bag a four-goal haul in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/01/tottenham-hotspur-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\">Spurs\u2019 2-7 humiliation</a> against Bayern at White Hart Lane was special.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Bernard Azulay </strong><a href=\"http://www.goonersdiary.co.uk/\" title=\"\">GoonersDiary.co.uk</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goonern5\" title=\"\">@GoonerN5</a></p> <h2>Aston Villa</h2> <p>It\u2019s been as tough as expected. Some wonderful moments, but what we\u2019ve seen has just confirmed that 17th would be a great outcome. Villa Park has been vibrant but the next few games are seminal. A poor Christmas could make it a sleepless early 2020, a good one would have us dreaming about cup finals. We\u2019ll see. By the way, you get treated much worse as an away fan in the Premier League than in the Championship: no pubs for miles let you in and the \u201csecond class citizen\u201d vibe is real. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops</strong> Grealish has been superb, adding goals to his general wizardry. The only concern now is that we\u2019re too reliant on him: if he gets injured we\u2019re down. El Ghazi has exceeded hopes and McGinn started well but has been overplayed and has faded. I\u2019m not in the \u201cWesley is useless\u201d camp \u2013 he\u2019s barely had a decent pass in a month. Mings is clearly a great bloke but his England debut went to his head. Grealish beware.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? 8/10</strong>. You gotta have faith. The last few weeks have been tough but we have to remember he is inexperienced. I\u2019d follow him over a cliff but if we have a bad next six games he\u2019s going to be under pressure. I\u2019d definitely let him loose with the January chequebook, though.</p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019? </strong>By a mile, Jack Grealish\u2019s winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/10/aston-villa-jack-grealish-attacked-by-spectator-birmingham-city\">at St Andrew\u2019s last March</a>, and his \u201cbest day of my life\u201d interview afterwards.

We started out with plenty of promise, but here we are in December, via a devastating injury crisis, in a relegation fight. The Carabao Cup defeat to Burton Albion set the tone and the team just haven\u2019t defended well against long balls played over the top. <strong>3/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>Jefferson Lerma, Aaron Ramsdale and on-loan Harry Wilson have impressed. Unfortunately, three players in good form isn\u2019t enough to win games. The goalkeeping has been the biggest positive: Ramsdale has been outstanding. Less impressive have been Philip Billing, Dominic Solanke and Ryan Fraser: they need to give Callum Wilson service and they just haven\u2019t been creating. We\u2019ve always been among the top scorers but the attacking players are struggling now.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>Howe\u2019s been making a few poor choices. Fans don\u2019t understand why Simon Francis is getting games when his best years are behind him. Eddie has been unlucky \u2013 Lloyd Kelly injured before the start of the season, and David Brooks out until March \u2013 but the performances still haven\u2019t been good enough. He\u2019s pulled us out of stickier situations before, though, and we trust him to do it again. <strong>5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019? </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/14/chelsea-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge</a> just tops our win at Southampton. Waiting for the VAR goal decision was nervy \u2013 but highly enjoyable when it went our way.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Peter Bell </strong><a href=\"https://afcbchimes.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\">AFCBchimes.blogspot.co.uk</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cherrychimes?lang=en\" title=\"\">@cherrychimes</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba7110948e0734458e9c4e7c417b5d329fe58ea3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba7110948e0734458e9c4e7c417b5d329fe58ea3/221_362_3548_2129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Wilson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Wilson (right): impressing fans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Brighton</h2> <p>A solid first half of the season. We\u2019re not winning enough, even though we\u2019re so often the better team, but our new style is utterly convincing and we\u2019re confident the results will come. We\u2019ve just got to be patient. After 17 games last season we had one point more, but this term we\u2019ve already met four of the top six away, and we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/16/crystal-palace-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">played Palace off the park</a> last time out. Just wish Zaha was on our team, not theirs. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops</strong> Our midfield of Aaron Mooy \u2013 he gets everywhere \u2013 Davy Pr\u00f6pper and Dale Stephens has been excellent, as have most of our summer signings: Trossard, Maupay and Webster. And Pascal Gross is thriving on our more positive approach. Flops are \u00a35m Florin Andone, \u00a315m J\u00fcrgen Locadia (both have gone out on loan) and \u00a317m Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who will go on loan next month.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>Yes. Graham Potter has got us playing expansive, fun and exuberant football. He has instilled confidence in the players and the transformation has been staggering. We\u2019re the Bar\u00e7a of the south coast. We achieved so much under Chris Hughton, but played to a tighter system. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019? </strong>Given that totally unwarranted equaliser at Selhurst Park, I\u2019ll go for a combined moment: beating the north London clubs: Tottenham at home, and Arsenal and Watford away.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Steph Fincham</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7293a77c96f22b35f55a86c59c0631041025ac1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7293a77c96f22b35f55a86c59c0631041025ac1d/121_204_3148_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Mooy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Mooy: gets everywhere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Burnley</h2> <p>It\u2019s been mixed. One real positive has been keeping six clean sheets, and we\u2019ve had some good performances \u2013 but we seem further away than ever from getting to grips with the big clubs. We\u2019ve had some big defeats against them, none more so than conceding five at Tottenham. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>It\u2019s always a team game with Burnley and that makes it hard to single people out. That said, the Ashley Barnes/Chris Wood partnership up front is special: they\u2019ve continued where they left off last season and have already bagged 13 in the league between them. The emergence of Dwight McNeil has been a delight to watch. He\u2019s started all but one of our league games since last Christmas. There\u2019s nothing better than seeing one of your young players come through to establish his place. As for negatives \u2013 some players have struggled, but I wouldn\u2019t label any of them flops.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>I fail to see how anyone can be anything but happy with a manager who has taken us into the Premier League twice and is now overseeing a fourth consecutive season there. That\u2019s remarkable for a club like ours and the one fear we have is someone snatching him from us. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019? </strong>That massively enjoyable week back in April when we beat Bournemouth and Cardiff to just about confirm our place in the top flight for this season.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Tony Scholes </strong><a href=\"http://www.uptheclarets.com/\" title=\"\">UpTheClarets.com</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/utcdotcom\" title=\"\">@UTCdotcom</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea20584292eb1435c1aaa365687ad454614b68fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea20584292eb1435c1aaa365687ad454614b68fd/58_51_990_594/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Dyche\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean Dyche: still doing it for Burnley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Chelsea</h2> <p>Fourth place, last 16 of the Champions League, academy players established in the starting XI \u2013 it\u2019s been a cracking start to a new chapter. Yes, we\u2019ve had a mini-slump lately but it\u2019s a big learning curve. We all need to hang on tight through this period, but there\u2019s plenty to be pleased about. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops? </strong>Tammy Abraham has proved wrong all those who doubted his Premier League quality; Mason Mount has been excellent \u2013 green at times, but that\u2019s to be expected; and Mateo Kovacic has been a revelation to me. He\u2019s started to hit the net, too, which is a much-needed bonus. Reece James has been superb when he\u2019s started and he\u2019ll make the right-back spot his own. As for the biggest flop: it has to be anyone who\u2019s been picked to play at left\u2011back. Azpilicueta, Alonso and Emerson have all been woeful at times.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>Very happy. He\u2019s made mistakes, still isn\u2019t on top of our defensive issues and seems a bit naive at times, but he\u2019s new at this level. Unless we want to go back to a new manager every other season then we need to back him. His honesty in post-match interviews, win or lose, is refreshing. It\u2019ll be very interesting to see who comes in to the squad in the next two windows, and how much input Lampard has in that process. <strong>7.5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019? </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/23/ajax-chelsea-champions-league-match-report\">Ajax away</a>. Low expectations before the game, but we took it to them. Just brilliant.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Paul Baker </strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/premier-league-best-and-worst-so-far-part-one\" title=\"\">In memory of Trizia Fiorellino</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc5b8822e7aee59ad0c7acf117354b472ee22201\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc5b8822e7aee59ad0c7acf117354b472ee22201/0_77_3793_2276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mason Mount\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mason Mount: big impact.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Crystal Palace</h2> <p>To be in the top 10 in the run-up to Christmas is a great achievement for a small squad. We gambled on having only one senior left- and right-back in the squad, and that\u2019s come off the rails with the injuries in recent weeks, but we\u2019ve kept on picking up results. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/manchester-united-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Wins at Manchester United</a> and West Ham, and beating Bournemouth at home despite having 10 men for most of the match have been the highlights. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>Vicente Guaita has been superb between the sticks \u2013 a model of brilliant consistency. Wilfried Zaha has grown into the campaign, Gary Cahill slotted in seamlessly, Martin Kelly has been good all season, and Jordan Ayew has surprised everyone with his goals, dribbling, and energy. Max Meyer hasn\u2019t established himself as fans expected him to, though made a big impact off the bench against Brighton, and it\u2019s impossible to judge Victor Camarasa, as Roy Hodgson just hasn\u2019t played him.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>Given the squad at his disposal, Roy has had a superb season. He\u2019s even begun to make more positive substitutions. He\u2019s spoken a lot about the need to strengthen in January if we are to compete for a top-10 finish and he deserves the chance to do so. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019? </strong>In the final game of last season, Bournemouth fans were relentlessly baiting Zaha whenever he was near them. It made him so angry he promptly dribbled the entire length of the field to cross for Andros Townsend to finish.

Yes, we\u2019ve been unlucky with a catastrophic injury list, but Marco Silva and the players were appalling. There\u2019s a long-term stench of mediocrity around Goodison, with board and owners (past and present) having been prepared to accept second best for way too long. <strong>3/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>There have been few obvious stars. Calvert-Lewin has grown in stature although isn\u2019t proven as a natural scorer just yet. Mina has looked more comfortable and Holgate has proved adaptable. But Richarlison is the only player to deliver fully so far: he\u2019s our outstanding player. Iwobi, meanwhile, needs to play as a No 10 otherwise he looks a poor buy. The rest have continually failed to show up.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>Silva (<strong>2/10</strong>) seemed a genuine guy and hard working, but was just hopelessly out of his depth in terms of his ability to focus players, instil passion and impose tactics and game management. Duncan Ferguson (<strong>6.5/10</strong>) gave us a welcome shot of passion, and reverted to a tried and tested 4-4-2, but was never a long-term fix due to his lack of experience. After that adrenaline rush we needed a cool head and some nous. Maybe Carlo Ancelotti can bring us that.</p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019? </strong>Two moments from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/everton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">the Chelsea game</a>: Duncan embracing the ballboy, and footage of the owner, chairman and CEO failing to clap in synchrony.

I\u2019d have snapped your hand off for a top-six place at the beginning of August and now we\u2019re the only realistic challengers to Liverpool in the title race, if there is a title race to be had. On top of that we\u2019re in a cup semi\u2011final, too. So it\u2019s a very solid <strong>10/10</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Stars/flops</strong> Ricardo Pereira really doesn\u2019t get the praise he deserves: he\u2019s comfortably the best right-back in the Premier League. Jamie Vardy is putting his 2015\u201116 form to shame, with 16 goals going into this weekend, and Wilfred Ndidi has made N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 look amateurish. On the flipside, Ayoze P\u00e9rez has had a frustrating start to his City career since he signed from Newcastle in July \u2013 he\u2019s got quality but is really lacking consistency so far.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>Fans have adopted Wham\u2019s festive classic, singing about giving their heart to Brendan Rodgers this Christmas. But even that doesn\u2019t feel like enough, somehow. <strong>10/10</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Moment of 2019? </strong>Every single time opposing fans have sung about Rebekah Vardy, Jamie has avenged his wife with a goal.

      "bodyText": "Arsenal Oh for a return to the gloom of being bored by top-four finishes and regular trophies. It\u2019s not just all those fans who filed out at half-time against Man City who are far too entitled: it seems that from top to bottom our club is populated by working stiffs who expect to be rewarded for showing up. Under the ownership of our absentee landlord the heart of our club has been eviscerated, replaced by an infectious apathy. It\u2019s not just the poor results in our worst start to a season since the 70s, it\u2019s the pitiful lack of spirit. 2/10 Stars/flops The unbridled enthusiasm of Gabby Martinelli has been just about the only highlight. Sadly the rest seem to have adopted the same uncommitted attitudes of David Luiz and Xhaka. Happy with the manager? I\u2019m really not sure if Mikel Arteta is capable of commanding the levels of fear and respect needed to turn this sinking ship round. More\u2019s the point, after Emery\u2019s failure, I\u2019m not sure if the suits who appointed Unai are suitable custodians of our club. I can\u2019t ever envisage them appointing the sort of confrontational character we really need, for fear of rocking the business boat. 5/10 Favourite moment of 2019? In a year where there\u2019s been a dearth of gloating opportunities, seeing the former Gunner Serge Gnabry bag a four-goal haul in Spurs\u2019 2-7 humiliation against Bayern at White Hart Lane was special. \u2022 Bernard Azulay GoonersDiary.co.uk @GoonerN5 Aston Villa It\u2019s been as tough as expected. Some wonderful moments, but what we\u2019ve seen has just confirmed that 17th would be a great outcome. Villa Park has been vibrant but the next few games are seminal. A poor Christmas could make it a sleepless early 2020, a good one would have us dreaming about cup finals. We\u2019ll see. By the way, you get treated much worse as an away fan in the Premier League than in the Championship: no pubs for miles let you in and the \u201csecond class citizen\u201d vibe is real. 7/10 Stars/flops Grealish has been superb, adding goals to his general wizardry. The only concern now is that we\u2019re too reliant on him: if he gets injured we\u2019re down. El Ghazi has exceeded hopes and McGinn started well but has been overplayed and has faded. I\u2019m not in the \u201cWesley is useless\u201d camp \u2013 he\u2019s barely had a decent pass in a month. Mings is clearly a great bloke but his England debut went to his head. Grealish beware. Happy with the manager? 8/10. You gotta have faith. The last few weeks have been tough but we have to remember he is inexperienced. I\u2019d follow him over a cliff but if we have a bad next six games he\u2019s going to be under pressure. I\u2019d definitely let him loose with the January chequebook, though. Moment of 2019? By a mile, Jack Grealish\u2019s winner at St Andrew\u2019s last March, and his \u201cbest day of my life\u201d interview afterwards. The lad is a legend, living out most Brummies\u2019 dreams. \u2022 Jonathan Pritchard Bournemouth We\u2019ve been, at best, mediocre. We started out with plenty of promise, but here we are in December, via a devastating injury crisis, in a relegation fight. The Carabao Cup defeat to Burton Albion set the tone and the team just haven\u2019t defended well against long balls played over the top. 3/10 Stars/flops Jefferson Lerma, Aaron Ramsdale and on-loan Harry Wilson have impressed. Unfortunately, three players in good form isn\u2019t enough to win games. The goalkeeping has been the biggest positive: Ramsdale has been outstanding. Less impressive have been Philip Billing, Dominic Solanke and Ryan Fraser: they need to give Callum Wilson service and they just haven\u2019t been creating. We\u2019ve always been among the top scorers but the attacking players are struggling now. Happy with the manager? Howe\u2019s been making a few poor choices. Fans don\u2019t understand why Simon Francis is getting games when his best years are behind him. Eddie has been unlucky \u2013 Lloyd Kelly injured before the start of the season, and David Brooks out until March \u2013 but the performances still haven\u2019t been good enough. He\u2019s pulled us out of stickier situations before, though, and we trust him to do it again. 5/10 Moment of 2019? Beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge just tops our win at Southampton. Waiting for the VAR goal decision was nervy \u2013 but highly enjoyable when it went our way. \u2022 Peter Bell AFCBchimes.blogspot.co.uk @cherrychimes Brighton A solid first half of the season. We\u2019re not winning enough, even though we\u2019re so often the better team, but our new style is utterly convincing and we\u2019re confident the results will come. We\u2019ve just got to be patient. After 17 games last season we had one point more, but this term we\u2019ve already met four of the top six away, and we played Palace off the park last time out. Just wish Zaha was on our team, not theirs. 7/10 Stars/flops Our midfield of Aaron Mooy \u2013 he gets everywhere \u2013 Davy Pr\u00f6pper and Dale Stephens has been excellent, as have most of our summer signings: Trossard, Maupay and Webster. And Pascal Gross is thriving on our more positive approach. Flops are \u00a35m Florin Andone, \u00a315m J\u00fcrgen Locadia (both have gone out on loan) and \u00a317m Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who will go on loan next month. Happy with the manager? Yes. Graham Potter has got us playing expansive, fun and exuberant football. He has instilled confidence in the players and the transformation has been staggering. We\u2019re the Bar\u00e7a of the south coast. We achieved so much under Chris Hughton, but played to a tighter system. 8/10 Moment of 2019? Given that totally unwarranted equaliser at Selhurst Park, I\u2019ll go for a combined moment: beating the north London clubs: Tottenham at home, and Arsenal and Watford away. \u2022 Steph Fincham Burnley It\u2019s been mixed. One real positive has been keeping six clean sheets, and we\u2019ve had some good performances \u2013 but we seem further away than ever from getting to grips with the big clubs. We\u2019ve had some big defeats against them, none more so than conceding five at Tottenham. 7/10 Stars/flops It\u2019s always a team game with Burnley and that makes it hard to single people out. That said, the Ashley Barnes/Chris Wood partnership up front is special: they\u2019ve continued where they left off last season and have already bagged 13 in the league between them. The emergence of Dwight McNeil has been a delight to watch. He\u2019s started all but one of our league games since last Christmas. There\u2019s nothing better than seeing one of your young players come through to establish his place. As for negatives \u2013 some players have struggled, but I wouldn\u2019t label any of them flops. Happy with the manager? I fail to see how anyone can be anything but happy with a manager who has taken us into the Premier League twice and is now overseeing a fourth consecutive season there. That\u2019s remarkable for a club like ours and the one fear we have is someone snatching him from us. 8/10 Moment of 2019? That massively enjoyable week back in April when we beat Bournemouth and Cardiff to just about confirm our place in the top flight for this season. \u2022 Tony Scholes UpTheClarets.com @UTCdotcom Chelsea Fourth place, last 16 of the Champions League, academy players established in the starting XI \u2013 it\u2019s been a cracking start to a new chapter. Yes, we\u2019ve had a mini-slump lately but it\u2019s a big learning curve. We all need to hang on tight through this period, but there\u2019s plenty to be pleased about. 8/10 Stars/flops? Tammy Abraham has proved wrong all those who doubted his Premier League quality; Mason Mount has been excellent \u2013 green at times, but that\u2019s to be expected; and Mateo Kovacic has been a revelation to me. He\u2019s started to hit the net, too, which is a much-needed bonus. Reece James has been superb when he\u2019s started and he\u2019ll make the right-back spot his own. As for the biggest flop: it has to be anyone who\u2019s been picked to play at left\u2011back. Azpilicueta, Alonso and Emerson have all been woeful at times. Happy with the manager? Very happy. He\u2019s made mistakes, still isn\u2019t on top of our defensive issues and seems a bit naive at times, but he\u2019s new at this level. Unless we want to go back to a new manager every other season then we need to back him. His honesty in post-match interviews, win or lose, is refreshing. It\u2019ll be very interesting to see who comes in to the squad in the next two windows, and how much input Lampard has in that process. 7.5/10 Moment of 2019? Ajax away. Low expectations before the game, but we took it to them. Just brilliant. \u2022 Paul Baker In memory of Trizia Fiorellino Crystal Palace To be in the top 10 in the run-up to Christmas is a great achievement for a small squad. We gambled on having only one senior left- and right-back in the squad, and that\u2019s come off the rails with the injuries in recent weeks, but we\u2019ve kept on picking up results. Wins at Manchester United and West Ham, and beating Bournemouth at home despite having 10 men for most of the match have been the highlights. 7/10 Stars/flops Vicente Guaita has been superb between the sticks \u2013 a model of brilliant consistency. Wilfried Zaha has grown into the campaign, Gary Cahill slotted in seamlessly, Martin Kelly has been good all season, and Jordan Ayew has surprised everyone with his goals, dribbling, and energy. Max Meyer hasn\u2019t established himself as fans expected him to, though made a big impact off the bench against Brighton, and it\u2019s impossible to judge Victor Camarasa, as Roy Hodgson just hasn\u2019t played him. Happy with the manager? Given the squad at his disposal, Roy has had a superb season. He\u2019s even begun to make more positive substitutions. He\u2019s spoken a lot about the need to strengthen in January if we are to compete for a top-10 finish and he deserves the chance to do so. 8/10 Moment of 2019? In the final game of last season, Bournemouth fans were relentlessly baiting Zaha whenever he was near them. It made him so angry he promptly dribbled the entire length of the field to cross for Andros Townsend to finish. Perfect. \u2022 Chris Waters PalaceTrust.org.uk @Clapham_Grand Everton What a disaster. Yes, we\u2019ve been unlucky with a catastrophic injury list, but Marco Silva and the players were appalling. There\u2019s a long-term stench of mediocrity around Goodison, with board and owners (past and present) having been prepared to accept second best for way too long. 3/10 Stars/flops There have been few obvious stars. Calvert-Lewin has grown in stature although isn\u2019t proven as a natural scorer just yet. Mina has looked more comfortable and Holgate has proved adaptable. But Richarlison is the only player to deliver fully so far: he\u2019s our outstanding player. Iwobi, meanwhile, needs to play as a No 10 otherwise he looks a poor buy. The rest have continually failed to show up. Happy with the manager? Silva (2/10) seemed a genuine guy and hard working, but was just hopelessly out of his depth in terms of his ability to focus players, instil passion and impose tactics and game management. Duncan Ferguson (6.5/10) gave us a welcome shot of passion, and reverted to a tried and tested 4-4-2, but was never a long-term fix due to his lack of experience. After that adrenaline rush we needed a cool head and some nous. Maybe Carlo Ancelotti can bring us that. Moment of 2019? Two moments from the Chelsea game: Duncan embracing the ballboy, and footage of the owner, chairman and CEO failing to clap in synchrony. Everton in a nutshell. \u2022 The esk TheEsk.org @theesk Leicester We\u2019re more than happy. I\u2019d have snapped your hand off for a top-six place at the beginning of August and now we\u2019re the only realistic challengers to Liverpool in the title race, if there is a title race to be had. On top of that we\u2019re in a cup semi\u2011final, too. So it\u2019s a very solid 10/10. Stars/flops Ricardo Pereira really doesn\u2019t get the praise he deserves: he\u2019s comfortably the best right-back in the Premier League. Jamie Vardy is putting his 2015\u201116 form to shame, with 16 goals going into this weekend, and Wilfred Ndidi has made N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 look amateurish. On the flipside, Ayoze P\u00e9rez has had a frustrating start to his City career since he signed from Newcastle in July \u2013 he\u2019s got quality but is really lacking consistency so far. Happy with the manager? Fans have adopted Wham\u2019s festive classic, singing about giving their heart to Brendan Rodgers this Christmas. But even that doesn\u2019t feel like enough, somehow. 10/10. Moment of 2019? Every single time opposing fans have sung about Rebekah Vardy, Jamie has avenged his wife with a goal. Honestly, it\u2019s like clockwork. Beautiful, hilarious, poetic clockwork. \u2022 Chris Whiting clippings.me/chriswhiting / @ChrisRWhiting Liverpool 9.5/10. We\u2019ve won every league game apart from one \u2013 a draw at Old Trafford \u2013 and are top by a distance with a game in hand. We negotiated a tricky start to the Champions League to finish top of the group and head back to Madrid in February. We\u2019ve got a few injuries in defence, which is worrying, but even with Henderson as centre-back, in for Van Dijk, we still managed to win. Stars/flops The star has to be VAR \u2013 that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re top, right? Other than that, the whole team, but if I have to single anyone out, Man\u00e9 has been phenomenal.

Oh and VAR, a truly dreadful introduction to the game. Happy with the manager? Completely, and thrilled he\u2019s signed an extension to stay for years to come. Entertaining on the touchline, too: see his set-to with Monterrey\u2019s Antonio Mohamed. 10/10 Moment of 2019? Winning the Champions League in Madrid. Followed by the triumphant bus tour around Liverpool the following day that saw Klopp on the swally being looked after by 19-year-old Rhian Brewster as he almost fell off the top deck. \u2022 Steph Jones \u2022 Part two: Manchester City to Wolves",

      "body": "<p>In a hard-to-find studio in north London,<strong> </strong>there is a small encounter between two big names. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dave\" title=\"\">Dave</a> arrives first.

Dave is cool and quiet, shaking everyone\u2019s hand before taking himself off with his phone until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/marcus-rashford\" title=\"\">Marcus Rashford</a> appears.</p> <p>Rashford is a little late. Understandable, perhaps: it was Manchester United\u2019s Christmas party last night, and he\u2019s recently played vital, hard-fought games <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/04/manchester-united-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Tottenham</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">and City</a>. But, despite being only 22, United and England\u2019s young forward isn\u2019t known for partying, and when he arrives he\u2019s fresh and relaxed. Slighter than you might expect, and taller, he\u2019s not flash, though his jeans have diamante sprinkled across the rips. He and Dave are months apart in age, but Rashford has a younger, less wary air. When he smiles, he looks like a kid.</p> <p>Dave is a huge United fan and Rashford likes his rap and grime, but at first both stick to their small entourages, check their clothes, worry about the photos. There is discussion of trainers: both have brought a brand new pair to wear. Dave\u2019s are orange Air Max; Rashford\u2019s classic white Air Force 1s. They are both naturally shy, you realise, and deliberately low-key in the manner of those for whom fame is a side product of their job. Why attract attention when you get so much in everyday life?</p> <p>Rashford is coming up to the toughest part of his season. \u201cDecember is hard,\u201d he says, calmly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two matches this week.\u201d Dave is not in work mode. Supposedly he went straight into the studio after winning his Mercury prize, but at the moment he\u2019s happy to be out and about. And very happy to talk football. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do my entire life when I\u2019m not doing music,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I\u2019m in a hotel room in Sweden, or on a plane to Vancouver, I\u2019m watching football. I\u2019ll try to talk about other stuff, too, but football is a lifestyle.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Marcus Rashford </strong>What year were you born \u2013 97?</p> <p><strong>Dave</strong> 98.

One of my brothers has a friend called Meena and if he was at my house seeing my brother, I was playing Fifa and they\u2019d just rap all day. So I was around music.</p> <p>When did you start rapping?</p> <p><strong>D </strong>When I was 14. It didn\u2019t go well. I remember putting out a video and it got 41 views in the first day. And I\u2019m going into class, and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cRah, this is mad, I\u2019m fucked, I only got 41 views.\u201d But the positive of it was, \u201cAll right, I only got 41 views, so no one\u2019s seen it.\u201d Unfortunately, 30 of the 41 views must\u2019ve been my classmates. So I could not live it down.</p> <p>There was a sort of chain in school. I wasn\u2019t, like, mad at the top, but I wasn\u2019t right at the bottom, either. I was a laughing stock. Walking past girls, they\u2019re whispering, they\u2019re laughing. You\u2019re thinking, \u201cNah, I want to disappear, I never want to feel like this again.\u201d I remember thinking, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m retiring.\u201d</p> <p>Remember <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/music/2018/11/kaylum-dennis-interview\" title=\"\">Ka</a><a href=\"https://www.complex.com/music/2018/11/kaylum-dennis-interview\" title=\"\">ylum Dennis</a> [the award-winning music video director]?</p> <p><strong>MR </strong>Yeah.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black people excel in music and football because talent is undeniable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"3a480cdd2e636d5219f6db85937e06b3dfe0c89e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a480cdd2e636d5219f6db85937e06b3dfe0c89e/617_883_766_766/500.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of rapper Dave\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"3a480cdd2e636d5219f6db85937e06b3dfe0c89e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a480cdd2e636d5219f6db85937e06b3dfe0c89e/2226_788_766_766/500.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of footballer Marcus Rashford\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>D</strong> Kaylum filmed it and I remember the video cost \u00a340. That was everything I had. At 14, to amass \u00a340! I was getting \u00a32 a day for dinner money. The pasta in school was \u00a31.60. I used to spend 50p to buy Skittles every morning, because I never had breakfast. So I\u2019d always be 10p short for the pasta. Anyway, I remember thinking, \u201cAll right, cool, I\u2019m going to miss dinners, put everything into this video\u201d, and then that happened. So I retired.</p> <p><strong>MR</strong> I\u2019ve never picked up a mic \u2013 football was the focus. But the link between music and football is interesting for me, the two go hand in hand. We\u2019d never play football without one of my friends bringing a speaker. </p> <p>Your upbringing definitely affects what music you like. A lot of people I know can relate to musicians because when they were younger they had nothing, same as me.</p> <p><strong>D </strong>Music and football are two industries where black people excel, because talent is undeniable. You can\u2019t deny an amazing voice. You can\u2019t deny amazing athletic prowess. Physically, it\u2019s evident. But in other industries, circumstance is more of a thing. Where you grew up, where you studied, the opportunities you got, where you\u2019ve done work experience. When you\u2019re talking about sport and entertainment at the highest level, you\u2019re talking about an industry that grosses billions every year on a very select few people\u2019s talent.</p> <p>With music there are a lot of people who have lyrics, who are doing their thing, but the percentage at the top tier is so, so, so few. What certain people can do with a football, no one else in the world could do. If I tried now and dedicated my life to getting a master\u2019s or something academically, it could take me 10, 15 years. I could do it. But only the tiniest per cent, like 0.0001% of people, could do something as simple as sprinting down a pitch and maintaining the composure to bring the ball down. The margins! If you don\u2019t put enough length on a pass, that\u2019s the difference between three points, one point \u2013 that\u2019s your season. Certain things are just bonkers.</p> <p><strong>MR</strong> For me, football brings people together. Where I grew up, I know the whole community from playing football in the park. I have the same friends from when I was six, seven years old. If some of my friends weren\u2019t at the park, then they would have probably been getting into trouble. Football definitely helps communities, and you want to spread that message. Because I think sometimes people get caught up in, \u201cOh, <em>he\u2019s</em> made it, <em>he</em> didn\u2019t make it.\u201d I don\u2019t like to discuss that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of people I know can relate to musicians because when they were younger they had nothing, same as me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>D </strong>How do you feel when you walk on to the pitch?</p> <p><strong>MR</strong> It\u2019s about expressing myself, doing things that I do naturally, that I might not be able to [do anywhere else] any more. If I wanted to go to the park now and play football, I\u2019m going to be there the whole day talking to people. But when you step over the white lines to play a match, you\u2019re free to do what you love. What you know.</p> <p><strong>D </strong>Can you hear everything and everyone around you, or is it on mute?</p> <p><strong>MR </strong>At first, when I played, it was mad. I remember looking at a section of the crowd and I must have seen about 10 or 15 people I knew. That\u2019s when it hit me, in the first game, and I was like, \u201cWow, this is a bit weird \u2013 he lives there, he lives there, my mum lives five minutes away from him.\u201d These things are going through my head. I needed to block it out and just focus on the game, and that\u2019s what I did. And in that first game, honestly, I didn\u2019t feel any fatigue, I was just running about on the pitch. When you lose yourself in the game, you always play your best football. You can hear the noise, you can feel the energy, but... Something\u2019s there, but it\u2019s not there. That\u2019s the best way to approach it.</p> <p><strong>D </strong>Is it different at home games?</p> <p><strong>MR</strong> At home, if it\u2019s positive energy, it drives you through your games. Your legs might not be there, but those games can be your best games, and it\u2019s just because of the fans. If you played with no fans, there\u2019s no way you\u2019d be able to play 55, 60 games in a season. It\u2019s not possible.</p> <p><strong>D </strong>When I\u2019m performing, the crowd just disappears, it\u2019s like everyone merges \u2013 one big person. You just say the words and people will say the words back to you. And it\u2019s just so rehearsed. I have a lot of songs I couldn\u2019t forget the words if I tried. So you get in there, you lose yourself and it\u2019s all good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e7802708391160e3e35137acae6129b4fd632f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e7802708391160e3e35137acae6129b4fd632f7/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dave, rapper (on left), with Marcus Rashford, footballer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>MR </strong>So you don\u2019t feel pressure?</p> <p><strong>D </strong>Where I feel pressure in performance is when I\u2019m being filmed and I\u2019ve got to play and rap \u2013 I know if I drop a chord, I\u2019ve dropped a song. If I\u2019m playing a song on piano, if I miss a note I have to go back, because certain scales only make sense when you have the note before. So I have to bring the lyrics back. So everyone knows, yeah, he\u2019s messed up.</p> <p>I did <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/08/776801538/dave-tiny-desk-concert?t=1576088039505\" title=\"\">NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk</a>, this performance in America to a few people, and it\u2019s the most nervous I\u2019ve felt, because I can see the people who are judging me. When things are up close and personal, then you start to feel the pressure.</p> <p><strong>MR</strong> No teammates to help.</p> <p><strong>D </strong>Yeah. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Because I know, if it\u2019s a great show, it\u2019s on me.</p> <p>How are you with your social media?</p> <p><strong>MR </strong>There\u2019s too much negativity. For me, you should only use your social channels to better the things around you. The rest of the time, I don\u2019t look at it. If you go on Twitter, you\u2019re going to see something bad, something good. You just don\u2019t really need it.</p> <p><strong>D </strong>I have to use it, because everything that I do is through social media. If I upload a video, I have to tell you: this video is up. I\u2019m performing on stage here, blah blah blah. Certain times I\u2019ll come off.</p> <p>I remember there was a period where I woke up and I saw something negative about myself on my social media every day for 91 days. And it doesn\u2019t have to be mad negative \u2013 the smallest thing can ever so slightly change your day. But once you start to believe in yourself, you can start to tune everything out. Things affect you less. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same with footballers. I just know that, in the industry I\u2019m in, I\u2019m a trier. There\u2019s people in the world that try, and there\u2019s the people in the world that talk about the people that try.</p> <p>[The conversation moves on to fame, and when each of them realised they had it.]</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no team-mates in rap. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Because I know, if it\u2019s a great show, it\u2019s on me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>MR </strong>Everything changed after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/28/manchester-united-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the Arsenal game</a> [Rashford scored twice against them in his first Premier League match in 2016]. Me and my friends used to always go to this thing called Soccer Dome to play five-a-side, and to get to it, you have to go through the Trafford Centre. I was just going to do that, and we were stuck for an hour, me and my friends, 18-year-old kids and just swarms of people. Now, I just don\u2019t put myself in that situation. For example, say I need to go and get milk, my friend will have to go for me. If I go to the shop, a two-minute job can turn into 20 minutes. It\u2019s weird. But it\u2019s part and parcel of it, and it helps you grow up. You have to grow up fast.</p> <p><strong>D </strong>Yeah, fast. For me, I think it was after Drake remixed my track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbZ0OXmXw38\" title=\"\">Wanna Know</a>. Though people still don\u2019t know my face. You can\u2019t watch football without seeing someone, but you can listen to music without seeing someone. I think Top Boy really changed that. When I was on tour in America, people would say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re that actor!\u201d Those two moments I felt a massive change.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, though, what you said about daily activities, how long they can become. Those are things I would still try to do. My manager\u2019s always saying to me, \u201cWhy are you in Selfridges all the time?\u201d I don\u2019t even like shopping. But it\u2019s the transaction of getting out of my car, walking and seeing people I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s important, even if it does take a long time, and even if you do have to smile and take a picture in this weird, awkward place, it\u2019s important.</p> <p>I try to be outside often. When there were hard times and things were dark, when there were a lot of people I\u2019d fallen out with, I was out every day, feeling the love, and sometimes the hate. When I walk around in LA, I\u2019m less than nothing, and that is an invaluable feeling. It reminds you of the scale of what it is you\u2019re trying to do.</p> <p><strong>MR</strong> Manchester\u2019s very, very small. I have quite a big family. I have two brothers, two sisters. So more often than not, somebody I\u2019m speaking to knows my mum, or my nana, or my brother, or my brother\u2019s friend, so everyone\u2019s connected. Everyone\u2019s family. But it\u2019s the only place I can feel normal. If I didn\u2019t go back to where I grew up and do normal stuff, see the same guy that used to serve me sweets when I was a kid, go and see my friend\u2019s mum and dad, if I didn\u2019t do those things, I\u2019d be sat in my house.</p> <p>[The conversation turns to the difference between a hobby and a talent.]</p> <p><strong>MR </strong>I think there\u2019s a difference. It\u2019s difficult, but you have to find what it is you\u2019re talented at. I like to play basketball and stuff like that, but I\u2019m not talented \u2013 it\u2019s just a hobby. Do your hobby, enjoy it \u2013 but put your hard work and time into your talent.</p> <p><strong>D </strong>I agree. I\u2019ve played football my entire life, and I\u2019m not a bad player, but it\u2019s not moving me and my mum out of Streatham in this lifetime. But there was a point where Juss, who\u2019s always with me and raps, and a few friends turned around and said: rap is something you\u2019re good at. My friends helped me find that. But you gotta work mad hard at it.</p> <p>I remember being in college and girls would say: \u201cOh, he\u2019s cool, but he doesn\u2019t make the music that I would listen to, you wouldn\u2019t hear him in a club.\u201d It\u2019s not my strongest point, singing or melody or rapping upbeat, uptempo, I\u2019m not some crazy, hype, off-the-wall, flashy type of guy. But I learned quickly that collaboration and putting yourself out of your comfort zone, that\u2019s the stuff that takes you further. Like going on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4jpQMUScUk\" title=\"\">Headie One\u2019s track</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOslx4hKwZk\" title=\"\">J Hus</a>. You have to really push yourself. </p> <p><strong>MR </strong>Yes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"198dd6962615b91ba89ad50e0427590150eeedf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/198dd6962615b91ba89ad50e0427590150eeedf0/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dave, rapper (on left), with Marcus Rashford, footballer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>D</strong> I rate you so highly, not just in terms of football, but because I can see you take it seriously. I can look to you and say, \u201cWow, this is someone who\u2019s got an opportunity and he\u2019s running with it. He\u2019s not coasting, he\u2019s really going hard.\u201d I love footballers \u2013 I see them out at a show or on holiday. But Marcus, I don\u2019t see you anywhere. And that\u2019s in itself a way of life.</p> <p><strong>MR</strong> Well, as a player, you have to take yourself out of the emotion. It\u2019s natural, if you\u2019re a fan: if the team wins, they must have done well; if they lose, they\u2019ve done something wrong. But once you get caught up in that, as a player, you\u2019re finished. It\u2019s too up-and-down. You have to have a middle. If you win, it doesn\u2019t mean you go crazy until the next game. If you lose, it doesn\u2019t mean you sit moping. You have to find a balance, and you always go back to what you know.</p> <p><strong>D </strong>So you don\u2019t go mad when you lose?</p> <p><strong>MR </strong>In the past, when we lost games and other players were just getting on with their day, I couldn\u2019t get my head around it. Some people don\u2019t have that connection I have with the club. That\u2019s fine, they still give 100%. But it\u2019s different for me. I\u2019m a fan, I went to matches. And then probably eight months ago, things started to click. I\u2019d got stuck in that up-and-down phase for too long. And it\u2019s no good, cos you\u2019re going to training the next day and if you\u2019re still thinking about the day before, you can\u2019t do your best. The games are a chance to showcase it, but the development\u2019s done on the training pitch.</p> <p>[The conversation turns to last week\u2019s election.]</p> <p><strong>D </strong>Yeah, I\u2019m going to vote.</p> <p><strong>MR </strong>Yeah, 100%. Which way? Well, if I can see the campaign\u2019s vision \u2013 not what they want to achieve next year, but what they plan to achieve in the long term, then for me, that\u2019s what I invest in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Seeing Ronaldo when I was young did a lot for me. You can have that much impact, even on someone who doesn't play sports</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>D </strong>When I look at politics, I think that everything is all just words. People say, \u201cOh, the problem that you have in your life is because of this person, so we\u2019re going to take this person away, and your problem\u2019s going to go.\u201d It\u2019s about division, coming up to an election. And I think, as a person, what type of person could I sit in a room with? Ninety-nine per cent of politicians I probably couldn\u2019t sit in a room with. If I feel like there\u2019s someone I can relate to, then that\u2019s the person I\u2019m going to side with. </p> <p>Over the last three years, I feel like evil had a chance for the first time, overtly, not just in this country, but worldwide. People voted for some really dark, crazy stuff. So this might just be the world we live in. All you can do is try to make the world a better place.</p> <p>This might sound random, but seeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ronaldo\" title=\"\">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> when I was young, that did a lot for me. I used to watch Ronaldo videos every night before I went to sleep. Skills, compilations, shots, left-foot goals, all of this stuff. My life for a long time, even though it was nothing to do with football, was based around him. You can have that much impact, on someone who doesn\u2019t even play sports.</p> <p><strong>MR </strong>I\u2019m sort of the same but with music: I need people to give me messages. There\u2019s only certain people I can listen to leading up to games. I can\u2019t listen to hype music because if I go on to the pitch pumped up with raw emotion, I\u2019m going to get a red card. I listen to the same group of people. You, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy\" title=\"\">Stormzy</a>. People who are spreading messages with the words.</p> <p>On the speaker, in the changing room, before a game, it\u2019s pure hype music playing. I just sit down with my headphones. I need to be clear-minded on the pitch, because as a forward player you might not see the ball the whole game, just that one time. And the game could be 0-0. Now imagine it\u2019s the Champions League final or the World Cup final\u2026</p> <p><strong>D </strong>Is it more pressure being a striker than a midfielder?</p> <p><strong>MR </strong>You need a different mentality. I made my debut at 18. The beginning of that season was my first year as a striker, ever in my life. Before that I couldn\u2019t understand how somebody can enjoy a game of football without touching a ball. Where you could have one chance and that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve always been a person who needs the ball \u2013 I need to express myself and make things happen.</p> <p>Then all of a sudden, a coach I liked changed my mindset. Then six months later, I made my debut with the first team. The bit I needed to work on was switching the mindset. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve improved on a lot, but I\u2019m still so far off where I can be. Everyone can say I scored a few goals and I\u2019m in good form \u2013 but it\u2019s nothing to what I can achieve.</p> <p><strong>D </strong>This new generation of footballers, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been this expressive. The kids \u2013 I saw flair in everyone. So much competition, so much talent, and they\u2019re all from similar age groups. This is an amazing time to be an English footballer.</p> <p><strong>MR </strong>The first time I was ever nervous was England under-16s against Ireland away. I was taking kick-off and my knee was shaking, and this had never happened before. I didn\u2019t play as well as I could have. Since then, the word pressure has changed for me. I see it as an opportunity. At the end of the day, if you take a penalty, the keeper can save it. I could have a perfect penalty, and the keeper could just save it: it\u2019s out of my control. In football you can\u2019t always control the outcome or results \u2013 it\u2019s a team sport, and anything can happen at any moment. </p> <p>Why this generation is good is because that\u2019s what everyone\u2019s mindset is like. There are so many young players nobody knows right now, ready to come on to the scene. I\u2019m trying to get them to understand how talented they are. Then if you work hard at it, don\u2019t put a limit on how good you can become. Because England can definitely win something. We already know that, on our day, we can beat any team in the world \u2013 but we want to get to the level of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/13/football-world-cup-2014-germany-win-final-mario-goetze\" title=\"\">Germany was </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/13/football-world-cup-2014-germany-win-final-mario-goetze\" title=\"\">in 2014</a>, and Spain for many years - that consistency. If we don\u2019t win something with England, at the end of my career, I\u2019d feel like something went wrong somewhere.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a hard-to-find studio in north London, there is a small encounter between two big names. Dave arrives first. The south London rapper, 21, moved into the mainstream this year, winning the Mercury prize with his first album, Psychodrama, and making an explosive acting debut in Netflix\u2019s Top Boy, as the thoroughly terrifying Modie. His sellout tour and Glastonbury show made news, too: remember the viral footage of the bucket-hatted kid who joined him on stage to rap on Thiago Silva (11m views)? Dave is cool and quiet, shaking everyone\u2019s hand before taking himself off with his phone until Marcus Rashford appears. Rashford is a little late. Understandable, perhaps: it was Manchester United\u2019s Christmas party last night, and he\u2019s recently played vital, hard-fought games against Tottenham and City. But, despite being only 22, United and England\u2019s young forward isn\u2019t known for partying, and when he arrives he\u2019s fresh and relaxed. Slighter than you might expect, and taller, he\u2019s not flash, though his jeans have diamante sprinkled across the rips. He and Dave are months apart in age, but Rashford has a younger, less wary air. When he smiles, he looks like a kid. Dave is a huge United fan and Rashford likes his rap and grime, but at first both stick to their small entourages, check their clothes, worry about the photos. There is discussion of trainers: both have brought a brand new pair to wear. Dave\u2019s are orange Air Max; Rashford\u2019s classic white Air Force 1s. They are both naturally shy, you realise, and deliberately low-key in the manner of those for whom fame is a side product of their job. Why attract attention when you get so much in everyday life? Rashford is coming up to the toughest part of his season. \u201cDecember is hard,\u201d he says, calmly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two matches this week.\u201d Dave is not in work mode. Supposedly he went straight into the studio after winning his Mercury prize, but at the moment he\u2019s happy to be out and about. And very happy to talk football. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do my entire life when I\u2019m not doing music,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I\u2019m in a hotel room in Sweden, or on a plane to Vancouver, I\u2019m watching football. I\u2019ll try to talk about other stuff, too, but football is a lifestyle.\u201d Marcus Rashford What year were you born \u2013 97? Dave 98. What were the big tunes at school that you can remember? MR Everyone was into Drake, Tinchy Stryder, Kano. D But Kano felt like he was more primary school than secondary school. I feel like 13 and 14 was Krept and Konan, Yungen and Cashtastic\u2026 I remember the dances, too. Do you dance? MR Nah, I don\u2019t dance. When I was younger, I was either playing football, or when I was listening to music I was always on my bike. On my earphones. D I don\u2019t dance, either. I remember people jerking and doing the Dougie \u2013 that was some American dance, the Dougie. Moving like you have a migraine. Your hands up here by your head. That was a real thing at school. MR There were a lot of underground artists I listened to. One of my brothers has a friend called Meena and if he was at my house seeing my brother, I was playing Fifa and they\u2019d just rap all day. So I was around music. When did you start rapping? D When I was 14. It didn\u2019t go well. I remember putting out a video and it got 41 views in the first day. And I\u2019m going into class, and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cRah, this is mad, I\u2019m fucked, I only got 41 views.\u201d But the positive of it was, \u201cAll right, I only got 41 views, so no one\u2019s seen it.\u201d Unfortunately, 30 of the 41 views must\u2019ve been my classmates. So I could not live it down. There was a sort of chain in school. I wasn\u2019t, like, mad at the top, but I wasn\u2019t right at the bottom, either. I was a laughing stock. Walking past girls, they\u2019re whispering, they\u2019re laughing. You\u2019re thinking, \u201cNah, I want to disappear, I never want to feel like this again.\u201d I remember thinking, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m retiring.\u201d Remember Kaylum Dennis [the award-winning music video director]? MR Yeah. D Kaylum filmed it and I remember the video cost \u00a340. That was everything I had. At 14, to amass \u00a340! I was getting \u00a32 a day for dinner money. The pasta in school was \u00a31.60. I used to spend 50p to buy Skittles every morning, because I never had breakfast. So I\u2019d always be 10p short for the pasta. Anyway, I remember thinking, \u201cAll right, cool, I\u2019m going to miss dinners, put everything into this video\u201d, and then that happened. So I retired. MR I\u2019ve never picked up a mic \u2013 football was the focus. But the link between music and football is interesting for me, the two go hand in hand. We\u2019d never play football without one of my friends bringing a speaker. Your upbringing definitely affects what music you like. A lot of people I know can relate to musicians because when they were younger they had nothing, same as me. D Music and football are two industries where black people excel, because talent is undeniable. You can\u2019t deny an amazing voice. You can\u2019t deny amazing athletic prowess. Physically, it\u2019s evident. But in other industries, circumstance is more of a thing. Where you grew up, where you studied, the opportunities you got, where you\u2019ve done work experience. When you\u2019re talking about sport and entertainment at the highest level, you\u2019re talking about an industry that grosses billions every year on a very select few people\u2019s talent. With music there are a lot of people who have lyrics, who are doing their thing, but the percentage at the top tier is so, so, so few. What certain people can do with a football, no one else in the world could do. If I tried now and dedicated my life to getting a master\u2019s or something academically, it could take me 10, 15 years. I could do it. But only the tiniest per cent, like 0.0001% of people, could do something as simple as sprinting down a pitch and maintaining the composure to bring the ball down. The margins! If you don\u2019t put enough length on a pass, that\u2019s the difference between three points, one point \u2013 that\u2019s your season. Certain things are just bonkers. MR For me, football brings people together. Where I grew up, I know the whole community from playing football in the park. I have the same friends from when I was six, seven years old. If some of my friends weren\u2019t at the park, then they would have probably been getting into trouble. Football definitely helps communities, and you want to spread that message. Because I think sometimes people get caught up in, \u201cOh, he\u2019s made it, he didn\u2019t make it.\u201d I don\u2019t like to discuss that. D How do you feel when you walk on to the pitch? MR It\u2019s about expressing myself, doing things that I do naturally, that I might not be able to [do anywhere else] any more. If I wanted to go to the park now and play football, I\u2019m going to be there the whole day talking to people. But when you step over the white lines to play a match, you\u2019re free to do what you love. What you know. D Can you hear everything and everyone around you, or is it on mute? MR At first, when I played, it was mad. I remember looking at a section of the crowd and I must have seen about 10 or 15 people I knew. That\u2019s when it hit me, in the first game, and I was like, \u201cWow, this is a bit weird \u2013 he lives there, he lives there, my mum lives five minutes away from him.\u201d These things are going through my head. I needed to block it out and just focus on the game, and that\u2019s what I did. And in that first game, honestly, I didn\u2019t feel any fatigue, I was just running about on the pitch. When you lose yourself in the game, you always play your best football. You can hear the noise, you can feel the energy, but... Something\u2019s there, but it\u2019s not there. That\u2019s the best way to approach it. D Is it different at home games? MR At home, if it\u2019s positive energy, it drives you through your games. Your legs might not be there, but those games can be your best games, and it\u2019s just because of the fans. If you played with no fans, there\u2019s no way you\u2019d be able to play 55, 60 games in a season. It\u2019s not possible. D When I\u2019m performing, the crowd just disappears, it\u2019s like everyone merges \u2013 one big person. You just say the words and people will say the words back to you. And it\u2019s just so rehearsed. I have a lot of songs I couldn\u2019t forget the words if I tried. So you get in there, you lose yourself and it\u2019s all good. MR So you don\u2019t feel pressure? D Where I feel pressure in performance is when I\u2019m being filmed and I\u2019ve got to play and rap \u2013 I know if I drop a chord, I\u2019ve dropped a song. If I\u2019m playing a song on piano, if I miss a note I have to go back, because certain scales only make sense when you have the note before. So I have to bring the lyrics back. So everyone knows, yeah, he\u2019s messed up. I did NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk, this performance in America to a few people, and it\u2019s the most nervous I\u2019ve felt, because I can see the people who are judging me. When things are up close and personal, then you start to feel the pressure. MR No teammates to help. D Yeah. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Because I know, if it\u2019s a great show, it\u2019s on me. How are you with your social media? MR There\u2019s too much negativity. For me, you should only use your social channels to better the things around you. The rest of the time, I don\u2019t look at it. If you go on Twitter, you\u2019re going to see something bad, something good. You just don\u2019t really need it. D I have to use it, because everything that I do is through social media. If I upload a video, I have to tell you: this video is up. I\u2019m performing on stage here, blah blah blah. Certain times I\u2019ll come off. I remember there was a period where I woke up and I saw something negative about myself on my social media every day for 91 days. And it doesn\u2019t have to be mad negative \u2013 the smallest thing can ever so slightly change your day. But once you start to believe in yourself, you can start to tune everything out. Things affect you less. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same with footballers. I just know that, in the industry I\u2019m in, I\u2019m a trier. There\u2019s people in the world that try, and there\u2019s the people in the world that talk about the people that try. [The conversation moves on to fame, and when each of them realised they had it.] MR Everything changed after the Arsenal game [Rashford scored twice against them in his first Premier League match in 2016]. Me and my friends used to always go to this thing called Soccer Dome to play five-a-side, and to get to it, you have to go through the Trafford Centre. I was just going to do that, and we were stuck for an hour, me and my friends, 18-year-old kids and just swarms of people. Now, I just don\u2019t put myself in that situation. For example, say I need to go and get milk, my friend will have to go for me. If I go to the shop, a two-minute job can turn into 20 minutes. It\u2019s weird. But it\u2019s part and parcel of it, and it helps you grow up. You have to grow up fast. D Yeah, fast. For me, I think it was after Drake remixed my track Wanna Know. Though people still don\u2019t know my face. You can\u2019t watch football without seeing someone, but you can listen to music without seeing someone. I think Top Boy really changed that. When I was on tour in America, people would say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re that actor!\u201d Those two moments I felt a massive change. It\u2019s funny, though, what you said about daily activities, how long they can become. Those are things I would still try to do. My manager\u2019s always saying to me, \u201cWhy are you in Selfridges all the time?\u201d I don\u2019t even like shopping. But it\u2019s the transaction of getting out of my car, walking and seeing people I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s important, even if it does take a long time, and even if you do have to smile and take a picture in this weird, awkward place, it\u2019s important. I try to be outside often. When there were hard times and things were dark, when there were a lot of people I\u2019d fallen out with, I was out every day, feeling the love, and sometimes the hate. When I walk around in LA, I\u2019m less than nothing, and that is an invaluable feeling. It reminds you of the scale of what it is you\u2019re trying to do. MR Manchester\u2019s very, very small. I have quite a big family. I have two brothers, two sisters. So more often than not, somebody I\u2019m speaking to knows my mum, or my nana, or my brother, or my brother\u2019s friend, so everyone\u2019s connected. Everyone\u2019s family. But it\u2019s the only place I can feel normal. If I didn\u2019t go back to where I grew up and do normal stuff, see the same guy that used to serve me sweets when I was a kid, go and see my friend\u2019s mum and dad, if I didn\u2019t do those things, I\u2019d be sat in my house. [The conversation turns to the difference between a hobby and a talent.] MR I think there\u2019s a difference. It\u2019s difficult, but you have to find what it is you\u2019re talented at. I like to play basketball and stuff like that, but I\u2019m not talented \u2013 it\u2019s just a hobby. Do your hobby, enjoy it \u2013 but put your hard work and time into your talent. D I agree. I\u2019ve played football my entire life, and I\u2019m not a bad player, but it\u2019s not moving me and my mum out of Streatham in this lifetime. But there was a point where Juss, who\u2019s always with me and raps, and a few friends turned around and said: rap is something you\u2019re good at. My friends helped me find that. But you gotta work mad hard at it. I remember being in college and girls would say: \u201cOh, he\u2019s cool, but he doesn\u2019t make the music that I would listen to, you wouldn\u2019t hear him in a club.\u201d It\u2019s not my strongest point, singing or melody or rapping upbeat, uptempo, I\u2019m not some crazy, hype, off-the-wall, flashy type of guy. But I learned quickly that collaboration and putting yourself out of your comfort zone, that\u2019s the stuff that takes you further. Like going on Headie One\u2019s track, or J Hus. You have to really push yourself. MR Yes. D I rate you so highly, not just in terms of football, but because I can see you take it seriously. I can look to you and say, \u201cWow, this is someone who\u2019s got an opportunity and he\u2019s running with it. He\u2019s not coasting, he\u2019s really going hard.\u201d I love footballers \u2013 I see them out at a show or on holiday. But Marcus, I don\u2019t see you anywhere. And that\u2019s in itself a way of life. MR Well, as a player, you have to take yourself out of the emotion. It\u2019s natural, if you\u2019re a fan: if the team wins, they must have done well; if they lose, they\u2019ve done something wrong. But once you get caught up in that, as a player, you\u2019re finished. It\u2019s too up-and-down. You have to have a middle. If you win, it doesn\u2019t mean you go crazy until the next game. If you lose, it doesn\u2019t mean you sit moping. You have to find a balance, and you always go back to what you know. D So you don\u2019t go mad when you lose? MR In the past, when we lost games and other players were just getting on with their day, I couldn\u2019t get my head around it. Some people don\u2019t have that connection I have with the club. That\u2019s fine, they still give 100%. But it\u2019s different for me. I\u2019m a fan, I went to matches. And then probably eight months ago, things started to click. I\u2019d got stuck in that up-and-down phase for too long. And it\u2019s no good, cos you\u2019re going to training the next day and if you\u2019re still thinking about the day before, you can\u2019t do your best. The games are a chance to showcase it, but the development\u2019s done on the training pitch. [The conversation turns to last week\u2019s election.] D Yeah, I\u2019m going to vote. MR Yeah, 100%. Which way? Well, if I can see the campaign\u2019s vision \u2013 not what they want to achieve next year, but what they plan to achieve in the long term, then for me, that\u2019s what I invest in. D When I look at politics, I think that everything is all just words. People say, \u201cOh, the problem that you have in your life is because of this person, so we\u2019re going to take this person away, and your problem\u2019s going to go.\u201d It\u2019s about division, coming up to an election. And I think, as a person, what type of person could I sit in a room with? Ninety-nine per cent of politicians I probably couldn\u2019t sit in a room with. If I feel like there\u2019s someone I can relate to, then that\u2019s the person I\u2019m going to side with. Over the last three years, I feel like evil had a chance for the first time, overtly, not just in this country, but worldwide. People voted for some really dark, crazy stuff. So this might just be the world we live in. All you can do is try to make the world a better place. This might sound random, but seeing Cristiano Ronaldo when I was young, that did a lot for me. I used to watch Ronaldo videos every night before I went to sleep. Skills, compilations, shots, left-foot goals, all of this stuff. My life for a long time, even though it was nothing to do with football, was based around him. You can have that much impact, on someone who doesn\u2019t even play sports. MR I\u2019m sort of the same but with music: I need people to give me messages. There\u2019s only certain people I can listen to leading up to games. I can\u2019t listen to hype music because if I go on to the pitch pumped up with raw emotion, I\u2019m going to get a red card. I listen to the same group of people. You, Stormzy. People who are spreading messages with the words. On the speaker, in the changing room, before a game, it\u2019s pure hype music playing. I just sit down with my headphones. I need to be clear-minded on the pitch, because as a forward player you might not see the ball the whole game, just that one time. And the game could be 0-0. Now imagine it\u2019s the Champions League final or the World Cup final\u2026 D Is it more pressure being a striker than a midfielder? MR You need a different mentality. I made my debut at 18. The beginning of that season was my first year as a striker, ever in my life. Before that I couldn\u2019t understand how somebody can enjoy a game of football without touching a ball. Where you could have one chance and that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve always been a person who needs the ball \u2013 I need to express myself and make things happen. Then all of a sudden, a coach I liked changed my mindset. Then six months later, I made my debut with the first team. The bit I needed to work on was switching the mindset. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve improved on a lot, but I\u2019m still so far off where I can be. Everyone can say I scored a few goals and I\u2019m in good form \u2013 but it\u2019s nothing to what I can achieve. D This new generation of footballers, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been this expressive. The kids \u2013 I saw flair in everyone. So much competition, so much talent, and they\u2019re all from similar age groups. This is an amazing time to be an English footballer. MR The first time I was ever nervous was England under-16s against Ireland away. I was taking kick-off and my knee was shaking, and this had never happened before. I didn\u2019t play as well as I could have. Since then, the word pressure has changed for me. I see it as an opportunity. At the end of the day, if you take a penalty, the keeper can save it. I could have a perfect penalty, and the keeper could just save it: it\u2019s out of my control. In football you can\u2019t always control the outcome or results \u2013 it\u2019s a team sport, and anything can happen at any moment. Why this generation is good is because that\u2019s what everyone\u2019s mindset is like. There are so many young players nobody knows right now, ready to come on to the scene. I\u2019m trying to get them to understand how talented they are. Then if you work hard at it, don\u2019t put a limit on how good you can become. Because England can definitely win something. We already know that, on our day, we can beat any team in the world \u2013 but we want to get to the level of what Germany was in 2014, and Spain for many years - that consistency. If we don\u2019t win something with England, at the end of my career, I\u2019d feel like something went wrong somewhere. \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "bodyText": "Last week, a whistle rang out in a buzzing conference fairground on the edge of Madrid. Instantly, a swell of protesters rose up, determined to \u201cbring in the streets and tear down the walls\u201d, enraged that the annual UN climate talks had wound to a grinding deadlock. Two days from a close, the talks had not yet produced a single line of text. Instead, while Sydney burned, Australia used an \u201caccounting loophole\u201d to cover for its poor climate record. Do politicians even live on the same planet? The conference of the parties (COP) brings thousands of states, NGOs and observers together for two weeks each year to decide what is to be done about the climate crisis. In 2015, most countries signed the Paris accord that aims to keep global warming \u201cwell under\u201d 2C \u2013 and to do all they can to limit this temperature increase to 1.5C. It\u2019s 2019. We\u2019re already at 1.1C. The world of COP is divided on economic and geographic faultlines. On one side is the global south, which lacks the resources to pick itself up after every new disaster brought on by the climate crisis; at the same time, dissent there is violently quelled. On the other lie northern countries such as the UK, which announced \u201cnet-zero by 2050\u201d plans, by which time many current politicians will not be alive and mega-cities such as Mumbai will be under water. On both sides of the divide, pro-fossil fuel leaders on the right have come to power. This COP pointed to deepening fissures in old blocs, as real-time climate risks widened the rift. Small island nations with the most to lose voiced opposition to countries such as India, Brazil and China being in favour of carbon trading to offset the emissions of the global north and to count towards their own. Tuvalu, with two of its nine islands at risk of going under, called out the US for blocking loss and damage finance, saying it could amount to \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d. To achieve the 1.5C limit, countries have to increase their commitments five-fold, starting in 2020, said a new UNEP Emissions Gap report released for Madrid. At COP25, this year\u2019s gathering, rich countries said they wanted more ambition, but also a clean slate. \u201cThis throws all history in the garbage, it\u2019s acting as if emissions started today,\u201d said Palestinian ambassador Ammar Hijazi, who chairs the G77 and China group. \u201cWhen some countries emit without accountability at any level, it undermines the world order at every level.\u201d I sat and fiddled with my earpiece, listening in horror as rainforest-clearing Brazil tried (and failed) to delete references to science around the relationship between climate change, land use and oceans. Through the night of last-ditch negotiations, I wandered the halls of this after-dark world, surveying the snacks that non-profits had stockpiled to see them through. Broken activists and diplomats curled up on recycled-wood armchairs and fuzzy rugs at the Ikea-sponsored UN pavilion for the night.

Alternatively, if you\u2019re a family that bonds over superheroes, they have an ample supply of Marvel spectaculars, Black Panther included. Stream them there \u2013 along with such Disney perennials as Beauty and the Beast \u2013 before the imminent Disney+ service has Christmas all wrapped up next year. Speaking of new streaming services, if you\u2019ve splashed out on a BritBox subscription, your chief reward is their \u201cBritmas\u201d collection: a veritable archive of Christmas specials from the telly vaults, from Absolutely Fabulous to Downton Abbey to Nigel Slater. On the classic films front, Now TV is also at your service if your Christmas isn\u2019t complete without an annual viewing of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street: the latter perhaps slightly under-celebrated outside the US, and still rich in hot-chocolate comforts. Another option is Lawrence of Arabia, whose immersive, size-does-matter grandeur will hold much of the family quietly rapt for an afternoon. If you\u2019re after quirkier Christmas viewing, the BFI Player offers the delirious Finnish Father Christmas horror adventure Rare Exports. Save it for when the pre-teens are in bed, but everyone else can enjoy its perverse twist on Lapland lore. Amazon Prime, meanwhile, has more to offer Christmas than free overnight delivery. If a Lord of the Rings streaming marathon is your idea of holiday comfort, it\u2019s the place to go. They also have the modest but likably cheery Feast of the Seven Fishes, a 1980s-set Christmas Eve romcom set within the Italian-American rust belt community. It skipped cinemas, but it\u2019s worthwhile for the deep-fried food porn alone. And finally, if kids and extended family are out of the picture, Amazon Prime has the best option for holiday spent snuggled with a significant other. If you ask me, in just four years, Todd Haynes\u2019s ravishing, snow-coated love story Carol has staked a convincing claim as the greatest Christmas film of all time \u2013 but if not, certainly the most romantic. Also new on DVD and streaming Dirty God (Modern Films, 15) Perhaps not optimum holiday viewing, but a very fine film, Newcomer Vicky Knight is shattering in Sacha Polak\u2019s candid, compassionate study of a young burns victim reasserting her identity in hostile environs. Never Look Away (Modern Films, 15) This Oscar-nominated three-hour saga based loosely on the life of artist Gerhard Richter poses as a return to form for The Lives of Others director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck: it\u2019s handsome and intelligent, but a wee bit turgid. Dilili in Paris (Prime Video) The latest from veteran French animator Michel Ocelot bypassed cinemas and DVD, but is worth a stream for animation buffs. Its mix of traditional techniques with 3D rendering fascinates even when its slender story \u2013 a kidnapping plot in belle \u00e9poque Paris \u2013 palls.",

Guy Pearce is Ebenezer Scrooge, a chillingly recognisable picture of a soul ingrained with meanness and cruelty. Andy Serkis is one of the admonishing spirits, with Stephen Graham as the avenging ghost of Marley. Viewers expecting a cosy Yuletide story could be in for a shock. <br><em>Sunday 22 December, 9pm, BBC One</em></p> <p><strong>Susan Hill\u2019s Ghost Story</strong><br>Shetland star Douglas Henshall leads this feature-length contemporary chiller adapted from Hill\u2019s unnerving bestseller The Small Hand.

Ben Miles is John Profumo, Emilia Fox plays his wife Valerie, and James Norton is sociable osteopath Stephen Ward in a still highly relevant story about a certain class of people who believe society\u2019s rules do not apply to them. Amanda Coe, who wrote the Bafta-winning Room at the Top, scripts it across six instalments. <br><em>Sunday 29 December, 9pm, BBC One</em></p> <p><strong>Doctor Who<br></strong>There is no Christmas Day special in 2019, but the first day of 2020 brings back Jodie Whittaker and the gang.

CM Pennington-Richards\u2019s snowy, atmospheric photography is superb \u2013 and beware the ghostly visitation of Michael Hordern\u2019s chain-clanking, shrieking Jacob Marley. A real gothic horror.<br><em>Saturday 21 December, 3.10pm, Channel 5</em></p> <p><strong>Mary Queen of Scots<br></strong>A gorgeous-looking slice of historical drama from director Josie Rourke. Saoirse Ronan is young Mary Stuart, returning to Scotland in 1561 and posing a threat to her cousin, Margot Robbie\u2019s Queen Elizabeth. The two are rivals, but also united as powerful women in a world of unscrupulous men. <br><em>Sunday 22 December, 11.15am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere</em></p> <p><strong>Toy Story 2</strong><br>This sequel surpasses even the great original: astronaut Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) takes on the heroic rescue of Woody the cowboy (Tom Hanks) from an unscrupulous collector in an inspired blend of high excitement, matchless animation and touching relationships, with a screenplay making fun of Star Wars and Jurassic Park. <br><em>Monday 23 December, 1.25pm, BBC One</em></p> <p><strong>Brave<br></strong>The fiery Princess Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) is a female Braveheart in Pixar\u2019s medieval mock fairytale. In the Highlands, she is outraged to learn that her parents (Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson) want to marry her off; so away she stomps, in search of an alternative to the traditional fate of fairytale princesses. <br><em>Monday 23 December, 2.55pm, BBC One</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78b5bb7eb33a3aac19a91dc3f148b20dfecb7696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78b5bb7eb33a3aac19a91dc3f148b20dfecb7696/1356_191_2004_2504/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gemma Arterton in Tamara Drewe\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gemma Arterton in Tamara Drewe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Mountain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tamara Drewe<br></strong>A touching adaptation of Posy Simmonds\u2019s cartoon strip that spatchcocks middle-class country life. Gemma Arterton is Tamara, who returns to her native West Country village with an ambition to write a chicklit epic. There, she stirs the passions of ex Andy (Luke Evans), pop star Ben (Dominic Cooper) and slimy philanderer Nicholas (Roger Allam). <br><em>Christmas Eve, 1.15am, BBC Two</em></p> <p><strong>The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part</strong><br>Eek! The Lego town of Bricksburg, ominously renamed Apocalypseburg, has been invaded by smiley-but-menacing Duplo figures from outer space. Ever-so-nice hero Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) has to get macho to lead the resistance, in a sequel that\u2019s full of self-referential jokes, soulful monologues and earwormy songs. <br><em>Christmas Eve, 11.45am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere</em></p> <p><strong>Elf</strong><br>Will Ferrell is full of festive cheer as the elf who learns he\u2019s not really one of Santa\u2019s little helpers \u2013 he\u2019s 6ft tall and human, and has a very Scroogey dad (James Caan) in New York. There\u2019s computer-animated trickery and warm support from the likes of Bob Newhart, Edward Asner and Zooey Deschanel \u2013 but it\u2019s Ferrell who parcels out the fun. <br><em>Christmas Eve, 5.15pm, ITV</em></p> <p><strong>Mary Poppins Returns<br></strong>The Banks children \u2013 Ben Whishaw\u2019s Michael; Emily Mortimer\u2019s Jane \u2013 are all grown up, but with Michael now a widowed father of three and in danger of losing the family home. Who should blow in one windy day but magic nanny Mary, now prettily played by Emily Blunt in Rob Marshall\u2019s deft, enchanting sequel. It\u2019s a big spoonful of pure joy. <br><em>Christmas Day, 7.30am, 8pm, 4.20am, Sky Cinema Premiere</em></p> <p><strong>Finding Dory<br></strong>Another animated undersea search for a lost fish? This sequel is pretty much a rerun of Finding Nemo, but it is done with such vibrant beauty and soppy charm that it can easily be forgiven. Here, the amnesiac Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) sets out on a quest to find her family, while chums Nemo and Marlin in turn go looking for her. <br><em>Christmas Day, 3.10pm, BBC One</em></p> <p><strong>The Others<br></strong>A distinctly chilly and unsettling horror story, this. Much of the credit goes to Nicole Kidman for her controlled performance as Grace, who lives a prison-like existence in a gothic Jersey mansion with her two children as they await the return of the father (Christopher Eccleston) from war. <br><em>Christmas Day, 7pm, AMC from BT</em></p> <p><strong>Jurassic World</strong><br>Boasting an all-new cast of massive dinosaurs, this oversized upgrade rescued the franchise from extinction. The tourist crowds are flocking to the Jurassic World theme park \u2013 like lambs to the slaughter \u2013 when the genetically modified mega-raptor Indominus Rex starts running amok. Bryce Dallas Howard\u2019s park manager and Chris Pratt\u2019s dino-wrangler attempt to restore order in a fast, fun and thrilling carnivore caper. <br><em>Christmas Day, 8pm, ITV2</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0c06de2cb9a6e6d5300f558cc84c825dff33ab9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0c06de2cb9a6e6d5300f558cc84c825dff33ab9/225_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avengers: Endgame\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avengers: Endgame.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Avengers: Endgame<br></strong>Five years on from the events of Infinity War, the grieving Avengers reassemble for another tilt at Josh Brolin\u2019s all-powerful Thanos. Directors the Russo brothers juggle the whole pantheon of Marvel heroes, and stage a staggering final battle in an epic conclusion to the 22-film saga. Thrilling, poignant and fun \u2013 especially when Chris Hemsworth\u2019s Thor is on. <br><em>Boxing Day, 10.45am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere</em></p> <p><strong>Florence Foster Jenkins<br></strong>In 1940s New York, Florence Foster Jenkins won a certain affectionate notoriety as \u201cthe worst goddamn singer in the world\u201d \u2013 a socialite turned talentless diva who nevertheless attracted a faithful following. Meryl Streep is marvellous as Jenkins, and Hugh Grant matches her as devoted partner-cum-manager St Clair Bayfield, in Stephen Frears\u2019s note-perfect, poignantly funny biopic. <br><em>Boxing Day, 11pm, BBC Two</em></p> <p><strong>Skyfall<br></strong>This tip-top Bond pits Daniel Craig\u2019s 007 against rogue agent Silva, played entertainingly by Javier Bardem. There are spectacular stunts in Macau and Shanghai, but this is a staunchly British affair, set largely in London before an unusually sombre showdown at Skyfall \u2013 the Highlands pile of Bond\u2019s youth. <br><em>Boxing Day, 8.30pm, ITV</em></p> <p><strong>The Limehouse Golem</strong><br>Peter Ackroyd\u2019s Victorian novel gets a grisly, gripping screen treatment from director Juan Carlos Medina and screenwriter Jane Goldman. Bill Nighy plays detective John Kildare, who hunts a Ripper-like killer known as The Limehouse Golem, while trying to save murder suspect Lizzie (Olivia Cooke) from the gallows; a pleasingly grim, clever melodrama. <br><em>Friday 27 December, 9.30pm, BBC Two</em></p> <p><strong>Saving Mr Banks</strong><br>The origins of the film legend that is Mary Poppins, served with a big spoonful of sugar by director John Lee Hancock. Emma Thompson is the wonderfully crotchety PL Travers, protective author of the book that Tom Hanks\u2019s Walt Disney is desperate to bring to semi-animated cinematic life: it\u2019s a supercali\u2026 (etc) double act. <br><em>Sunday 29 December, 3pm, BBC Two</em></p> <p><strong>Bridesmaids<br></strong>Paul Feig\u2019s raucous, sometimes tender, comedy stars co-writer Kristen Wiig as the put-upon Annie, who is losing best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) to marriage and to her horrible rich new bestie Helen (Rose Byrne). Can she win her back as maid of honour at the wedding? There is pathos and charm here, but mainly laughs (particularly from Rebel Wilson\u2019s outrageous Brynn). <br><em>New Year\u2019s Eve, 9pm, ITV2</em></p> <p><strong>Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout</strong><br>It\u2019s the sixth time around for Tom Cruise\u2019s IMF agent Ethan Hunt, so heart-stopping motorbike and helicopter chases, crazy jumps from a tower block window/out of an airplane, and a brutal hand-to-hand battle in the gents could all seem a bit Mission: Everyday. Under the kinetic direction of Christopher McQuarrie, however, this is yet another breathlessly thrilling ride. <br><em>New Year\u2019s Day, 9pm, Channel 4</em></p> <p><em>PJH</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c8bd3adf4175efc9f21fe3f1b2f592e6801d08c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8bd3adf4175efc9f21fe3f1b2f592e6801d08c4/0_12_3307_1985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: The Adam Buxton podcast; Count Arthur Strong\u2019s Radio Show!

Gregg Wallace and Les Dennis are among the combatants. Thursday 19 December, 10pm, BBC Two In the Long Run Christmas Special The seasonal episode of Idris Elba\u2019s hearty 80s-set sitcom is suitably chaotic, with extended family arriving for a party and everyone trying to make a few extra notes for Christmas. Friday 20 December, 10pm, Sky One The Christmas Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan A festive travelogue shot in the Sahara may seem strange, until you recall how much Romesh hates the cold. He really hates it. But will the heat make him grumpier still? Sunday 22 December, 9pm, BBC Two John Mulaney and the Sack Lunch Bunch The droll US comedian promises to hark back to a previous era of variety shows in this \u201csurprisingly profound\u201d special. He also happily risks being outshone by his talented kid co-stars. From Christmas Eve, Netflix Cinderella: After Ever After A family-friendly Christmas special for those who don\u2019t like fairytale endings. Cinderella (Sian Gibson) thought Prince Charming (David Walliams) was her \u201chappily ever after\u201d. Now she\u2019s not so sure. Christmas Eve, 8pm, Sky One Gavin &amp; Stacey Christmas Special There is plenty occurring in Wales and Essex this Christmas, including elaborate karaoke by Smithy (James Corden), a kitchen disaster for Bryn (Rob Brydon) and a screaming match for the Sutcliffes (Julia Davis and Robert Wilfort). Christmas Day, 8.30pm, BBC One The Two Ronnies: The Unseen Sketches In 1986, Ronnies Corbett and Barker, who were huge in Australia, made a series there. With some scenes shot specially for that country\u2019s Channel Nine network, this has never been shown here \u2013 until now. Christmas Day, 9.30pm, Channel 5 Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys Christmas Special Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys pays tribute to the classic It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, as Agnes gets fed up with her Finglas family Christmas. Would it be better if she had never been born? Christmas Day, 10.30pm, BBC One Frankie Boyle\u2019s 2019 New World Order Consistently one of the BBC\u2019s most thoughtful political programmes, never mind comedies, Boyle\u2019s mix of woke debate and acid zingers won\u2019t be short of fuel in the aftermath of the election. Monday 30 December, 10pm, BBC Two Dame Edna Rules the Waves She lives! Emily Atack, Sharon Osbourne and Rob Rinder act as willing stooges as Barry Humphries wheels out the original and best \u201cbeing rude while dressed as an old lady\u201d comedy character, one more time. New Year\u2019s Eve, 9.05pm, BBC One Miranda: My Such Fun Celebration It has been a decade since this Fleabag-for-boomers first stumbled on to our screens. To mark the occasion, Miranda and pals are hosting a fun-filled reunion party at the London Palladium. New Year\u2019s Day, 5.45pm, BBC One A Year in the Life of a Year 2019 Rhys Thomas\u2019s stupidly edited roundup is reliably a hidden comedy gem of the holiday season: his spew of mash-ups and re-dubs always has at least five creasingly funny moments. New Year\u2019s Day, 11pm, BBC Two Drama A Christmas Carol Peaky Blinders writer Steven Knight gives Dickens\u2019s parable a pitch-dark psychological backstory and lashings of starkly unfestive language, in a confrontational three-part rendering. Guy Pearce is Ebenezer Scrooge, a chillingly recognisable picture of a soul ingrained with meanness and cruelty. Andy Serkis is one of the admonishing spirits, with Stephen Graham as the avenging ghost of Marley. Viewers expecting a cosy Yuletide story could be in for a shock. Sunday 22 December, 9pm, BBC One Susan Hill\u2019s Ghost Story Shetland star Douglas Henshall leads this feature-length contemporary chiller adapted from Hill\u2019s unnerving bestseller The Small Hand. He might wish he\u2019d stayed up north: his antique-books dealer Adam Snow experiences a pint-sized haunting that unlocks vexing memories. Boxing Day, 9pm, Channel 5 The Witcher Henry Cavill is granite of face and surprisingly dry of wit in a decent fantasy romp full of bloody fights and big fur capes. Cavill\u2019s mercenary monster-hunter is destined to protect an exiled princess. From Friday 20 December, Netflix His Dark Materials The TV version of Philip Pullman\u2019s books has struck a decent balance between chilly dread and childish heroics. In the finale, Lyra (the excellent Dafne Keen) has to face the theocratic Magisterium. Sunday 22 December, 8pm, BBC One The Tiger Who Came to Tea These animated adaptations of children\u2019s classics are a welcome addition to C4\u2019s telly traditions. Next up, it\u2019s Judith Kerr\u2019s beloved 1968 book, featuring the voices of Benedict Cumberbatch and David Oyelowo. Christmas Eve, 7.30pm, Channel 4 Martin\u2019s Close Mark Gatiss dramatises the MR James ghost story, casting Peter Capaldi as the defendant in a murder trial in 1684. An old creep stands accused of killing an innocent girl, but she\u2019s not completely gone \u2026 Christmas Eve, 10pm, BBC Four The Snail and the Whale Kids\u2019 author Julia Donaldson has a back catalogue as bountiful as Santa\u2019s sack.

Boxing Day, 6.20pm, BBC One Wisting The Beeb\u2019s winter Scandi import is an international sleuther, with Carrie-Anne Moss as an FBI agent chasing a US killer to Norway. Sven Nordin (Valkyrien) is Wisting, the local maverick detective. Saturday 28 December, 9pm, BBC Four The Trial of Christine Keeler Sophie Cookson leads a dramatisation of the Profumo scandal, as the woman the 1960s establishment wrongly thought they could control. Ben Miles is John Profumo, Emilia Fox plays his wife Valerie, and James Norton is sociable osteopath Stephen Ward in a still highly relevant story about a certain class of people who believe society\u2019s rules do not apply to them. Amanda Coe, who wrote the Bafta-winning Room at the Top, scripts it across six instalments. Sunday 29 December, 9pm, BBC One Doctor Who There is no Christmas Day special in 2019, but the first day of 2020 brings back Jodie Whittaker and the gang. Stephen Fry and Lenny Henry are the impressive guest stars in the opening adventure. New Year\u2019s Day, 6.55pm, BBC One Dracula Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, the co-creators of Sherlock, are sinking their teeth into another Victorian classic. Danish actor Claes Bang might just be a perfectly cast Count. New Year\u2019s Day, 9pm, BBC One Bancroft Sarah Parish returns for a second three-part run as a beloved but compromised top cop, whose current professional success is predicated on a pact with a cunning gang lord (Ryan McKen). Might a local double-murder bring the whole thing crashing down? New Year\u2019s Day, 9pm, ITV Messiah The trailer for this nominally twisty thriller posed a juicy question: might a charismatic leader popping up in global hotspots be the Second Coming? Within hours, IMDb detectives had figured out the answer before an episode had even aired. Probably not what Netflix had in mind. New Year\u2019s Day, Netflix The Deuce The third and final season of David \u201cThe Wire\u201d Simon\u2019s sex-trade epic picks up at the tail end of 1984, with straight-to-video booming and the Aids epidemic looming. Thursday 2 January, 10pm, Sky Atlantic Entertainment Christmas Quizzes At the year\u2019s end, there are brainteasers aplenty. Only Connect (from 30 Dec, 8pm, BBC Two) has four specials in which old champions triumphantly return, while Quizmaster (29 Dec, 6pm, ITV) pits winners of rival quizshows against each other. There are celeb versions of Mastermind (from 21 Dec, 6.05pm, BBC One) and University Challenge (from 23 Dec, 7.30pm, BBC Two), while Big Fat Quiz of the Year/Decade (Boxing Day &amp; 2 Jan, 9pm, Channel 4) doesn\u2019t mind what its famous people know, so long as they make Jimmy Carr whinny like a climaxing reindeer. Sports Personality of the Year To Aberdeen for the Beeb\u2019s annual gongs, where five nominees battle to see who comes second to Ben Stokes in the main public vote. Before that: tears, back-claps and bants. Sunday 15 December, 7pm, BBC One The Apprentice The finalists summon back old teammates for a last business pitch, and they will need all the help they can get. White beard aside, there\u2019s nothing jolly about Lord Sugar. Wednesday 18 December, 9pm, BBC One Robbie Williams: Radio 2 in Concert To celebrate Robbie\u2019s new stocking-targeted release \u2013 his first ever Christmas album, somehow \u2013 the cocksure national treasure takes to the BBC Radio Theatre stage to perform a selection box of festive hits, pop bangers, and to generally entertain, er, yule. Saturday 21 December, 10.25pm, BBC Two Celebrity Crystal Maze: Christmas Special A seasonal tour of presenter Richard Ayoade\u2019s jumbo escape room, where a grotto has sprouted in the Aztec Zone. Will a rather familiar-looking Santa assist Corrie\u2019s Catherine Tyldesley and her starry squad of Gareth Malone, Shirley Ballas, Nish Kumar and Scarlett Moffatt? Monday 23 December, 10pm, Channel 4 Gareth Malone\u2019s Christmas Concert If the traditional Carols From King\u2019s on BBC2 at 5pm has got you in the mood, recent Crystal Maze escapee Malone has even more trillings of comfort and joy as he rocks up at Watford General Hospital to stage a concert inspired by staff, patients and their families. Christmas Eve, 9pm, BBC Two Cruising at Christmas With Jane McDonald A previous seasonal special saw Jane haring down the Rhine, taking in some of the world\u2019s grandest Christmas markets along the way. Where will she go carolling this year?

They will be joined by the likes of AJ Tracey, Lewis Capaldi and Mabel, who\u2019s appearing for the third year running. But will any of them have bagged the coveted Christmas No 1? Christmas Day, 11.35am, BBC One Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special Debbie McGee, Chizzy Akudolu, Gemma Atkinson, Joe Sugg, Mark Wright and Richard Arnold re-sequin themselves for a one-off return. Expect a fine dusting of generous 10s from the judges. Christmas Day, 4.40pm, BBC One The Great Christmas Bake Off/Festive Bake Off The judges reconvene for two specials: one with contestants from 2017 and 2018, which should be good; the other with the cast of Derry Girls, which should be unmissable. Christmas Day, 7.10pm; New Year\u2019s Day, 7.40pm, Channel 4 Dolly Parton: Here I Am The queen of country has a podcast and a Netflix series, but this documentary gets us close to the real Dolly. Turns out she was there in her lyrics all along. Christmas Day, 8.30pm, BBC Two Jamie and Jimmy\u2019s Festive Feast Is Taron Egerton a rocket man, or does he prefer baby spinach?

Friday 27 December, 9pm, Channel 4 The Decade the Music Died We lost a heartbreaking number of singular artists in the 2010s, and while you could argue the likes of Chuck Berry, Leonard Cohen and Aretha Franklin had a good innings, it felt as if Bowie, Prince and Amy Winehouse were all gone too soon. This film salutes their lives and careers. Friday 27 December, 9pm, Sky Arts Gogglebox Festive Special If you find yourself beginning 2020 with the nagging feeling that you somehow missed the most noteworthy Christmas TV, Gogglebox has got you covered. This regurgitative special will see the sofa-bound arbiters pass snappy and snippy judgments on all the stuffed yuletide schedules. Friday 3 January, 9pm, Channel 4 Factual New Year\u2019s Eve TV People stay home on NYE for many reasons (sobriety, young kids, JOMO); can TV cater to this disparate mob? It certainly tries. Musos can opt for either Jools\u2019s Annual Hootenanny (11.15pm, BBC Two), which this year features Stormzy, La Roux and \u2013 still not giving us up \u2013 Rick Astley; or Craig David Rocks Big Ben Live (11.25pm, BBC One). Chat-hounds may prefer The Graham Norton Show (10.20pm, BBC One), which has Tom Hanks on the sofa, while those after a laugh can turn to The Last Leg of the Year (9pm, Channel 4). A Berry Royal Christmas Mary Berry joins the Duke Wills and Duchess Kate on a tour of their charities, culminating in a Berry-catered party to honour festive volunteers. Nadiya Hussain is invited, obviously. Monday 16 December, 8.30pm, BBC One A Merry Tudor Christmas With Lucy Worsley Christmas Tudor-style meant a month of fasting and prayer before the serious revelry kicked off on 25 December. Hands-on historian Lucy Worsley is up for trying it all. Friday 20 December, 9pm, BBC Two Hugh Grant: A Life on Screen Perhaps you hadn\u2019t noticed but Hugh Grant has staged a subtle comeback, now universally adored for his dazzling turns in Paddington 2 and A Very English Scandal. This celebration revisits his varied career with the likes of Richard Curtis, Sandra Bullock and the man himself. Monday 23 December, 10pm, BBC Two The Last Igloo Experience a day in the life of a Greenland Inuit hunter in this \u201cslow TV\u201d documentary. It makes for poignant viewing, since climate change has condemned this ancient way of life to extinction. Christmas Eve, 7pm, BBC Four Royal Institution Christmas Lectures A festive perennial as hardy as the conifer, the lecture series turns to the world of numbers, with mathematician Hannah Fry considering the sums that dictate life, helped by, among others, the maths guru behind Liverpool FC\u2019s winning run. From Boxing Day, 8pm, BBC Four World\u2019s Strongest Man Now in several episodes stretched between Christmas and New Year, a grand tradition: lie belly-down on the sofa and see swollen fellas heave heavy objects around. From Boxing Day, 8pm, Channel 5 Mystify: Michael Hutchence While unlikely to achieve the viral fame of last Christmas\u2019s daft Bros doc, this intimate portrait of the late INXS frontman features revealing interviews with friends, family and lovers (and Bono). It is followed by the concert film Live Baby Live, recorded at Wembley stadium in 1991. Saturday 28 December, 9.20pm, BBC Two The Repair Shop at Christmas Goodness, this show is lovely enough without it being Christmas as well. Craftspeople restore broken items that have huge sentimental value for their owners. Sunday 29 December, 7pm, BBC One EEJ, JS and GV Film Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again The enormous success of the original 2008 Abba-singalong came out of the Aegean blue, and now here we go again: this sequel is a five-star triumph. Cannily blending the young Donna\u2019s 1970s Greek island adventures with the present-day wedding problems of daughter Sophie, it\u2019s a sun-soaked delight. Saturday 21 December, 10am, Sky Cinema Musicals Scrooge: A Christmas Carol This 1951 adaptation is the warmest and also chilliest version of the Dickens tale, with Alastair Sim a Scrooge incarnate; his miserly humbuggery is a gloomy delight. CM Pennington-Richards\u2019s snowy, atmospheric photography is superb \u2013 and beware the ghostly visitation of Michael Hordern\u2019s chain-clanking, shrieking Jacob Marley. A real gothic horror. Saturday 21 December, 3.10pm, Channel 5 Mary Queen of Scots A gorgeous-looking slice of historical drama from director Josie Rourke. Saoirse Ronan is young Mary Stuart, returning to Scotland in 1561 and posing a threat to her cousin, Margot Robbie\u2019s Queen Elizabeth. The two are rivals, but also united as powerful women in a world of unscrupulous men. Sunday 22 December, 11.15am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere Toy Story 2 This sequel surpasses even the great original: astronaut Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) takes on the heroic rescue of Woody the cowboy (Tom Hanks) from an unscrupulous collector in an inspired blend of high excitement, matchless animation and touching relationships, with a screenplay making fun of Star Wars and Jurassic Park. Monday 23 December, 1.25pm, BBC One Brave The fiery Princess Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) is a female Braveheart in Pixar\u2019s medieval mock fairytale. In the Highlands, she is outraged to learn that her parents (Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson) want to marry her off; so away she stomps, in search of an alternative to the traditional fate of fairytale princesses. Monday 23 December, 2.55pm, BBC One Tamara Drewe A touching adaptation of Posy Simmonds\u2019s cartoon strip that spatchcocks middle-class country life. Gemma Arterton is Tamara, who returns to her native West Country village with an ambition to write a chicklit epic. There, she stirs the passions of ex Andy (Luke Evans), pop star Ben (Dominic Cooper) and slimy philanderer Nicholas (Roger Allam). Christmas Eve, 1.15am, BBC Two The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part Eek! The Lego town of Bricksburg, ominously renamed Apocalypseburg, has been invaded by smiley-but-menacing Duplo figures from outer space. Ever-so-nice hero Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) has to get macho to lead the resistance, in a sequel that\u2019s full of self-referential jokes, soulful monologues and earwormy songs. Christmas Eve, 11.45am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere Elf Will Ferrell is full of festive cheer as the elf who learns he\u2019s not really one of Santa\u2019s little helpers \u2013 he\u2019s 6ft tall and human, and has a very Scroogey dad (James Caan) in New York. There\u2019s computer-animated trickery and warm support from the likes of Bob Newhart, Edward Asner and Zooey Deschanel \u2013 but it\u2019s Ferrell who parcels out the fun. Christmas Eve, 5.15pm, ITV Mary Poppins Returns The Banks children \u2013 Ben Whishaw\u2019s Michael; Emily Mortimer\u2019s Jane \u2013 are all grown up, but with Michael now a widowed father of three and in danger of losing the family home. Who should blow in one windy day but magic nanny Mary, now prettily played by Emily Blunt in Rob Marshall\u2019s deft, enchanting sequel. It\u2019s a big spoonful of pure joy. Christmas Day, 7.30am, 8pm, 4.20am, Sky Cinema Premiere Finding Dory Another animated undersea search for a lost fish? This sequel is pretty much a rerun of Finding Nemo, but it is done with such vibrant beauty and soppy charm that it can easily be forgiven. Here, the amnesiac Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) sets out on a quest to find her family, while chums Nemo and Marlin in turn go looking for her. Christmas Day, 3.10pm, BBC One The Others A distinctly chilly and unsettling horror story, this. Much of the credit goes to Nicole Kidman for her controlled performance as Grace, who lives a prison-like existence in a gothic Jersey mansion with her two children as they await the return of the father (Christopher Eccleston) from war. Christmas Day, 7pm, AMC from BT Jurassic World Boasting an all-new cast of massive dinosaurs, this oversized upgrade rescued the franchise from extinction. The tourist crowds are flocking to the Jurassic World theme park \u2013 like lambs to the slaughter \u2013 when the genetically modified mega-raptor Indominus Rex starts running amok. Bryce Dallas Howard\u2019s park manager and Chris Pratt\u2019s dino-wrangler attempt to restore order in a fast, fun and thrilling carnivore caper. Christmas Day, 8pm, ITV2 Avengers: Endgame Five years on from the events of Infinity War, the grieving Avengers reassemble for another tilt at Josh Brolin\u2019s all-powerful Thanos. Directors the Russo brothers juggle the whole pantheon of Marvel heroes, and stage a staggering final battle in an epic conclusion to the 22-film saga. Thrilling, poignant and fun \u2013 especially when Chris Hemsworth\u2019s Thor is on. Boxing Day, 10.45am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere Florence Foster Jenkins In 1940s New York, Florence Foster Jenkins won a certain affectionate notoriety as \u201cthe worst goddamn singer in the world\u201d \u2013 a socialite turned talentless diva who nevertheless attracted a faithful following. Meryl Streep is marvellous as Jenkins, and Hugh Grant matches her as devoted partner-cum-manager St Clair Bayfield, in Stephen Frears\u2019s note-perfect, poignantly funny biopic. Boxing Day, 11pm, BBC Two Skyfall This tip-top Bond pits Daniel Craig\u2019s 007 against rogue agent Silva, played entertainingly by Javier Bardem. There are spectacular stunts in Macau and Shanghai, but this is a staunchly British affair, set largely in London before an unusually sombre showdown at Skyfall \u2013 the Highlands pile of Bond\u2019s youth. Boxing Day, 8.30pm, ITV The Limehouse Golem Peter Ackroyd\u2019s Victorian novel gets a grisly, gripping screen treatment from director Juan Carlos Medina and screenwriter Jane Goldman. Bill Nighy plays detective John Kildare, who hunts a Ripper-like killer known as The Limehouse Golem, while trying to save murder suspect Lizzie (Olivia Cooke) from the gallows; a pleasingly grim, clever melodrama. Friday 27 December, 9.30pm, BBC Two Saving Mr Banks The origins of the film legend that is Mary Poppins, served with a big spoonful of sugar by director John Lee Hancock. Emma Thompson is the wonderfully crotchety PL Travers, protective author of the book that Tom Hanks\u2019s Walt Disney is desperate to bring to semi-animated cinematic life: it\u2019s a supercali\u2026 (etc) double act. Sunday 29 December, 3pm, BBC Two Bridesmaids Paul Feig\u2019s raucous, sometimes tender, comedy stars co-writer Kristen Wiig as the put-upon Annie, who is losing best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) to marriage and to her horrible rich new bestie Helen (Rose Byrne). Can she win her back as maid of honour at the wedding? There is pathos and charm here, but mainly laughs (particularly from Rebel Wilson\u2019s outrageous Brynn). New Year\u2019s Eve, 9pm, ITV2 Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout It\u2019s the sixth time around for Tom Cruise\u2019s IMF agent Ethan Hunt, so heart-stopping motorbike and helicopter chases, crazy jumps from a tower block window/out of an airplane, and a brutal hand-to-hand battle in the gents could all seem a bit Mission: Everyday. Under the kinetic direction of Christopher McQuarrie, however, this is yet another breathlessly thrilling ride. New Year\u2019s Day, 9pm, Channel 4 PJH Radio/Podcasts No Country for Young Women A festive edition of Sadia Azmat and Monty Onanuga\u2019s podcast, which continues to explore \u2013 in cheerful and playful style \u2013 the issues facing young BAME women in a white man\u2019s world. Women Available now, BBC Sounds Kermode and Mayo\u2019s Film Review The Irishman, Midsommar, Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood or Bait? Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo bring their easy-going middlebrow chemistry to their analysis of the year in cinema. Friday 20 December, 3pm, Radio 5 Live The Official Chart Show with Scott Mills Lewis Capaldi and Robbie Williams are slugging it out to be Christmas No 1. But could Sky Sports\u2019 Chris Kamara\u2019s yuletide single make a late run? Almost certainly not. Mills is the man with the answers. Friday 20 December, 4pm, Radio 1 The Adam Buxton Podcast From Chris Morris to Philip Pullman, Adam Buxton\u2019s pod has snared some high-calibre guests this year. For this festive edition, he goes back to his roots for an annual chat with his old mate Joe Cornish. Christmas Day Count Arthur Strong\u2019s Radio Show! Back on the radio after his TV transfer, Steve Delaney\u2019s variety show star brings the oddball cheer. More comedy comes later in the day from the surreal A Very John Kearns Christmas at 4.30pm. Christmas Day, 11.30am, Radio 4 Neil Gaiman\u2019s Chivalry Glenda Jackson and Kit Harington star in this typically playful festive story from the fantasy writer. Mrs Whitaker discovers The Holy Grail in a charity shop. But will it bring her salvation or misfortune? Christmas Day, 4pm, Radio 4 The Today Programme\u2019s guest editors The guest editors of this year\u2019s festive editions of Today are a varied bunch, ranging from teenage environmentalist Greta Thunberg to Telegraph Brexit bruiser Charles Moore. From Boxing Day, 6am, Radio 4 Ghost Stories from Ambridge The Archers follows its Slow Radio experiment with the traditional yuletide special, featuring an in-show festive drama performance. This year: a trio of ghost stories. Monday 30 December, 6.15pm, Radio 4 Asian Network\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve DJ Takeover Asian Network\u2019s former resident DJ Manara kicks off this New Year\u2019s Eve party-starter. She is followed by DJ Frenzy and AJD, who\u2019ll take us into 2020 with a set of bhangra-influenced bangers. New Year\u2019s Eve, 7pm Sound of Gaming Jessica Curry looks back on a year of digital exploration, showcasing gaming music that is much more than just background bleeps. And, for New Year\u2019s Day, she\u2019s found sounds to soothe aching heads too. New Year\u2019s Day, 1pm, Radio 3 PH",

With <a href=\"https://allontheline.org/\">an assist from gerrymandering,</a> blue states got bluer and red states got redder; Republicans became more white and more male while Democrats diversified.

Fresh from Broadway success, Miranda tried out a song \u201cabout the life of somebody who embodies hip-hop \u2013 treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton\u201d. Far-fetched as the idea seemed, Hamilton took flight as theatre\u2019s hottest ticket, featuring songs that caught on with school children across the country.</p> <p>The musical that cast black actors as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other slave-owning founding fathers also became synonymous with the Obama years.

      "bodyText": "Lin-Manuel Miranda was touring his award-winning musical, In the Heights, to his parents\u2019 homeland of Puerto Rico. Donald Trump was awarding first prize on his reality TV show, The Apprentice, to a corporate lawyer turned mobile cupcake entrepreneur. The year was 2010 and, in the decade that followed, these two hustlers from New York with fiercely devoted followings would come to represent the two faces of America. Miranda produced Hamilton, a musical megahit that with hip-hop, jazz, blues, rap, R&amp;B and Broadway recast America\u2019s founding fathers as people of colour in a hymn to the immigrant nation. Trump smashed and grabbed his way into the political class, and the White House, with a nationalist, nativist message that promised to build a border wall to keep Mexicans out and make America great (white) again. Open, inclusive and endlessly curious, Miranda personified a progressive sensibility and social consciousness around gender, race and the environment, largely associated with America\u2019s booming coastal cities. Trump, revelling in ignorance and narcissism, embodied a populist rage against change, political correctness and liberal elites, gaining traction in small towns and rural areas that felt left behind. As 2019 drew to a close, America\u2019s existential crisis was the yawning, ever-growing chasm between these two tribes. With an assist from gerrymandering, blue states got bluer and red states got redder; Republicans became more white and more male while Democrats diversified. The parties were more polarised on issues such as abortion and the climate crisis than anyone could remember. Words such as \u201cunprecedented\u201d still had some life in them just over a decade ago when Barack Obama, on the verge of his signature healthcare reform known as Obamacare, hosted a poetry jam at the White House. Fresh from Broadway success, Miranda tried out a song \u201cabout the life of somebody who embodies hip-hop \u2013 treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton\u201d. Far-fetched as the idea seemed, Hamilton took flight as theatre\u2019s hottest ticket, featuring songs that caught on with school children across the country. The musical that cast black actors as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other slave-owning founding fathers also became synonymous with the Obama years. First lady Michelle Obama called it \u201cthe best piece of art in any form that I have ever seen in my life\u201d and recently tweeted that Miranda \u201cpainted as honest a portrait of our country as I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. Obama performed a freestyle rap with Miranda in the White House Rose Garden. And introducing him at Hamilton showcase in March 2016, he declared: \u201cIn the character of Hamilton, a striving immigrant who escaped poverty, made his way to the New World, climbed to the top by sheer force of will and pluck and determination, Lin-Manuel saw something of his own family, and every immigrant family.\u201d Hamilton made its off-Broadway debut at New York\u2019s Public Theater in February 2015. Four months later and three miles away, Trump rode down an escalator at Trump Tower to declare his candidacy for US president, declaring: \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best \u2026 They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d It was the pivot point, the moment that ensured this would be a broken-backed, contradictory decade that would confound future historians with a simple question: how did America go from Obama, its first black president, to Trump, champion of racist conspiracy theories about his predecessor\u2019s birthplace? Halifu Osumare, professor emerita in the department of African American and African studies at University of California, Davis, says: \u201cIt really shows the extreme schizophrenia of this country and how race is still very much a part of the original sin to portray itself in the world as the beacon of democracy that is always looking at the inalienable rights of the individual while at the same time reinforcing racial difference and hierarchy. \u201cI think that Barack Obama was such a rupture in the master narrative of the white, wealthy male being the only possible leader for this country, the original sin of America erupted with Donald Trump and we had permission for the violent racist past to re-emerge.\u201d Osumare, a black popular culture scholar, points to the white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, that erupted in deadly violence in 2017 as an example of this re-emergence. \u201cWe were in denial during the Obama administration about it because it seemed that the election of the first black president meant that we were moving into a post-racial society. But we saw very quickly the backlash where that underbelly of racism re-emerged with Donald Trump.\u201d The anti-Obama backlash had been evident in the stirrings of the conservative Tea Party movement. Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin were congressional staffers at the time. They would later become progressive organisers, co-founders of the group Indivisible and authors of the book We Are Indivisible: A Blueprint for Democracy After Trump. Greenberg says of the Tea Party: \u201cWe had a lot of personal experience with them and what was really clear was that it was a white identity grievance movement. Sure, they had signs that were about the debt or the deficit but it was code for their sense that somewhere some undeserving other was getting something that their tax dollars were going for.\u201d She adds: \u201c[Trump] threw out the dog whistles and just used a bullhorn and it turned out that enough people within the Republican party were into that that he was able to seize the nomination and seize control of the party.\u201d Wielding his bullhorn, Trump also seized control of the White House in November 2016. It was a moment of reckoning for America, forcing white liberals to confront a storied racism (see The Case for Reparations by Ta-Nehisi Coates) that many had believed would inevitably wither away. There were other forces in play. The opioid crisis. The highest suicide rate since the second world war. Declining life expectancy. Automation and factory closures ripping the hearts out of communities. Cavernous inequality, pitting the top 1% against the bottom 99%, a natural conclusion of Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201ctrickle down\u201d economics. \u201cThe Obama presidency was much less radical than it needed to be in order to halt the trends which led us to Trump. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s all Obama\u2019s fault; most of it is not his fault,\u201d said Timothy Snyder, a history professor at Yale University, says. \u201cBut I think the eight years of Obama were in large measure a kind of self-congratulatory illusion instead of the very tough remaking of politics that probably had to happen if we weren\u2019t going to get a Trump.\u201d The 2008 financial crisis, which saw vast sums of money spent to rescue Wall Street, produced aftershocks that found populist expression in outsiders such as 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, targeting corporate power from the left, and Trump, scapegoating immigrants and elites from the right. They reshaped politics and put the centrism of Bill Clinton and company in retreat. Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman from Maryland, says: \u201cThe Democratic party moved left and the Republican party moved right and we have a contest between duelling populisms now in America. We\u2019ve got an authoritarian, racially tinged populism, and we\u2019ve got a progressive economic and social populism, and that\u2019s the battle for the soul of America. \u201cThe question is, will the centre hold and where is the centre? Is the centre somewhere between these two populisms or is it inside one of them?\u201d But along with Trump\u2019s gaudy escalator ride, something else happened in June 2015 that gave hope to Raskin and millions of others. The US supreme court legalised same-sex marriage nationwide. It was a win for the America of Hamilton. Not even Trump, wildly popular with Christian evangelicals, has suggested trying to overturn the decision. Raskin recalls: \u201cWhen I first ran for state senate in 2006, one of my planks was marriage equality. I\u2019ll never forget, when I made my announcement speech, a woman came up to me and said, \u2018Jamie, great speech but one thing, you\u2019ve got to take out all that stuff in there about gay marriage because it\u2019s never going to happen and even the gay candidates don\u2019t talk about it, and it makes you sound like you\u2019re really extreme. like you\u2019re not in the political centre.\u2019 \u201cThat was when I had an epiphany and I said, \u2018Thank you for telling me because it makes me realise it\u2019s not my goal to be in the political centre \u2026 I think that progressive impulse has really taken over the Democratic party. The country has become far more progressive on a whole bunch of issues that were considered taboo in 2010.\u201d This was reflected in protest movements that have rattled old hierarchies: Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, Extinction Rebellion. Not long after Trump, who had bragged about groping women without their consent, was elected to the White House, the #MeToo movement caught fire, holding Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and other predatory men to account and demanding to know why victims had gone unheard for so long. David Remnick, editor of the New Yorker magazine, notes: \u201cWe are a contradictory people, and just one example is that at a time when a proven misogynist is the president, a #MeToo phenomenon happens and moves us forward.\u201d #MeToo thrived on social media. But so too did disinformation, fake news, invasions of privacy, downright lies and Russian propaganda. Perhaps the biggest winners of the decade were Facebook and Google, which defied regulation, raked in billions of dollars and changed the way we live now. Big tech enabled and incentivised people to pick fights, strike the snarkiest pose and flaunt the worst of themselves, often behind a cloak of anonymity. The giants became as influential as nations but without UN obligations. These echo chambers were reinforced by cable news networks that seemed to occupy alternative universes, offering radically different chyrons and commentaries on everything from Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation to judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s supreme court confirmation to House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into Trump over his alleged attempt to bribe Ukraine to investigate one of Trump\u2019s key political opponents. The reality TV president exploited these post-truth fractures to deny science and withdraw America from the Paris climate accords, which may prove the most consequential decision of the decade. With this and a thousand other egregious acts, he could always rely on support from Fox News, which perfected its model during the Obama years then seemingly tethered itself to Trump\u2019s White House. David Brock, founder and chairman of Media Matters for America, a progressive media watchdog, says: \u201cFox has given the conservative side a whole set of counter-facts and a whole different reality that they can live in that has destroyed the consensus in the country, destroyed the notion that we are operating from the same set of facts and then kind of arguing how to interpret them\u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be here in the moment we\u2019re in without Fox.\u201d Social media plays an auxiliary role, Brock argues. \u201cYou can definitely see that the producers at Fox are paying attention to these far-right extreme websites and social media outlets: Breitbart, the Daily Caller, 4chan, 8chan and Reddit. Of course, the Trump campaign was very adept at exploiting all that and they got a leg up on the Democrats digitally in 2016 and they still have it.\u201d Niall Ferguson, an author, historian and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, has a different emphasis. \u201cCable news has been around a while; that wasn\u2019t new,\u201d he argues. \u201cWhat was new was Facebook and Google\u2019s dominance of news consumption through news feed and search and, of course, the advent of targeted political advertising. \u201cI strongly believe that without social media \u2013 and certainly be more precise and say Facebook \u2013 Trump wouldn\u2019t have won. That was much more important than Fox. I think the big tech companies totally changed the structure of the public sphere and it\u2019s still the case that many people don\u2019t get that.\u201d The rise of social media played a big part in the collapse of America\u2019s local newspapers, devouring advertising revenue and creating \u201cnews deserts\u201d. Facebook and other social media are \u201cunquestionably\u201d responsible for accelerating political tribalisation and a breakdown of a shared reality, Ferguson argues. \u201cIt\u2019s not just polarisation; it\u2019s atomisation now. The most striking difference between 2016 and 2012 at the national aggregate level was the depressed African American turnout. That didn\u2019t happen just by accident. That was the core objective of the Trump social media campaign and it worked. \u201cThis is the big difference that this decade will be remembered for, and also the fact that during this decade the big tech companies basically were unrestrained by any regulation and were able to take the implications of financing online content with ads to the illogical reductio ad absurdum of having Russians post political content anonymously on American social media.\u201d America\u2019s \u201ccold civil war\u201d, as veteran journalist Carl Bernstein characterises it, has been described as a more profound threat to national security than any external foe. Combined with Trump\u2019s manta of \u201cAmerica first\u201d, which shakes the trust of old allies in Nato and beyond, the US is widely seen to be ending the decade in a far weaker position than where it began. Ferguson published Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire in 2004, soon after George W Bush\u2019s disastrous war in Iraq \u2013 still arguably a greater blow to America\u2019s standing, and to trust in leaders, than anything Trump has said, done or tweeted. \u201cThe real story of the last 10 years has been that there are two ways of managing imperial decline,\u201d the British-born historian says. \u201cYou could do it a kind of refined, law professor way as Obama did, giving lectures and then taking actions like not intervening in Syria. Or you can just walk away with complete insouciance as Trump has. I think it\u2019s really actually two flavours of the same ice cream.\u201d The past decade witnessed the deaths of former president George HW Bush and Senator John McCain and, some argue, the Republican party as they knew it when it became consumed by a personality cult. The bipartisan unity that followed the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks now seems a relic from a different era. Back in 2010, Leon Panetta was the director of the CIA, planning the raid that would kill Osama Bin Laden the following year. He says: \u201cThose who wanted to undermine America and our democracy and create distrust have been very successful. Whether it\u2019s the terrorists of 9/11 or whether it\u2019s Putin and Russia, I think the objective of creating a divided America that began to lack trust in the institutions of our democracy: that was their goal and, if you look at America today, they\u2019ve largely succeeded.\u201d The Atlantic magazine closed the decade with a cover story headlined How to Stop a Civil War. For many in the US, it is ending with a looming, pit-of-the-stomach sense of dread \u2013 of a potentially violent election, of future conflict with China, of apocalyptic global heating. In the short term, the November 2020 election will determine whether Trump was a four-year aberration \u2013 last time he did lose the popular vote by nearly three million after all \u2013 or the crass messenger of a more profound shift in direction. \u201cOceans rise, empires fall,\u201d sings King George III in Hamilton. Will future historians see in this decade the decline of the American empire? Panetta says: \u201cI think we\u2019re very much at a crossroads where there are really two paths. One is that we really could be an America in renaissance, if we could get our act together and deal with these challenges. Or we could be an America in decline. And right now, my sense is that we\u2019re are clearly moving on the wrong path of an America in decline.\u201d",

She told me this was to stop anyone disturbing me, but I soon realised that it was so they could pretend I wasn\u2019t home.

I wish I could tell you it was because I feel a desperate need not to overload the NHS before it is turned into a series of drive-thru McDonald\u2019s. But the truth is that I have had the same doctor since I was a kid, and I once had to see him about a problem with my penis. He said he wasn\u2019t sure why I was worried, and that it was perfectly fine, which made me feel as if he thought I had gone to the surgery purely to show him my penis. In every subsequent visit, I have had to resist the urge to start by saying: \u201cCan I just take this opportunity to reiterate that I did genuinely think I had something wrong with my penis?\u201d</p> <p>As a result, I am forced to self-diagnose, which means Googling, followed by panic attacks. For about an hour, a particular internet wormhole led me to believe that I might need to get my nose amputated. It turned out that I had acute sinusitis, which, I was delighted to discover, can knock you off your feet and is very painful. I told my wife triumphantly, and awaited her awe at my bravery. She said that she\u2019d had it the previous week, but I hadn\u2019t known because she hadn\u2019t mentioned it. I spent the night trying to find some evidence to suggest that sinusitis affects men more seriously than women. I know: pretty sad.</p>",

My three days off were spent lying in my pants, a plate of toast resting on my chest, while I watched The Thick Of It over and over again, moving only to brush some crumbs off my torso or to shout to a passing child about how ill I was. It was hellish. My wife initially showed sympathy, buying me medication and occasionally stroking my head. Eventually, however, she shut the door and let me be. She told me this was to stop anyone disturbing me, but I soon realised that it was so they could pretend I wasn\u2019t home. I could hear them laughing and having fun downstairs, and then, when they came to see me, they would paint on sad faces and ask how I was doing. Pathetic. I don\u2019t like going to the doctor. I wish I could tell you it was because I feel a desperate need not to overload the NHS before it is turned into a series of drive-thru McDonald\u2019s. But the truth is that I have had the same doctor since I was a kid, and I once had to see him about a problem with my penis. He said he wasn\u2019t sure why I was worried, and that it was perfectly fine, which made me feel as if he thought I had gone to the surgery purely to show him my penis. In every subsequent visit, I have had to resist the urge to start by saying: \u201cCan I just take this opportunity to reiterate that I did genuinely think I had something wrong with my penis?\u201d As a result, I am forced to self-diagnose, which means Googling, followed by panic attacks. For about an hour, a particular internet wormhole led me to believe that I might need to get my nose amputated. It turned out that I had acute sinusitis, which, I was delighted to discover, can knock you off your feet and is very painful. I told my wife triumphantly, and awaited her awe at my bravery. She said that she\u2019d had it the previous week, but I hadn\u2019t known because she hadn\u2019t mentioned it. I spent the night trying to find some evidence to suggest that sinusitis affects men more seriously than women. I know: pretty sad.",

      "body": "<p>Airbnb superhosts \u201cprovide a shining example\u201d and \u201cextraordinary experiences for their guests\u201d, according to the holiday accommodation company. For regular Airbnb travellers, they offer a badge of quality. But when Mike Nicholson, a retired harbourmaster on the Tyne in Newcastle, booked a family get-together in Spain, his superhost turned into a super disaster.</p> <p>Not only was Nicholson left without a villa to go to when the family arrived in M\u00e1laga, he says on his return Airbnb refused to pay the costs he incurred after the cancellation, and suggested he go through the Irish courts if he wanted to make a legal claim \u2013 only for the Irish courts to say it was beyond their jurisdiction.</p> <p>But Nicholson\u2019s tale is also about how a lone consumer fought back, and turned the tables on the internet giant.</p> <p>Back in May, the reviews on Airbnb for the villa in Calahonda, on the Costa del Sol, were glowing when Nicholson booked for four days from 6-10 September. It wasn\u2019t cheap \u2013 a total of \u00a31,536 \u2013 but the owner was a superhost, and the scores given by other guests were near perfect.</p> <p>Yet as the days counted down to the holiday, Nicholson began to be concerned. He emailed the owner about keys and other arrival issues, but even after multiple attempts, did not receive an answer. The night before the family were due to fly, he tried desperately contacting the host, but there was still no answer.</p> <p>In the morning of 6 September, as the family headed off to the airport for the flight to Spain, and still with no word from his superhost, Nicholson called Airbnb. It, too, was unable to get through to the host, so it terminated the booking. But this left Nicholson and the seven members of his family stranded at M\u00e1laga airport, with nowhere to go.</p> <p>He took another look at the superhost\u2019s listing. It turned out that, since booking in May, the reviews had turned sour, with one dreadful tale after the next. In total, Nicholson counted six instances where the host had cancelled in the previous six months, leaving holidaymakers in the lurch.

      "bodyText": "Airbnb superhosts \u201cprovide a shining example\u201d and \u201cextraordinary experiences for their guests\u201d, according to the holiday accommodation company. For regular Airbnb travellers, they offer a badge of quality. But when Mike Nicholson, a retired harbourmaster on the Tyne in Newcastle, booked a family get-together in Spain, his superhost turned into a super disaster. Not only was Nicholson left without a villa to go to when the family arrived in M\u00e1laga, he says on his return Airbnb refused to pay the costs he incurred after the cancellation, and suggested he go through the Irish courts if he wanted to make a legal claim \u2013 only for the Irish courts to say it was beyond their jurisdiction. But Nicholson\u2019s tale is also about how a lone consumer fought back, and turned the tables on the internet giant. Back in May, the reviews on Airbnb for the villa in Calahonda, on the Costa del Sol, were glowing when Nicholson booked for four days from 6-10 September. It wasn\u2019t cheap \u2013 a total of \u00a31,536 \u2013 but the owner was a superhost, and the scores given by other guests were near perfect. Yet as the days counted down to the holiday, Nicholson began to be concerned. He emailed the owner about keys and other arrival issues, but even after multiple attempts, did not receive an answer. The night before the family were due to fly, he tried desperately contacting the host, but there was still no answer. In the morning of 6 September, as the family headed off to the airport for the flight to Spain, and still with no word from his superhost, Nicholson called Airbnb. It, too, was unable to get through to the host, so it terminated the booking. But this left Nicholson and the seven members of his family stranded at M\u00e1laga airport, with nowhere to go. He took another look at the superhost\u2019s listing. It turned out that, since booking in May, the reviews had turned sour, with one dreadful tale after the next. In total, Nicholson counted six instances where the host had cancelled in the previous six months, leaving holidaymakers in the lurch. Airbnb says a superhost should maintain a 90% response rate, and only cancel a maximum of one in 100 bookings. Its terms also say a host, whether \u201csuper\u201d or not, can\u2019t cancel more than three times without being threatened with being delisted. Airbnb later told Guardian Money that the superhost has since been removed from the platform. The family decided to set up camp in a cafe in Benalm\u00e1dena and start looking for new accommodation. An assistant at Airbnb tried their best to help, but nothing offered matched the requirements of his grown-up family of five plus three partners.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Firework fiesta, </strong>Elche, Spain</h2> <p>You\u2019re unlikely to have heard of Elche, in Valencia province, unless you saw a recent tabloid story linking Diego Maradona with the manager\u2019s job of the Spanish city\u2019s <em>Segunda </em><em>Divisi\u00f3n</em> football team. Perhaps only someone of Maradona\u2019s stature could put this workaday southern city on the map. Because Elche sits outside the gaudy glare of the Costa Blanca\u2019s overheated beach resorts, just far enough inland to preserve its modesty. And it\u2019s all the better for it. We were visiting friends and happy to be led on a tour of discovery. We were even happier that there were more hidden treasures than we anticipated: <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/930/\" title=\"\">the Palmeral</a>, a world heritage site of 200,000 palm trees; <a href=\"http://www.castles.nl/altamira-castle\" title=\"\">Altamira Castle</a>, a 12th-century Moorish castle; the neoclassical <a href=\"http://www.visitelche.com/en/cultura/monumentos/basilica-de-santa-maria/\" title=\"\">Bas</a><a href=\"http://www.visitelche.com/en/cultura/monumentos/basilica-de-santa-maria/\" title=\"\">\u00edlica de Santa Mar\u00eda</a>, home of the Elche mystery play, which was declared a <a href=\"https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/mystery-play-of-elche-00018\" title=\"\">masterpiece of oral and intangible heritage by Unesco</a>; and a massive firework display to kick-start the summer festival season.</p> <p>At a local restaurant we were encouraged to try <em>fideu\u00e0</em>, a dish similar to paella, but made with thin pasta instead of rice; and <em>arroz a banda</em>, rice cooked in salty fish stock and topped with a dollop of aioli. A bottle of Marina Alta white wine from nearby Alicante was cheap and delicious. But it\u2019s not alcohol that you crave in the dog days of summer, when even a stroll at midnight is enough to reduce you to a puddle. So we dived into an ice-cream shop on Placa de la Glorieta, where our friends ordered us long glasses of <em>horchata de</em><em> chufa</em>. And <em>fart</em><em>\u00f3ns</em>! The sweet milky horchata \u2013 made from tiger nuts \u2013 has been cooling people from the Valencia region for centuries. The fart\u00f3ns were billowy soft finger buns dusted with icing sugar, perfect for dunking. I haven\u2019t been happier sipping a milky drink at midnight for many years.<br><strong>Andy Pietrasik</strong></p> <h2><strong>Gelat</strong><strong>o heaven, </strong>Italian Alps</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2916521bfc2f57c5be7f78c8456490654d182dc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2916521bfc2f57c5be7f78c8456490654d182dc2/0_448_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gelateria Pilier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Some people may regard it as mildly eccentric to drive 20 minutes out of your way in the midwinter snow for an ice-cream. I am very much not one of those people \u2013 and fortunately, the Italians aren\u2019t either \u2013 so having heard that Aosta valley mountain guides were big fans of the <strong>Gelateria Pilier</strong> in Morgex, I decided a detour was in order en route from La Thuile to Courmayeur. Turns out those guides are good for more than just looking cool on skis, because I\u2019m still thinking about the resulting ice-cream six months later. Made using milk from the sheep grazing on their winter pastures across the road, it combined the distinctive clean lightness of ewe\u2019s milk with the rich, fruity flavours of the region \u2013 raspberries, sour cherries, roasted hazelnuts \u2013 and came topped with a generous avalanche of hot chocolate sauce. It was winter, after all.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.piliercentral.com/en-gb/home\" title=\"\">piliercentral.com</a></em><br><strong>Felicity Cloake, Guardian food and drink writer</strong></p> <h2><br><strong>Something of the night, </strong>Cluj-Napoca, Romania</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b628dc81da8cf10a5bd92e30a1c81111fd7cf5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b628dc81da8cf10a5bd92e30a1c81111fd7cf5b/0_232_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Electric Castle Festival, near Cluj, Romania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Electric Castle Festival, near Cluj, Romania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger Garfield/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>There\u2019s a lot to love about Cluj-Napoca, Romania\u2019s second-largest city.

My visit coincided with Cluj Day in September, a cultural celebration with medieval parades, outdoor art exhibitions, concerts and a party atmosphere. Cluj is known on the electronic music scene for the <a href=\"https://electriccastle.ro/\" title=\"\">Electric Castle</a> and <a href=\"https://untold.com/\" title=\"\">Untold</a> festivals and has great nightlife year round, with venues like the <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/club.aspx?id=67578\" title=\"\">Gazette Club</a> in a warehouse on top of a hill and the vast <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/club.aspx?id=135398\" title=\"\">Form Space</a> in town, and there are plentiful cool cafes and bars (try the steampunk pub <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EnigmaCafeCluj/\" title=\"\">Enigma</a>).

This cobbled square is in fact a rectangle of towering Flemish gothic architecture, but on warm afternoons it feels like one long terrace bar, with students lounging on outdoor sofas, lazily sipping Hoegaardens. The traditional <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/Caf%C3%A9-Belge-Leuven-154278367916247/about/?tab=page_info\" title=\"\">Caf\u00e9 Belge</a> is a good place to test out Leuven\u2019s reputation as Belgium\u2019s beer capital, while more sophisticated spots include <a href=\"https://www.bardotleuven.be/\" title=\"\">Bardot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cafetvertier/\" title=\"\">Caf\u00e9 \u2019t Vertier</a>, which has the comfiest outdoor seats for people watching. Leuven is small and still off Belgium\u2019s main tourist circuit, so even at the weekend it\u2019s surprisingly peaceful \u2013 but the city\u2019s history, architecture and bar and restaurant scenes rival those of Ghent and Bruges. <br><strong>Rachel Hall</strong></p> <h2><strong>Love at first bite, </strong>Aberdeen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2f47507d1855830bf26857a3c75f2c89d231dd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2f47507d1855830bf26857a3c75f2c89d231dd2/0_447_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bonobo Cafe Aberdeen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Coming off the overnight ferry from Orkney, I dropped in at the <strong>Bonobo Cafe</strong> for breakfast and promptly fell in love. Aberdeen\u2019s first workers\u2019 cooperative vegan cafe opened in its current central location in 2017, after a couple of years as a pop-up. I headed upstairs to the bijou dining area \u2013 lots of exposed wood, reclaimed materials and a warm, friendly vibe \u2013 and was soon tucking into a generous, tasty and very reasonably priced cooked breakfast: vegan sausages, tomato, tofu \u201cscrambled eggs\u201d, baked beans, tattie scones and more. As it was sunny, I had a cheeky post-prandial hot chocolate and CBD oil in the roof garden, where I made friends with Mickey, a handsome white-and-ginger tom who has adopted the cafe and is now a permanent fixture. It\u2019s not the first time I wished I were a cat.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.bonobotribe.co.uk/\" title=\"\">bonobotribe.co.uk</a></em><br><strong>Dixe Wills</strong></p> <h2><strong>Wild woods, </strong>East Sussex</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2c7341a24792c783ba0e22842fb6f715afc7c7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2c7341a24792c783ba0e22842fb6f715afc7c7a/0_68_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wowo Campsite Sussex\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This summer we spent three days in a Sussex field \u2013 and it was one of the most successful family holidays we\u2019ve ever had. The sun shone; my son and his friend (both nine) disappeared for hours on end, and I had time to read. <strong>Wowo</strong> is known for its family-friendliness, offering bushcraft, circus and storytelling sessions, and the boys enjoyed these, but the thing they loved most was the freedom to play in the woods on rope swings and makeshift bridges. There were times when I worried I was giving them too much freedom \u2013 like the time my son came back and told me he\u2019d been dangling upside down over a ditch \u2013 but the benefits of being able to roam wild far outweighed the risks. To my astonishment, the boys completely forgot about electronic devices and instead got into whittling. They had zero interest in day trips, so we stayed on site, adjusting to the rhythm of outdoor life \u2013 waking early, cooking breakfast outside, exploring the woods that border each field.

A modicum of research produced tantalising images of ancient Greek temples and the remains of a Roman town behind the dunes \u2013 history and swimming, an ideal holiday combination. As it happened, cafes on the delightful little square over the road from the temples took more of our time than we had envisaged, as did the fascinating museum, with its Greek and Lucanian tomb art, made famous by the <a href=\"http://www.paestum.org.uk/museum/classical/\" title=\"\">stunning Diver painting</a>. We also managed to photobomb the most stylish wedding I\u2019ve ever witnessed, just outside the venerable Paleochristian Basilica of Our Lady of the Annunciation.

And yet in some ways the star performer of the trip was the Greek ferry system. From the first voyage out of Piraeus, it served up a reliable mixture of fresh air, cheese pies, good coffee and spectacular panoramas. Every island had its attractions, but I always looked forward to that moment in the port, waiting in a little taverna, when the boat came steaming into harbour and I\u2019d jump aboard. Even the occasional need to change boats for particular destinations made for interesting discoveries: the antiquities of Kos, for example, and the charm of Naxos\u2019s old town. <br>\u2022 <em>Booking info at<a href=\"https://www.ferries.gr/\" title=\"\"> ferries.gr</a> </em><br><strong>Kevin Rushby</strong></p> <h2>Heart of glass<strong>,</strong> Perugia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70967ca3e31387bc2aded61f23cd5beda23fa51c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70967ca3e31387bc2aded61f23cd5beda23fa51c/0_62_1250_750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"studio moretti caselli\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Many visitors to Italy find themselves gazing at amazing stained glass, but not so many get to see how these masterpieces of light and chemistry are created.

His descendants showed us original bottles of coloured enamel powder, kilns where different colours are carefully \u201ccooked\u201d and workshops where new masterpieces are created. Walking into the main studio (pictured) in this 15th-century house is like stepping into a Renaissance painting: lit by a row of windows, its walls and archways are covered in decorative frescos and hung with paintings, musical instruments and even a suit of armour.

Accessible by train from the UK \u2013 I travelled overnight via Berlin \u2013 it\u2019s the birthplace of art deco architect Erich Mendelsohn and capital of the Warmia-Masuria province, known as the Land of a Thousand Lakes (though it\u2019s actually home to about 3,000). At its heart is a laid-back mix of parks and attractive streets liberally sprinkled with medieval buildings. One of these is the very castle whose walls were used in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus to make the calculations that resulted in the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. Best of all, 11 of the region\u2019s lakes are within the city limits, so visitors are never far from a place to indulge in water sports, a tranquil shoreline wander or a lakeside bar for a crisp, refreshing beer from the city\u2019s Kormoran brewery. <strong>DW</strong></p> <h2><strong>Highland flung, </strong>The Lost valley, Glen Coe</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"33afde90066def59d0da65f781c2c803c1b034c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33afde90066def59d0da65f781c2c803c1b034c1/0_87_3008_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lost Valley, Glen Coe, Scotland with ridge and steep slopes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Glen Coe is everything you would imagine of the Scottish Highlands \u2013 majestic, forbidding, savagely beautiful \u2013 but you don\u2019t have to be an experienced hiker with calves of steel to enjoy it.

In May, my partner and I took the train from Naples to the toe of Italy, where the train is loaded on to the ferry to cross the Straits of Messina (the boat has tracks and the train is driven right on). Once on the ferry, we watched from the deck as Sicily neared. After half an hour, we were back on board and speeding down the island\u2019s east coast to Taormina, Catania and Syracuse.

      "bodyText": "Firework fiesta, Elche, Spain You\u2019re unlikely to have heard of Elche, in Valencia province, unless you saw a recent tabloid story linking Diego Maradona with the manager\u2019s job of the Spanish city\u2019s Segunda Divisi\u00f3n football team. Perhaps only someone of Maradona\u2019s stature could put this workaday southern city on the map. Because Elche sits outside the gaudy glare of the Costa Blanca\u2019s overheated beach resorts, just far enough inland to preserve its modesty. And it\u2019s all the better for it. We were visiting friends and happy to be led on a tour of discovery. We were even happier that there were more hidden treasures than we anticipated: the Palmeral, a world heritage site of 200,000 palm trees; Altamira Castle, a 12th-century Moorish castle; the neoclassical Bas\u00edlica de Santa Mar\u00eda, home of the Elche mystery play, which was declared a masterpiece of oral and intangible heritage by Unesco; and a massive firework display to kick-start the summer festival season. At a local restaurant we were encouraged to try fideu\u00e0, a dish similar to paella, but made with thin pasta instead of rice; and arroz a banda, rice cooked in salty fish stock and topped with a dollop of aioli. A bottle of Marina Alta white wine from nearby Alicante was cheap and delicious. But it\u2019s not alcohol that you crave in the dog days of summer, when even a stroll at midnight is enough to reduce you to a puddle. So we dived into an ice-cream shop on Placa de la Glorieta, where our friends ordered us long glasses of horchata de chufa. And fart\u00f3ns! The sweet milky horchata \u2013 made from tiger nuts \u2013 has been cooling people from the Valencia region for centuries. The fart\u00f3ns were billowy soft finger buns dusted with icing sugar, perfect for dunking. I haven\u2019t been happier sipping a milky drink at midnight for many years. Andy Pietrasik Gelato heaven, Italian Alps Some people may regard it as mildly eccentric to drive 20 minutes out of your way in the midwinter snow for an ice-cream. I am very much not one of those people \u2013 and fortunately, the Italians aren\u2019t either \u2013 so having heard that Aosta valley mountain guides were big fans of the Gelateria Pilier in Morgex, I decided a detour was in order en route from La Thuile to Courmayeur. Turns out those guides are good for more than just looking cool on skis, because I\u2019m still thinking about the resulting ice-cream six months later. Made using milk from the sheep grazing on their winter pastures across the road, it combined the distinctive clean lightness of ewe\u2019s milk with the rich, fruity flavours of the region \u2013 raspberries, sour cherries, roasted hazelnuts \u2013 and came topped with a generous avalanche of hot chocolate sauce. It was winter, after all. \u2022 piliercentral.com Felicity Cloake, Guardian food and drink writer Something of the night, Cluj-Napoca, Romania There\u2019s a lot to love about Cluj-Napoca, Romania\u2019s second-largest city. It\u2019s the unofficial capital of Transylvania, and blends the historic \u2013 a striking central square with gothic St Michael\u2019s Church, old town hall, baroque B\u00e1nffy Palace (now the national art museum) \u2013 with a bohemian, lively vibe thanks to the big student presence (they make up a third of the population). My visit coincided with Cluj Day in September, a cultural celebration with medieval parades, outdoor art exhibitions, concerts and a party atmosphere. Cluj is known on the electronic music scene for the Electric Castle and Untold festivals and has great nightlife year round, with venues like the Gazette Club in a warehouse on top of a hill and the vast Form Space in town, and there are plentiful cool cafes and bars (try the steampunk pub Enigma). It\u2019s got a huge vintage and outlet shopping offering and a vibrant art scene too \u2013 the Paintbrush Factory in a converted factory is a huge independent cultural space and worth a visit. It made a great value, alternative city break. Jane Dunford Beer capital, Leuven, Belgium One of the best places in Belgium to escape the summer heatwaves is under a canopy in Oude Markt in Leuven, 16 miles east of Brussels. This cobbled square is in fact a rectangle of towering Flemish gothic architecture, but on warm afternoons it feels like one long terrace bar, with students lounging on outdoor sofas, lazily sipping Hoegaardens. The traditional Caf\u00e9 Belge is a good place to test out Leuven\u2019s reputation as Belgium\u2019s beer capital, while more sophisticated spots include Bardot and Caf\u00e9 \u2019t Vertier, which has the comfiest outdoor seats for people watching. Leuven is small and still off Belgium\u2019s main tourist circuit, so even at the weekend it\u2019s surprisingly peaceful \u2013 but the city\u2019s history, architecture and bar and restaurant scenes rival those of Ghent and Bruges. Rachel Hall Love at first bite, Aberdeen Coming off the overnight ferry from Orkney, I dropped in at the Bonobo Cafe for breakfast and promptly fell in love. Aberdeen\u2019s first workers\u2019 cooperative vegan cafe opened in its current central location in 2017, after a couple of years as a pop-up. I headed upstairs to the bijou dining area \u2013 lots of exposed wood, reclaimed materials and a warm, friendly vibe \u2013 and was soon tucking into a generous, tasty and very reasonably priced cooked breakfast: vegan sausages, tomato, tofu \u201cscrambled eggs\u201d, baked beans, tattie scones and more. As it was sunny, I had a cheeky post-prandial hot chocolate and CBD oil in the roof garden, where I made friends with Mickey, a handsome white-and-ginger tom who has adopted the cafe and is now a permanent fixture. It\u2019s not the first time I wished I were a cat. \u2022 bonobotribe.co.uk Dixe Wills Wild woods, East Sussex This summer we spent three days in a Sussex field \u2013 and it was one of the most successful family holidays we\u2019ve ever had. The sun shone; my son and his friend (both nine) disappeared for hours on end, and I had time to read. Wowo is known for its family-friendliness, offering bushcraft, circus and storytelling sessions, and the boys enjoyed these, but the thing they loved most was the freedom to play in the woods on rope swings and makeshift bridges. There were times when I worried I was giving them too much freedom \u2013 like the time my son came back and told me he\u2019d been dangling upside down over a ditch \u2013 but the benefits of being able to roam wild far outweighed the risks. To my astonishment, the boys completely forgot about electronic devices and instead got into whittling. They had zero interest in day trips, so we stayed on site, adjusting to the rhythm of outdoor life \u2013 waking early, cooking breakfast outside, exploring the woods that border each field. I\u2019d expected to be eager to leave; instead I was reluctant to rejoin the real world and would happily have stayed for the rest of the summer. \u2022 From \u00a310 a night adult, \u00a35 child; sessions such as bushcraft and circus skills from \u00a312; wowo.co.uk Isabel Choat Splendid isolation, Lincolnshire Much of Lincolnshire\u2019s wild coastline is unspoilt by development, with vast sandy stretches, dunes and wildlife-rich, marshy hinterlands. The only sign of human presence from the beach at Gibraltar Point was a wind farm, far out in the misty sea, and the boardwalk leading back to the nature reserve. When I visited in August, we paddled in the warm shallows, skimmed stones, walked barefoot across the mudflats and explored several miles of pathways around salt marshes and freshwater meres. Nearby, there\u2019s the new North Sea Observatory at Chapel Point; fab fish and chips at Waldo\u2019s in Sutton-on-Sea; and Anderby Creek, a sandy beach with a small cafe and \u201ccloud bar\u201d \u2013 which claims to be the world\u2019s first dedicated cloud observation platform. Antonia Wilson Strawberry Field \u2026 forever, Liverpool For a Beatles nut, the opening ceremony of Strawberry Field in September was a magical moment. The grounds of the former Salvation Army children\u2019s home that inspired the Beatles\u2019 1967 classic had never before been open to the public (as a boy, John Lennon would bunk over the wall to play in the gardens) and were the last major unknown piece of the Beatles jigsaw. Where the gothic Victorian house once stood, the Salvation Army has built a light-filled cafe and exhibition space to help fund its Steps to Work programme, which is on the same site and helps young people with learning disabilities get into employment. The exhibition covers Lennon\u2019s early life and the making of Strawberry Fields (Lennon added the \u201cs\u201d), with a virtual Mellotron that teaches visitors to play the song\u2019s famous opening notes. But the real joy was sitting in the peaceful now-landscaped garden (free to enter) imagining which of the trees my hero would have climbed (\u201cNo one I think is in my tree\u201d) while his psychedelic masterpiece played in my head. \u2022 Cafe and garden free to enter, interactive exhibition \u00a312.95 adult, \u00a38 child (5-16), strawberryfieldliverpool.com Gavin McOwan Antiquity-on-sea, Paestum, Salerno, Italy Craving a long empty sandy shore after cheek-by-jowl experiences on tiny Amalfi beaches, I spotted Paestum on a map, to the south of Salerno. A modicum of research produced tantalising images of ancient Greek temples and the remains of a Roman town behind the dunes \u2013 history and swimming, an ideal holiday combination. As it happened, cafes on the delightful little square over the road from the temples took more of our time than we had envisaged, as did the fascinating museum, with its Greek and Lucanian tomb art, made famous by the stunning Diver painting. We also managed to photobomb the most stylish wedding I\u2019ve ever witnessed, just outside the venerable Paleochristian Basilica of Our Lady of the Annunciation. A 10-minute walk through dunes took us to a huge beach curving away south to Cilento. Easily big enough to dodge the sunloungers and roped-off private areas, this was an idyllic place to wander and swim. But there\u2019s more history to ponder: this was also the site of the US 36th Division\u2019s fraught Salerno landings in 1943. Just how did those stunning temples survive? Adam McCulloch Pots of delight, Beirut One of the first neighbourhoods in East Beirut to become trendy, Gemmayzeh is now full of bars, restaurants and clubs. Most memorable, though, was not the (excellent) cocktails but drinking coffee with inspiring potters Nicole Bersuder and Imad Baalbaki at their workshop-cum-gallery on the top floor of an old building on the main drag, Gouraud Street. Nicole learned her craft in Sweden and Greece, and she and partner Imad have been perfecting it here for 25 years, producing dishes, plates, vases and more in tactile, sinuous shapes, with finishes varying from matt to shiny, richly opaque to transparent. \u201cI have a carnal relationship with clay,\u201d she says. Imad\u2019s work is more playful \u2013 expressive animal shapes in figurines or adorning a plate. He was working on a series featuring spiky-haired refugee boy Handala, commemorating his creator, Palestinian cartoonist Naji Salim Hussain, murdered in London in 1987. The pair hold an open house fortnight each September, but visitors are welcome any time at their atelier (between Caf\u00e9 Ginette and Phil &amp; Joe Barbers \u2013 no street number). They\u2019ll have the coffee pot on. \u2022 espacesephemeres.com Liz Boulter Take the bus to a waterfall walk, Bellingham, Northumberland Exploring rural Northumberland by bus places great emphasis on timing, as the service can stretch your understanding of the word \u201cfrequency\u201d. Rather than viewing the two-hour gaps between the 680 Tynedale Links buses as a negative, I took the positives: an opportunity to plan properly. Arriving in Bellingham (on the Pennine Way) on a Saturday afternoon, I had two hours \u2013 or four. Details like these focus the mind. A sausage bap and coffee at the town\u2019s Carriages Tea Rooms (two repurposed 1957 Mark 1 railway carriages) turned out to be not my only \u201cdiscovery\u201d. With 80 minutes to play with, I took the three-mile circular walk to Hareshaw Linn waterfall. This site of special scientific interest is home to rare ferns and more than 300 types of mosses, liverworts and lichen. On a late autumn day, walking the gorge \u2013 alongside Hareshaw Burn, crossing numerous wooden bridges on the way \u2013 was a beautifully tranquil, nature-filled experience. Robert Hull It was ferry heaven, Greek island hopping I spent a few weeks in the summer on an island-hopping odyssey around the Greek islands, among them some superb craggy outcrops like Amorgos, Sifnos and Ikaria. And yet in some ways the star performer of the trip was the Greek ferry system. From the first voyage out of Piraeus, it served up a reliable mixture of fresh air, cheese pies, good coffee and spectacular panoramas. Every island had its attractions, but I always looked forward to that moment in the port, waiting in a little taverna, when the boat came steaming into harbour and I\u2019d jump aboard. Even the occasional need to change boats for particular destinations made for interesting discoveries: the antiquities of Kos, for example, and the charm of Naxos\u2019s old town. \u2022 Booking info at ferries.gr Kevin Rushby Heart of glass, Perugia Many visitors to Italy find themselves gazing at amazing stained glass, but not so many get to see how these masterpieces of light and chemistry are created. On a steep street in central Perugia, five generations of one family have been working in glass since 1858, when Francesco Moretti, whose work can be seen throughout Italy and across the world, founded the studio. His descendants showed us original bottles of coloured enamel powder, kilns where different colours are carefully \u201ccooked\u201d and workshops where new masterpieces are created. Walking into the main studio (pictured) in this 15th-century house is like stepping into a Renaissance painting: lit by a row of windows, its walls and archways are covered in decorative frescos and hung with paintings, musical instruments and even a suit of armour. Also on display are a portrait of Queen Margherita that you would never believe was glass, a version of Da Vinci\u2019s last supper, and elegant contemporary pieces. \u2022 Open Tues, Weds 10am-3pm, other times by appointment, donations requested, studiomoretticaselli.it LB About time, Olsztyn, Poland I made a long overdue first visit to Poland this year, and found myself really quite taken with Olsztyn, a small city in the north-east of the country on the River \u0141yna. Accessible by train from the UK \u2013 I travelled overnight via Berlin \u2013 it\u2019s the birthplace of art deco architect Erich Mendelsohn and capital of the Warmia-Masuria province, known as the Land of a Thousand Lakes (though it\u2019s actually home to about 3,000). At its heart is a laid-back mix of parks and attractive streets liberally sprinkled with medieval buildings. One of these is the very castle whose walls were used in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus to make the calculations that resulted in the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. Best of all, 11 of the region\u2019s lakes are within the city limits, so visitors are never far from a place to indulge in water sports, a tranquil shoreline wander or a lakeside bar for a crisp, refreshing beer from the city\u2019s Kormoran brewery. DW Highland flung, The Lost valley, Glen Coe Glen Coe is everything you would imagine of the Scottish Highlands \u2013 majestic, forbidding, savagely beautiful \u2013 but you don\u2019t have to be an experienced hiker with calves of steel to enjoy it. On our visit at Easter we followed the path from a layby on the A82 up across the valley floor, edged along a narrow gorge, clambered over boulders; and after about an hour were above the Lost valley \u2013 a hidden spot where the Macdonald clan used to hide their cattl, where wild campers now pitch tents. The walk had enough drama to distract my son, and for us to feel as if we\u2019d had a proper dose of wilderness. Plus in a week when we had almost every type of weather, we were lucky to walk under spring sunshine. IC Happy hotel, Vienna I\u2019d never been to Vienna before, and on my first trip, this summer, was won over by the laid-back vibe. My base was the newly opened Max Brown hotel, a converted mansion with 143 rooms in Neubau, the hip 7th district. On the ground floor, Seven North restaurant, run by Israeli chef Eyal Shani, has a theatrical open kitchen serving southern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine with lots for veggies (Arabian cabbage cake, roast cauliflower or sweet potato \u201cbrain\u201d with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, from \u20ac9). Carnivores can feast on whole roasted fish (\u20ac14) or kebab schnitzel (\u20ac18). The hotel has a cocktail bar, cinema and pool tables and rooms all have Crosley record players, a basketball net (and ball), bright colour schemes, chic mid-century furniture, potted plants and bathrooms with Desea Spa products. It\u2019s a great location for vintage shopping and only a short walk from the museum district and Vienna\u2019s old-school coffee houses and lively bars. \u2022 Doubles from \u20ac113 room-only, maxbrownhotels.com JD Lap it up, Husky hike, Finland The most fun I had all year was taking a dog for a walk. (Maybe I need to get out more?) But this wasn\u2019t any old dog walk \u2013 it was a husky hike through a forest in Finnish Lapland. Before the snows come and the sleigh rides begin, visitors can help exercise the dogs on foot. Our guide selected a pack of eight out of hundreds of baying hounds, humans and dogs were paired up and put into harness, and we all hurtled off at high speed. After the barking (and screaming) subsided, my dog, Kuiska (Whisper) and I settled into a steady jog through trees. It was ruska, the two-week period in Lapland when the autumn colours are most vivid. The peace was broken only when the huskies scented water and dashed en masse into a ditch, dragging us handlers face-first behind them. If you too want to get wet, dirty and covered in dog hair, you don\u2019t have to go to Finland \u2013 Eagle Heights Wildlife Foundation in Kent also offers husky hikes. \u2022 harriniva.fi Rachel Dixon Wild about wildlife, UK nature reserves Thanks to David Attenborough\u2019s television programmes, some of the British public are probably more familiar with the Serengeti and Antarctica than places like Kenfig and Skipwith Common, but there is environmental treasure right under our noses here in the UK. My moment of awakening came at Kenfig, a national nature reserve near Bridgend, south Wales, when my guide suddenly jumped up from where he was showing me a sward covered in orchids and ran off, shouting, \u201cGet your camera. Quick!\u201d He had spotted a shrill carder bee, a creature rarer than a Bengal tiger. There are over 2,500 nature reserves in Britain, some managed by government bodies, some by Wildlife Trusts and some privately. There are more than 30 run by Butterfly Conservation. Many were formerly known by the catchy moniker \u201csites of special scientific interest\u201d. They may not have prides of lions, but they can be just as dramatic. Take Gilfach in mid-Wales, where the salmon spend November chucking themselves headlong up waterfalls right past the viewing platform that only occasionally hosts a visitor. Or Skipwith near York, where grass snakes snooze on the warm bricks of first world war bunkers, with not a single minivan of camera-toting tourists in sight. These places are disgracefully under-resourced by government, often reliant on volunteers, and there will be a gem near you. Give it some love. \u2022 wildlifetrusts.org, visitengland.com, nnr.scot, first-nature.com/waleswildlife, discovernorthernireland.com KR Your carriage awaits, boat train to Sicily On 14 December, one of Europe\u2019s three surviving train ferries set sail for the last time. The Hamburg to Copenhagen train will now be rerouted via Odense. It is the latest in a long list of lost boat trains from the golden age of rail, including the overnight London-Paris ferry. The two remaining services are the summer-only Berlin Night Express to Malm\u00f6, and the year-round train ferry from mainland Italy to Sicily. In May, my partner and I took the train from Naples to the toe of Italy, where the train is loaded on to the ferry to cross the Straits of Messina (the boat has tracks and the train is driven right on). Once on the ferry, we watched from the deck as Sicily neared. After half an hour, we were back on board and speeding down the island\u2019s east coast to Taormina, Catania and Syracuse. With spectacular coastal scenery, the excitement of the sea crossing and our picnic of arancini and wine, it was one of the most enjoyable journeys I\u2019ve ever taken. Next time, I might extend it by starting in Rome, Milan or even London, and go all the way to Palermo. After all, if we don\u2019t support these venerable boat trains, there will soon be none left. RD Kreuzberg street art tour, Berlin I love Berlin\u2019s imposing, sometimes daunting, architecture and history, but for me an even bigger draw is its embrace of cultural diversity. It still feels open to artistic expression and lo-fi creativity, amid all the European capital oomph. In the company of Elisabetta, a With Locals guide, I took an afternoon walking tour around the Kreuzberg district\u2019s street art. What impressed me about her insight was how, as we strolled past the East Side Gallery and across the Oberbaumbr\u00fccke, she shone a light on smaller artworks and lesser-known artists, not just Insta hits. So, as well as eyecatching pieces by Os G\u00eameos and Nomad, she pointed out Korkm\u00e4nnchen (little cork yoga figures added to road signs), the cigarette packet-style art of Taosuz, and emotional stencils by ALIAS, about children left alone in the city. The tour also takes in RAW Gel\u00e4nde, a complex of wildly graffitied derelict buildings that is now a cultural space (including the Haubentaucher lido). \u2022 Tour \u20ac26.50pp, 2\u00bd hours, withlocals.com RH Bastide in blue, Lectoure, France Lectoure is a bastide \u2013 it\u2019s even got a hotel called the Bastard. A bastide is a fortified town, and this one sits high above the fertile plains of the Gers river in rural south-west France. Its houses and shops are built of limestone and radiate a warm honey glow in summer, their shutters painted a distinctive pastel shade known as Lectoure blue, made using local woad. The main street is closed off every Friday for the farmer\u2019s market, which sells local produce like armagnac (it used to be the capital of the earldom of Armagnac), prunes and, whisper it, foie gras. At the other end, there\u2019s a rambling antiques market in the former 17th-century hospital, and a small thermal spa. But the jewel of the town is tucked out of sight behind the monumental cathedral in the gardens of the former bishop\u2019s palace. Sitting on a terrace overlooking the Gers countryside is the most beautiful outdoor swimming pool. It\u2019s a 25-metre lido with a separate children\u2019s section, surrounded by a Technicolor green lawn. It\u2019s like a scene from a French movie: sun glinting on the water, women of a certain age swimming, head up in sunglasses, middle-aged men doing laps, couples cuddling in the shallow end. And it\u2019s all presided over by a sun-wizened lifeguard who prowls the perimeter in a white vest and the briefest of trunks. Best of all it costs less than \u20ac5 for the whole day. AP Pasta glory, Lisbon I\u2019d only been in Lisbon a couple of days, but the beetroot pasta at Osteria Cucina Di Amici had already been name-dropped by both the manager of my co-working space and my surf instructor. The corner restaurant\u2019s pea-green walls are decorated with vintage Italian posters and a photo of the pope lit up with coloured fairy-lights, under mismatched chairs at Formica tables dressed with red gingham napkins. An enamel bowl of silky, pink bucatini pasta (pictured) topped with parmesan and basil leaves, was perfectly in tune with the surrounding Italian kitsch. Also on the menu is Sardinian bread lasagne, and meatballs with creamy mash. The restaurant is in the hilly Madragoa neighbourhood of narrow cobbled streets and washing lines strung between crumbly tiled walls.

Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker is described as a \u201cheavy hitter\u201d, rather than one of America\u2019s most notorious union busters, while the neocon Elliott Abrams, an unsuccessful candidate to be deputy secretary of state, is a \u201csharp observer of the Middle East\u201d instead of an \u201cactual American war criminal\u201d, as Eric Alterman has described him more convincingly in the Nation. Then there\u2019s the famous mercenary Eric Prince, whose detailed plan to privatize the war in Afghanistan Bergen says seemed just \u201ca little self-serving\u201d, since Prince was one of the largest players \u201cin the war contracting industry\u201d. Despite the ample evidence of catastrophe, Bergen is shy about making any final judgements. After all, \u201cHarry Truman was initially derided as a onetime haberdasher and Reagan was similarly dinged as a former actor\u201d before both of their reputations, especially Truman\u2019s, soared when they left the White House. \u201cCould the blowhard billionaire from Queens also enjoy a similar reputational shift?\u201d Bergen asks. With Trump becoming the third American president to be impeached, because of one of his most outrageous foreign adventures, the answer is surely a resounding: \u201cNo!\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jonathan on Matt What were you hoping for? The loss of my boxers at a yet undisclosed secondary location. First impressions? Oh Christ, he\u2019s cute. Are we wearing the same outfit? What did you talk about? I knew we were off to a good start when I confessed to having a tinnie of rose on the tube before the date, and he said he\u2019d been to a Spoons alone. Any awkward moments? We drunkenly lost each other after the third or fourth bar, so I spent 20 minutes stumbling around Soho listening to Madonna deep cuts trying to find him. Good table manners? Impeccable, he was great with his hands. Best thing about Matt? He\u2019s kind, but still has a filthy sense of humour. Would you introduce him to your friends? I already did, in the morning. Describe Matt in three words Funny, handsome, messy. What do you think he made of you? I reckon he would probably place me somewhere between Boris Johnson at a Jennifer Arcuri business launch party and Miley Cyrus at the VMAs. Did you go on somewhere? I think the order was: pub to see his friend, pub to see his flatmate, gay bar, gay bar, gay bar, Uber, bus, Uber, undisclosed secondary location. And... did you kiss? What do you think? If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? One of us got stopped by a police officer, that probably could have been avoided. Luckily, the only charge was having too much fun. Marks out of 10? 9. Would you meet again? Seeing him on Sunday. Matt on Jonathan What were you hoping for? A laugh and a free meal. First impressions? I thought he was handsome. What did you talk about? Our most embarrassing stories, travel and our shared love of Berlin. We had a lot in common; we\u2019ve lived in the same places and worked for very similar organisations. Any awkward moments? We were wearing the same shirt. Good table manners? Terrible. But so are mine, so it took the pressure off. Best thing about Jonathan? He\u2019s just a really lovely human being. Would you introduce him to your friends? I did, and they loved him! Describe Jonathan in three words Kind, fun, cute. What do you think he made of you? He probably thinks I\u2019m bat-shit crazy.

Police say there was a huge surge in people handing guns in at the last minute, with more than 4,000 surrendered in the last week. \u201cWe kept our collection events open late last night to ensure those firearms owners who left it to the last minute did have the opportunity to do the right thing,\u201d Clement said. \u201cPolice welcome any opportunity to reduce harm in our communities and ultimately, the more than 30,000 hand-ins indicate that firearms owners understood the why \u2013 that we hope to never again see the kind of attack we saw in Christchurch.\u201d Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern banned semi-automatic weapons and launched a gun amnesty and buyback scheme earlier this year, after a March shooting in Christchurch where a man is accused of gunning down 51 Muslims in two mosques. Police say there were 685 collection events across the country and that police went to more than 270 people\u2019s homes where they had a number of firearms or were unable to travel. More than forty dealers collected more than 6,000 firearms on behalf of police. \u201cPolice really have made every effort to provide frequent and accessible options to firearms owners so there really were no excuses for not taking part,\u201d Clement said. This included 37 gunsmiths who helped firearms owner modify their guns to comply with the law. But Clement had a warning for those who had defied the buyback scheme: \u201cFor anyone that has refused to abide by the law, my advice to you is to go to a station and hand in your firearm under amnesty now.\u201d He said those who missed the deadline would not be eligible for compensation, but if they don\u2019t surrender their firearms they would potentially be liable for prosecution and loss of licence. Almost NZ$100m ($66.1m) was paid in compensation to gun owners.",

Graham died in February 2018 and was honored at a US capitol memorial service, where Trump <a href=\"https://www.christianpost.com/news/billy-graham-honored-capitol-memorial-service-trump-dad-love-america-pastor-219766/\">described him</a> as \u201can ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God\u2019s grace.\u201d </p> <p>Graham\u2019s son, Franklin, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/franklin-graham-donald-trump-6b18159f-d481-48e2-9eb3-ea48f4eb26aa.html\">remains an ardent supporter of the president</a>. </p> <p>But Christianity Today still attracts 4.3 million monthly online reader among a demographic, evangelical Christians, that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. </p> <p>Here\u2019s an excerpt <a href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/december-web-only/trump-should-be-removed-from-office.html\">from the editorial</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But the facts in this instance are unambiguous: The president of the United States attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president\u2019s political opponents. That is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral.</p> <p>The reason many are not shocked about this is that this president has dumbed down the idea of morality in his administration. He has hired and fired a number of people who are now convicted criminals. He himself has admitted to immoral actions in business and his relationship with women, about which he remains proud. His Twitter feed alone\u2014with its habitual string of mischaracterizations, lies, and slanders\u2014is a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused.</p> </blockquote> <p> The president was clearly irked by the article, posting two tweets this morning branding the publication a \u201cfar left magazine\u201d and arguing he has done \u201cmore for the evangelical community\u201d than any other president in history. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1207997319821615105\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">....have a Radical Left nonbeliever, who wants to take your religion &amp; your guns, than Donald Trump as your President.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for sticking around for the tail end of this momentous week. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s major stories: Nancy Pelosi made a point to emphasize in an interview that Trump would go down in history as an impeached president. \u201cHe\u2019ll be impeached for ever,\u201d the House speaker said. \u201cNo matter what the Senate does. He\u2019s impeached for ever because he violated our Constitution.\u201d Trump accepted the House speaker\u2019s invitation to deliver his annual state of the union address on Feb. 4, one day after the Democratic presidential caucuses in Iowa. The timing also means the president will likely speak to Congress shortly after being acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Trump suggested Pelosi should be impeached for holding back the articles of impeachment from the Senate, even though members of Congress cannot be impeached. The Democratic national committee announced the requirements to qualify for the January debate, which could eliminate all but five candidates \u2013 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 from the debate stage. Trump continued to lash out against Christianity Today after the evangelical magazine suggested the president should be removed from office. The inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security said immigration agents had not engaged in \u201cmisconduct or malfeasance\u201d regarding the deaths in custody of two migrant children last December. Bernie Sanders spoke with my colleague Sam Levin this morning, and reiterated his critique of Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and billionaires: They will tell you, \u2018It doesn\u2019t impact me. It really doesn\u2019t mean anything to me.\u2019 That is clearly nonsensical. Why would billionaires and wealthy people be making large contributions if it didn\u2019t mean something to them? The Vermont senator also addressed concerns that his nomination could lead to a Democratic defeat similar to that of Jeremy Corbyn and the British Labour party\u2019s recent shellacking: The United Kingdom, last I heard, is not the United States. Brexit is not a major part of what this campaign is about. The issues that I am campaigning on, in fact, are precisely the issues the American people support. Talk about raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. Four years ago when I introduced that concept, it was a radical idea. Not radical anymore. Read the full interview here. It\u2019s the Friday afternoon before Christmas, so please forgive me for sharing this article, a startlingly in-depth investigation into the most dedicated editor of the Wikipedia page of Pete Buttigieg. Another interesting report from the Washington Post: over the past few days, the White House threatened to veto the year-end spending package necessary to avert a government shutdown before Saturday unless the House dropped language about military aid for Ukraine. Per the Post: The Ukraine provision was one of several items the White House drew a hard line on during negotiations to finalize the spending legislation, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the developments. It would have required the White House to swiftly release $250 million in defense money for Ukraine that was part of the spending package. The White House this year refused to release congressionally appropriated defense aid to Kyiv during a period when President Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump\u2019s request of Zelensky as the White House delayed the aid was at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 decision to impeach Trump this week on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Read the whole report here. White House aide Stephen Miller has pushed to embed ICE agents in the Office of Refugee Resettlement, in apparent circumvention of federal laws, the Washington Post reports. Unaccompanied migrant children are cared for by the ORR, which is part of the department of health and human services (HHS), and congress has passed laws to keep the program separate from deportation enforcement efforts. But after the White House tried and failed to \u201cembed\u201d ICE agents in the agency, it did extract a concession from HHS: They agreed to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to collect fingerprints and other biometric information from adults seeking to claim migrant children at government shelters. If those adults are deemed ineligible to take custody of a child, ICE could then use their information to target them for arrest and deportation. Read the rest of the Washington Post\u2019s report here. The inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security found no \u201cmisconduct or malfeasance\u201d in the deaths of two migrant children last December, according to BuzzFeed News. Jakelin Caal Maquin, 7, and Felipe G\u00f3mez Alonzo, 8, died in US custody last winter after crossing the border with their fathers and being detained by Customs and Border Protection. Both died from infections that led to sepsis, according to the report. Last week, CBP refused to allow a group of doctors in San Diego access to detained migrant children to provide them with flu vaccines. CBP has said that it only detains children for less than 72 hours, making medical services unnecessary, but government records have shown children and adults held for longer. Since we already had Jane Lynch, it seems only fair to check in on the rest of the day\u2019s weird celebrity/politician match-ups... Jack Nicholson was spotted at a Bernie Sanders rally: And here\u2019s an image that will set Hacker News aflame ... Speaking of billionaires... the two billionaire candidates in the Democratic presidential primary spent about $15m on television ads in California in advance of yesterday\u2019s debate, my colleague Sam Levin reports. What could you do with that kind of money in a state with 59,000 homeless residents? Well, house some of them, to start. Rev Andy Bales of the Union Rescue Mission told Sam that $15m could provide immediate if temporary shelter for approximately 1,800 homeless people from LA\u2019s Skid Row. Alternatively, that kind of money could fund 30 new units of supportive housing, providing longterm housing for about 50 people. Read the rest of Sam\u2019s report here. The Trump campaign will not be, well, turning the other cheek on this one. Hello everyone! This is Julia Carrie Wong, reporting in from a wine cave somewhere north of San Francisco where I\u2019ve been hanging out with my good pal Jane Lynch. Is she joking? Is she serious? It\u2019s hard to tell, but according to a quick search of federal elections filings, a Jane Lynch who lists her profession as actor and residence as Los Angeles has made the following donations to presidential campaigns this year: $2700 to Pete Buttigieg, $100 to Elizabeth Warren, and $100 to Marianne Williamson. That\u2019s it from me after a historic week in Washington. My west coast colleague, Julia Carrie Wong, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Nancy Pelosi made a point to emphasize in an interview that Trump would go down in history as an impeached president. \u201cHe\u2019ll be impeached for ever,\u201d the House speaker said. \u201cNo matter what the Senate does. He\u2019s impeached for ever because he violated our Constitution.\u201d Trump accepted the House speaker\u2019s invitation to deliver his annual state of the union address on Feb. 4, one day after the Democratic presidential caucuses in Iowa. The timing also means the president will likely speak to Congress shortly after being acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Trump suggested Pelosi should be impeached for holding back the articles of impeachment from the Senate, even though members of Congress cannot be impeached. The Democratic national committee announced the requirements to qualify for the January debate, which could eliminate all but five candidates -- Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar -- from the debate stage. Trump continued to lash out against Christianity Today after the evangelical magazine suggested the president should be removed from office. Julia will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump has now sent a tweet suggesting Nancy Pelosi should be impeached as House speaker for holding up the articles of impeachment, even though members of Congress cannot actually be impeached. The Constiution specifies the House can only impeach the \u201cPresident, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States,\u201d and the Senate detemined in 1799 that members of Congress do not qualify as \u201cCivil Officers of the United States.\u201d According to Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution, members of Congress can be expelled for \u201cdisorderly behavior\u201d if two-thirds of their colleagues support their removal. But expulsion and impeachment are different mechanisms of removal. Trump just sent a tweet declaring his \u201cFULL Endorsement\u201d for Jeff Van Drew, the congressman who switched his party affiliation to Republican after opposing the president\u2019s impeachment. \u201cSouth Jersey is TRUMP COUNTRY, so I know ALL NJ Republicans will join me in supporting Jeff Van Drew,\u201d the president wrote. The tweet comes one day after Van Drew appeared alongside Trump in the Oval Office and declared his \u201cundying\u201d support for the president, setting off plenty of Twitter heckling. Van Drew won his congressional seat as a Democrat last year with 53% of the vote, so it\u2019s possible the district could change hands. But the Cook Political Report has rated the seat as \u201cLean Republican\u201d following Van Drew\u2019s party switch. Eric Ueland, Trump\u2019s legislative affairs director, said the president is \u201cbaffled\u201d by Nancy Pelosi\u2019s threat to hold back the House-passed articles of impeachment from the Senate. \u201cI think the president is completely baffled at the theory that Nancy Pelosi appears to have that somehow holding back impeachment articles will leverage some sort of specific behavior out of the Senate,\u201d Ueland told CBS News. The legislative affairs director added it would be \u201cconstitutionally questionable\u201d and \u201cextraordinarily unprecedented\u201d if Pelosi held back the articles of impeachment. White House counsel Pat Cipollone had a \u201cbrief conversation\u201d with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell as he and Trump\u2019s legisaltive affairs director, Eric Ueland, toured Capitol Hill to look at potential locations for the eventual impeachment trial. Shortly after Trump bragged that he has been the best president for \u201creligion itself,\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg sent this tweet. Buttigieg has often discussed his faith on the campaign trail and has used it to explain his political positions. For example, the Indiana mayor got into a bit of a feud earlier this year with Vice President Mike Pence, who signed a law as governor of the state that LGBTQ advocates feared would allow businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples. \u201cIf me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade,\u201d Buttigieg said in April. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand: that if you\u2019ve got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\u201d Congress has no more votes scheduled before the holidays, but the Senate is already looking ahead to its 2020 business. Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the finance committee, has announced a Jan. 7 markup session for the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which the House approved yesterday. The Democratic-controlled House approved the bill by a vote of 385 to 41, so it seems likely the Republican-controlled Senate will pass the legislation, which Trump is eager to claim credit for. But at a press conference yesterday, Nancy Pelosi praised the House Democratic caucus for working to get the bill passed. \u201cOf course we\u2019ll take credit for it,\u201d the House speaker said. \u201cIt would have collateral benefit for the president. I don\u2019t care about that. We had an opportunity to do something very important for America\u2019s people.\u201d Trump then lashed out against Pelosi on Twitter -- claiming the House speaker, who oversaw months of negotiations with US trade representative Robert Lighthizer, \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know what [the bill] says.\u201d Two senior Trump advisers, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and legislative affairs director Eric Ueland, are visiting Capitol Hill to view locations where the president\u2019s eventual impeachment trial could take place. \u201cIt will be a good straightforward run-through,\u201d Ueland said. Trump has accepted the House speaker\u2019s invitation and will deliver his annual state of the union address on Feb. 4, one day after the Iowa caucuses. \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump has accepted the Speaker\u2019s invitation to deliver the State of the Union Address on February 4, 2020,\u201d White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley said in a statement. The timing means Trump will likely deliver the annual speech shortly after he is acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Joe Biden seems to be taking the high road after Sarah Sanders, Trump\u2019s former press secretary, sent a now-deleted tweet mocking the former vice president for his history of stuttering. During last night\u2019s debate, Biden reflected upon children he has met on the campaign trail who have asked him for help because they also struggle with stuttering. To emphasize the point, Biden did an impression of his own past stutter. Shortly afterwards, Sanders sent a tweet reading, \u201cI I I I I I I I I I I I I I I hhhave absolutely no idea what Biden is talking about.\u201d Biden quickly replied on Twitter, \u201cI\u2019ve worked my whole life to overcome a stutter. And it\u2019s my great honor to mentor kids who have experienced the same. It\u2019s called empathy. Look it up.\u201d Sanders later deleted the tweet and apologized, claiming she did not know about Biden\u2019s history of stuttering. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t know that about you and that is commendable,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI apologize and should have made my point respectfully.\u201d Less than two months after dropping out of the presidential race, Beto O\u2019Rourke has launched a political action group meant to boost Democratic candidates in his home state of Texas. In an email to supporters, O\u2019Rourke said the group, which is called Powered by People, will bring \u201ctogether volunteers from around the state to work on the most important races in Texas.\u201d \u201cPowered by People will organize grassroots volunteers to do the tough, necessary work that wins elections: registering Texans to vote (especially those that have just moved to Texas and those who are just turning 18), knocking on their doors, making phone calls, and connecting the dots so that we all understand that in order to make progress on the issues we care most about \u2014 like gun violence, healthcare and climate \u2014 we will have to register, volunteer and vote,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. It\u2019s worth noting what a historic week it has been for Nancy Pelosi. In less than 48 hours, the House speaker oversaw the impeachment of a president, shepherded through a renegotiated North American trade deal and invited Trump to deliver his state of the union address. Meanwhile, Trump is still stewing over the evangelical magazine Christianity Today calling for his removal from office, claiming he has been the best president for \u201creligion itself.\u201d Despite the magazine\u2019s censure, Trump\u2019s approval rating among white evangelicals, whose support he will need to win reelection, remains very high. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s letter inviting Trump to deliver his state of the union seemed to take on an added meaning considering the House\u2019s vote this week to impeach the president for abusing his power and obstructing Congress. \u201cIn their great wisdom, our Founders crafted a Constitution based on a system of separation of powers: three co-equal branches acting as checks on each other,\u201d the House speaker wrote. \u201cIn the spirit of respecting our Constitution, I invite you to deliver your State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, February 4, 2020 in the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives.\u201d Nancy Pelosi has invited Trump to deliver his annual state of the union address on Feb. 4, one day after the Democratic presidential caucuses in Iowa. The timing of the state of the union also likely means Trump will deliver his remarks shortly after being acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign has just announced an endorsement from actor Kevin Costner, who will introduce the presidential candidate at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa, this Sunday. Costner starred in the 1989 movie \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d which centers on an Iowa corn farmer building a baseball diamond in his fields after hearing a voice saying, \u201cIf you build it, he will come.\u201d This is Joanie Greve in Washington, taking over the blog from Oliver Laughland, and there is some more debate news today following last night\u2019s face-off. The Democratic National Committee has announced the requirements to qualify for the January debate in Des Moines, Iowa, and they could eliminate all but a handful of candidates. According to the requirements, candidates must attract 225,000 donors and hit 5% in at least four national or early-voting state polls. Candidates can also hit 7% in two early-voting state surveys to meet the polling requirement. These heightened thresholds could eliminate everyone from the debate stage except Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang, who participated in last night\u2019s debate, have not yet met the polling requirement, and there will be few surveys taken over the holidays, complicating their qualification path. Here\u2019s how things stand at lunch: Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, has said she shown Donald Trump \u201cthe power of the gavel\u201d and has impeached the president \u201cforever\u201d. The combative talk comes as Democrats and Republicans in the senate continue to battle out the parameters of a senate trial. Ivanka Trump has defended her father\u2019s relationship with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani who she described as a \u201creal warrior and a great, great mayor\u201d. Donald Trump is expected to sign a multibillion dollar defense bill later today. Trump also lashed out at Christianity Today, an evangelical newspaper that has called for his impeachment. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has told the Associated Press that she has shown the president \u201cthe power of the gavel\u201d by impeaching the president \u201cfor ever\u201d. \u201cHe just got impeached. He\u2019ll be impeached for ever. No matter what the Senate does. He\u2019s impeached for ever because he violated our constitution,\u201d she said during an interview on Thursday that was published today. \u201cIf I did nothing else, he saw the power of the gavel there And it wasn\u2019t me, it was all of our members making their own decision.\u201d She also urged Senate majority leader, the Republican Mitch McConnell, to bring forward votes on the raft of bills passed by Democrats in the House since the 2018 midterms. \u201cAs the election approaches, we would not want these to be election issues, we would like them to be accomplished legislation,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they either pass the bills or pay a price for not passing bills.\u201d Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior advisor, has given a particularly soft interview to CBS News. The full interview won\u2019t air until 29 December, but the outlet have released a partial transcript. There\u2019s not a huge amount of probing in there, but Trump does appear to defend her father\u2019s judgement when it comes to his relationship with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani is at the centre of the Ukraine scandal for his role in an unorthodox diplomatic back channel tasked with setting up an investigation into Trump\u2019s political rivals in Ukraine, She said: I know Rudy Giuliani in a very different context as one of the greatest mayors in the history of this country and- and a real hero in New York. So that is- that is the experience I\u2019ve had with Rudy for a very long period of time. He\u2019s smart and thoughtful and- and- and a real warrior and was a great- a great mayor. She also said her father is \u201cenergized\u201d by the impeachment process. The president has said that a formal signing of a US trade deal with China is \u201cbeing arranged\u201d after he spoke directly with president Xi Jinping today. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said yesterday that the nations sides would sign the Phase 1 trade pact, which calls for U.S. farm product exports to China to double over the next two years, at the beginning of January. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has urged the Trump administration to withhold signing the deal until two Canadian detained in China are released by authorities. Despite the new deal, an analysis by Bloomberg News suggests it will not cover the remaining costs of the ongoing trade war between China and the US, as the majority of tariffs will remain in place. Here\u2019s some more on Washington state representative Matthew Shea, the local politician found to have \u201cparticipated in an act of domestic terrorism against the United States\u201d, according to a report produced for the state legislature. This from Jason Wilson, who has reported on Shea for the Guardian. It was Wilson\u2019s reporting along with other local outlets, that led to the legislature commissioning the investigation: The report further contends that in a document entitled the Biblical Basis for War, Shea \u201cadvocated the replacement of US democracy with a theocracy and the killing of all males who do not agree\u201d. In its conclusion, while commenting that Shea is not an \u201cimminent direct threat \u2026 it is more probable than not that Representative Shea is likely to plan, direct and engage in additional future conflicts that could carry with them significant risk of bloodshed and loss of life\u201d. It adds: \u201cRepresentative Shea presents a present and growing threat of risk to others through political violence.\u201d In response to the report, the Washington Republican state legislative minority leader, JT Wilcox, announced on Twitter that Shea had been suspended from the house Republican caucus. The report was commissioned by the house and produced by an outside agency, the Rampart Group, following reporting from the Guardian and other local and national outlets on Shea\u2019s activities. It says Shea \u201cplanned the 2016 takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge; engaged in the conflict by directing Cows (Coalition of Western States) members and militias in support of the takeover; and traveled to Burns, Oregon, and met with refuge armed occupiers contrary to appeals and warnings from law enforcement and Oregon state elected officials\u201d. You can read more of Jason\u2019s work on this below: Donald Trump has responded to an editorial in the mainstream evangelical news outlet Christianity Today, which called for his removal from office. The outlet was founded in 1956 by the famous evangelical preacher Billy Graham. Graham died in February 2018 and was honored at a US capitol memorial service, where Trump described him as \u201can ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God\u2019s grace.\u201d Graham\u2019s son, Franklin, remains an ardent supporter of the president. But Christianity Today still attracts 4.3 million monthly online reader among a demographic, evangelical Christians, that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the editorial: But the facts in this instance are unambiguous: The president of the United States attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president\u2019s political opponents. That is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral. The reason many are not shocked about this is that this president has dumbed down the idea of morality in his administration. He has hired and fired a number of people who are now convicted criminals. He himself has admitted to immoral actions in business and his relationship with women, about which he remains proud. His Twitter feed alone\u2014with its habitual string of mischaracterizations, lies, and slanders\u2014is a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused. The president was clearly irked by the article, posting two tweets this morning branding the publication a \u201cfar left magazine\u201d and arguing he has done \u201cmore for the evangelical community\u201d than any other president in history. Welcome to our live coverage of US politics. Here are some of the stories we\u2019re tracking this morning. Seven of the top Democratic candidates for president took part in the final primary debate of the year last night, which say mayor Pete Buttigeg take the brunt of criticism with weeks left before the first vote. Donald Trump is expected to sign a spending deal today that includes a $738bn defense bill. The package will add funding for the president\u2019s much maligned space force. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, continue to clash over the next steps in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. Pelosi has withheld the two articles of impeachment, passed by the House earlier this week, arguing the majority leader has declined to indicate a fair trial in the Senate. Matthew Shea, a Republican state representative in Washington state, has been suspended from the party caucus after a report prepared by the state legislature found he had participated \u201cin an act of domestic terrorism\u201d.",

When asked about concerns regarding too many older men in power, he interjected, \u201cAnd I\u2019m white as well!\u201d adding, \u201cThe issue is not old or young, male or female, the issue is working people standing up taking on the billionaire class.\u201d When he pivoted to the climate crisis on a question about racism, he earned a rebuke from a moderator. Asked about the nearly all white lineup at Thursday\u2019s debate, the senator promised on Friday, \u201cWhen people turn on the television and see my cabinet and our administration, it will look like America \u2026 in terms of racial diversity, ethnic diversity, religious diversity \u2026 We\u2019ve got to work hard to undo the racism and the xenophobia of the Trump administration and one way you do that is to create an inclusive administration.\u201d He declined to say whether he would select a vice-president running mate who was a person of color: \u201cIt\u2019s too early.\u201d Asked if he had fun at the debate, the senator sighed. \u201cFun is the wrong word. It\u2019s frustrating! You don\u2019t have time to get into the issues.\u201d",
