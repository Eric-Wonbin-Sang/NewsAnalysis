Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

      "bodyText": "The Western Australian Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, has dismissed suggestions from WA police that they need a directive from cabinet to act on a report showing that police issue three times as many traffic fines to Indigenous drivers. An internal police briefing note, published by Guardian Australia, showed Aboriginal drivers receive 3.2 times more fines issued during traffic stops than non-Aboriginal drivers, but slightly fewer than non-Aboriginal drivers in infringements issued by traffic cameras. The briefing note said an analysis of five years of traffic infringement data in WA showed a \u201cclear ethnic disparity\u201d in traffic fines issued by police, which contributed to a cycle of unpaid fines and was \u201clikely to lead to further police attention\u201d. WA police said they had not done anything in response to the briefing note, dated 13 February 2019, because reducing Aboriginal incarceration was a priority for Mark McGowan\u2019s government and therefore deciding on actions that could reduce Indigenous incarceration was a matter for cabinet. But Wyatt said that \u201cpolice can, and do, act on the findings of internal briefing notes, particularly around operational matters\u201d. The minister said he was not personally aware of the briefing note. \u201cHowever, I understand the broad issues captured in the note were raised with the cross-agency officers\u2019 group responsible for progressing the Aboriginal wellbeing target,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be considered as part of the group\u2019s policy development going forward.\u201d Wyatt said he had been \u201cimpressed\u201d with the police commissioner Chris Dawson\u2019s efforts to date to improve the relationship between police and Aboriginal people. The briefing note states that an analysis of traffic infringements between 2010 and 2014 showed a \u201cclear ethnic disparity\u201d in police-initiated traffic stops. \u201cThese differences are large enough to suggest an uncomfortable distinction between automated camera and police-initiated traffic enforcement, with this distinction heavily correlated with Aboriginality,\u201d the briefing note said. \u201cIf the automated cameras are assumed to objectively reflect any actual differences in on-the-road behaviour, our data suggest that Aboriginal and non-Aborignal drivers are equally prone to breaking traffic laws.\u201d The trend was largely unchanged in data from January 2017 to mid-2018, when Aboriginal drivers still received more than three times as many penalty units from police stops than non-Aboriginal drivers, and roughly the same number from cameras. Dawson told Perth radio station 6PR on Thursday that there were \u201clessons to be learned\u201d from the report, but did not respond directly to questions about whether he believed WA Police targeted Aboriginal people. He pointed at the final lines of the report, which said the analysis \u201cby no means provide[s] conclusive evidence that deliberate bias exists.\u201d The report\u2019s author, Dr Geoffrey Barnes, told Guardian Australia that comment, which preceded a call for more research, was a standard caveat on all scientific research.

That practice only applied to court fines, not traffic infringements, unless the infringement was dealt with before the court. The legislation, which is yet to pass parliament, would also allow authorities to garnish the salary of a person who has unpaid fines until the debt is cleared. It was prompted by the 2014 death in custody of the Yamatji woman Ms Dhu. Monique Hurley, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said racially motivated over-policing could cause \u201cenormous harm\u201d. \u201cThis data shows clearly that WA police have a serious racism problem,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cFor WA police and the WA government to just sit on their hands in the face of this stark injustice is inexcusable.

Rustin, who worked alongside Martin Luther King Jr and helped organize the March on Washington, was arrested in 1953 for having consensual sex, convicted under a \u201cvagrancy\u201d law long used to prosecute LGBTQ+ people. Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Wednesday that his office would pardon Rustin, who died in 1987, and also allow others subjected to this kind of discriminatory policing to apply for clemency. Rustin, who also helped organize the Montgomery bus boycott and who was given a posthumous presidential medal of freedom by Barack Obama, was sentenced to 60 days in jail and forced to register as a sex offender after his arrest. Black and LGBTQ+ lawmakers praised the pardon for Rustin, which some of them had formally requested.

In 1997, California allowed people convicted under that law to get off the sex offender registry, but that process did not remove their underlying conviction and did not constitute a pardon. The initiative unveiled this week seeks to identify eligible pardon candidates and allow people to apply. A spokesperson said the office did not have numbers on how many people might be eligible, and it is unclear if anyone currently incarcerated would be affected. Newsom\u2019s announcement said he was tackling \u201chistoric homophobia in the justice system\u201d. But activists said they would like to see the effort extend to contemporary discrimination in the way LGBTQ+ people are arrested, prosecuted, sentenced and ultimately denied release. Lenz, who is part of a coalition that lobbies the governor\u2019s office for the release of trans prisoners, says she would like to see the pardon effort extend to currently imprisoned trans people, who are disproportionately represented in the system, and can face high rates of violence and abuse inside. Survived and Punished is one of the partner groups, which advocates for survivors of abuse and domestic violence who were incarcerated after defending themselves, such as the famous case of Cyntoia Brown, sentenced to life at age 16 for murder, but recently released. There are numerous trans women incarcerated with similar cases in California, said Lenz, who estimated that Newsom has received at least 50 clemency requests on behalf of trans prisoners but has yet to grant any. Janetta Johnson, a trans rights activist in San Francisco who was formerly incarcerated, agrees that for the trans community \u201ctheir crimes are survival crimes because of lack of opportunities, lack of access to employment and housing\u201d. Some end up in prison because they fought their abusers, she said, and trans people often face harsher sentences. \u201c[The governor] needs to acknowledge the discrimination and punitive punishment for the queer and trans community.\u201d Lenz has also advocated for queer cisgender women who have faced homophobic prosecution and abuse inside, and she noted that biases throughout the process can make it especially hard to get pardons and releases for LGBTQ+ people. Amber-Rose Howard, the executive director for Californians United for a Responsible Budget, a group that works to reduce the prison population, said she was pleased to see the news about Rustin and the clemency initiative, but that she hoped it would be a first step: \u201cWe will not address mass incarceration until we start to think about people convicted of more serious offenses.\u201d While Rustin\u2019s offense was a misdemeanor, Howard noted that many queer and trans people languishing in California prisons today were locked up for serious felonies, some sentenced to life without parole, meaning they will die inside if not granted a pardon: \u201cI hope the conversation opens up \u2026 and I\u2019m really hoping to see a lot of pardons answered.\u201d Lynly Egyes, the Transgender Law Center legal director, noted that there were a range of laws that were still used in the US to criminalize trans people, such as loitering ordinances that have been described as \u201cwalking while trans\u201d offenses. In addition to granting pardons to people criminalized in this way, a governor\u2019s pardon power could also save immigrants from detention and deportation when they are facing removal due to a criminal conviction. \u201cI would really hope the governor is using pardons to help all people who need to be released,\u201d she said. Newsom has commuted the sentences of just over 20 people in his first year in office. His predecessor, Jerry Brown, issued commutation orders for 283 people. A Newsom spokesperson did not respond to questions about advocates\u2019 calls for broader pardons for LGBTQ+ people. The announcement on Wednesday echoes the recent apologies from police officials about the historic cases of law enforcement violence against LGBTQ+ people in the infamous Stonewall riot and similar attacks. Newsom similarly made made history when he formally apologized to Native Americans last year, acknowledging the brutal genocide and \u201cwar of extermination\u201d. Indigenous leaders in the state praised the announcement but also called for specific reparations.",

Mohammed Zahir Khan, a shopkeeper from Sunderland, was sentenced to four years and six months in May 2018 for nine counts of sharing Islamist material and calling for \u201cdeath to shia\u201d Muslims. Investigators say he is due for automatic release on 28 February \u2013 at the mid-point of his sentence, allowing for time spend on remand \u2013 unless the government successfully changes the law to make the minimum time served two-thirds of the sentence levied at court. Khan initially denied the postings were his, but once police and prosecutors had demonstrated he was the author, he switched his plea to guilty, but said that he had been reckless and not set out to encourage terrorism, according to a summary of the case from the Crown Prosecution Service. Some of his tweets were in support of Isis. \u201cWelcome to the year of fear, IS will make this one the deadliest ever.

Sudesh Amman, 20, was killed by police after he stabbed two people just days after being automatically released from prison for charges of disseminating terrorist material. A Whitehall official said the legislation would be introduced in the Commons on 11 February.

The government said it was not aiming to retrospectively alter the sentence handed out by the court; this is a change to release arrangements that technically come under the administration of a sentence. \u201cIt would be our position you can change those without being considered to breach an offender\u2019s human rights,\u201d the official said.

Matt Hancock, the health secretary, raised further questions over Britain\u2019s relationship with the ECHR. When asked what he made of the warnings, he said he had heard the arguments from those against the changes but that they should go ahead. Lawyers think prisoners could try to appeal against the proposed changes as the ECHR contains guidelines on retrospective changes to prison sentences. Hancock told Sky News: \u201cOften in government you get a point where you have to balance the rights of different people and in this case it\u2019s weighing up the rights of an individual who\u2019s committed terrorist offences and his right to leave prison early against the rights of people to walk around Streatham or anywhere in our country free from the threat of terrorism.\u201d The convention is enforced by the European court of human rights, an institution that is separate to the EU and to which Britain remains a member and is bound by its rules.",

      "bodyText": "The sixth and final woman to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexually attacking them took the witness stand at his rape trial on Wednesday, describing in harrowing detail how he allegedly groped her in a Los Angeles hotel bathroom in 2013. The jury in the New York supreme court were once again subjected to a graphic and distressing account of an alleged forced sex act imposed on an aspiring young actor by the once-powerful movie producer. Lauren Young, 30, a model from Pennsylvania, recounted how she had been invited by a female acquaintance to the Montage hotel in Beverly Hills on 19 February 2013. She went in the hope of showing Weinstein a film script she was writing based on her life. The film producer appeared in the lobby of the hotel and they began talking about the reality TV show America\u2019s Next Top Model which he suggested Young might be able to join. They continued talking about the show as Weinstein asked Young and the other woman up to his hotel room, she told the jury.

One of the two main accusers in the case, who alleges she was raped by Weinstein in a New York hotel in 2013, told the jury that he appeared to be \u201cintersex\u201d. \u201cHe does not have testicles and it appears he has a vagina,\u201d the accuser said in testimony earlier this week. On Tuesday prosecutors showed the jury official photographs of the movie mogul\u2019s body. The images were handed to jurors to inspect without being visible to the public in the courtroom. Young is one of three witnesses who have been included in the trial even though their allegations are not actively being prosecuted. They have been called to provide evidence of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d, a type of supporting testimony known as Molineux witnesses under New York law.

      "body": "<p>Sky Comedy\u2019s latest import certainly lands with a splash. Danny McBride\u2019s HBO comedy, centred on the astonishing world of US megachurches and the extremely wealthy people who run them, opens with a 24-hour baptism marathon in China, as 5,000 converts line up to be dunked. Overseen by John Goodman\u2019s towering patriarch Eli, the Gemstone brothers, Jesse (played by McBride) and Kelvin (the elastic-faced Adam DeVine), are unable to stop bickering even in this most spiritual of moments. They splash each other. Then the wave machine comes on, and with it, disco lights and a thumping EDM soundtrack. In the name of this father and these sons, the holy spirit is lacking.</p> <p>As a concept, God, guns and theme parks should provide rich material. Across the US south, the Gemstones have built arena-sized places of worship and reaped the rewards, living in grotesque excess as the tithes keep rolling in. One scene in particular shows that this is a lucrative business; after Eli has preached the importance of donations, to \u201csave 5,000 Chinese souls\u201d, we cut to the backstage area, which looks like an outtake from The Sopranos, as the many money-counting machines get to work on the piles of cash.</p> <p>Like any TV family, the Gemstones are deeply dysfunctional. Eli is mourning his wife, Aimee-Lee, with whom he built his empire in the 80s, and the throwback footage of the pair\u2019s televangelist days is one of the highlights of the first episode. Without her, the family is falling apart. The three children exist on a sliding scale between intellectually challenged and amoral.

      "bodyText": "Sky Comedy\u2019s latest import certainly lands with a splash. Danny McBride\u2019s HBO comedy, centred on the astonishing world of US megachurches and the extremely wealthy people who run them, opens with a 24-hour baptism marathon in China, as 5,000 converts line up to be dunked. Overseen by John Goodman\u2019s towering patriarch Eli, the Gemstone brothers, Jesse (played by McBride) and Kelvin (the elastic-faced Adam DeVine), are unable to stop bickering even in this most spiritual of moments. They splash each other. Then the wave machine comes on, and with it, disco lights and a thumping EDM soundtrack. In the name of this father and these sons, the holy spirit is lacking. As a concept, God, guns and theme parks should provide rich material. Across the US south, the Gemstones have built arena-sized places of worship and reaped the rewards, living in grotesque excess as the tithes keep rolling in. One scene in particular shows that this is a lucrative business; after Eli has preached the importance of donations, to \u201csave 5,000 Chinese souls\u201d, we cut to the backstage area, which looks like an outtake from The Sopranos, as the many money-counting machines get to work on the piles of cash. Like any TV family, the Gemstones are deeply dysfunctional. Eli is mourning his wife, Aimee-Lee, with whom he built his empire in the 80s, and the throwback footage of the pair\u2019s televangelist days is one of the highlights of the first episode. Without her, the family is falling apart. The three children exist on a sliding scale between intellectually challenged and amoral. Judy, a fun turn by Vice Principals\u2019 Edi Patterson, is sidelined by the men, no matter how desperate she is to thrive. \u201cFlying around on private planes being leaders, that\u2019s men\u2019s business,\u201d Jesse tells her.

That is what I was worried the most about, because that would have had a massive impact. But I can hope that he is not long injured. It is not enough to dominate, we have to use our changes. We stuck to our gameplan, but in the last 15 minutes gave it away too easy. We didn\u2019t defend well. Against such an opponent this is not possible. They showed their quality and we lost the game. It is only about winning and losing, it\u2019s not about getting warm words. We must quickly turn the behaviour of getting the results back, this is what we are playing for. I am not happy.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3b39af8f086a28115a65f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-05T22:01:26.645Z\">10.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jose, with many perfectly timed pauses, delivers a bravura post-match soliloquy.</strong> \u201cI have to be honest. I think the best team lost. The best team on the pitch lost. But the team with more heart ... the team with the players who went to their limits ... the team who had so many difficulties, even to build a team ... the team who, on the bench, had options that were not options to change the game ... even Dele was in so difficult condition ... so my team deserved to win! The best team lost, but my team deserved to win. From the beginning I could feel immediately that the intensity level, conditions and freshness, they were much stronger than us. We tried to organise the team with the players we had available. We tried to build the puzzle, but some pieces were missing.

They dominated possession for the most part, at the home of last year\u2019s Champions League runners-up, and on another night would be celebrating victory. Spurs needed to dig deep to see them off. Once the pain subsides, they\u2019ll begin to feel good about themselves going forward.

But they kept battling, and the introduction of Dele Alli brought a little class to their play. He was involved in Lucas Moura\u2019s fine equaliser, then set up Son Heung-min for the winning penalty with a stunning pass. \u201cIt says a lot about the character we have in this team,\u201d a content but determined Dele tells BT Sport. \u201cIt was such a big game at the weekend [against Manchester City] that you can lose the momentum, and we didn\u2019t play our best. But it takes one little switch, and our second goal did that. I think we deserve a trophy but nobody is going to give it to us.

Long hopes to toe-poke home, but Lloris diverts it out for a corner with a crucial fingertip. The resulting set piece comes to nothing, but Saints could easily have had a couple of goals already.

If this recent history is any guide, then tonight\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round replay at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is a shoo-in for the eponymous hosts.</p> <p><strong>But not all recent history is against the Saints. </strong>Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side may have depended on a late Sofiane Boufal equaliser at St Mary\u2019s to force this replay, but they beat Jose Mourinho\u2019s men down by the Solent in the league on New Year\u2019s Day. They asked Spurs a few questions in defeat here back in September. And they\u2019ve scored in each of their last ten matches against Spurs. The top-line stats may not make for great reading for today\u2019s visitors, but all is not yet lost.</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s also the historical FA Cup record between these two clubs. </strong>They\u2019re level at three wins apiece, a story that stretches all the way back to 1902, when both teams were members of the Southern League. Saints won that tie after two replays, and went on to reach the final, where they lost to Sheffield United. They\u2019re still the last non-league side to reach the final. (For the sake of completion, Spurs were the holders that year, and <em>they\u2019re</em> still the last non-league side since the foundation of the Football League in 1888 to win the cup. Both records are likely to stand for a few years yet.)</p> <p><strong>Fast forward, and the last two FA Cup meetings between the teams have ended in routs. </strong>Ronnie Rosenthal smashing in a hat-trick in a 6-2 win for Spurs at the Dell in 1995; Gordon Strachan\u2019s side, spearheaded by James Beattie, humiliating former manager Glenn Hoddle\u2019s team 4-0 at St Mary\u2019s in 2003.</p> <p><strong>All of which is a roundabout way of saying: this could be great fun! </strong>Spurs are favourites, but these two have history, so anything could happen. Including extra-time and penalty kicks. One way or another, we\u2019ll have a blast finding out who\u2019ll host Norwich City in the fifth round. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>7.45pm GMT.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48c2c042c12264ad7ddcad30f95a527d6ea8b167\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48c2c042c12264ad7ddcad30f95a527d6ea8b167/0_0_5079_3386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tanguy Ndombele rocks up at the ground.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanguy Ndombele rocks up at the ground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-05T16:32:18.061Z\">at 4.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "David Hytner was in N17 to see Spurs sneak past Southampton, and keep their dream of a first FA Cup since 1991 alive. Here\u2019s his verdict. Enjoy, enjoy ... and thanks so much for reading this MBM. Congratulations to Tottenham; commiserations to the Saints. Nighty night! A disappointed Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl responds. \u201cThe worst thing to happen is to be out of the FA Cup with James Ward-Prowse injured, but it\u2019s good that he has only a cut. That is what I was worried the most about, because that would have had a massive impact. But I can hope that he is not long injured. It is not enough to dominate, we have to use our changes. We stuck to our gameplan, but in the last 15 minutes gave it away too easy. We didn\u2019t defend well. Against such an opponent this is not possible. They showed their quality and we lost the game. It is only about winning and losing, it\u2019s not about getting warm words. We must quickly turn the behaviour of getting the results back, this is what we are playing for. I am not happy.\u201d Jose, with many perfectly timed pauses, delivers a bravura post-match soliloquy. \u201cI have to be honest. I think the best team lost. The best team on the pitch lost. But the team with more heart ... the team with the players who went to their limits ... the team who had so many difficulties, even to build a team ... the team who, on the bench, had options that were not options to change the game ... even Dele was in so difficult condition ... so my team deserved to win! The best team lost, but my team deserved to win. From the beginning I could feel immediately that the intensity level, conditions and freshness, they were much stronger than us. We tried to organise the team with the players we had available. We tried to build the puzzle, but some pieces were missing. We fought to our limit.\u201d [applause, bouquets] Here\u2019s the revised fifth-round draw. Ties will be played the week commencing March 2. Chelsea v Liverpool Leicester City v Birmingham City Portsmouth v Arsenal Sheffield Wednesday v Manchester City Derby County v Manchester United Reading v Sheffield United Tottenham Hotspur v Norwich City West Bromwich Albion v Newcastle United As for Saints, who were less than a quarter-of-an-hour away from the fifth round? It\u2019ll hurt for a while, of course. But tonight\u2019s performance was more proof that Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl has Southampton moving in the right direction. They dominated possession for the most part, at the home of last year\u2019s Champions League runners-up, and on another night would be celebrating victory. Spurs needed to dig deep to see them off. Once the pain subsides, they\u2019ll begin to feel good about themselves going forward. Even if their wait for a second FA Cup will stretch to at least 45 years. Spurs celebrate more in relief than joy. For long stretches tonight, they weren\u2019t very good at all. But they kept battling, and the introduction of Dele Alli brought a little class to their play. He was involved in Lucas Moura\u2019s fine equaliser, then set up Son Heung-min for the winning penalty with a stunning pass. \u201cIt says a lot about the character we have in this team,\u201d a content but determined Dele tells BT Sport. \u201cIt was such a big game at the weekend [against Manchester City] that you can lose the momentum, and we didn\u2019t play our best. But it takes one little switch, and our second goal did that. I think we deserve a trophy but nobody is going to give it to us. We have to keep this momentum in all competitions, and we need to win something.\u201d Southampton were the best team for 75 minutes, but Spurs floored the accelerator at the business end of the match and somehow prevailed. A sign that it could be their year? It could be their year, you know. They host Norwich City in the fifth round. 90 min +4: Spurs take their own sweet time over a throw deep in Southampton territory. On the touchline, Mourinho throws frantic semaphore shapes, ordering his charges to keep concentrating. A place in the fifth round, which looked so far away 20 minutes ago, is so close now! 90 min +3: Ings sends a shot screaming over the Spurs bar, but it\u2019s an act of frustration, the offside flag having pinged up seconds before, putting a stop to Southampton\u2019s gallop. 90 min +1: Oh When The Spurs Go Marching In rings around the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. For the first time this evening, the home fans are winning the spiritual-off. 90 min: Alli glides down the inside left, thinks about shooting, then tees up Moura, who can\u2019t quite get a shot away. Spurs are suddenly swarming all over Saints. Can the visitors force extra time? They\u2019ve got five extra minutes to find something. 89 min: Breaking clock-management news: Sessegnon is replaced by Sanchez. Son whip-cracks the penalty into the bottom left, and Spurs get their reward for finally waking up in the last 15 minutes of this match! Saints must wonder what\u2019s happened to them. 86 min: PENALTY FOR SPURS! Fine work by Alli, who slips a diagonal pass in from the right. Son is free, and tries to round Gunn on the penalty spot. He goes left. Gunn sticks out an arm, and down Son goes. There wasn\u2019t much contact, but enough for the referee to point to the spot! 85 min: Adams is booked for a crude bodycheck on Aurier. Saints are rocking. Spurs have enjoyed 68% during the last five minutes. 84 min: Moura\u2019s bustle down the right wins a corner for Spurs. Alderweireld heads it harmlessly over the bar. Spurs have stepped it up in these closing stages, the first time in the evening they\u2019ve looked in control. 83 min: Romeu bumbles into Moura, and is booked for a second foul in 30 seconds. The first, on Son, saw the Spurs striker gesticulating for a card, which was a bit saucy of him. But this is the heat of battle, to be fair, so anything goes. 82 min: This match has descended into high-octane nonsense. Marvellous. Both teams seem hell bent on finding a late winner. The atmosphere crackles accordingly. 81 min: Long has picked up a minor knock and is replaced by Che Adams. 79 min: What a great cup tie this has been. Not entirely sure how Spurs have managed to keep up with Saints, but they\u2019ve stuck at it, despite being second best in midfield all evening. Out of nowhere, Spurs equalise! Moura and Alli one-two down the middle. Moura takes a touch to the right, sending Vestergaard the wrong way, and whipping a wonderful shot into the bottom left, past the outstretched arm of Gunn. The home fans explode in relief. Hopes of a first FA Cup since 1991 are still alive! 75 min: Redmond skitters down the inside left channel and nearly gets to the ball ahead of Lloris. Redmond goes over, Lloris draws his arm back. No contact, they say, though it wasn\u2019t 100 percent clear. Still, the officials are convinced that it wasn\u2019t a penalty, and in VAR we trust, right kids? 74 min: Saints deserve their lead. They\u2019ve been marvellous. Spurs have been all over the shop, mind, but take nothing away. A length-of-the-pitch move gives Saints the lead. Redmond races up the right from deep. He cuts inside adroitly, passing Winks with ease, and raking a sensational pass wide left for Ings, who drifts infield past Tanganga and plants a curler into the bottom right! Lloris had no chance. Ings is such a fine striker, though that goal was as much about Redmond. 71 min: Dier takes a speculative whack from distance. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner. Easily cleared. But Spurs come again through Son, who earns another and takes it himself from the left. Gunn comes off his line to punch clear semi-confidently. 70 min: A sore one for Son, as Stephens tries to kick the ball from under the prone striker but catches his arm. Neither referee nor VAR see any foul play, and Son\u2019s quickly up and running again, so all\u2019s well. 68 min: Long whips a cross in from the right. Lloris claims well with Ings lurking. Spurs go up the other end, Aurier sending a ball in from the right. His cross hits Vestergaard\u2019s arm, but the pair were standing right next to each other, and he\u2019ll not be getting the penalty he claims. 67 min: Yep, here comes Armstrong. He replaces Boufal, who has put in a shift, and receives a warm ovation from the travelling Saints fans for his efforts. 66 min: Spurs are struggling to get out of their own half. They\u2019ll not be pleased to see Stuart Armstrong pulling on his boots, a sign that Saints intend to go for this in the final stages. They\u2019ve been well on top pretty much from the get-go. 64 min: Now it\u2019s Alderweireld\u2019s turn to explode in anger, as Redmond wins a corner off him down the right. The defender\u2019s claiming no touch. From the set piece, Vestergaard is found free, six yards out, but heads straight at Lloris, who tips over. Goodness knows what Alderweireld\u2019s mood would be like had Lloris not made that save. The second corner comes to nothing. 62 min: Saints have enjoyed 63% possession since the restart. The home fans don\u2019t sound particularly enamoured with the fare on display, though a goal would of course change everything, if only for a night. \u201cIf Messi\u2019s looking for a new challenge may I humbly suggest he gives the Scottish Premiership a go, which is where Dundee United will be playing next season?\u201d Yes, folks, it\u2019s Simon McMahon. \u201cA swap deal with Lawrence Shankland (plus, say, 50 million euros to United) should see a deal completed.\u201d 61 min: Alli replaces Ndombele. Spurs, having made two quickfire changes in midfield, are momentarily all over the shop, allowing Redmond to skitter down the left into a lot of space. He\u2019s got options in the middle, but his cross is too close to Lloris, who gathers. 59 min: Spurs\u2019 new boy Fernandes is booked for a late clip on Boufal, who has diddled him out on the right flank. No complaints. In the dugout, Vertonghen continues to seethe and smoulder like a 1940s movie star. 58 min: ... but Saints aren\u2019t awarded it. Long descends into a wild fury. Spurs tear up the other end, Son seeing a shot deflected wide right for a corner that is given. Happily for the karmic order, nothing comes of the Spurs set piece. 57 min: Stephens finds some space down the right and whips low towards the near post. Long tries to turn the ball goalwards. Alderweireld blocks out for a corner ... 55 min: Moura spins in the midfield, away from Bednarek, who pulls him back. That\u2019s a deserved booking. Meanwhile Vertonghen reaches the dugout, and pointedly looks away as Mourinho gives him a consoling tap on the shoulder. He sits on the bench, chin balanced on fist. A deep funk. 54 min: Spurs make the first tactical change of the evening. Vertonghen is replaced by the new boy Gelson Fernandes. The big defender trudges around the perimeter with head bowed, deep in thought. He\u2019s not happy. 52 min: And now it\u2019s Spurs who pass up a great opportunity to take the lead. Sessegnon rolls a pass down the left, the ball rolling along the white line and somehow staying in play. Son crosses gorgeously towards the far post. Moura has to score, but plants a header wide right from six yards. How on earth is this game still only 1-1? 50 min: Saints should be leading. Ings and Redmond combine crisply down the left. Ings again can\u2019t quite get a shot away, so rolls a pass wide right for Boufal, free in the area! Boufal opens his body and tries to pop a sidefoot into the bottom left, but sends it well wide. Boufal holds his head in his hands, a fine chance spurned. 49 min: The early signs: it\u2019s as-you-were. Saints continue to stroke it around in the midfield, with Spurs often chasing shadows. Redmond rakes a ball down the left for Ings, who can\u2019t quite find the space to shoot. Then Romeu hoicks a cross in from the left, Hojbjerg heading harmlessly over from six yards. 47 min: An update on James Ward-Prowse: he may have suffered knee ligament damage, though it\u2019ll be hard to say for sure until some swelling goes down. Here\u2019s hoping for a positive outcome and a swift recovery; he\u2019s been excellent for Saints this season, and will be sorely missed. And we\u2019re off again. Spurs get the ball rolling for the second half. You\u2019d expect them to have had the riot act read to them during the break; they had one shot on target during that first half, and that wasn\u2019t even their goal. Let\u2019s see if it\u2019s had any effect. Half-time paranormal activity. \u201cI was just scanning back through today\u2019s MBM, when your line for the first goal (\u2018Saints have been the better side, so of course it\u2019s the home side who take the lead\u2019) gave me a sense of deja vu,\u201d writes Sarah Rothwell, and not just because I clumsily used the word \u2018side\u2019 twice in the same sentence. \u201cI quickly brought up last Saturday\u2019s Clockwatch and found the following line for Liverpool\u2019s second goal: \u2018Southampton have been much the better team, so they probably knew this was coming.\u2019 I\u2019d feel sorry for the Saints if I weren\u2019t such a dyed-in-the-wool Liverpool supporter.\u201d Half-time entertainment. Some news that may cheer Jose up: Barcelona are in disarray. Sid Lowe has the latest! Saints have been by far the better team. Spurs will be much happier with the scoreline. Mourinho stomps off with not too many cheers ringing in his ears. We could be in for quite the second half ... and perhaps extra-time and penalties to come. 45 min +3: Son and Aurier one-two crisply down the inside-right channel. Both have chances to shoot, but both hesitate, and Bednarek slides in to block and clear. Great defending, ponderous attacking. 45 min +1: In the first of four added minutes, Redmond spins Winks with great ease, 20 yards out, and blazes over the bar. 45 min: And now Son bustles down the middle, but with options at either side and Saints extremely light at the back, the striker loses control and there goes the chance to set someone clear. So much for waiting for the half-time whistle, eh. Pulitzer, please! 44 min: Actually, scrub that. First Bertrand powers down the left to win a Saints corner. Then from the set piece, Spurs break upfield, Moura nearly wriggling his way clear on the left. 42 min: That unpleasant accident has understandably taken the wind out of Southampton\u2019s sail, and most of the energy from what had been a very entertaining, if slightly lop-sided, game. Both sides could probably do with hearing the half-time whistle. 40 min: Poor Ward-Prowse is taken off on a stretcher. It might be an injury to his right knee, his leg planted upon taking a kick. Sessegnon looks concerned and not a little shaken; the incident certainly looked accidental. Vestergaard comes on to replace the stricken Saint. God speed, James Ward-Prowse. 38 min: Uh-oh, this doesn\u2019t look good. Sessegnon and Ward-Prowse come together out on the Saints right. It\u2019s a 50-50 ball. At first glance, it looked like a kick on the shin, no more, but it might be worse than that, sadly. Ward-Prowse holds his head and he\u2019s in some distress. The oxygen mask comes out as his team-mates comfort him. Fingers crossed this looks worse than it is. 36 min: On the touchline, Mourinho frowns and pouts, harrumphs and emotes. And no wonder. Saints have made 209 passes to the home side\u2019s 102. His side have been very much second best. This is no more than Saints deserve. Boufal slips Redmond into space down the inside right. Redmond looks to have made the wrong choice, spinning to his right, away from goal, seemingly the wrong way. But he turns and threads a shot towards the bottom left. Lloris parries weakly, into the path of Long, who makes no mistake from six yards. 32 min: Moura romps down the left, checks, then u-turns and nearly breaks clear into the Saints box. He\u2019s crowded out by three Saints players, but it\u2019s a fine run that almost bears fruit. 30 min: Aurier creams a lovely pass down the right for Son, who can\u2019t turn Bertrand as he enters the box. Saints clear, but for a split second there it looked as though Spurs had opened them up. A better period for the home side. 29 min: Boufal and Bertrand combine nicely down the left, the latter whipping a low ball towards the near post. Ings attempts to trap and turn past Tanganga by the near post, but the full-back is wise to the grift and holds his ground before shepherding both ball and Ings out of play. 28 min: Even so, Spurs look dangerous when they do piece an attack together. Moura zips down the left, twisting, turning and nearly earning space to shoot. He settles for a corner, from which very little occurs. 26 min: Corner for Saints down the right, Ward-Prowse swinging a low cross in that Vertonghen is forced to slice clear. Ward-Prowse gets two goes at delivering the corner, but neither effort is all that. But Spurs continue to look second best, and Ward-Prowse is usually the thorn in their side. 24 min: Spurs are struggling to string more than a couple of passes together. The home support has been pretty quiet from the get-go, one obvious moment apart. The travelling fans currently in better voice, winning the battle of the US spiritual both claim as their own. 22 min: Saints are stroking the ball around delightfully. A PlayStation move involving Ward-Prowse, Boufal and Ings nearly comes off down the right. Not quite. The admittedly important matter of the scoreline apart, they\u2019ll be very pleased with their performance so far. They\u2019ve been the better team. 20 min: Redmond sends a low drive towards the bottom right from 20 yards. Lloris parries, and is pretty fortunate not to tee up the lurking Ings. Spurs get away with it again. Not entirely sure how they\u2019re leading, but here we are. 19 min: Southampton hit the crossbar! Ward-Prowse exchanges passes with Hojbjerg out on the right, and curls a glorious defence-splitting pass down the line. Ings is clear, and enters the box. Lloris hesitates, and Ings must surely score. He gets the ball past the keeper, but with far too much force, leaning back and blootering it off the bar. The ball twangs miles back upfield. Ings will consider that a bad miss. 17 min: Another cute Ndombele spin. His dragback foxes Romeu, who might have gone in the book for his clumsy clatter had there been a few more minutes on the clock. But it\u2019s still early enough, and we all play on. 16 min: Saints continue to enjoy the lion\u2019s share of possession. Spurs seem quite happy to sit back and see what they can do on the break. And it\u2019s working so far. Textbook Joseball. 14 min: A bit of space for Long down the inside-left channel. He cushions a pass back to Ings, who has plenty of space and time to size up a shot from distance. But the flag goes up for offside, Long the transgressor, and there goes a chance for Saints to hit back immediately. Saints have been the better side, so of course it\u2019s the home side who take the lead. Winks hooks a ball down the inside-left channel for Sessegnon, who can\u2019t get a shot away. The ball breaks back to Ndombele, who whacks a first-time shot goalwards. It\u2019s heading wide left, but cannons off Stephens and into the bottom right, an outrageous deflection that wrong-foots Gunn. 10 min: Redmond skitters down the inside left and enters the Spurs box, using Vertonghen as a shield and sending a shot towards the bottom left. Lloris, partially unsighted, does very well to hack clear with his legs. Spurs are living dangerously. 9 min: Saints continue to stroke it around. Spurs eventually break up their pretty midfield patterns, Moura tearing down the middle and slipping the ball wide right for Aurier, but the Spurs wing-back is forced to turn tail. Saints held their shape very nicely. 7 min: Boufal turns on the burners and blazes down the left. He eases past Tanganga, as if the young full-back wasn\u2019t there, and fizzes a stunning low cross through the six-yard box. Long hopes to toe-poke home, but Lloris diverts it out for a corner with a crucial fingertip. The resulting set piece comes to nothing, but Saints could easily have had a couple of goals already. The home fans have fallen a little quiet as a result. 5 min: And now it\u2019s Southampton\u2019s turn to have a whack on goal. Romeu drifts down the inside left and rakes a diagonal pass towards the in-form Ings, who takes a touch inside, bypassing Alderweireld, but sending a weak volley down the throat of Lloris. Somewhere, in a parallel universe with better finishing, it\u2019s 1-1. 3 min: Saints ping it around in a confident style, befitting a team with such a good record on the road. But then the play\u2019s broken up, and Son chases after a long pass down the Spurs left. He cuts into the area but can\u2019t work space for a shot. He pulls back for Sessegnon, who sidefoots lamely towards Gunn. A nice open start to the match. 2 min: Sessegnon passes in from the left for Ndombele, who spins away from trouble and into acres of space. A lovely pirouette. But he can\u2019t find Son with a pass down the inside-right channel. Saints clear their lines. And we\u2019re off! Saints, who have won four of their last five away matches, get the party started. Spurs have won their last seven home FA Cup ties. Within nine seconds, Stephens has launched the ball long and out of play for a goal kick. The teams are out! A rare old atmosphere at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as the players take to the pitch. Spurs fans are looking to scratch a 29-year itch in this competition; Saints supporters have been waiting 44 years for the soothing balm of Wembley victory. Both sets giving it plenty accordingly. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! And now a word from Mourinho\u2019s opposite number, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl: \u201cWe play against a very, very strong side. The Liverpool game was an important experience for us, and in the end the result was not a surprise. But it was an important experience. We have won the FA Cup once, so we are focused on this competition. It is an important signal to show how far we are in our development, because to win here, and go to the next round, will not be so easy. So it will be a massive signal and we want to win.\u201d Here\u2019s Jose! \u201cWe have the happiness of the victory over Manchester City, but also the consequences. We have injured players, we are very short of attacking options. I look forward to the game. It is a good opportunity for Eric Dier, who is working so hard to get back to the team, but has not had many opportunities to play. And Tanguy Ndombele, let\u2019s see him finally start after his difficult period. Ryan Sessegnon is a kid who I am always happy to give an opportunity to.\u201d EXCLUSIVE BREAKING NEWS: Spurs will be playing in white shirts tonight. Yes, it\u2019s a fairly transparent excuse to whack up some pictures of classic kit of yore. Here are Tottenham in their double-winning glory, glory days. Southampton are forced out of their first-choice red and white stripes, and into grey and highlighter-pen yellow. Huh. As change strips go, it\u2019s not a patch on the glorious Admiral threads they wore when turning Manchester United over in the 1976 final. But to be fair, that\u2019s a pretty high bar. A bonus sprinkling of team news, because the FA Cup is special, isn\u2019t it. Giovani Lo Celso misses out through injury, as does Erik Lamela. Dele Alli was only fit enough for the bench after picking up a knock at the weekend. Stuart Armstrong wasn\u2019t expected to make it at all, thanks to a hip problem, but like Dele he\u2019s in the dugouts tonight. Tottenham make four changes to the team selected for the original tie at St Mary\u2019s. Jan Vertonghen, Eric Dier, Tanguy Ndombele and Ryan Sessegnon are in; Dele Alli, Davison Sanchez and Gedson Fernandes drop to the bench, while Giovani Lo Celso misses out altogether. Saints make three changes to the side named for that match. Oriol Romeu, Sofiane Boufal and Shane Long step up; Stuart Armstrong and Michael Obafemi drop to the bench, while Kevin Danso is left out altogether. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Tanganga, Dier, Winks, Ndombele, Sessegnon, Lucas, Son. Subs: Gazzaniga, Sanchez, Cirkin, Skipp, Gedson, Dele, Parrott. Southampton: Gunn, Ward-Prowse, Stephens, Bednarek, Bertrand, Hojbjerg, Romeu, Boufal, Redmond, Ings, Long. Subs: Lewis, Vokins, Vestergaard, Smallbone, Armstrong, Obafemi, Adams. Since Southampton returned to the Premier League in 2012, they haven\u2019t enjoyed travelling to Tottenham Hotspur very much. There have been eight matches between the clubs in N17, and Spurs have won seven of them. If this recent history is any guide, then tonight\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round replay at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is a shoo-in for the eponymous hosts. But not all recent history is against the Saints. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side may have depended on a late Sofiane Boufal equaliser at St Mary\u2019s to force this replay, but they beat Jose Mourinho\u2019s men down by the Solent in the league on New Year\u2019s Day. They asked Spurs a few questions in defeat here back in September. And they\u2019ve scored in each of their last ten matches against Spurs. The top-line stats may not make for great reading for today\u2019s visitors, but all is not yet lost. There\u2019s also the historical FA Cup record between these two clubs. They\u2019re level at three wins apiece, a story that stretches all the way back to 1902, when both teams were members of the Southern League. Saints won that tie after two replays, and went on to reach the final, where they lost to Sheffield United. They\u2019re still the last non-league side to reach the final. (For the sake of completion, Spurs were the holders that year, and they\u2019re still the last non-league side since the foundation of the Football League in 1888 to win the cup. Both records are likely to stand for a few years yet.) Fast forward, and the last two FA Cup meetings between the teams have ended in routs. Ronnie Rosenthal smashing in a hat-trick in a 6-2 win for Spurs at the Dell in 1995; Gordon Strachan\u2019s side, spearheaded by James Beattie, humiliating former manager Glenn Hoddle\u2019s team 4-0 at St Mary\u2019s in 2003. All of which is a roundabout way of saying: this could be great fun! Spurs are favourites, but these two have history, so anything could happen. Including extra-time and penalty kicks. One way or another, we\u2019ll have a blast finding out who\u2019ll host Norwich City in the fifth round. It\u2019s on! Kick-off: 7.45pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>Even now, 30 years on, memories of Scotland\u2019s tumultuous 1990 grand-slam triumph over England have the power to move those involved to tears. Iwan Tukalo is recounting the team talk delivered by Scotland\u2019s revered coaching double-act of Ian McGeechan and Jim Telfer at their hotel before heading to Murrayfield. It was, he believes, the \u201cdefining moment\u201d when hope was infused with conviction they could topple Will Carling\u2019s England and seize European rugby\u2019s biggest prize themselves.</p> <p>\u201cNormally it was a little bit like being back at school, with the teachers \u2013 the coaches \u2013 at the front and then our chairs set out in rows,\u201d the former wing says. \u201cThis time all the seats were in a circle and on the front of each chair was a jersey but you couldn\u2019t see the numbers, just the thistle. They said: \u2018Come in, just sit anywhere.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cSo Geech gets into the circle and starts to talk to us about tactics, all the things we do when we\u2019re in certain parts of the field. Then he stepped out and Creamy [Telfer] stepped in. He started this whole thing about not just playing for the jersey but for yourselves, your friends and families, saying: \u2018If you win this game, it is life-changing for you.\u2019</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/05/anthony-watson-england-miss-six-nations-scotland-injury-calcutta-cup\">Lewis Ludlam and Courtney Lawes ready for Six Nations \u2018war\u2019 with Scotland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAt the end he said: \u2018There is a jersey on the front of your chair; pick that jersey up and give it to the person it belongs to and make a commitment to them\u2019.\u201d At this point Tukalo, now 58, pauses to wipe away a tear. \u201cSorry, but that\u2019s how powerful it was, it still has that emotion.\u201d On Tukalo\u2019s chair was the No 6 jersey belonging to the flanker John Jeffrey. \u201cI just said: \u2018JJ, there\u2019s your jersey, I won\u2019t let you down.\u2019 For me, after that, nobody was going to beat us that day.\u201d</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s latest Calcutta Cup passion play will not lack for intrigue as both countries plot a route back from opening defeats \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/01/ireland-scotland-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">Scotland in Dublin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/02/france-england-six-nations-eddie-jones-bernard-le-roux\" title=\"\">England in Paris</a> \u2013 but even were a grand slam still on the line, it is doubtful the emotional pitch would reach 1990 levels. The patriotic fervour swirling round Murrayfield was fuelled by the political backdrop, with many Scots none too impressed at being used as a testing ground for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s hated poll tax before its imminent introduction south of the border.</p> <p>If England were characterised in the buildup as the embodiment of this arrogance and brutality, the Scots, billeted in the Braid Hills hotel on the outskirts of Edinburgh, were \u201coblivious\u201d to the off-field noise until the day of the match, according to Tukalo, who was sharing a room with the captain, David Sole.</p> <p>\u201cSoley is not the most talkative of individuals. The nerves were jangling and there was a deathly silence. So I said: \u2018Do you mind if I put the TV on?\u2019 It just so happened the opening credits of Grandstand came on. There was every Scotland-England sporting event that had ever happened, not just rugby but football, boxing and everything else. It only lasted a couple of minutes and then there was silence. We looked at each other and just went: \u2018Fuuuuck!\u2019 That\u2019s when it hit home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27d064419238202ada5ce9231319bd53d44f763a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27d064419238202ada5ce9231319bd53d44f763a/0_73_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Guscott takes issue with Scotland\u2019s John Jeffrey (right) as Tony Stanger and Rob Andrew look to intervene in the fiery Murrayfield showdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Guscott takes issue with Scotland\u2019s John Jeffrey (right) as Tony Stanger and Rob Andrew look to intervene in the fiery Murrayfield showdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>England\u2019s dominant form in the Championship made them favourites. Scotland earned narrow wins in Dublin and Cardiff but a 21-0 home victory over France bolstered confidence, as did the recall of only their second ever grand slam six years earlier, to the day, 17 March. Coincidentally, Telfer\u2019s birthday.</p> <p>\u201cI was there when Jim Calder scored his try in \u201984 against France,\u201d says Tukalo, who is behind plans to reunite Scotland\u2019s 1984 and 1990 squads at a unique charity dinner in May. \u201cWhen it was our turn to have the opportunity, to know it was achievable, those guys were an inspiration.\u201d</p> <p>Home fires were stoked further when Scotland ran out to warm up and found the England players\u2019 girlfriends being interviewed on the pitch. \u201cTalk about red rag to a bull,\u201d Tukalo says. \u201c\u2018You are on our turf, you have got no effing right to be there until the day is done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scotland\u2019s slow walk out for the kick-off, led by Sole, is enshrined in rugby folklore. Tukalo believes its origins lay in their annual trial match two years previously, when Gary Callander, who led the \u201creds\u201d against the more established \u201cblues\u201d, used it as motivation. \u201cGary said: \u2018We are not Christians at the Colosseum being led to the slaughter. We\u2019re going to walk out there with purpose\u2019. It resonated.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/05/fearful-england-autonomy-paris-six-nations-france\">Fearful England need to play with autonomy or Paris may be just the start | Ben Ryan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finlay Calder, Jim\u2019s twin brother and a victorious Lions captain in Australia in 1989, harboured doubts about the plan. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really buying into it because you can look helluva foolish,\u201d says the former flanker. \u201cI did it for the first Test with the Lions and we got murdered but I played along and it worked out fine, didn\u2019t it? The whole idea was to destabilise them. It was a bit of gamesmanship. I can still remember when we walked out. It was a sense of there is a big fight on the cards.\u201d A spine-tingling moment on a day full of them. \u201cIt must have rattled the England players,\u201d Tukalo says. \u201cThe noise was off the scale.\u201d</p> <p>It went up several notches more when Tony Stanger, Scotland\u2019s other wing, reached Gavin Hastings\u2019 kick first to score the decisive try. Calder was alongside him, arms wide in celebration. The euphoria around Murrayfield reverberated far and wide, and not just in rugby circles.</p> <p>\u201cOne of my work colleagues was a Dundee United supporter and was at Tannadice on the day,\u201d says Tukalo, then a distribution engineer with British Gas. \u201cHe said people suddenly started jumping up and down and it was like a Mexican wave making its way to the centre of the stand. When it reached the PA announcer, he said: \u2018Scotland have defeated England at Murrayfield.\u2019 The whole place erupted.\u201d</p> <p>Strangely, perhaps, Calder recalls no great celebrations among the players. \u201cIt was more relief. We were professional in all but pay and we made huge sacrifices, to our families, to our employers. Some of us went down to Goldenacre [home of Heriot\u2019s rugby club] where there was a live broadcast going on. Others may have gone out but I was back at work on Monday morning.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Tickets for the grand-slam reunion event are available at <a href=\"https://www.heartsandballs.org.uk/\">heartsandballs.org.uk</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Even now, 30 years on, memories of Scotland\u2019s tumultuous 1990 grand-slam triumph over England have the power to move those involved to tears. Iwan Tukalo is recounting the team talk delivered by Scotland\u2019s revered coaching double-act of Ian McGeechan and Jim Telfer at their hotel before heading to Murrayfield. It was, he believes, the \u201cdefining moment\u201d when hope was infused with conviction they could topple Will Carling\u2019s England and seize European rugby\u2019s biggest prize themselves. \u201cNormally it was a little bit like being back at school, with the teachers \u2013 the coaches \u2013 at the front and then our chairs set out in rows,\u201d the former wing says. \u201cThis time all the seats were in a circle and on the front of each chair was a jersey but you couldn\u2019t see the numbers, just the thistle. They said: \u2018Come in, just sit anywhere.\u2019 \u201cSo Geech gets into the circle and starts to talk to us about tactics, all the things we do when we\u2019re in certain parts of the field. Then he stepped out and Creamy [Telfer] stepped in. He started this whole thing about not just playing for the jersey but for yourselves, your friends and families, saying: \u2018If you win this game, it is life-changing for you.\u2019 \u201cAt the end he said: \u2018There is a jersey on the front of your chair; pick that jersey up and give it to the person it belongs to and make a commitment to them\u2019.\u201d At this point Tukalo, now 58, pauses to wipe away a tear. \u201cSorry, but that\u2019s how powerful it was, it still has that emotion.\u201d On Tukalo\u2019s chair was the No 6 jersey belonging to the flanker John Jeffrey. \u201cI just said: \u2018JJ, there\u2019s your jersey, I won\u2019t let you down.\u2019 For me, after that, nobody was going to beat us that day.\u201d Saturday\u2019s latest Calcutta Cup passion play will not lack for intrigue as both countries plot a route back from opening defeats \u2013 Scotland in Dublin, England in Paris \u2013 but even were a grand slam still on the line, it is doubtful the emotional pitch would reach 1990 levels. The patriotic fervour swirling round Murrayfield was fuelled by the political backdrop, with many Scots none too impressed at being used as a testing ground for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s hated poll tax before its imminent introduction south of the border. If England were characterised in the buildup as the embodiment of this arrogance and brutality, the Scots, billeted in the Braid Hills hotel on the outskirts of Edinburgh, were \u201coblivious\u201d to the off-field noise until the day of the match, according to Tukalo, who was sharing a room with the captain, David Sole. \u201cSoley is not the most talkative of individuals. The nerves were jangling and there was a deathly silence. So I said: \u2018Do you mind if I put the TV on?\u2019 It just so happened the opening credits of Grandstand came on. There was every Scotland-England sporting event that had ever happened, not just rugby but football, boxing and everything else. It only lasted a couple of minutes and then there was silence. We looked at each other and just went: \u2018Fuuuuck!\u2019 That\u2019s when it hit home.\u201d England\u2019s dominant form in the Championship made them favourites. Scotland earned narrow wins in Dublin and Cardiff but a 21-0 home victory over France bolstered confidence, as did the recall of only their second ever grand slam six years earlier, to the day, 17 March. Coincidentally, Telfer\u2019s birthday. \u201cI was there when Jim Calder scored his try in \u201984 against France,\u201d says Tukalo, who is behind plans to reunite Scotland\u2019s 1984 and 1990 squads at a unique charity dinner in May. \u201cWhen it was our turn to have the opportunity, to know it was achievable, those guys were an inspiration.\u201d Home fires were stoked further when Scotland ran out to warm up and found the England players\u2019 girlfriends being interviewed on the pitch. \u201cTalk about red rag to a bull,\u201d Tukalo says. \u201c\u2018You are on our turf, you have got no effing right to be there until the day is done.\u201d Scotland\u2019s slow walk out for the kick-off, led by Sole, is enshrined in rugby folklore. Tukalo believes its origins lay in their annual trial match two years previously, when Gary Callander, who led the \u201creds\u201d against the more established \u201cblues\u201d, used it as motivation. \u201cGary said: \u2018We are not Christians at the Colosseum being led to the slaughter. We\u2019re going to walk out there with purpose\u2019. It resonated.\u201d Finlay Calder, Jim\u2019s twin brother and a victorious Lions captain in Australia in 1989, harboured doubts about the plan. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really buying into it because you can look helluva foolish,\u201d says the former flanker. \u201cI did it for the first Test with the Lions and we got murdered but I played along and it worked out fine, didn\u2019t it? The whole idea was to destabilise them. It was a bit of gamesmanship. I can still remember when we walked out. It was a sense of there is a big fight on the cards.\u201d A spine-tingling moment on a day full of them. \u201cIt must have rattled the England players,\u201d Tukalo says. \u201cThe noise was off the scale.\u201d It went up several notches more when Tony Stanger, Scotland\u2019s other wing, reached Gavin Hastings\u2019 kick first to score the decisive try. Calder was alongside him, arms wide in celebration. The euphoria around Murrayfield reverberated far and wide, and not just in rugby circles. \u201cOne of my work colleagues was a Dundee United supporter and was at Tannadice on the day,\u201d says Tukalo, then a distribution engineer with British Gas. \u201cHe said people suddenly started jumping up and down and it was like a Mexican wave making its way to the centre of the stand. When it reached the PA announcer, he said: \u2018Scotland have defeated England at Murrayfield.\u2019 The whole place erupted.\u201d Strangely, perhaps, Calder recalls no great celebrations among the players. \u201cIt was more relief. We were professional in all but pay and we made huge sacrifices, to our families, to our employers. Some of us went down to Goldenacre [home of Heriot\u2019s rugby club] where there was a live broadcast going on. Others may have gone out but I was back at work on Monday morning.\u201d \u2022 Tickets for the grand-slam reunion event are available at heartsandballs.org.uk",

      "body": "<p>Tottenham\u2019s motivation in hiring Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to replace Mauricio Pochettino was clear. They wanted the serial winner to guide them to silverware which, despite Pochettino\u2019s excellence, has consistently eluded them. The drought pre-dated the Argentinian. Since the 1984 Uefa Cup, the club have won only three major trophies.</p> \n<p>Mourinho has viewed this season\u2019s FA Cup through the prism of opportunity. If he can win it, maybe it will galvanise his tenure. When Danny Ings put Southampton 2-1 up in the 72nd minute of this fourth-round replay, the prospect of Spurs advancing to a home last-16 tie against Norwich was outlandish.</p> \n<p>Southampton had been the better team, particularly during a one-sided first-half. The cohesive football had belonged to them and so did the majority of the chances. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s tactics looked spot on and his players were stronger and quicker. They pressed with greater intensity. They seemed to be having fun.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/christian-eriksen-felt-like-the-black-sheep-at-tottenham-inter\">Christian Eriksen admits he felt like 'the black sheep' at Tottenham</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet Spurs found a way to dig deeper. They did not play particularly pretty football but in the end it was winning football and to Mourinho that was all that mattered. Lucas Moura swapped passes with Dele Alli to score with a fierce low shot, having skipped past a substitute, Jannik Vestergaard and, as extra time loomed, Alli \u2013 who came off the bench to make a difference \u2013 curled a wonderful pass through for Son Heung-min.</p> \n<p>He ran round the goalkeeper, Angus Gunn, who had hesitated before leaving his line, and everybody knew what was going to happen next. Gunn\u2019s challenge was rash, Son went down and, in real time, it added up to a penalty for the referee, David Coote.</p> \n<p>The replays showed contact was minimal, restricted to Gunn catching Son with a hand. Was it sufficient to send him tumbling? Son did not care about the debate. He picked himself up to score the penalty and Southampton found their best efforts were undermined at the last. Mourinho said that the best team had lost but Hasenh\u00fcttl did not want compliments, he wanted progress.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is not enough to dominate,\u201d the Southampton manager said. \u201cIn the last 15 minutes we gave it away too easy. We didn\u2019t defend well. I am not happy. It\u2019s not about being the better team, it\u2019s about being the winning team.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mourinho, who complained that injuries had restricted his options, sprang the tactical surprise, starting with a back three and partnering Lucas with Son up front. It did not work and he switched to 4-2-3-1 early in the second half. Only when Alli began to exert an influence towards the end did Spurs come into the game.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"55001e3a-74ea-4a5f-b65d-888366ca61fa\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Chelsea v Liverpool</li>\n     <li>Leicester v Birmingham</li>\n     <li>Portsmouth v Arsenal</li>\n     <li>Sheffield Wednesday v Manchester City</li>\n     <li>Derby v Manchester United</li>\n     <li>Reading v Sheffield United</li>\n     <li>Tottenham v Norwich</li>\n     <li>West Brom v Newcastle</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\u2013 <i>Ties to be played week commencing 2 March</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tanguy Ndombele had helped to put Spurs in front, shooting for goal after Jack Stephens had stopped Ryan Sessegnon with a last-ditch challenge and watching the ball deflect heavily off the unfortunate Southampton defender to beat Gunn.</p> \n<p>It was tough on the visiting side, who might have taken the lead on two occasions.

He would not be so lucky in the 34th minute. Sofiane Boufal found space and fed Redmond, who spun and shot for the far post. When Lloris pushed it out, Shane Long was all alone to sweep home.</p> \n<p>Spurs were poor on the defensive cover and there were other instances of them giving up too much space, particularly in the areas between the wide centre-backs and the wing-backs. They did not move the ball with any conviction until the closing stages and their final decisions were poor. Southampton lost James Ward-Prowse to a grisly-looking knee injury but it did not affect their rhythm. Happily, the post-match update was positive, revealing only a deep cut.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/feb/05/tottenham-v-southampton-fa-cup-fourth-round-replay-live\">Tottenham v Southampton: FA Cup fourth-round replay \u2013 live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Boufal miscued when gloriously placed after a burst from Ings on 50 minutes and Mourinho had seen enough. He swapped Vertonghen for Gedson Fernandes and changed his formation and, shortly afterwards, he sent on Alli for Ndombele. Vertonghen looked devastated and he brooded darkly on the bench, while Ndombele faded badly after a driving and trick-filled start.</p> \n<p>Although Son broke and crossed for Lucas who headed wide \u2013 a big chance wasted \u2013 it was Southampton who hogged possession and controlled the tempo. It was difficult to isolate any star performer for them; it was a team display in the truest sense.</p> \n<p>Vestergaard extended Lloris with a header from a corner and it was no surprise when Southampton took the lead. What a goal it was, Long\u2019s clearing header from inside his own box releasing Redmond and the forward tearing into Spurs territory, skating past three opponents, before findings Ings, who stepped inside Japhet Tanganga and finished. Game over? It looked that way. Somehow Mourinho found a way.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tottenham\u2019s motivation in hiring Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to replace Mauricio Pochettino was clear. They wanted the serial winner to guide them to silverware which, despite Pochettino\u2019s excellence, has consistently eluded them. The drought pre-dated the Argentinian. Since the 1984 Uefa Cup, the club have won only three major trophies. Mourinho has viewed this season\u2019s FA Cup through the prism of opportunity. If he can win it, maybe it will galvanise his tenure. When Danny Ings put Southampton 2-1 up in the 72nd minute of this fourth-round replay, the prospect of Spurs advancing to a home last-16 tie against Norwich was outlandish. Southampton had been the better team, particularly during a one-sided first-half. The cohesive football had belonged to them and so did the majority of the chances. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s tactics looked spot on and his players were stronger and quicker. They pressed with greater intensity. They seemed to be having fun. Yet Spurs found a way to dig deeper. They did not play particularly pretty football but in the end it was winning football and to Mourinho that was all that mattered. Lucas Moura swapped passes with Dele Alli to score with a fierce low shot, having skipped past a substitute, Jannik Vestergaard and, as extra time loomed, Alli \u2013 who came off the bench to make a difference \u2013 curled a wonderful pass through for Son Heung-min. He ran round the goalkeeper, Angus Gunn, who had hesitated before leaving his line, and everybody knew what was going to happen next. Gunn\u2019s challenge was rash, Son went down and, in real time, it added up to a penalty for the referee, David Coote. The replays showed contact was minimal, restricted to Gunn catching Son with a hand. Was it sufficient to send him tumbling? Son did not care about the debate. He picked himself up to score the penalty and Southampton found their best efforts were undermined at the last. Mourinho said that the best team had lost but Hasenh\u00fcttl did not want compliments, he wanted progress. \u201cIt is not enough to dominate,\u201d the Southampton manager said. \u201cIn the last 15 minutes we gave it away too easy. We didn\u2019t defend well. I am not happy. It\u2019s not about being the better team, it\u2019s about being the winning team.\u201d Mourinho, who complained that injuries had restricted his options, sprang the tactical surprise, starting with a back three and partnering Lucas with Son up front. It did not work and he switched to 4-2-3-1 early in the second half. Only when Alli began to exert an influence towards the end did Spurs come into the game. Tanguy Ndombele had helped to put Spurs in front, shooting for goal after Jack Stephens had stopped Ryan Sessegnon with a last-ditch challenge and watching the ball deflect heavily off the unfortunate Southampton defender to beat Gunn. It was tough on the visiting side, who might have taken the lead on two occasions. Ings took an excellent first touch to surge inside Jan Vertonghen but his shot was straight at Hugo Lloris \u2013 either side and he would have scored \u2013 while the Spurs goalkeeper appeared to misread a low shot from Nathan Redmond before saving with his trailing leg. Southampton advertised the equaliser. Ings rattled the crossbar after getting in behind the creaking Vertonghen and Lloris parried weakly from Ryan Bertrand\u2019s long-range effort. The goalkeeper got away with that one. He would not be so lucky in the 34th minute. Sofiane Boufal found space and fed Redmond, who spun and shot for the far post. When Lloris pushed it out, Shane Long was all alone to sweep home. Spurs were poor on the defensive cover and there were other instances of them giving up too much space, particularly in the areas between the wide centre-backs and the wing-backs. They did not move the ball with any conviction until the closing stages and their final decisions were poor. Southampton lost James Ward-Prowse to a grisly-looking knee injury but it did not affect their rhythm. Happily, the post-match update was positive, revealing only a deep cut. Boufal miscued when gloriously placed after a burst from Ings on 50 minutes and Mourinho had seen enough. He swapped Vertonghen for Gedson Fernandes and changed his formation and, shortly afterwards, he sent on Alli for Ndombele. Vertonghen looked devastated and he brooded darkly on the bench, while Ndombele faded badly after a driving and trick-filled start. Although Son broke and crossed for Lucas who headed wide \u2013 a big chance wasted \u2013 it was Southampton who hogged possession and controlled the tempo. It was difficult to isolate any star performer for them; it was a team display in the truest sense. Vestergaard extended Lloris with a header from a corner and it was no surprise when Southampton took the lead. What a goal it was, Long\u2019s clearing header from inside his own box releasing Redmond and the forward tearing into Spurs territory, skating past three opponents, before findings Ings, who stepped inside Japhet Tanganga and finished. Game over? It looked that way. Somehow Mourinho found a way.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s short but indelible political career has been based around the principle of divide-and-fool. His acquittal in the impeachment trial by the US Senate will further fan the flames of the most profound national split since the Vietnam war, perhaps even the civil war. First, expect Trump to be cocky and take a victory lap, falsely claiming \u201cexoneration\u201d just as he did after special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation left him bruised but unbowed. A day after Mueller\u2019s leaden testimony to Congress, the president felt able to act with such impunity that he made his bullying phone call to the leader of Ukraine. Now, we must ask, who will he call a day after being cleared by the Senate? Admirers of the US president will take heart that a man many imbue with folk-hero status, who gives them long yearned-for \u201cpayback\u201d against a perceived cultural, economic and social elite, has survived yet again. They share his view that he was the victim of \u201ca coup\u201d and embrace his sense of grievance and resentment. Trump supporters interviewed by the Guardian at his recent campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa, put it down to the latest machinations of corrupt politicians in Washington. On the other side, feelings run equally high. Democrats and other critics of the president argue, correctly, that in strong-arming Ukraine to investigate a political rival, Trump abused his office for personal political gain and has been allowed to get away with it through a miscarriage of justice. He is, they have said, a president who would be king, undermining rule of law and threatening the very fabric of democracy in America \u2013 and around the world.

Guaid\u00f3, who has spent the last year battling \u2013 so far unsuccessfully \u2013 to topple Maduro, arrived at the White House on Wednesday afternoon and was met by Trump. Earlier, a senior administration official told reporters to expect the moves against Maduro in the next 30 days, without specifying what form they might take. \u201cWe are probably halfway to what maximum pressure [on Maduro] could look like,\u201d they said. \u201cWe are only moving in one direction and that is forwards.\u201d The official said Trump instructed all parts of the US government \u201cto use all of the tools at their disposal to further create stress upon Maduro and his cronies\u201d. But Guaid\u00f3\u2019s t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Trump was overshadowed by Mitt Romney\u2019s announcement that he would vote for the US president\u2019s impeachment. As that news broke, journalists were abruptly excluded from a planned Oval Office encounter between Trump and Guaid\u00f3 by the White House press office, without immediate explanation. The previous evening Trump had used his State of the Union address to offer Guaid\u00f3 a high-profile show of support. As Guaid\u00f3 looked on from the gallery, Trump declared him \u201cthe true and legitimate president of Venezuela\u201d leading a \u201crighteous struggle for freedom\u201d. \u201cMaduro is an illegitimate ruler \u2026 but Maduro\u2019s grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken,\u201d Trump vowed to loud applause from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. In a clear sign of how Trump sees Venezuela as an important element of his 2020 presidential campaign, he added: \u201cSocialism destroys nations.

Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, a top Venezuelan pollster, said Guaid\u00f3 could certainly consider Trump\u2019s backing a victory.

And whether you end up as bagazo [pulp] in Caracas or in Miami, [it\u2019s the] same shit.\u201d Guaid\u00f3 has offered no hint of what \u2013 if any \u2013 additional support his allies may have offered during his tour. But during a rally in Miami on Saturday he told supporters \u201call options are on the table \u2013 but also underneath it too\u201d. Maduro\u2019s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, slammed Trump\u2019s \u201cdelusional and arrogant\u201d remarks, dismissing them as part of an attempt to revive his moribund regime change strategy for Venezuela.",

CVC wants to aggregate the commercial rights of the six unions, bundling November internationals and the Six Nations together to achieve a maximum return. It would involve making the July and November Test windows more than a series of friendlies that have no competitive meaning beyond world ranking positions, but the Six Nations would be the most valuable property for sale. CVC has been linked with Amazon, which screened all the Premier League football matches on Boxing Day in a bid to drive subscriptions for its Prime service. It worked, but a leading sports lawyer believes it would be difficult to tempt Amazon into rugby unless the game adopted a more global outlook. \u201cI think they would want something that involved countries like the United States and Japan, but rugby does not have football\u2019s reach,\u201d said Richard Cramer, the managing partner at Front Row Legal. \u201cThey would definitely be an option to explore, but CVC will not be looking to make a quick return on their investment. They will need to be involved for the long haul for meaningful change to happen.\u201d",

The rapper Loski, 20, whose real name is Jyrelle O\u2019Connor, has had a string of successful singles and attracts millions of views on YouTube and other social media platforms. He has been charged with various offences related to possession of a firearm, one with intent to endanger life, and possession of ammunition. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. A jury at Croydon Crown Court had already heard the prosecution\u2019s case and the defence case had opened with O\u2019Connor responding to questions from defence counsel Simon Pentol QC. Cross-examination of the rapper by prosecutor Ken Millett was due to start but Millett was unwell and so judge Elizabeth Smaller discharged the jury on Wednesday and said a retrial would have to take place. The court will sit on Friday to set a retrial date.",

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs has said that it wants \u201ca relationship with the EU based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals\u201d, but has ramped up preparations in case talks with Brussels break down.

In a no-deal scenario, the UK would be responsible for patrolling and enforcing the exclusion of foreign vessels in its economic waters, a vast area of 80,000 nautical square miles into the Atlantic and the North sea.

Some claims date back to the 1940s.</p> <p>Of the alleged offences, 47% were not investigated by police, in over a third of these cases because the suspect was dead. In a fifth of discontinued claims, suspects could not be identified.

      "bodyText": "Police say they are uncovering a hidden \u201cepidemic\u201d of paedophile abuse in the 1970s and 1980s, with thousands of allegations leading to convictions against people who abused their power to attack children. New figures seen by the Guardian show that 4,024 allegations led to guilty verdicts at court after police investigations since 2014 into decades-old child sex offences. Officers say hundreds of offenders, including teachers, religious workers, youth and care workers, thought they had got away with their crimes. Many victims have been traumatised, and some have killed themselves or been left with severe mental health problems. Police believe the figures, which show that 35% of all allegations led to guilty verdicts, demonstrate that inquiries into non-recent sexual abuse are not \u201cspaffing money up the wall\u201d, as Boris Johnson last year claimed. Labour said Johnson should apologise to victims. Officers believe there are many more allegations to come, and Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the national lead for child protection and abuse investigations, told the Guardian: \u201cWe are now having to come to terms, as a society, and we are going to have to recognise and accept, that during the 1970s and 1980s in particular, there was widespread sexual abuse of children taking place. \u201cThese allegations and the vast majority of cases were never reported to the authorities. Some victims did not think they were going to be believed. There was one constant factor: there was an abuse of power \u2026 to satisfy their sexual desires.\u201d Among those convicted were care home boss John Allen, 78, jailed for 14 years for attacking five child victims between 1976 and 1984, Timothy Mawer, 51, a badminton coach jailed for abusing seven victims in the 1980s and 90s, and John Clifford Davies, 61, a children\u2019s home worker jailed for 24 years for a string offences in the 1970s and 80s. The national operation coordinating claims of non-recent child sexual abuse began in 2014 and is called Operation Hydrant. It began after the Jimmy Savile scandal prompted more victims to come forward. Since Hydrant\u2019s launch, 7,000 suspects have been identified, with 11,346 allegations of attacks received from 9,343 victims, all concerning sexual abuse of children. Some claims date back to the 1940s. Of the alleged offences, 47% were not investigated by police, in over a third of these cases because the suspect was dead. In a fifth of discontinued claims, suspects could not be identified. More than one-third of the allegations resulted in convictions at court, with 6% resulting in acquittal. The conviction rate comes despite cases from long ago being harder to investigate because of fewer, if any, forensic clues. Some paedophiles who had escaped justice were convicted of multiple attacks, with one found guilty of 78 offences, based on allegations made by 10 victims. It is the first time Operation Hydrant has released conviction figures for non-recent child sexual abuse. Bailey, who is chief constable of Norfolk police, said: \u201cThere was an epidemic of it in the 1970s and 1980s. We do not understand the true scale of it. There is a lot to come out. There are a lot more victims who are yet to come forward. \u201cThe really difficult thing to come to terms with is the untold damage that\u2019s been done to victims and survivors. Some could not cope. It\u2019s the toll that it has taken on their lives. Some victims committed suicide. Some coped, some are in the mental care system. The horrors bestowed on these children are horrific.\u201d Contemporary cases of child sexual abuse are also rising. \u201cPolicing today is having to deal with the sins of the past,\u201d the chief constable said, with some paedophiles who offended in the past still presenting a danger today. Bailey said: \u201cIt is crucial we continue to listen to the voices of those abused and investigate allegations thoroughly and impartially, irrespective of when the offence took place.\u201d In March 2019, Johnson, while foreign secretary, tried to deflect criticism about police cuts and told LBC radio: \u201cI think an awful lot of money, an awful lot of police time, now goes into these historic offences and all this malarkey, and you know \u00a360m I saw has been spaffed up the wall on some investigation into historic child abuse?

The prime minister should have the decency to look them in the eye and apologise for claiming it was a waste of money.\u201d Disastrous cases such as Operation Midland, where the Metropolitan police fell for the lies of a fantasist as they pursued bogus claims against high-profile figures, led to some scepticism about the need to pursue non-recent cases. Police say \u201cpersons of public prominence\u201d make up 3% of suspects and include 44 politicians, mostly at a local level, 60 people from the entertainment industry, 31 from music and 30 from the world of sport. Allegations flooded in after the Guardian revealed claims of an abuse cover-up in football after Andy Woodward bravely came forward. A government inquiry into child sexual abuse and claims of a cover-up continues. Gabrielle Shaw, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: \u201cWe know from what victims and survivors tell us that being able to report what happened to the police is healing for many people, sometimes even when a case cannot be pursued. Thirty-five percent of offenders brought to justice for non-recent abuse is very encouraging.\u201d \u2022 If you feel you need help then the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC) provides support to adults who experienced abuse as a child.

There has been nobody quite like him in contemporary British intellectual life.</p> <p>He was feted and laden with honours from learned societies, research institutes and distinguished universities. Few academics of his generation received so many professions of respect. Yet, Steiner was far from satisfied. He felt that Cambridge University had behaved abominably in not appointing him to a lectureship. Those who remained silent about his ideas, or wrote mocking reviews of his books, were, he thought, all too likely to appropriate his central themes without acknowledgment.</p> <p>The universities that fell over themselves to honour him had, with few exceptions, he claimed, been complicit in the erosion of literacy and the betrayal of standards demanded by mass society. As the level of civilised literacy declined, he found aficionados of \u201ctheory\u201d (a term he held in special contempt) in so-called elite institutions, and sardonically noted that there were more opportunities to study popular culture in such institutions than to read Dante.</p> <p>Steiner felt the democratisation of high culture had produced a collapse in genuine literacy. He passionately believed in the need to \u201cread well\u201d, to \u201cengage the immediacy of felt presence in a text at every level of encounter\u201d. He was bleakly uneasy about art that was raucous, disposable and that existed as performance. The humanistic elite alone had responsibility for the continuity of culture: \u201cNinety-nine per cent of humanity,\u201d he argued, \u201ccontributes nothing to the sum of insight, of beauty, of moral trial in our civil condition.\u201d</p> <p>Everything he saw around him in the 60s left him agitated and enraged. His doubts over the American role in Vietnam were publicly expressed, but his misgivings about American civilisation went even deeper. In 1981, in an essay titled The Archives of Eden, which was intensely resented in the US, Steiner passed magisterial judgment upon an entire culture. He argued that American music was \u201cof an essentially provincial character\u201d and that American philosophy was \u201cthin stuff\u201d. The greatest American achievements in thought and culture were, he asserted, largely the product of European artists and intellectuals.</p> <p>Steiner\u2019s parents, Frederick and Elsie (nee Franzos), were secular Jews who lived in a cultured Viennese milieu of reading and music. His father, an investment banker, reached a high position in the Austrian Central Bank, but the shrunken horizons of post-Versailles Austria prompted a move. Although nominally Zionists, the Steiners had no wish to settle in Palestine, and in 1924 the family went to Paris, where George was born.</p> <p>Their lives there were cosmopolitan, secular and multilingual. English, French and German were readily spoken at home. \u201cMy mother, so Viennese,\u201d recalled Steiner, \u201chabitually began a sentence in one language and ended it in another.\u201d In his autobiography, Errata: An Examined Life (1997), Steiner recalled the \u201cperpetual joy\u201d at being raised in a polyglot home.</p> <p>With \u201cgrim clairvoyance\u201d, Frederick foresaw the fate of the Jews as the threat of Hitler\u2019s regime loured over Europe. A quiet tip from a German banking friend impelled him to get the family out of Europe. They went to New York in 1940, settling in Manhattan, and George was enrolled in a French lyc\u00e9e, becoming a naturalised citizen in 1944.</p> <p>He was able to complete the requirements for a BA at the University of Chicago at age of 19. There were quotas on Jews at the Ivy League universities in the 1940s, but none at the University of Chicago, and its well-founded reputation for highbrow intellectuality attracted a brilliant cohort of assimilated Jews.

      "bodyText": "George Steiner, who has died aged 90, was a polymathic European intellectual of particular severity. In an academic career that took him from the University of Chicago to Harvard, Oxford, Princeton, Cambridge and Geneva, Steiner held forth on tragedy, reading, the decline of literacy, the possibilities of translation, science and chess. He crossed swords with Noam Chomsky on linguistics and wrote the Fontana Modern Masters volume on the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. For half a century, Steiner was a commanding reviewer and a subtle and enthralling lecturer. His books established fields, set agendas, and upheld the highest standards. There has been nobody quite like him in contemporary British intellectual life. He was feted and laden with honours from learned societies, research institutes and distinguished universities. Few academics of his generation received so many professions of respect. Yet, Steiner was far from satisfied. He felt that Cambridge University had behaved abominably in not appointing him to a lectureship. Those who remained silent about his ideas, or wrote mocking reviews of his books, were, he thought, all too likely to appropriate his central themes without acknowledgment. The universities that fell over themselves to honour him had, with few exceptions, he claimed, been complicit in the erosion of literacy and the betrayal of standards demanded by mass society. As the level of civilised literacy declined, he found aficionados of \u201ctheory\u201d (a term he held in special contempt) in so-called elite institutions, and sardonically noted that there were more opportunities to study popular culture in such institutions than to read Dante. Steiner felt the democratisation of high culture had produced a collapse in genuine literacy. He passionately believed in the need to \u201cread well\u201d, to \u201cengage the immediacy of felt presence in a text at every level of encounter\u201d. He was bleakly uneasy about art that was raucous, disposable and that existed as performance. The humanistic elite alone had responsibility for the continuity of culture: \u201cNinety-nine per cent of humanity,\u201d he argued, \u201ccontributes nothing to the sum of insight, of beauty, of moral trial in our civil condition.\u201d Everything he saw around him in the 60s left him agitated and enraged. His doubts over the American role in Vietnam were publicly expressed, but his misgivings about American civilisation went even deeper. In 1981, in an essay titled The Archives of Eden, which was intensely resented in the US, Steiner passed magisterial judgment upon an entire culture.

The greatest American achievements in thought and culture were, he asserted, largely the product of European artists and intellectuals. Steiner\u2019s parents, Frederick and Elsie (nee Franzos), were secular Jews who lived in a cultured Viennese milieu of reading and music. His father, an investment banker, reached a high position in the Austrian Central Bank, but the shrunken horizons of post-Versailles Austria prompted a move.

With \u201cgrim clairvoyance\u201d, Frederick foresaw the fate of the Jews as the threat of Hitler\u2019s regime loured over Europe. A quiet tip from a German banking friend impelled him to get the family out of Europe.

He was able to complete the requirements for a BA at the University of Chicago at age of 19. There were quotas on Jews at the Ivy League universities in the 1940s, but none at the University of Chicago, and its well-founded reputation for highbrow intellectuality attracted a brilliant cohort of assimilated Jews. The careers of Saul Bellow, Allan Bloom, Philip Roth and Susan Sontag were shaped by that unique educational environment. It was at Chicago that Steiner first encountered the work of Heidegger. \u201cI can still feel a hammering excitement that no other university has ever stirred in me,\u201d he wrote in 1989. He took a master\u2019s degree at Harvard in 1950, and won a Rhodes scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he contributed to Oxford poetry magazines, won the chancellor\u2019s English essay prize, and was interviewed by Sylvia Plath for an article in Mademoiselle magazine. He worked at the Economist for four happy years from 1952 and then was invited to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He spent 1958-59 on a Fulbright professorship teaching at Innsbruck, returning to Princeton in 1959 as the Gauss lecturer. His first book, Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky: An Essay in the Old Criticism, appeared in 1959. Two years later he was appointed a founding fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge, and The Death of Tragedy, a wide-ranging and erudite study of the classic texts, was published. Among its most enthusiastic reviewers was CP Snow, who became a friend and a valued guide to the Cambridge labyrinth in the early 1960s. Steiner\u2019s unsuccessful 1969 interview for a university lectureship was decided, he felt, when Muriel Bradbrook asked whether he had actually written that \u201cto shoot a man because you disagree with him about Hegel\u2019s dialectic is after all to honour the human spirit\u201d. Steiner agreed that he had written that sentence. A feeling of being misunderstood and ill-appreciated at Cambridge contributed to his frosty relationship with the faculty. The suspicion at Cambridge was that, for all his polymathic intellectual achievements, Steiner was something of a fraud. Nothing revealed the disagreeable inner life of \u201cCambridge English\u201d more clearly than the attitude so often expressed, more in private than in public, towards Steiner. He found people in other disciplines, and not his ostensible colleagues in the English faculty, more congenial company during these years. After the debacle of his lectureship rejection he was elected to an extraordinary fellowship at Churchill College. By then Steiner had established himself as a fluent and prolific essayist, publishing Language and Silence in 1967. In Bluebeard\u2019s Castle, originally delivered as lectures at the University of Kent, followed in 1971. Extraterritorial (1972) suggested how strongly Steiner was drawn to technical work in linguistics, science and philosophy. The great extraterritorial writers, \u201cdriven from language to language by social upheaval and war\u201d, were uniquely spokesmen of the age. Steiner collected what he called his \u201cworking papers\u201d of the 1970s in On Difficulty (1978), in which he explored two prophetic themes: the decline of privacy, and with it the emergence of new and threatening expectations of public exposure and utterance, and the changing status of the act of reading. That there was a decline in the \u201chabits of solitary, exclusive reading\u201d he felt was unmistakable, and perhaps inevitable. \u201cWhat we must try to see to,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis that those who want to learn to read fully can do so and that they be allowed the critical space and freedom from competing noise in which to practice their passion.\u201d Penguin Books published George Steiner: A Reader in 1984, but it was No Passion Spent (1996), a collection of his essays of the two previous decades, that more comprehensively represented the range of his interests. In the 1970s Steiner\u2019s BBC radio talks and his book reviews in the Sunday Times and the TLS did much to make British intellectual life less provincial. He helped introduce the work of Jean Starobinski, Paul Ricoeur, Ernst Bloch, Theodor W Adorno, Thomas Bernhard (whom he regarded as the most important postwar German novelist), Paul Celan and Walter Benjamin to the Anglo-American world. He contributed more than 130 substantial reviews to The New Yorker between 1967 and 1997; George Steiner at the New Yorker (2009) collected perhaps a third of these pieces. Steiner held a Guggenheim fellowship in 1971, and was appointed in 1972 to a chair in comparative literature at Geneva University where, while deconstruction and the influence of Jacques Derrida spread like a rash across the European and American academy, Steiner conducted a fabled doctoral seminar on comparative literature and poetics. He turned increasingly to the study of translation, and to the enduring legacy of classical myths in western culture. After Babel (1973), an exploration of the nature and possibilities of translation, contained examples of Steiner\u2019s bravura skills at what in Cambridge was called \u201cpractical criticism\u201d (the close verbal analysis of passages of verse). Hostile to \u201ctheories of translation\u201d, Steiner anticipated the remarkable flowering of translation into English that Seamus Heaney, Ted Hughes, Derek Walcott and others brought about. From Steiner\u2019s seminal book came dozens of academic centres for translation, not least that led by WG Sebald at the University of East Anglia. Steiner, who had childhood memories of hearing Hitler\u2019s speeches on the radio, had earlier noted in his Kent lectures that \u201cmuch of my work has concerned itself, directly or indirectly, with trying to understand, to articulate, causal and teleological aspects of the Holocaust\u201d.

Perhaps not, but admirers of his work, and there are many, might prefer to leave it as that: an elderly though vigorous man playing with semantic Don Juanism. Steiner\u2019s personal papers were donated in 2000 to Churchill College, Cambridge. In 1955 he married Zara Shakow, who became a distinguished political historian.

Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to \u201cavoid dangerous climate change\u201d, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.</p>\n    <p>The UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time&nbsp;to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.</p>\n    <p>The negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.<br></p>\n    <p>Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fiona-harvey\"><b>Fiona Harvey</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Environment correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, , the government\u2019s statutory adviser, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChiefExecCCC/status/1224998675652521986?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cI think I speak for most friendly independent climate advisory bodies when I say I\u2019d like to see this COP 26 business sorted out sharpish.

The appointment of Ricardo Lopes Dias, an anthropologist and evangelical pastor, to head the department for isolated and recently contacted tribes at the indigenous agency Funai, was announced on Wednesday. Dias will have detailed information on 107 isolated tribes, including monitoring and location studies. Brazil has more \u201cvoluntarily isolated\u201d tribes \u2013 some of whom are believed to have hidden from white society after massacres and epidemics \u2013 than any other country. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people, said: \u201cThis is a dangerous decision that may have the potential to cause genocide among isolated indigenous people.\u201d Bolsonaro has frequently made racist remarks about the country\u2019s indigenous people, recently commenting that they were \u201cincreasingly becoming human beings just like us\u201d. Critics say he is bargaining indigenous lives for political support from the powerful evangelical lobby, just as his attacks on environmental agencies have appeased wildcat miners and farmers in the Amazon. \u201cThere are those who see nothing but the greed of land-grabbers, cattle ranchers and mining companies driving Bolsonaro\u2019s anti-indigenous policies. But it\u2019s clear cultural annihilation with religious dividends is also guiding the presidency,\u201d the Folha de S Paulo newspaper said on Tuesday. Critics said Dias\u2019s appointment threatened the survival of vulnerable isolated groups, which in the past have been decimated by diseases like measles and flu after coming into contact with evangelical missionaries, government employees and outsiders. The Brazilian Amazon indigenous organisation Coiab warned of \u201cthe crimes of genocide and ethnocide that will be committed against our isolated relatives\u201d. Beto Marubo, an indigenous leader from the Javari Valley reserve, said evangelical missionaries destroy the \u201ccosmological and ethical\u201d belief systems of indigenous people. \u201cThe behaviour of missionaries in indigenous communities is as malign as a disease,\u201d he said. Between 1997 and 2007, Dias worked as a missionary in the same reserve for the controversial group New Tribes Mission, who pledged to convert every last \u201cunreached people group\u201d on earth.

No darkness is too dark for God,\u201d CEO Larry Brown says in a video on its website. In his 2015 dissertation for a social science master\u2019s degree, Dias said he decided as a young man to commit himself to the \u201ccause\u201d of evangelizing among indigenous people. Speaking to O Globo newspaper last week, he refused to say whether he would change Brazil\u2019s 37-year rule of \u201cno contact\u201d with indigenous people. \u201cMy performance will be technical. I will not promote evangelisation of indigenous people,\u201d he said. But Brazil\u2019s public defender\u2019s office said such a nomination risked \u201cthe mass death of indigenous people from illness resulting from irresponsible contact, or conflicts between religious missions, loggers, wildcat miners, hunters and illegal fishermen\u201d. Indigenous experts said the move to allow evangelical missionaries to contact remote tribes has already begun. They allege a missionary group is using a mental health visit to gain access to a remote Amazon tribe they were previously expelled from. Following an alert from a local Funai official, the federal prosecutor for Amazonas state has written to the head of the government\u2019s indigenous health service (Sesai) demanding details of the mission to visit the remote Suruwaha tribe. According to the alert, the visit will be led by Sesai\u2019s boss, Silvia Wai\u00e3pi \u2013 an indigenous woman, army officer and former soap opera actor who campaigned for Bolsonaro. It also includes two Suruwaha indigenous women who live in an evangelical community in Bras\u00edlia run by Jocum \u2013 the Brazilian arm of international evangelical missionary group Youth With A Mission. Four psychologists and a Jocum linguist are also in the group. Federal prosecutors ordered Funai to expel Jocum missionaries from the Suruwaha reserve in 2003. The latest mission was launched after five Suruwaha killed themselves last year. About 150 people live in the community, where ritual suicides have long been part of the culture. One Swiss study counted up to 12 suicides a year between 1984 and 2018.

If you look at the numbers, my demographic in the 40s, Bernie\u2019s edging him, I think. In this area in particular it\u2019s very important for Biden to make a strong appeal and I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to take for that. I\u2019m kind of waiting for him.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tired and bickering Democratic candidates frantically crisscrossed New Hampshire on Wednesday morning as they tried to regain their footing after the breakdown of the Iowa caucuses voting process threw the 2020 US election into chaos earlier in the week. On the day that a buoyant Donald Trump went from a triumphalist State of the Union address to expecting acquittal in the final vote of his impeachment trial in Washington, Democrats scrambled to appear competitive both with Trump and with each other on a tense campaign trail. Joe Biden, speaking at a crowded church event on a crisp sunny day in New Hampshire on Wednesday morning, was noticeably down \u2013 but insisted he was far from out after a disappointing showing in the results that have trickled in from Iowa so far. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch in Iowa,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThe whole process took a gut punch,\u201d he added. Those comments reflect the view among Democrats that the Iowa caucuses left the Democratic primary field in disarray and that Biden lost significant ground against his chief rivals in the state after the vote collection process collapsed on Monday night. Biden said: \u201cYou know, 24 hours later we\u2019re still trying to figure out what happened. At this rate New Hampshire might get the first vote after all.\u201d The New Hampshire primary is next Tuesday. Biden has been placed a disappointing fourth so far in Iowa, behind the leading Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, despite being the frontrunner in national polls. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time in my life I\u2019ve gotten knocked down,\u201d Biden said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d The former vice-president in Barack Obama\u2019s administration is sticking with his overall viability, or electability, as his rationale for voters to pick him over other more adventurous choices. He told voters to ask themselves: \u201c\u2018Can the person I\u2019m voting for beat Donald Trump?\u2019 I believe I can.\u201d Meanwhile, Buttigieg was taking every opportunity on Tuesday and Wednesday to proclaim victory in Iowa and leverage his surge to try to win in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary vote in the nation next Tuesday, followed by contests in Nevada and South Carolina later this month. The official overall winner of the Iowa caucuses, held on Monday, still had not been declared on Wednesday morning, after the breakdown of a new data collection app threw the contest into utter chaos. Party organizers had to rely on an overwhelmed phone system and paper votes in the end, and with between 60% and 70% of voting precincts\u2019 results made known by Wednesday, Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, remained slightly ahead of Vermont senator Sanders. Later on Wednesday morning, sitting US senators Sanders, Warren and Amy Klobuchar again had to interrupt their races to fly back to Washington for the final impeachment vote on Trump. The president was expected to be acquitted by a loyal Republican majority in the Senate later on Wednesday, not thrown out of office as Democrats strived to do by impeaching him on charges that he abused his office by pressuring the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden while holding back US military aid for leverage. Despite having been impeached, Trump has been gleeful about the mess in Iowa as he seeks to ride the strong economy and an enthusiastic conservative base to re-election. The Democratic candidates will rush back to the campaign trail shortly after the impeachment vote, with no time to lose and the New Hampshire primary taking on increased significance in the wake of the Iowa confusion. In the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, polling had showed Sanders with a significant lead over his rivals and Biden also jostling near the top. The belated results proved disappointing for both. Warren, who has been struggling to recapture the traction she was building during a surge last year, held an event in New Hampshire at the same time as Biden on Wednesday morning before heading to Washington. With the three leading men on an attention-grabbing seesaw of good and bad news, Warren\u2019s position of being solidly in the middle of the field coming out of Iowa brings the growing risk of invisibility. Accompanied to New Hampshire by his husband, Chasten, on Tuesday, Buttigieg was both emotional and ebullient as he acknowledged leading the field in Iowa. But he admitted his campaign\u2019s weakness when asked how he would win over reluctant African American voters \u2013 a persistent question for his candidacy, saying he \u201chad a lot of work to do\u201d in states such as South Carolina. \u201cAnd the process of proving that begins here in New Hampshire as we make our way on to states like Nevada, South Carolina and the Super Tuesday states as well. And we will earn that support,\u201d he said. Sanders, with his wife, Jane, out on the campaign trail, too, has been making overt efforts to court the large number of Latino voters in Nevada. And with Biden overwhelmingly the favorite with the majority African American Democratic party electorate in South Carolina, Buttigieg could be in danger of peaking too soon. On Wednesday, Biden attacked both Sanders, a self-declared socialist, and the more moderate Buttigieg, an openly gay military veteran. \u201cI have great respect for Mayor Pete and his service to this nation but I do believe it\u2019s a risk, to be just straight up with you, for this party to nominate someone who\u2019s never held office higher than mayor of a town of 100,000 people.\u201d Biden warned that Democrats on all levels would face a tougher election in November if Sanders got the party nomination to fight for the White House. Alluding to Sanders\u2019s longtime identification as a democratic socialist, Biden warned every Democrat \u201cwill have to carry the label he chose for himself\u201d. Attendees at the Biden event were a mix of curious voters and hardcore committed Biden supporters. Jess Knowles, 25, came because he was curious about the former vice-president but also worried how he would fair against Trump in the general election. \u201cIf he stumbles over words or seems a little foggy, that won\u2019t end well. So I\u2019m here to see how he is on the stump,\u201d Knowles said. Thomas Young, a firm Biden supporter, said the still-developing Iowa results didn\u2019t sway him. \u201cI don\u2019t see that as indicative as everybody else does. I don\u2019t see that as \u2018OK, Pete Buttigieg is going to win\u2019,\u201d he said. Paul Turner, an undecided Democrat at the event, said: \u201cI\u2019m looking for Biden to rebound \u2013 I\u2019m for looking for more excitement, more energy from him, to get more of the youthful vote. If you look at the numbers, my demographic in the 40s, Bernie\u2019s edging him, I think. In this area in particular it\u2019s very important for Biden to make a strong appeal and I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to take for that. I\u2019m kind of waiting for him.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWhen in a hole, stop digging\u201d is an iron law of politics, but not one that Boris Johnson recognises. He made his name by flouting conventional wisdom and gives the impression there\u2019s no reason to stop. In the case of High Speed 2 \u2013 a railway where costs have doubled to around \u00a3100bn \u2013 he joked to schoolchildren last week that with a hole this big \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/31/boris-johnson-hs2-keep-digging\" title=\"\">the only thing to do is keep digging</a>\u201d. Yet Mr Johnson knows the arguments are finely balanced: between those who claim the scheme will be an economic boost for a country far too reliant on the south-east and highly polluting forms of travel, against those who say it is not the most cost-effective or the greenest solution to the problems it is intended to solve.</p> <p>Mr Johnson has yet to make a convincing case for proceeding with the project \u2013 which his chief adviser calls a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7381615/Boris-Johnsons-aide-Dominic-Cummings-called-HS2-disaster-zone.html\" title=\"\">disaster zone</a>\u201d. Instead the prime minister has hidden behind a review that he launched last August and leaks suggesting that Douglas Oakervee, the former HS2 chairman reporting to Mr Johnson, strongly \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51319261\" title=\"\">advised against cancelling the project</a>\u201d. There\u2019s no doubt HS2 has been mismanaged and is well behind schedule and over budget. More than \u00a37bn has been sunk into the project. The first trains were supposed to run by 2026 but won\u2019t pull out of stations <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2019-09-03/HCWS1809/\" title=\"\">before 2028</a>. The project\u2019s objectives are pretty clear: to increase capacity on the railway to meet long-term demand; to rebalance the economy by stimulating growth in the north of England; and to do both of these things in the most environmentally sustainable way possible. But is HS2 the answer to the questions raised? Or would a better reply be to scrap it and start with something else?</p> <p>Mr Oakervee\u2019s review, it has been <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/hs2-will-boost-north-despite-soaring-costs-gkd3k58lm\" title=\"\">reported</a>, says that even with the extra costs there will be a benefit to the wider economy, though this has fallen from \u00a32.30 for every \u00a31 spent in 2017 to between \u00a31.30 and \u00a31.50 for every \u00a31 spent this year. Given how badly the project has been run, there is every reason to be sceptical about these figures, but this should not blur into outright cynicism. That HS2 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/04/northern-powerhouse-rail-backers-say-hs2-vital-success\" title=\"\">benefits</a> the north ought not to be a difficult argument to win. Yet it has not been made in a convincing manner.</p> <p>The mistake is to see HS2 solely as a high-speed service to and from London. In fact the new railway\u2019s hidden worth is that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/03/hs2-will-spark-regeneration-say-city-leaders-on-the-route\" title=\"\">frees up capacity</a> on lines that are almost full and run into cities like Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. By segregating the high-speed operator on to its own railway, more services can run on lines that currently have to deal with a complex \u2013 and inevitably sluggish \u2013 mixture of slow and fast trains. That is why city leaders back HS2 even though its first phase does not reach them. The concern is that pulling the plug on HS2 would not lead to alternative local rail improvements in the north of England. Transport traditionally comes off a poor second to the NHS and schools. Under the Tories it has been <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2018-10-27/hammond-to-unveil-28bn-budget-boost-for-englands-roads-network/\" title=\"\">roads</a> that have received the cash. With that in mind, consider that though HS2 will destroy swathes of ancient woodland, it will only do roughly as much damage as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/permanentrail/status/1174268126705410051\" title=\"\">one 15-mile stretch of motorway</a>. All that can be done to mitigate its impact should be done.</p> <p>Transport is the UK\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, which have been flat since 2008. HS2\u2019s conservative estimate is that over 120 years it will not cut carbon emissions. Yet without a ready <a href=\"https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/A_Rail_Network_for_Everyone_WEB.pdf\" title=\"\">alternative</a> to free up space on the rail network there will be no way of tempting people out of cars, trucks and planes.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhen in a hole, stop digging\u201d is an iron law of politics, but not one that Boris Johnson recognises. He made his name by flouting conventional wisdom and gives the impression there\u2019s no reason to stop. In the case of High Speed 2 \u2013 a railway where costs have doubled to around \u00a3100bn \u2013 he joked to schoolchildren last week that with a hole this big \u201cthe only thing to do is keep digging\u201d. Yet Mr Johnson knows the arguments are finely balanced: between those who claim the scheme will be an economic boost for a country far too reliant on the south-east and highly polluting forms of travel, against those who say it is not the most cost-effective or the greenest solution to the problems it is intended to solve. Mr Johnson has yet to make a convincing case for proceeding with the project \u2013 which his chief adviser calls a \u201cdisaster zone\u201d. Instead the prime minister has hidden behind a review that he launched last August and leaks suggesting that Douglas Oakervee, the former HS2 chairman reporting to Mr Johnson, strongly \u201cadvised against cancelling the project\u201d. There\u2019s no doubt HS2 has been mismanaged and is well behind schedule and over budget. More than \u00a37bn has been sunk into the project. The first trains were supposed to run by 2026 but won\u2019t pull out of stations before 2028. The project\u2019s objectives are pretty clear: to increase capacity on the railway to meet long-term demand; to rebalance the economy by stimulating growth in the north of England; and to do both of these things in the most environmentally sustainable way possible. But is HS2 the answer to the questions raised? Or would a better reply be to scrap it and start with something else? Mr Oakervee\u2019s review, it has been reported, says that even with the extra costs there will be a benefit to the wider economy, though this has fallen from \u00a32.30 for every \u00a31 spent in 2017 to between \u00a31.30 and \u00a31.50 for every \u00a31 spent this year. Given how badly the project has been run, there is every reason to be sceptical about these figures, but this should not blur into outright cynicism. That HS2 benefits the north ought not to be a difficult argument to win. Yet it has not been made in a convincing manner. The mistake is to see HS2 solely as a high-speed service to and from London. In fact the new railway\u2019s hidden worth is that it frees up capacity on lines that are almost full and run into cities like Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. By segregating the high-speed operator on to its own railway, more services can run on lines that currently have to deal with a complex \u2013 and inevitably sluggish \u2013 mixture of slow and fast trains. That is why city leaders back HS2 even though its first phase does not reach them. The concern is that pulling the plug on HS2 would not lead to alternative local rail improvements in the north of England. Transport traditionally comes off a poor second to the NHS and schools. Under the Tories it has been roads that have received the cash. With that in mind, consider that though HS2 will destroy swathes of ancient woodland, it will only do roughly as much damage as one 15-mile stretch of motorway. All that can be done to mitigate its impact should be done. Transport is the UK\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, which have been flat since 2008. HS2\u2019s conservative estimate is that over 120 years it will not cut carbon emissions. Yet without a ready alternative to free up space on the rail network there will be no way of tempting people out of cars, trucks and planes. So far there\u2019s no strategic plan from ministers that meshes the railway fix that HS2 provides with money and links to ambitious schemes for local buses, trams, cycling and walking. Government can\u2019t just endorse HS2 without giving a green light to the National Infrastructure Commission\u2019s recommendations for significant investment in public transport. Ministers ought to also block the third runway at Heathrow. The Treasury has said public spending on infrastructure should be around 1% of GDP a year \u2013 about \u00a325bn \u2013 for the next 30 years. There is no fiscal reason not to proceed with HS2 as long as it can be part of the answer to the climate emergency. On balance HS2 ought to go ahead in an integrated transport plan designed to cut carbon and maximise the transfer from road and air to rail.",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill.

In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

Many airlines have, however, stopped flying to the country.</p> \n<p>While the UK is among a number of countries to have evacuated thei citizens from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, which is under lockdown, it is alone in advising all citizens anywhere in China to leave. But the Foreign Office briefed that early return was advisable in case the outbreak spread within China and travel restrictions made it difficult to leave.</p> \n<p>The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, accused the government of asking Britons in China to fend for themselves. \u201cHow on earth has the Foreign Office not got plans and protocols in place for how these crises are managed? The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens, at home and abroad, and Boris Johnson is manifestly failing to do that,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Matt Hancock said on Wednesday morning that the government\u2019s stance was based on scientific advice. \u201cThere are still commercial flights available,\u201d the health secretary said on BBC Breakfast. \u201cThe principle that we are taking is that we want to take no chances with this virus. We want to take a science-led approach. The approach we have been taking is very much driven by the advice of the chief medical officer.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a very serious virus and having a very serious impact in China. There are two cases only here in the UK, but we do expect more, so we are taking no chances.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Canada\u2019s foreign minister said on Wednesday that Canadians who do not need to be in China should leave while they still can. Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne told reporters: \u201cWe are advising Canadians whose presence in China is not essential to depart via commercial means while they remain available.\u201d</p> \n<p>Canada intended to fly 200 citizens out on Wednesday, but was waiting another 24 hours because of bad weather, prime minister Justin Trudeau said earlier.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK has been criticised by the World Health Organization\u2019s director general for urging all its 30,000 citizens in China to leave the country because of the coronavirus outbreak. It was wrong to imply that the whole of China had an outbreak on the same scale as that in Wuhan in Hubei province, where it began and where most of the cases and deaths are still occurring, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cConsidering China as if the problem was the same in all provinces could be wrong \u2013 and it is wrong,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cFor instance, 80% of cases in China are in Hubei province, so that blanket approach may not help. \u201cWe are concerned that all countries make their decisions based on evidence. Even in China there are provinces with very few cases, like other countries in the neighbourhood and beyond.\u201d There have been 24,363 cases of the new coronavirus confirmed in China and 490 deaths, he said at a briefing in Geneva. In the previous 24 hours the largest number of cases were reported in a day since the outbreak began. Outside China, there were 191 cases in 24 countries and one death, in the Philippines. Dr Michael Ryan, head of the WHO\u2019s emergencies programme, said they were asking governments to adopt calm, well-considered public health measures. \u201cCertainly in a situation where many individuals are potentially living in the country, we don\u2019t believe those individuals are necessarily at the highest risk.\u201d He pointed out that recalling such a large number of people to the UK would require a great deal of screening and public health support on their return. The WHO was monitoring all the measures that countries outside China were taking and would be sharing its findings with other member states \u201cto try to bring some cohesion and order\u201d to countries\u2019 responses to the crisis. The new advice to British nationals in China came out of the blue on Tuesday in a statement from foreign secretary Dominic Raab: \u201cWe now advise British nationals in China to leave the country if they can, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus.\u201d The advice came just a few days after the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, but urged countries not to impose travel or trade restrictions on China. Many airlines have, however, stopped flying to the country. While the UK is among a number of countries to have evacuated thei citizens from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, which is under lockdown, it is alone in advising all citizens anywhere in China to leave. But the Foreign Office briefed that early return was advisable in case the outbreak spread within China and travel restrictions made it difficult to leave. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, accused the government of asking Britons in China to fend for themselves. \u201cHow on earth has the Foreign Office not got plans and protocols in place for how these crises are managed? The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens, at home and abroad, and Boris Johnson is manifestly failing to do that,\u201d she said. Matt Hancock said on Wednesday morning that the government\u2019s stance was based on scientific advice. \u201cThere are still commercial flights available,\u201d the health secretary said on BBC Breakfast. \u201cThe principle that we are taking is that we want to take no chances with this virus. We want to take a science-led approach. The approach we have been taking is very much driven by the advice of the chief medical officer. \u201cThis is a very serious virus and having a very serious impact in China. There are two cases only here in the UK, but we do expect more, so we are taking no chances.\u201d Meanwhile, Canada\u2019s foreign minister said on Wednesday that Canadians who do not need to be in China should leave while they still can. Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne told reporters: \u201cWe are advising Canadians whose presence in China is not essential to depart via commercial means while they remain available.\u201d Canada intended to fly 200 citizens out on Wednesday, but was waiting another 24 hours because of bad weather, prime minister Justin Trudeau said earlier.",

Boris Johnson, who has brought Northern rail into public ownership and delayed the full rollout of universal credit in the last couple of weeks, clearly has other ideas about how popular the measures Long-Bailey would pursue are. Is the problem that she has the temerity to be a woman of the left?

      "bodyText": "The family of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn and the alleged victims of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein have united to put pressure on Anne Sacoolas and the Duke of York to \u201cco-operate with law enforcement\u201d. Lisa Bloom, lawyer for six alleged Epstein victims, and Radd Seiger, spokesman for the parents of Dunn, 19, joined forces on Wednesday to call for Sacoolas to return to the UK, and for Prince Andrew to face questioning by the FBI in the US. Bloom\u2019s clients, who are pursuing civil claims against the late financier and convicted sex offender\u2019s estate, want Prince Andrew to face questioning over his friendship with Epstein. At a New York press conference with Seiger, Bloom said the \u201cparallels between the two cases are eerie\u201d and involved \u201ceveryday teenagers\u201d who were \u201cvictimised\u201d. \u201cToday we stand with the family of Harry Dunn and they stand with us. Both Mrs Sacoolas and Prince Andrew must cooperate with law enforcement. \u201cI call upon my government, the US, to return Mrs Sacoolas to the UK to face justice\u201d. She said Andrew needed to \u201canswer questions about Jeffrey Epstein and his own behaviour,\u201d adding: \u201cIn both countries everyone is equal in the eyes of the law.\u201d Seiger said it was \u201cterrible advice\u201d for the prince and for Sacoolas if they were being advised that \u201cit\u2019s all going to go away\u201d and they should just \u201cwait it out\u201d. Last month, the New York state attorney, Geoffrey Berman, accused the prince of \u201czero cooperation\u201d and not responding to requests by the FBI and US lawyers for an interview over his friendship with Epstein. Andrew was later said to be \u201cangry and bewildered\u201d about the claims, with sources close to him saying he had not been approached to speak about the case. Dunn was killed when his motorbike was in collision with a car outside a US military base in Northamptonshire in August. Sacoolas, 42, the wife of a US intelligence official based at RAF Croughton, claimed diplomatic immunity after the crash and was able to return to her home country, sparking an international controversy. She was charged with causing the teenager\u2019s death by dangerous driving, but the US has refused an extradition request. Seiger said he had \u201creached out\u201d to Bloom after realising \u201cthat there was a common thread running between these cases.\u201d He said: \u201cIt\u2019s about evasion of justice. \u201cThese are the two greatest allies in the world and they follow a rules-based system. No-one, no matter who you are \u2026 is above the law. \u201cWe all break the rules from time to time but we don\u2019t get to walk away and hide.\u201d In a message to Prince Andrew, Seiger said: \u201cif you have nothing to hide, get on a plane \u2026\u201d, adding: \u201cthere\u2019s no other way\u201d. Seiger said the lawyers were not calling for a \u201cstraight swap\u201d, adding, \u201cbut at the heart of extradition treaties is reciprocity.\u201d The US government\u2019s refusal to extradite Sacoolas was \u201clegally indefensible\u201d and \u201ceffectively ripping up the treaty,\u201d he said. Andrew, who stepped down from royal duties in November after his disastrous interview on BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme over his relationship with Epstein, is reportedly \u201ccommitted to the legal process\u201d. At the time he stood down, he insisted: \u201cI am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency\u201d. Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein, has alleged she was instructed to have sex with Andrew on three occasions from the age of 17. The prince categorically denies he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. While a US investigation is looking at possible \u201cconspirators\u201d who worked with Epstein, Bloom\u2019s alleged victims are involved in a separate civil lawsuit. A source close to Andrew has previously been reported saying: \u201cThe duke is not under any obligation to talk to lawyers representing alleged victims of Epstein at the moment, but he is totally willing to talk to any law enforcement agencies, be they the police or FBI.\u201d Any FBI interview Andrew agrees to give would be voluntary at this stage, and could take place in the UK.",

This is untrue, as well as a huge oversimplification. In 1994, I stopped a press release going out for a painting show I curated for London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/venues/hayward-gallery\">Hayward</a>, which said that painting was \u201cpast its sell-by date\u201d. Here we go again.</p> <p>The end of painting is always kinda sexy. With its profusion of bodies of one sort or another, the artists in this exhibition aren\u2019t so much the walking dead, going blithely on with a dead medium, so much as taking on board the idea that painting can do things other media can\u2019t. Dead or alive, painting goes on. Its end is always being rehearsed and rehashed, perhaps from painting to painting. And much of what we see here \u2013 resplendent bodies, irradiated bodies, bodies imagined from the inside, spectral bodies, remembered bodies, cartoonish bodies, impossible bodies \u2013 has all come into being through the particularities of a medium.

Frequently compared (and even confused) with Doig \u2013 their ways of rendering trees, figures and mountains have sometimes been similar \u2013 Richter has a more scattergun approach to images: a turbaned Taliban and the Marlboro man having a smoke on a mountain, a naked woman in high heels getting up to hanky-panky in the woods \u2013 till she turns her head and we see the face of a grinning, bearded mujahid. I\u2019m not sure gender-fluidity is really Richter\u2019s thing.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Representational painting has been deeply unfashionable and largely superseded by photography and video among young, ambitious artists since the critical backlash against neo-expressionism in the 1980s,\u201d reads a wall text at the start of Radical Figures: Painting in the New Millennium at the Whitechapel Gallery in east London. This is untrue, as well as a huge oversimplification. In 1994, I stopped a press release going out for a painting show I curated for London\u2019s Hayward, which said that painting was \u201cpast its sell-by date\u201d. Here we go again. The end of painting is always kinda sexy. With its profusion of bodies of one sort or another, the artists in this exhibition aren\u2019t so much the walking dead, going blithely on with a dead medium, so much as taking on board the idea that painting can do things other media can\u2019t. Dead or alive, painting goes on. Its end is always being rehearsed and rehashed, perhaps from painting to painting. And much of what we see here \u2013 resplendent bodies, irradiated bodies, bodies imagined from the inside, spectral bodies, remembered bodies, cartoonish bodies, impossible bodies \u2013 has all come into being through the particularities of a medium. The presence, too \u2013 or rather absence \u2013 of the painters Marlene Dumas, Maria Lassnig, Chris Ofili and Peter Doig, who all came to prominence in the 80s and 90s, is felt in much of the work of the 10 artists here. Daniel Richter, at 57 the oldest painter in the show, can be funny. Frequently compared (and even confused) with Doig \u2013 their ways of rendering trees, figures and mountains have sometimes been similar \u2013 Richter has a more scattergun approach to images: a turbaned Taliban and the Marlboro man having a smoke on a mountain, a naked woman in high heels getting up to hanky-panky in the woods \u2013 till she turns her head and we see the face of a grinning, bearded mujahid. I\u2019m not sure gender-fluidity is really Richter\u2019s thing. His best work here is a 2001 image of a group of north African refugees approaching Tarifa on a life raft at night, their clothes and faces fluorescing and fracturing in the light of heat-sensitive cameras as they float above the black swell of the Gibraltar strait. With her blizzards of nearly cohering fragments that assemble and disassemble and almost coalesce just as they are flying apart, Cecily Brown\u2019s paintings barely seem new. The wearying, histrionic flux of her art, rather like the forced humour of Richter\u2019s paintings, and the repetitive satire of Tala Madani\u2019s little pictures of pudgy, balding and bearded Iranian men going about their salacious interludes, their prayers and their business, ends up enervating rather than exciting. In Russian-born, US-based Sanya Kantarovsky\u2019s work, an ill-tempered baby clings to its mother\u2019s bent back like a horrible goading parasite, its hands clasping her red nipple as she struggles through the gloom, with bloodied knees and elbows. The mother here is a sort of stoic victim. In Deprivation, a man leans over a woman, her face hidden, on a bed. She is naked, he still has his shirt on, and it looks as if he is prising his hand out of hers. I do not like this guy, nor the spiderish way he looms over her, nor how his sandy hair falls over his scalp. Nor, indeed, the sickliness of the scene. There are some unexplained, nasty backstories informing the images, and how they are painted. A jumble of faces \u2013 as though multiple personalities or theatrical roles \u2013 flit through the mind of a single person in Ryan Mosley\u2019s Duchess of Oils. In another painting, a bearded man smoking a pipe does something with snakes, and with a number of legs that have inexplicably sprouted heads. I\u2019m reminded here of Enrico David\u2019s sculptural tableaux, but I haven\u2019t a clue where Mosley is going with all this. Another pair of snakes slithers through one of Michael Armitage\u2019s paintings, all of which use a cloth made from bark, or lubugo, as a support: the cloth is more usually used for funeral shrouds in Armitage\u2019s native Kenya. Mostly, the viewer doesn\u2019t notice it, but I guess there are practical as well as symbolic reasons to use it.

In another painting, a group of men look down at a woman lying in a fusty bower. She is in the pose of Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s so-called Rokeby Venus, a painting that was slashed in 1914 by suffragette Mary Richardson. The woman here is about to be violated, too, by the group of men whose feet stand in a row at the top of the canvas. Christina Quarles, whose works were recently at the Hepworth Wakefield, shows more of the same here. Her lascivious, fraught bodies morph and slew, clutching at themselves and at one another in scenes that are as much to do with a disjunctive repertoire of painterly and graphic devices, a drama of forms, as they are to do with any human action. Upstairs, Nicole Eisenman blows everything we\u2019ve seen so far out of the water, with a pair of gigantic 2006 paintings titled Progress: Real and Imagined. In the left panel, the artist sits hunched in her studio on a rackety houseboat, drawing with a quill in a notebook. She\u2019s all at sea in her floating studio. Great lumps of paint congeal on her palette. Flowers explode like fireworks from a vase. Stuff flies around the studio, someone drowns in the waves, the captain is at the tiller looking serious.

Painterly, cartoonish, thick and thin, hilarious, horrible, delicate, monstrous, funny and inventive, this is a world without men \u2013 except for a decapitated fellow who gawps bleakly on the shore.

A waiter moves implacably through the throng. Lights dance on the trees, and death looks back at us through the crowd. This is all enormous fun.

It might be possible, in future, to pick up such mutations using so-called liquid biopsies \u2013 genetic tests that detect mutations in free-floating DNA carried in the blood that can indicate the presence of tumours elsewhere in the body.</p> <p>\u201cOne could try and identify these [early mutations] and do some kind of very sensitive imaging on patients that were positive,\u201d said Van Loo. \u201cOr even further into the future, one could conceive of methods that really targeted these cells and made them light up in an imaging approach or just kill them in one go. That\u2019s a bit science fiction at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>About 363,000 new cancer cases are reported in the UK every year, according to Cancer Research UK, with the disease causing 165,000 deaths annually.</p> <p>The team analysed and sequenced nearly 2,700 whole genomes of cancer samples and mapped mutations in 38 different types of tumours.</p> <p>While human cells undergo billions of mutations, only a small number of them, called driver mutations, give rise to cancer.

      "bodyText": "Early signs of cancer can appear years or even decades before diagnosis, according to the most comprehensive investigation to date of the genetic mutations that cause healthy cells to turn malignant. The findings, based on samples from more than 2,500 tumours and 38 cancer types, reveal a longer-than-expected window of opportunity in which patients could potentially be tested and treated at the earliest stages of the disease. The work was carried out as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project, the most comprehensive study of cancer genetics to date. \u201cWhat\u2019s extraordinary is how some of the genetic changes appear to have occurred many years before diagnosis, long before any other signs that a cancer may develop, and perhaps even in apparently normal tissue,\u201d said Clemency Jolly, a co-author of the research based at the Francis Crick Institute in London. \u201cUnlocking these patterns means it should now be possible to develop new diagnostic tests that pick up signs of cancer much earlier,\u201d said Peter Van Loo, co-lead author, also of the Crick Institute. \u201cThere is a window of opportunity.\u201d The discovery that the seeds of cancer are often sown many years before the first symptoms arise will not change cancer screening in the immediate term. But it points to the possibility that those at risk could be spotted far earlier. The study revealed that about half of the earliest mutations occurred in just nine genes, meaning there is a relatively small pool of common genes that serve as triggers for cells to diverge from healthy development to a path towards cancer. It might be possible, in future, to pick up such mutations using so-called liquid biopsies \u2013 genetic tests that detect mutations in free-floating DNA carried in the blood that can indicate the presence of tumours elsewhere in the body. \u201cOne could try and identify these [early mutations] and do some kind of very sensitive imaging on patients that were positive,\u201d said Van Loo. \u201cOr even further into the future, one could conceive of methods that really targeted these cells and made them light up in an imaging approach or just kill them in one go. That\u2019s a bit science fiction at the moment.\u201d About 363,000 new cancer cases are reported in the UK every year, according to Cancer Research UK, with the disease causing 165,000 deaths annually. The team analysed and sequenced nearly 2,700 whole genomes of cancer samples and mapped mutations in 38 different types of tumours. While human cells undergo billions of mutations, only a small number of them, called driver mutations, give rise to cancer. The researchers looked at how many times a single change, or driver mutation, had been replicated and copied across chromosomes. Using what they describe as a \u201ccarbon-dating method\u201d, they were able to reconstruct the order in which the genomes of cancer cells started to accumulate errors and eventually carry large segments that had been scrambled or copied. The team found that these mutations occurred \u201cparticularly early\u201d in ovarian cancer as well as in two types of brain tumour, glioblastoma and medulloblastoma. The analysis is published in Nature as part of a wider collection of 22 papers from the Pan-Cancer project. Previous research on cancer genetics has focused on the so-called coding regions of the genome, which contain the instructions for cells to make proteins. Lincoln Stein, of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research in Canada, who is also a member of the Pan-Cancer project steering committee, said: \u201cThe vast majority of work so far has been on the protein coding portion of the genome. That\u2019s a mere 1%. It\u2019s like trying to put together a 100,000-piece jigsaw puzzle when you\u2019re missing 99% of the pieces and there\u2019s no puzzle box with a completed picture to guide you.\u201d The latest research provides some of the first detailed insights into the role of the other 99% of our DNA \u2013 the genome\u2019s \u201cdark matter\u201d \u2013 and how these less-studied regions contribute to cancer. The study identifies several important genes that lie outside the coding region. Stein said these newly identified genes would increase the proportion of patients for whom a cancer-causing mutation could be pinpointed from about two-thirds to 95%. \u201cPrior to that, we would be in the dark about roughly one-third of patients that came into the clinic,\u201d Stein added.",

      "bodyText": "Quique Seti\u00e9n scoffed and then started laughing. \u201cNo way,\u201d he said. He had been talking for 12 minutes and he was only halfway through, still trying to put out the fire, when he was asked if he regretted becoming the Barcelona manager. \u201cIt\u2019s true that a month ago I was at home and I had no problems, but [these are] blessed problems. I have the same enthusiasm as ever, the same will, because my life hasn\u2019t been easy. You know things will happen here, you know the repercussions will be huge, but I\u2019m blown by the north wind; I don\u2019t go down easily.\u201d Nobody said it was easy, but nobody said it would be this hard. As for the problems, there are a lot. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal to take over at a team that\u2019s top,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said when he arrived on 13 January but nor is it normal for so many things to happen so fast. And the scale of the latest problem \u2013 his captain and best player publicly calling out the sporting director \u2013 is yet to be fully gauged. The club\u2019s president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, spoke to Eric Abidal and Lionel Messi on Wednesday, desperate to restore calm. After a long meeting, the decision was made to stick with Abidal. The day before Seti\u00e9n turned up, it was confirmed Luis Su\u00e1rez needed an operation and would be out for three or four months. They sold two strikers, Carles P\u00e9rez and Abel Ruiz, to raise funds and make space for another but, having briefed that it was all tied up, they failed to sign one. Carles Ale\u00f1\u00e1 had gone too, and Jean-Clair Todibo, and Moussa Wagu\u00e9, but still they had not raised enough. No matter, Seti\u00e9n said, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 would be the \u201csigning\u201d: he was on his way back to full fitness and would be \u201cflying\u201d. Then the news broke that Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 had torn a tendon in his thigh and would miss the rest of the season. The squad are weaker, not stronger, than when Seti\u00e9n arrived; this is not what he was sold. On Wednesday morning only 16 first\u2011team players were named to travel to face Athletic in Bilbao \u2013 and that is everyone they have got. Samuel Umtiti would have to make his own way there: he was wanted in court in the morning, accused of doing almost \u00a3170,000 worth of damage to a flat he was renting. At the weekend, Ivan Rakitic admitted he was unhappy at how Barcelona had tried to force him out. Arturo Vidal\u2019s agents had already begun legal proceedings over a disputed bonus. And then, as if all that was not enough, on Tuesday night Abidal gave an interview to Sport. In it, he said he was optimistic Messi would sign a new deal and that Bar\u00e7a\u2019s star player was happy at Camp Nou. But what he said in response to that question was eclipsed by what he said in response to others, which in turn changed the veracity of that statement. Abidal had suggested some of Barcelona\u2019s players had been \u201cunsatisfied\u201d with the former manager Ernesto Valverde \u2013 responsible for this sacking, in other words. He also said they did not \u201cwork much\u201d. For Messi, long assumed to wield power, the heaviest of dressing\u2011room heavyweights and invariably burdened with responsibility, the accusation was intolerable. It took less than 90 minutes from the first brief advance of the interview going live for Messi to react: it was public and unequivocal, the division and resentment exposed. On Messi\u2019s Instagram account a red circle was drawn around the quote: \u201cLots of players were not satisfied and nor did they work much.\u201d Below it, Messi demanded Abidal take responsibility for his actions, accusing him of \u201cdirtying\u201d the players and challenging the sporting director to name names. Messi takes more responsibility than he should; he was not going to take this one, too. Many thought he was right and even those who thought Abidal might be did not consider it a good idea to say so. The damage was done and it awoke the greatest fear: Messi leaving. Messi has a clause in his contract that allows him to leave at the end of the season \u2013 and for free. As Abidal admitted, all he has to do is communicate that in May. The 32-year-old has said repeatedly he wants to finish his career at Barcelona but has also said he wants to compete and over the past five years he has felt increasingly like Bar\u00e7a do not. Nor does he have long left: at December\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or presentation for the first time he raised the question of retirement. There is a growing feeling his final years are being wasted and Messi is not immune to that feeling. Messi has not won the European Cup for five years. He has watched Barcelona fail to build around him \u2013 whether he is part of that problem is a broader, more complex question \u2013 and seen a generation slip into retirement and not be replaced. He has seen a lack of direction and certainty, four directors of sport and endless advisers under this regime. He has seen the president become vice-president as well and the team become weaker, despite spending \u20ac1,000m since the departure of Neymar. And now this. No wonder he snapped.

      "body": "<p>The controversial Leave.EU co-founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/arron-banks\">Arron Banks</a>, who was barred from joining the Conservative party, gave a cash donation to a Tory MP\u2019s general election campaign, it has been revealed. Brexiter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/andrea-jenkyns-gets-salary-for-thinktank-that-does-not-yet-exist\">Andrea Jenkyns</a> has defended receiving money from the businessman in November, weeks before she held her seat of Morley and Outwood in West Yorkshire.</p> <p>It is the first time that the insurance entrepreneur has made a political donation since Leave.EU was found to have broken electoral law in 2018. That year, Banks was prevented from joining the Tories after urging hardline Brexiters to flood the party to depose the then prime minister, Theresa May.</p> <p>Banks has consistently denied claims that he received money from Russia, but the source of his wealth has been under scrutiny since he gave \u00a39m to Leave.EU, the largest political donation in British history.</p> <p>Speaking from New Zealand, Banks told the Guardian that the donation of \u00a32,000 to Jenkyns\u2019 office was a reflection of a thawing of relationships between Leave.EU and the Conservative party since Boris Johnson took over the party.</p> <p>\u201cWe are much friendlier with the Conservative party,\u201d he said. \u201cWe supported them during the campaign and so we have a fairly cordial relationship. Boris is doing a great job. I have just been watching President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, so I think I can say that Boris is making Britain great again.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkyns received his donation, he said, because of her close links with Leave.EU. She has also featured on Westmonster, the website he helped to bankroll.</p> <p>\u201cAndrea has been a big supporter of Leave.EU and I supposed I thought it would be good to offer my personal support,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Banks said he was not aware of any checks by the Conservative party about whether he was allowed to give money, given that he was barred from joining the party in 2018.</p> <p>Jenkyns, whose majority increased from 2,104 to 11,267, defended receiving the money. \u201cThis was a personal donation to my re-election campaign.

      "bodyText": "The controversial Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks, who was barred from joining the Conservative party, gave a cash donation to a Tory MP\u2019s general election campaign, it has been revealed. Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns has defended receiving money from the businessman in November, weeks before she held her seat of Morley and Outwood in West Yorkshire. It is the first time that the insurance entrepreneur has made a political donation since Leave.EU was found to have broken electoral law in 2018. That year, Banks was prevented from joining the Tories after urging hardline Brexiters to flood the party to depose the then prime minister, Theresa May. Banks has consistently denied claims that he received money from Russia, but the source of his wealth has been under scrutiny since he gave \u00a39m to Leave.EU, the largest political donation in British history. Speaking from New Zealand, Banks told the Guardian that the donation of \u00a32,000 to Jenkyns\u2019 office was a reflection of a thawing of relationships between Leave.EU and the Conservative party since Boris Johnson took over the party. \u201cWe are much friendlier with the Conservative party,\u201d he said. \u201cWe supported them during the campaign and so we have a fairly cordial relationship. Boris is doing a great job. I have just been watching President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, so I think I can say that Boris is making Britain great again.\u201d Jenkyns received his donation, he said, because of her close links with Leave.EU. She has also featured on Westmonster, the website he helped to bankroll. \u201cAndrea has been a big supporter of Leave.EU and I supposed I thought it would be good to offer my personal support,\u201d he said. Banks said he was not aware of any checks by the Conservative party about whether he was allowed to give money, given that he was barred from joining the party in 2018. Jenkyns, whose majority increased from 2,104 to 11,267, defended receiving the money. \u201cThis was a personal donation to my re-election campaign. All donations to my campaign have been properly and transparently declared in the usual way,\u201d she said. Banks emerged on to the political scene in 2014 when, having been a Tory donor, he publicly defected to Ukip, led by Nigel Farage. Since then, he has handed millions to political parties and organisations campaigning to leave the EU. Questions were raised about the whether Leave.EU broke electoral spending rules. The Electoral Commission concluded in May 2018 that Leave.EU had committed multiple breaches of electoral spending law during the EU referendum and fined it \u00a370,000, saying the \u201cunlawful overspend\u201d was at least \u00a377,380 but may well have been higher. The commission also found that Leave.EU inaccurately reported three loans it had received from companies controlled by Banks. However, the commission found no evidence that Leave.EU received donations or paid-for services from Cambridge Analytica for its referendum campaigning and found that the relationship with the political campaign agency \u201cdid not develop beyond initial scoping work\u201d. Banks responded by accusing the commission of a \u201cpolitically motivated attack on Brexit\u201d and threatened to take legal action. The Metropolitan police announced in September that it would be taking no further action against Leave.EU for spending offences in the Brexit referendum, despite accepting that it had broken the law. Farage claimed in April that Banks would not be handing over political donations in future because he had been \u201cbadly burned\u201d by repeated questions over the \u00a39m he contributed to the Brexit campaign. On Wednesday, Banks said he would consider making further donations and claimed that he was still pursuing legal action against the commission that would challenge its previous ruling.. \u201cWe have issued against the Electoral Commission and are talking about whether to settle or not. The police exonerated us. We are keen to see why they [the commission] did what they did.\u201d Banks confirmed that he was still pursuing legal action against the investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr, despite dropping two elements of his libel claim in January. Cadwalladr has won a series of prestigious journalism prizes for her work, published in the Guardian and Observer, exposing the Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting scandal and spending by pro-Brexit campaigners in the EU referendum. Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP who has previously called for an inquiry into Banks\u2019s links to Russia, said: \u201cIt is no surprise that the man who broke electoral law but against whom the government took no action has since decided to help prop the Tories up.\u201d The National Crime Agency previously said it found no evidence Leave.EU and Banks broke the law. The Conservative party has been approached for a comment.",

      "bodyText": "Less than a week after the departure of the UK, Brussels is seeking to breathe new life into the enlargement of the EU, unveiling an overhaul of the process for joining the bloc. The long-awaited document from the European commission was published less than a week after the first ever departure of a big country. One main purpose is to keep alive the EU ambition for six western Balkan nations, with a combined population of 17.9 million people. No country has joined the EU since Croatia in 2013, but Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia hope to eventually. The paper is also intended to assuage doubts about further EU expansion among member states wearied by the eurozone crisis as well as backsliding on the rule of law and persistent corruption in some EU countries. It draws heavily on a plan put forward by Emmanuel Macron, who last year vetoed North Macedonia\u2019s hopes of starting membership talks, causing despair among politicians in the region. The French president also joined Denmark and the Netherlands in blocking Albania. Potential EU member states have to complete 35 chapters to match EU standards in numerous areas, from a functioning public administration to fisheries to financial regulation. The new proposals mean that all countries will be required to complete fundamental reforms on democratic institutions and the rule of law before attempting more technical reforms. France complained that the EU enlargement process lacked credibility and said applicants should be required to repeat negotiating \u201cchapters\u201d if they later unpicked key reforms, an idea the commission has adopted. EU enlargement had to be \u201cmore credible\u201d for EU member states and those seeking to join, the EU enlargement commissioner, Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, told journalists. \u201cIt has to be more predictable, more dynamic and more political,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cvery many member states\u201d had raised concerns in private, beyond countries that had voiced opposition in public. If countries seeking to join the EU could meet the criteria \u201cthen it can actually go quicker and in a much more meaningful way\u201d. The new criteria will not apply to Serbia and Montenegro, which have embarked on EU accession under old rules. V\u00e1rhelyi said it was \u201ctheir choice\u201d to opt into the new system, adding that he could see grounds to do so. The former Romanian prime minister Dacian Ciolo\u0219, who sits with Macron\u2019s MEPs in the European parliament, described the plans as a good step forward, adding that his group \u201cfully supports\u201d new impetus to EU enlargement. \u201cThe next step, after agreeing on the new methodology, should be the opening of accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania,\u201d he said.",

It is a story of inhuman capitalist greed on a huge scale, described here as being on a par with the lies told about tobacco in a previous century. The final twist is that when the scandal goes national, the humble Louisiana pharmacist keeps up with it, scaling up the same fussy, stubborn common sense to help stem the tide.</p> <p>The Pharmacist raises an impeccably important global issue, but its power as television all comes from one individual. Schneider, always dogged by sadness (the programme never forgets young Danny\u2019s loss) but resolute in his faith and his desire to right wrongs, also has the self-awareness necessary to be a truly great documentary protagonist: \u201cI was driven,\u201d he says in one of many wry examinations of his own motives. \u201cOther people would say \u2018obsessed\u2019.\u201d</p>",

That was \u2026 the beginning!\u201d In the last two episodes, we arrive at the real point of The Pharmacist, as it pulls back to look at the history of a national opioid crisis that has claimed hundreds of thousands of American lives since Schneider correctly outlined its mechanics at a local level. It is a story of inhuman capitalist greed on a huge scale, described here as being on a par with the lies told about tobacco in a previous century. The final twist is that when the scandal goes national, the humble Louisiana pharmacist keeps up with it, scaling up the same fussy, stubborn common sense to help stem the tide. The Pharmacist raises an impeccably important global issue, but its power as television all comes from one individual. Schneider, always dogged by sadness (the programme never forgets young Danny\u2019s loss) but resolute in his faith and his desire to right wrongs, also has the self-awareness necessary to be a truly great documentary protagonist: \u201cI was driven,\u201d he says in one of many wry examinations of his own motives. \u201cOther people would say \u2018obsessed\u2019.\u201d",

He is also an accomplished performer who, like most good performers, can tell when he is losing his audience. By the end of this session he looked like someone finding it increasingly hard to pretend that what he was doing was anything other than utterly pointless.</p> \n  <p>And he was right; it was.</p> \n  <p>It is never wise to make predictions, but I would be very surprised if this charade is still running after Easter. Johnson would not be the first prime minister to try, and abandon, a new means of communication with the public. Tony Blair tried a weekly podcast, I seem to remember, but gave up very quickly when he realised that no one was listening.</p> \n  <p>The only half interesting bit was when Johnson started talking about the portraits on the wall and Queen Elizabeth. It was a reminder that, as a TV documentary presenter, Johnson was very watchable. Perhaps he\u2019s missing his old career.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e3af8898f0811db2faf2084\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-05T17:19:29.683Z\">5.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Even Johnson seems to be getting bored now.

Isn\u2019t it amazing to have contemporaneous pictures of Queen Elizabeth and Shakespeare, he says. He says Shakespeare performed in front of Queen Elizabeth. Elizabeth asked for another Falstaff play, and he wrote the Merry Wives of Windsor.</p> \n  <p>(Johnson started writing a Shakespeare biography, but had to give it up when he became PM.)</p> \n  <p>And that\u2019s it.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e3af80d8f0811db2faf207c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-05T17:16:43.426Z\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: What will you do to cut taxes and help hard-working families?</em></p> \n  <p>Johnson says this questioner is the sort of person he really wants to help.

He says he will soon legislate to end the automatic release of terrorist offences.</p> \n  <p>And the automatic early release of prisoners in jail for serious crimes will also end, he says.</p> \n  <p>He says the attack in Streatham was terrible.</p> \n  <p>He says people\u2019s patience with this has come to an end.</p> \n  <p>He says people will also ask what will happen to these people in jail. It is an important consideration, he says. He says the government must find ways of rehabilitating people.</p> \n  <p>Terrorist offenders are a special case, he says.

Eastwood told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Last week we lost a political giant in Seamus Mallon. He was an outstanding parliamentarian, and a seeker of justice for everyone. One injustice that burned in him until his dying day was the murder of Paul Quinn, who was beaten to death by an IRA gang in 2007. They broke every single bone in his body, to the extent that his mother could not place rosary beads in his hands when he was in his coffin. </p> \n   <p>In the aftermath, the now finance minister Conor Murphy said that Paul was linked to criminality.

She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I only recently began to understand why people felt so strongly about being able to pass things on to the next generation. My mother who was a great socialist and frankly had very little indeed, wrote on a scrap of pink paper, otherwise known as her will, complete with drawings, how proud she was to be able to pass on some savings to her kids. I was so angry with her because she\u2019d been saving up money from her pension to give me money and I didn\u2019t really need it.</p> \n   <p>It made me think about this quite a lot, as opposed to my somewhat knee jerk anti-inheritance reaction in the past. But the truth is that if we have a society which is about equality we shouldn\u2019t have people who have a greater chance because their parents have more money.</p> \n   <p>But it is a question of getting the balance right. Because another truth is that if we do believe in equality fairness and justice, we cannot have families hoarding an amount of wealth and increasingly so. So our tax system shouldn\u2019t just be a tax system were people are taxed fairly, with those with the broadest shoulders paying the most, we also do need to look at wealth when it is passed on from one generation to another to the extent that it currently is.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And, in response to a question from someone worried about \u201cgender identity extremism\u201d and trans rights supposedly undermining women\u2019s rights, Thornberry admitted that her own thinking on this issue had changed. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the 1970s and 80s I was involved in the feminist movement and at that time we were trying to establish that women could make their own choices that they weren\u2019t in someway \u2018lesser men\u2019, that we could do <a href=\"https://jobs.mumsnet.com/\">jobs</a> that until then only men had done, that we didn\u2019t have to wear make up, that we didn\u2019t have to get married. We could establish our own identity. I was really proud of being a woman and being part of that movement.</p> \n   <p>Over the decades things have changed and I have thought about this issue a great deal and have been challenged particularly by the younger generation who have a very different attitude to identity than I did when I was their age. When I was at college there was someone who worked in the catering department. She was known as David the Dinner Lady and we all laughed at her and she was incredibly vulnerable but amazingly brave and I look back at that and I\u2019m ashamed. </p> \n   <p>I hope our world has moved on and I think the younger generation have a different attitude. I don\u2019t think you need to be worried about your daughter, I think your daughter will grow up in a world that is more tolerant and understanding and perhaps has learnt from feminism that we can all be different and it\u2019s OK.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f38af534ee77f2d0cf92ef18cf43a3cf5fcadc70\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f38af534ee77f2d0cf92ef18cf43a3cf5fcadc70/0_359_8132_4879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Thornberry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Thornberry.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e3ade128f0811db2faf1f1c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-05T15:24:15.580Z\">3.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From the Times\u2019 <strong>Steven Swinford</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1225074093063536640\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There\u2019s a race to get emergency legislation ending automatic early release of convicted terrorists in place by February 27<br><br>Another convicted terrorist considered to pose a threat to the public is due for release the following day<br><br>Five others are due for release in March</p>\u2014 Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1225074093063536640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 5, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e3ad6a18f086a28115a6198\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-05T15:10:57.457Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/business/revealed-sajid-javid-scored-victory-over-rival-dominic-cummings-when-it-came-to-appointing-new-bank-a4354451.html\">a story</a> in today\u2019s Evening Standard <strong>Jim Armitage </strong>says that Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, lost an internal Downing Street battle with Sajid Javid, the chancellor, over who should be the next head of the Bank of England. Armitage says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s powerful adviser <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> pushed hard for <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/bank-of-england\">Bank of England</a> chief economist Andy Haldane to take over from Mark Carney as governor but was overruled by the prime minister after intervention from Chancellor <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/sajid-javid\">Sajid Javid</a>, the Evening Standard has learned.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/andrew-bailey-new-bank-of-england-governor-a4318496.html\">Johnson appointed Financial Conduct Authority chief Andrew Bailey</a><a> </a> instead in a victory for the chancellor amid boiling point tensions with the aide.</p> \n   <p>Cummings had demanded Haldane for the job due to his more radical tendencies. Haldane has been sounding increasingly on board with the aide\u2019s key messages on \u201clevelling up\u201d the regions. He has been far more outspoken than Bailey, chiming with Cummings\u2019 preference for independent thinkers. However, despite the lobbying, Johnson refused.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Standard is edited, of course, by George Osborne, the former chancellor, who is a close ally of Javid\u2019s.</p> \n  <p>The Bank of England story follows another <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/has-dominic-cummings-overplayed-his-hand-bjnvww52m\">in today\u2019s Times (paywall) </a>by <strong>Oliver Wright </strong>also suggesting that Cummings might not be quite as powerful in Whitehall as some suggest.

Whitehall, pointing out \u2013 respectfully \u2013 that even the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff could not recruit civil servants.</p> \n   <p>He even failed in his more modest proposal to rearrange the Downing Street office space when Mr Johnson decided that he didn\u2019t want to leave his study to become part of a Nasa-style mission control centre.</p> \n   <p>It has led those, who

It does not have a chair, the costs seem to be overrunning, and even the venue has yet to be fully finalised. Public concern about the climate crisis is rising. And yet, from PMQs, it does not feel as if Johnson considers himself at all vulnerable on this front at this moment. Jeremy Corbyn devoted all his questions to the issue and he made some good points (the most effective, probably, about Johnson\u2019s record as a climate change denier \u2013 see <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/05/pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-bbc-could-end-up-as-defunct-as-blockbuster-unless-it-adapts-to-digital-era-says-culture-secretary-nicky-morgan-live-news?page=with:block-5e3ab05f8f0811db2faf1cc9#block-5e3ab05f8f0811db2faf1cc9\">12.12pm</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/05/pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-bbc-could-end-up-as-defunct-as-blockbuster-unless-it-adapts-to-digital-era-says-culture-secretary-nicky-morgan-live-news?page=with:block-5e3ab3608f086a28115a5fa7#block-5e3ab3608f086a28115a5fa7\">12.22pm)</a>. But he was so scattergun that none of them really stuck, and he did not make much headway against a PM who seemed better briefed than usual (a very low bar). As usual, Johnson\u2019s facts may not stand up to sustained forensic analysis (Full Fact has some useful snap analysis \u2013 see below), but at least he was able to show that the government does have a story to tell on climate change.</p> \n  <p>At this stage in the electoral cycle, Tory MPs pose more of a threat to Johnson than opposition ones, and the most important interventions were probably those from Damian Green and David Davis. They are two former cabinet minsters, from opposite wings of the party, who were both asking for assurances that, notwithstanding the announcement made last week about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/28/labour-says-government-claim-to-be-reversing-beeching-rail-cuts-meaningless-live-news\">allowing Huawei a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G </a>network, the government remains committed over the long term to drive it out (or to reduce its market share to zero, as Green put it). Johnson did stress his desire to nurture alternative providers, but twice he refused to commit to forcing Huawei out of the network for good. At some point, probably quite soon, this issue will come to a vote in the Commons, and today Johnson was put on notice that heavyweight Tories are threatening to mobilise against him.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FullFact/status/1225030196354519042\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">During <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMQs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PMQs</a> Jeremy Corbyn repeated his claim the govt won\u2019t meet its target of net zero carbon emissions until 2099.<br><br>We\u2019re already looking into this claim and will publish something on it soon.

The full text of the culture secretary is not available yet (it should be <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport\">on the DCMS website</a> soon), but the spiky stuff came in the Q&amp;A.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Morgan, the culture secretary, rejected claims that the government was giving a \u201cpunishment beating\u201d to the BBC.</strong> In her speech Morgan announced two policies with profound consequences for the BBC: decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee from April 2022, which could cost it \u00a3200m; and possibly replacing the licence free altogether after 2027. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/05/pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-bbc-could-end-up-as-defunct-as-blockbuster-unless-it-adapts-to-digital-era-says-culture-secretary-nicky-morgan-live-news?page=with:block-5e3a96cb8f086a28115a5e56#block-5e3a96cb8f086a28115a5e56\">10.21am.)</a> When the BBC\u2019s <strong>Norman Smith </strong>put it to her that this would be seen as a \u201cpunishment beating\u201d for the BBC because the government disliked its Brexit and election coverage, she rejected the claim. Smith said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You say the BBC needs to adapt to the new streaming era. Everyone in the BBC knows that. What I\u2019m not clear about is why you think decriminalising, or moving to a civil enforcement scheme, in any way assists the BBC in meeting that challenge, because the view within the corporation is it weakens the BBC to the tune of \u00a3200m a year, quite possibly more. In other words, it puts us in a worse place to meet the challenge. And doesn\u2019t that just underscore the suspicion that really what is going on here is a bit of a punishment beating for the BBC from a government who resent the attitude of the BBC as they see it during the Brexit referendum and the general election? It\u2019s a bit of political payback.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And Morgan replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I utterly refute that last suggestion ... If you have to criminalise the non-payment of a licence fee in order for the BBC to have the funding to remain relevant, then that would suggest to me there\u2019s something wrong with the model.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She rejected claims that opening a debate about the future of the BBC licence fee when its current charter period has another seven years to run was unprecedented.</strong> This point was put to her by <strong>Lord Birt</strong>, the former BBC director general, who used a lengthy question to suggest the government was threatening the BBC\u2019s independence.

The corporation has always been slightly nervous of its prospects under Conservative governments, and relations with Boris Johnson\u2019s government are particularly fraught, partly because Downing Street is boycotting the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs programme, Today on Radio 4, for reasons that have never been fully explained in public. Now a cabinet minister is raising the prospect of the BBC facing extinction.</p> \n  <p>Morgan, who quit the Commons at the last election and now sits in the House of Lords, is making a speech today that will confirm an overnight announcement about how the government is launching a consultation on whether to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee. This sounds like one of those consultations where there is little doubt about what the outcome will be. The BBC claims the move could cost it \u00a3200m. My colleague <strong>Jim Waterson</strong>\u2019s overnight story about the plan is here.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/05/bbc-facing-funding-cut-as-licence-fee-consultation-launched\">BBC licence fee: proposals to decriminalise non-payment</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has stressed that this is not a consultation about the future of the licence fee funding model in principle. But it does say that, if non-payment is decriminalised, any change in the law would not come into effect until April 2022 and the government would consider the impact of this when starting negotiations on the overall licence fee settlement later this year.</p> \n  <p>And, in <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7967413/NICKY-MORGAN-explains-plan-decriminalise-nonpayment-TV-levy.html\">an article for the Daily Mail</a>, Morgan makes it clear that ministers do want to open up a conversation about how the BBC should be funded in the long term. She writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Twenty years ago Blockbuster, the then heavyweight of video rentals, turned down a \u00a338m merger offer from <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/netflix/index.html\">Netflix</a>.</p> \n   <p>Today Netflix is worth \u00a350bn, 1,300 times its offer to Blockbuster \u2013 which has gone from 3,000 stores to a museum in Oregon, for people who want to remember what video cassettes look like ...</p> \n   <p>We need to think carefully about how the BBC \u2013 and indeed public service broadcasting more generally \u2013 can stay relevant in the years ahead.</p> \n   <p>As we move into an increasingly digital age, where there are more and more channels to watch and platforms to choose from, it is clear that many people consider it an anachronism that you can be imprisoned effectively for not paying for your TV licence ...</p> \n   <p>We make no apology for being bold and ambitious. As the world around us changes, our laws must change too. It will require the BBC to be innovative and to move with the times. </p> \n   <p>We don\u2019t want a beacon of British values and world-class entertainment ending up like Blockbuster.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Morgan has said she will stand down from the cabinet at the reshuffle, which is expected to happen next week (although <a href=\"https://order-order.com/2020/02/04/reshuffle-rumours-round/\">one theory</a> is that it could come tomorrow). She won\u2019t be around to take the final decisions, although what she says today almost certainly reflects the wider view in government.

      "bodyText": "The television licence could be abolished from 2027, with ministers saying they are \u201copen minded\u201d about how to fund the BBC from that point onwards, suggesting further cuts could be on the cards for the national broadcaster. The culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, made the announcement at an event where she also denied claims that the government was submitting the BBC to a \u201cpunishment beating\u201d because of its coverage of Brexit and the general election. (See 11.36am.) Boris Johnson has failed to give Tory MPs at PMQs they assurance they want that Huawei\u2019s involvement in the UK\u2019s 5G network will only be temporary. (See 1.33pm.) Jeremy Corbyn has accused Boris Johnson of \u201cfailing spectacularly\u201d to measure up to the scale of the climate crisis, after the sacked president of COP 26 revealed the UK was miles behind in getting ready for the November summit. David Cameron has turned down an offer from Boris Johnson to head the UK\u2019s preparations for a crucial international climate summit in Glasgow, saying he already has \u201ca lot of things\u201d to do this year. Giving John Bercow a peerage would be a scandal that parliament would struggle to live down, according to the man accusing the former Speaker of bullying and explosive behaviour. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has bowed to pressure from rank-and-file police officers and is seeking to rip up changes to bail rules spearheaded by Theresa May. My colleague Jamie Grierson reports, Patel has proposed doubling or trebling the length of pre-charge bail, which since 2017 has been limited to 28 days under changes drawn up by May when she was home secretary and implemented when she was prime minister. The proposals put out to consultation by Patel would delay the point at which magistrates\u2019 approval for the extension of bail is required from three months to six, nine or 12 months. Richard Burgon has accused Labour MPs who supported military intervention in Syria of \u201cstrutting about like frustrated Churchills\u201d, as he called for Labour members to be given a vote before the party backs future military action. A notorious murder allegedly committed by the IRA has returned to haunt Sinn F\u00e9in just as it appears poised for a historic breakthrough in Ireland\u2019s general election on Saturday. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the Boris Johnson has many faults, but he is not stupid. He is also an accomplished performer who, like most good performers, can tell when he is losing his audience. By the end of this session he looked like someone finding it increasingly hard to pretend that what he was doing was anything other than utterly pointless. And he was right; it was. It is never wise to make predictions, but I would be very surprised if this charade is still running after Easter. Johnson would not be the first prime minister to try, and abandon, a new means of communication with the public. Tony Blair tried a weekly podcast, I seem to remember, but gave up very quickly when he realised that no one was listening. The only half interesting bit was when Johnson started talking about the portraits on the wall and Queen Elizabeth. It was a reminder that, as a TV documentary presenter, Johnson was very watchable. Perhaps he\u2019s missing his old career. Even Johnson seems to be getting bored now. He thinks it is time to wrap up, but finds one final question. Q: Will you turn this into a podcast? Johnson says he does not know about that, but that he will look into it. He says there will be another PMQs. Isn\u2019t it amazing to have contemporaneous pictures of Queen Elizabeth and Shakespeare, he says. He says Shakespeare performed in front of Queen Elizabeth. Elizabeth asked for another Falstaff play, and he wrote the Merry Wives of Windsor. (Johnson started writing a Shakespeare biography, but had to give it up when he became PM.) And that\u2019s it. Q: What will you do to cut taxes and help hard-working families? Johnson says this questioner is the sort of person he really wants to help. He will reduce national insurance contributions. He says that will give everyone a \u00a3500 tax cut once the threshold has been lifted to \u00a312,000. (Johnson does not mention that lifting the threshold to that level is only a long-term Tory aspiration, and not something he committed in the manifesto to doing in this parliament.) Q: What do you and your government intend to do about the justice system? The judiciary are out of touch. We expect prisoners to serve their full sentences. Absolutely right, says Johnson. He says he will soon legislate to end the automatic release of terrorist offences. And the automatic early release of prisoners in jail for serious crimes will also end, he says. He says the attack in Streatham was terrible. He says people\u2019s patience with this has come to an end. He says people will also ask what will happen to these people in jail. It is an important consideration, he says. He says the government must find ways of rehabilitating people. Terrorist offenders are a special case, he says. He says there are 224 about to come out in the immediate future. But it is hard to tell if they have been de-radicalised. Q: Can you do more to protect urban trees? Johnson says he loves trees, and that he is a fanatic about trees. But often people object to trees being planted because they worry about subsidence. He says he thinks the government can plan 50,000 more urban trees. He says nothing could be lovelier than cycling beneath the dappled light of apple trees. Q: When will you address the pressure on the NHS? It cannot take any more. Johnson agrees with the \u2018not taking any more\u2019 point. He says he had a \u201cmassive meeting\u201d on this yesterday with Matt Hancock, the health secretary. He says he thinks he can get 50,000 more nurses. More money is going into the NHS, he says. The graph is rising. But he wants to see huge improvements. Johnson says his points-based immigration system will come into effect next year. He does not want to slam up the drawbridge, he says. Q: I\u2019m concerned about education. There does not seem to be the investment needed. What are your future intentions? Johnson says he is putting record sums into education. (This may be true in cash terms, but is probably questionable in relative terms. Because of inflation, most governments put record amounts into public services in cash terms.) Boris Johnson is holding another of his \u2018People\u2019s PMQs\u2019 on Facebook. He says he is in the Pillared Room in No 10, which has a picture of Queen Elizabeth I on the wall. Johnson presents her as a forerunner of \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. During PMQs the SDLP MP Colum Eastwood asked about a particularly brutal IRA killing 13 years ago. At the time Conor Murphy, the Sinn Fein politician who is now finance minister in Northern Ireland executive, infuriated the family of the victim, Paul Quinn, by claiming that he was \u201cinvolved in smuggling and criminality\u201d. Eastwood told MPs: Last week we lost a political giant in Seamus Mallon. He was an outstanding parliamentarian, and a seeker of justice for everyone. One injustice that burned in him until his dying day was the murder of Paul Quinn, who was beaten to death by an IRA gang in 2007. They broke every single bone in his body, to the extent that his mother could not place rosary beads in his hands when he was in his coffin. In the aftermath, the now finance minister Conor Murphy said that Paul was linked to criminality. That was a lie. Does the prime minister agree that Conor Murphy should retract that lie, publicly apologise, and give any information that he has about Paul\u2019s murder to the Police Service of Northern Ireland? Boris Johnson did not mention Murphy in his reply. But Murphy has subsequently issued this statement. He said: I have consistently and unreservedly condemned the murder of Paul Quinn. Those who murdered him are criminals and need to be brought to justice. I repeat my call on anyone with any information on his murder to bring it to the Garda\u00ed or the PSNI. I very much regret comments I made in the aftermath of Paul\u2019s murder which have added to the grief felt by the Quinn family. I apologise for those remarks and I unreservedly withdraw them. Once again I offer to meet the Quinn family at a time and place of their convenience. This will be worth watching. Here are two more answers from Emily Thornberry\u2019s webchat with Mumsnet. (See 1.24pm.) Thornberry, who is one of four candidates still in the contest (although the only one of the four who has not yet got the enough nominations from members or unions needed to get a place on the final ballot) did not say anything particularly newsy, but she did give some interesting insights into her thinking. In response to a question about inherited wealth, she said an experience with her mother recently had given her new understanding of why it was important for people to be able to leave money to their children. She said: I only recently began to understand why people felt so strongly about being able to pass things on to the next generation. My mother who was a great socialist and frankly had very little indeed, wrote on a scrap of pink paper, otherwise known as her will, complete with drawings, how proud she was to be able to pass on some savings to her kids. I was so angry with her because she\u2019d been saving up money from her pension to give me money and I didn\u2019t really need it. It made me think about this quite a lot, as opposed to my somewhat knee jerk anti-inheritance reaction in the past. But the truth is that if we have a society which is about equality we shouldn\u2019t have people who have a greater chance because their parents have more money. But it is a question of getting the balance right. Because another truth is that if we do believe in equality fairness and justice, we cannot have families hoarding an amount of wealth and increasingly so. So our tax system shouldn\u2019t just be a tax system were people are taxed fairly, with those with the broadest shoulders paying the most, we also do need to look at wealth when it is passed on from one generation to another to the extent that it currently is. And, in response to a question from someone worried about \u201cgender identity extremism\u201d and trans rights supposedly undermining women\u2019s rights, Thornberry admitted that her own thinking on this issue had changed. She said: In the 1970s and 80s I was involved in the feminist movement and at that time we were trying to establish that women could make their own choices that they weren\u2019t in someway \u2018lesser men\u2019, that we could do jobs that until then only men had done, that we didn\u2019t have to wear make up, that we didn\u2019t have to get married. We could establish our own identity. I was really proud of being a woman and being part of that movement. Over the decades things have changed and I have thought about this issue a great deal and have been challenged particularly by the younger generation who have a very different attitude to identity than I did when I was their age. When I was at college there was someone who worked in the catering department. She was known as David the Dinner Lady and we all laughed at her and she was incredibly vulnerable but amazingly brave and I look back at that and I\u2019m ashamed. I hope our world has moved on and I think the younger generation have a different attitude. I don\u2019t think you need to be worried about your daughter, I think your daughter will grow up in a world that is more tolerant and understanding and perhaps has learnt from feminism that we can all be different and it\u2019s OK. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford In a story in today\u2019s Evening Standard Jim Armitage says that Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, lost an internal Downing Street battle with Sajid Javid, the chancellor, over who should be the next head of the Bank of England. Armitage says: Boris Johnson\u2019s powerful adviser Dominic Cummings pushed hard for Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane to take over from Mark Carney as governor but was overruled by the prime minister after intervention from Chancellor Sajid Javid, the Evening Standard has learned. Johnson appointed Financial Conduct Authority chief Andrew Bailey instead in a victory for the chancellor amid boiling point tensions with the aide. Cummings had demanded Haldane for the job due to his more radical tendencies. Haldane has been sounding increasingly on board with the aide\u2019s key messages on \u201clevelling up\u201d the regions. He has been far more outspoken than Bailey, chiming with Cummings\u2019 preference for independent thinkers. However, despite the lobbying, Johnson refused. The Standard is edited, of course, by George Osborne, the former chancellor, who is a close ally of Javid\u2019s. The Bank of England story follows another in today\u2019s Times (paywall) by Oliver Wright also suggesting that Cummings might not be quite as powerful in Whitehall as some suggest. Wright says: [Cummings] vehemently opposed giving the go-ahead to the HS2 rail network that he described as a \u201cdisaster zone\u201d and was a hawk on allowing the Chinese tech giant Huawei access to the UK\u2019s 5G networks. Meanwhile, his radical plan to slim down the cabinet and create a trade and business ministry has also been ditched. The civil service, well used to political zealots, has also seen off his attempts to bring \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d into Whitehall, pointing out \u2013 respectfully \u2013 that even the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff could not recruit civil servants. He even failed in his more modest proposal to rearrange the Downing Street office space when Mr Johnson decided that he didn\u2019t want to leave his study to become part of a Nasa-style mission control centre. It has led those, who at first feared Mr Cummings as an almost Rasputin-like power behind Mr Johnson\u2019s throne, to question just how far his writ runs. Earlier this week Alex Wickham at BuzzFeed also published a detailed account of feuding between Cummings and Javid. Wickham said: \u201cRumours of [Cummings\u2019] eventual demise in Downing Street have already started up again, with some expecting him to eventually grow frustrated and walk out.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn favours Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader and former energy secretary, as a candidate to chair the COP 26 climate change summit, HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh reports. From the Financial Times\u2019s media reporter Mark Di Stefano On the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show this morning Emily Thornberry, a candidate for the Labour leadership, said she would approve of empty homes being seized to tackle the housing crisis. She said: If you leave a flat empty and you\u2019re not using it then you will lose it ... They would need to justify why it\u2019s been empty for the amount of time that it has. But if you\u2019re leaving a flat empty for years \u2013 which if you go down the Thames, there are all of these developments, all of these big blocks of flats and you go down there at night \u2013 none of them have got the lights on. They are all empty. When she was asked whether she approved of taking private property away from people, Thornberry replied: Yes. Because they are not being used and because we have a housing crisis. We\u2019ve got people sleeping on the streets, we\u2019ve got homeless families in bed and breakfasts \u2013 it\u2019s not right. Twice during PMQs Boris Johnson refused to promise Tory MPs that he would find an alternative 5G provider for the UK so that at some point in the future it could give up using Huawei. Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, first raised the issue. He asked the PM: The prime minister is conscious of the very widespread concern in this house about the plans to involve Huawei in 5G networks, concerns that will have only been increased by the news this week that France is building a new 5G network without the involvement of Huawei, following the lead of Australia. If they can do it, we could do it. Can the prime minister confirm that he wants to reduce Huawei\u2019s involvement over time and can he give a timescale as to when that involvement will hit zero? Johnson replied: [Green is] certainly right that we are going to be reducing involvement of Huawei below the 35% market cap, but he\u2019s also right in his general vision, which is one I entirely share. What has happened is, I\u2019m afraid, a failure of like-minded countries to produce an alternative to the 5G network, except that provided by high-risk vendors, and that is why we are now doubling the science budget and we will be working with some of the countries that he mentions in order to produce exactly that diversification in the market. Then David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, made a similar point. He asked: The Australian agencies analysed the involvement of \u2013 any, any involvement of \u2013 Huawei in their 5G system and determined that any involvement would lead to a major risk of a sabotage and espionage. Can [Johnson) give an undertaking that this country will lead the Five Eyes and Nato to create an alternative to Huawei in the next two years? Johnson replied: We, of course, will do nothing to endanger either our critical national security infrastructure or to prejudice co-operation with Five Eyes partners as he has rightly suggested. We will work to ensure that high-risk vendors cannot dominate our market. Emily Thornberry, a candidate for the Labour leadership, has been taking part in a webchat with Mumsnet. In one answer she said Labour people must avoid being \u201ccuddly, hopeless lefties\u201d. Being cuddly and leftie were fine, she said - but not hopeless. I will post more from the webchat when it is over. One of the big events of the year for this government will be the COP 26 climate change summit in Glasgow in November and yesterday, as Boris Johnson formally \u201claunched\u201d it at an event in London, it was clear that it is mired in a mess. It does not have a chair, the costs seem to be overrunning, and even the venue has yet to be fully finalised. Public concern about the climate crisis is rising. And yet, from PMQs, it does not feel as if Johnson considers himself at all vulnerable on this front at this moment. Jeremy Corbyn devoted all his questions to the issue and he made some good points (the most effective, probably, about Johnson\u2019s record as a climate change denier \u2013 see 12.12pm and 12.22pm). But he was so scattergun that none of them really stuck, and he did not make much headway against a PM who seemed better briefed than usual (a very low bar). As usual, Johnson\u2019s facts may not stand up to sustained forensic analysis (Full Fact has some useful snap analysis \u2013 see below), but at least he was able to show that the government does have a story to tell on climate change. At this stage in the electoral cycle, Tory MPs pose more of a threat to Johnson than opposition ones, and the most important interventions were probably those from Damian Green and David Davis. They are two former cabinet minsters, from opposite wings of the party, who were both asking for assurances that, notwithstanding the announcement made last week about allowing Huawei a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network, the government remains committed over the long term to drive it out (or to reduce its market share to zero, as Green put it). Johnson did stress his desire to nurture alternative providers, but twice he refused to commit to forcing Huawei out of the network for good. At some point, probably quite soon, this issue will come to a vote in the Commons, and today Johnson was put on notice that heavyweight Tories are threatening to mobilise against him. The SDLP\u2019s Colum Eastwood asks about the involvement of the IRA in the murder of Paul Quinn in 2007. It was claimed Quinn was a criminal, he says. That was a lie, he says. Johnson says the government will implement the Stormont House agreement so as to provide justice for victims. The SNP\u2019s Owen Thompson asks when the report into Russian interference in UK elections will be published. Johnson says it will be published when the intelligence and security committee is reconstituted. He says conspiracy theorists will be disappointed by its conclusions. Johnson says he is passionate about buses and will \u201cmassively increase\u201d the bus network in the Rother Valley. Labour\u2019s Ruth Jones asks when medicinal cannabis will be available for the families that need it. Will Johnson come and meet some of them who will be in parliament after PMQs. Johnson says it was this government that legalised medicinal cannabis. He says Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will meet the families. Johnson says he thinks most people in the country would agree that early release of terrorist offenders has gone too far. Labour\u2019s Lilian Greenwood asks about a constituent who starved to death when the DWP stopped his benefits. How many more vulnerable claimants will have to die before the government values their cases? Johnson says this is a tragic case. He says the DWP has allocated millions of pounds to improve the way it handles these vulnerable cases. David Davis, a Conservative, says the Australian government concluded that any involvement of Huawei was a threat. Will the UK develop an alternative? Johnson says the government will work to ensure high-risk vendors do not dominate the market. Suella Braverman, a Conservative, says there has been an explosion of judicial review and judicial activism. Will Johnson address this? Johnson says the government will protect judicial review, but ensure it is not used to generate needless delay. Edward Timpson, a Conservative, asks if the government will extend the scheme to give a national insurance holiday to people who take on ex-veterans to cover other groups who find it hard to find employment, like disabled people. Johnson says he does support this idea. The Tories favour cutting taxes, he says. From Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov Labour\u2019s Catherine West asks about the state of school buildings. Johnson says that is why the government is investing \u00a314bn in education. Johnson says he supports the idea of a metrolink between Manchester and Bolton. Johnson says the government is investing immediately on improving bus services. The chancellor has \u201cmany more\u201d such investments in the pipeline. Damian Green, a Conservative, asks about Huawei. He says France is building a 5G network without Huawei. \u201cIf they can do it, we can do it.\u201d When will the UK reduce the involvement of Huawei to zero? Johnson says he does want to reduce Huawei\u2019s share. He says he agrees with Green that there has been a market failure, and he says the UK will be working with countries (like France, he implies) on a competitor. Michael Tomlinson, a Conservative, asks if the government is still committed to the troubled families programme. Johnson says he is, and that the programme is getting more funding. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, asks if Johnson is trying to impersonate Donald Trump. Johnson says his speech on Monday was internationalist. There is only one party here with nationalist in its name, he says; the SNP. Blackford says Johnson does not even know the name of his party. (It is the Scottish National party, not Scottish Nationalist party.) He says the PM is a threat to the NHS. He asks if Johnson will support the SNP\u2019s NHS protection bill. Johnson says the SNP policy is to rejoin the EU, have a new currency, put up a border at Berwick, and hand over fish. Darren Henry, a Conservative, asks Johnson is the government will fulfil its manifesto pledges and deliver for the NHS. Johnson says he is proud the money is now flowing through. Corbyn says Johnson cut the number of climate attach\u00e9s in embassies when he was foreign secretary. He says until 2015 Johnson denied climate science. Johnson says Corbyn wants to confiscate people\u2019s care and prevent them having foreign holidays. Corbyn says the PM has a vivid imagination. But it has taken over from his memory. He says Johnson once described climate change as a \u201cprimitive fear without foundation\u201d. When will he face up to the climate emergency and turn Glasgow into the climate change? Johnson says this government is showing world leadership in tackling climate change. He says Corbyn mentioned the media. Labour did an inquest into the election, and concluded it was the media that was to blame. He says he won\u2019t do that; he says he is a journalist, and loves journalism. Corbyn says the government is missing its targets. He says O\u2019Neill said the government was not keeping its promises over the COP 26 summit. What was she talking about? Johnson says he does not know what Corbyn is talking about. He says CO2 levels have been cut in this country by 42%, while the economy has grown by 73%. That was down to dynamic free market Conservatism. That is his approach; what is Corbyn\u2019s? Corbyn quotes O\u2019Neill on how voters cannot trust Johnson. Johnson says Corbyn\u2019s failure to understand what is happening in this country is mind-boggling. He says the north-east leads the world in wind turbine technology. He says reliance on coal has been cut from 70% to 3%, and will fall to zero. Jeremy Corbyn also starts with a tribute to the police. On Brexit, he says Britain\u2019s place at a world is at a crossroads. He says he hopes we come together to shape our future and to build a diverse, outward-looking future. On COP 26, he says Claire O\u2019Neill, the former president of COP 26, said there had been a huge lack of leadership from the government. What did she mean? Johnson says last year renewable sources produced more energy than carbon sources. Corbyn is just producing hot air, he says. Corbyn says two former Tory leaders have turned down O\u2019Neill\u2019s job. Why is the PM failing to measure up spectacularly to the challenge of climate change. Johnson says this is beyond satire. The government is leading the world on this, he says. He says there will be a wonderful summit in Glasgow. Jamie Wallis, a Conservative, congratulates the PM on delivering Brexit. Will he ensure jobs are brought to areas like Bridgend that are left behind. Johnson says he will unite and level up the country. Boris Johnson starts by paying tribute to the police for their handling of the Streatham attack. The government will shortly introduce emergency legislation, he says. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Diane Abbott has been branded \u201cridiculous\u201d by a union boss after she suggested it was unlikely a former general could have been bullied by John Bercow. (See 9.55am.) Abbott, the shadow home secretary, made her point in a tweet, which she subsequently deleted. But Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said Abbott had shown a \u201ccomplete failure to understand\u201d the abuse of power in the workplace. He said: Indeed Diane - faced with an abusive boss, we often advise members to deploy military self-defence tactics. What a ridiculous comment from an experienced MP, demonstrating blind political partisanship and a complete failure to understand how power is abused in the workplace. The Labour MP Dan Jarvis, a former soldier, also criticised Abbott. He posted this on Twitter. Bercow, of course, has repeatedly denied allegations that he bullied Commons staff. My colleague Polly Toynbee is urging people to contribute to the DCMS consultation on decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee. Here are the main points from Nicky Morgan\u2019s Q&amp;A. The full text of the culture secretary is not available yet (it should be on the DCMS website soon), but the spiky stuff came in the Q&amp;A. Morgan, the culture secretary, rejected claims that the government was giving a \u201cpunishment beating\u201d to the BBC. In her speech Morgan announced two policies with profound consequences for the BBC: decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee from April 2022, which could cost it \u00a3200m; and possibly replacing the licence free altogether after 2027. (See 10.21am.) When the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith put it to her that this would be seen as a \u201cpunishment beating\u201d for the BBC because the government disliked its Brexit and election coverage, she rejected the claim. Smith said: You say the BBC needs to adapt to the new streaming era. Everyone in the BBC knows that. What I\u2019m not clear about is why you think decriminalising, or moving to a civil enforcement scheme, in any way assists the BBC in meeting that challenge, because the view within the corporation is it weakens the BBC to the tune of \u00a3200m a year, quite possibly more. In other words, it puts us in a worse place to meet the challenge. And doesn\u2019t that just underscore the suspicion that really what is going on here is a bit of a punishment beating for the BBC from a government who resent the attitude of the BBC as they see it during the Brexit referendum and the general election? It\u2019s a bit of political payback. And Morgan replied: I utterly refute that last suggestion ... If you have to criminalise the non-payment of a licence fee in order for the BBC to have the funding to remain relevant, then that would suggest to me there\u2019s something wrong with the model. She rejected claims that opening a debate about the future of the BBC licence fee when its current charter period has another seven years to run was unprecedented. This point was put to her by Lord Birt, the former BBC director general, who used a lengthy question to suggest the government was threatening the BBC\u2019s independence. (See 10.37am.) Morgan did not accept that. She urged Downing Street to make peace with Westminster political journalists (aka \u201cthe lobby\u201d). The two sides have been in dispute this year over the arrangements in place for government briefings, and it culminated in political journalists walking out of No 10 on Monday when the prime minister\u2019s director of communications, Lee Cain, tried to exclude certain reporters from a briefing. Asked about this, Morgan said: At the end of the day I don\u2019t think it serves anybody for this as a debate to be continuing. I hope very much that, actually, the best thing would be for the co-chairs of the press lobby here at Westminster to sit down with the director of communications and to work this out because ... actually what\u2019s needed is communicating clearly to the public about the tricky issues that this government is dealing with. According to at least one account, so far No 10 has been resistant to holding this sort of meeting. (See 10.29am.) She refused to defend No 10\u2019s decision not to allow government ministers to appear on the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs programme, Today on Radio 4. Asked about this by the Telegraph\u2019s Anna Mikhailova, Morgan replied: Obviously there are decisions taken elsewhere about which programme [ministers appear on]. But ... there is a massive amount of engagement between government ministers and the BBC and different channels, as well as all other broadcasters. So it is not that we are not being questioned by broadcasters. In answering this question Morgan was less brave than she was two weeks ago, when she implicitly criticised the No 10 tactic when responding to the same question in an interview with Nick Robinson. Here is the Independent\u2019s Tom Peck on Morgan\u2019s answer today. Morgan said changing broadcasting impartiality rules to allow Fox News-style partisan news channels in the UK was \u201cnot on the government\u2019s agenda\u201d. (See 10.42am.) This will come as a relief to the BBC. As my colleague Rowena Mason revealed recently, Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, used to argue for impartiality rules to be abandoned in anti-BBC blogs around 15 years ago (in which he also made the case for a boycott of Today). The Q&amp;A is over. But it was good while it lasted, and much more interesting than the speech itself. I will post a summary shortly. Q: [From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith] Everyone in the BBC knows it has to adapt to the digital era. But how will decriminalisation help at all. It will just take revenue from the BBC. It will be seen as a \u201cpunishment beating\u201d, and payback for news coverage the government does not like. Morgan says she does not accept that. She says it is reasonable to consider whether non-payment of the licence fee should be a crime. Q: [From the Telegraph] Is is right for the government to boycott the Today programme and its 7 million weekly listeners, particularly in the wake of a terror attack? Morgan says she is taking questions today. She says decisions are taken elsewhere about who appears on programmes. But there is a \u201cmassive amount\u201d of engagement, she says. Q: Would the government change broadcasting impartiality rules to allow US-style partisan news? Morgan says this idea is not part of any of the consultations under way. This is \u201cnot on the government\u2019s agenda\u201d. Morgan rules out abandoning broadcasting impartiality rules to allow Fox-style partisan news in the UK. Q: [From Lord Birt, the former BBC director general] This will be seen an attack on the BBC. The BBC was founded 100 years ago. In the 1920s Churchill wanted to take over the BBC during the general strike. That was a critical event. But both main parties established the BBC under a charter. It has been a peerless, although never perfect, institution. The charter means the government can only review the future of the BBC once a decade or so. But you are now instituting a review outside the charter period. This is pretty much unprecedented. Do you accept that? Morgan says she does not accept that. She says it is right to review the BBC. There is always a review mid-charter, she says. She says there is a longer debate to be had about the licence fee model. But what she is talking about is decriminalisation of non-payment of the licence fee. Q: How will you know what the levels of licence fee evasion will be once non-payment is decriminalised? You need to know this before deciding the licence fee settlement. Morgan says the conversation for 2022 is about the level of the licence fee. The conversation about its future would come later. She says the BBC has its own figure for how much evasion might cost it. (It is \u00a3200m, although she does not mention that.) Q: This will be perceived as an attack on the BBC. How can trust in the BBC be maintained? Morgan says her speech should not be seen as an attack on the BBC. It is seen as a beacon around the world, she says. She says it is the government\u2019s duty to consider if the BBC is being funded in the right way. Nicky Morgan is now taking questions. Q: What do you think of the fact that ministers are banned from some media programmes, and some journalists have been banned from government briefings? Morgan says the lobby is open to everyone. But she says the government has always held additional technical briefings. But she says she hopes the row between No 10 and journalists can be ended. I don\u2019t think it serves anybody for this to be continuing. UPDATE: From the Sun\u2019s Matt Dathan From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith Morgan says DCMS is making sure that the regulatory environment for broadcasting adapts too. The legislative underpinning of the PSB system needs to be reviewed, she says. She says the concept of public service broadcasting should extend beyond just linear TV channels. Morgan says PSB (public sector broadcasters) remain popular with audiences. But they must adapt to the new era, she says. Morgan says the licence fee will remain during this charter period, which will end in 2027. But she says it is important to be \u201copen-minded\u201d about what might come next. Morgan confirms that the government wants to consider replacing the BBC licence fee over the long term. Morgan says the government will shortly use secondary legislation to make the \u201csimple payment plan\u201d a permanent feature. At the moment the system is just being trialled. Here is the DCMS explanation of what this involves. Monthly payment plans are already offered by TV Licensing to pay for a TV licence. However, under current regulations, customers are required to pay for their first year\u2019s TV licence which requires initial payments at double the rate in the first six months (known as \u2018front-loading\u2019). The simple payment plan allows eligible vulnerable customers to spread the cost of their first year licence equally over twelve months. Morgan says the world in which the BBC operates has \u201cchanged beyond recognition\u201d because of the huge increase in the number of people watching TV through a subscription service like Netflix. She is now turning to the consultation on decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee. She admits that a review five years ago ruled out decriminalisation. But at that point a licence was not required to watch programmes downloaded on iPlayer, she says. Morgan says the media landscape is changing. The only constant is that DCMS secretaries of state keep giving speeches about how the media is changing, she says. Morgan says broadcasters can also contribute to the government\u2019s aim of spreading opportunity across the whole of the country. Broadcasters need to ask what they are doing to benefit the whole of the UK, she says. But she accepts that in some respects this is happening. She says half of ITV staff are outside London. Channel 4 is setting up a hub in Leeds, she says. And half of BBC spending is outside London, she says. Morgan says the government values the broadcasting sector. It employs 25,000 people directly, and another 50,000 people in the wider broadcasting sector. The BBC can take risks the commercial sector cannot, she says. And it provides a pipeline of talent for the commercial sector, she says. No matter how well funded other broadcasters are, British broadcasters are essential, she says. They can create \u201cshared moments\u201d that bring the country together. Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, has just started giving her BBC speech. She is addressing the Policy Exchange thinktank. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. She starts with the Blockbuster anecdote she used in her Daily Mail article. See 9.15am. She says public sector broadcasting is too important to be allowed to go the way of Blockbuster. David Cameron, the former Conservative prime minister, has explained why he turned down an offer from Boris Johnson to chair the COP 26 global climate change conference in Glasgow in November. Speaking to the BBC, he said there were \u201ca lot of things I have already agreed to do this year, not least the work I do for Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, so I thought it was important that I carried on with that work\u201d. He went on: But I wish the government well, I wish this climate change conference well, because it\u2019s absolutely vital. I\u2019m sure that there will be a government minister, or someone, who will be able to do the job and do it very well. The government has my backing as they go forward. Asked about his relationship with Johnson, Cameron declined to answer. Giving John Bercow a peerage would be a scandal parliament would struggle to live down, according to the man accusing the former Speaker of bullying and explosive behaviour. As my colleague Kate Proctor reports, Lt Gen David Leakey, who served in the role of Black Rod for seven years, has told the BBC that Bercow\u2019s nomination to sit in the House of Lords by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is inappropriate because of the way he was treated and his behaviour towards other staff members. Kate\u2019s full story is here. In a sign of the extent to which views on Bercow became polarised in the Commons along party lines (Labour MPs were broadly supportive, not least because Tory MPs became ever more hostile towards him), the shadow home secretary Diane Abbott posted this on Twitter this morning siding with the former Speaker: The Scottish National party has hired the former newspaper editor who published \u201cthe Vow\u201d, the famous UK leaders\u2019 pledge on extra powers during the independence referendum, as its new chief spin doctor at Holyrood. Murray Foote, former editor of the Record newspaper in Glasgow, will take over from Fergus Mutch as the SNP\u2019s head of communications at Holyrood after becoming a committed supporter of independence following his retirement as editor in 2018. Mutch quit after four years in the post to contest West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine during the general election. After narrowly losing to the Tories, by 843 votes, Mutch did not return to his Holyrood post. A widely-liked and experienced journalist, Foote quit as Record editor not long after his paper was fined a record \u00a380,000 for two contempt of court offences. He will now play a pivotal role in Sturgeon\u2019s efforts to build support for a second independence referendum, deal with any fallout from Alex Salmond\u2019s trial on 14 alleged sex offences (which Salmond denies), and win more seats in the 2021 Holyrood election. With the Record living up to its traditions as a pro-Labour paper, Foote published the vow on behalf of the then prime minister, David Cameron, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband and Lib Dem leader, Nick Clegg two days before the referendum, as the yes campaign edged into the lead in the polls. The vow is infamous in nationalist circles and wrongly credited by some critics for swinging popular opinion in favour of the union. While it galvanised the no campaign, pollsters found it had very little influence on the result, which the no campaign won by more than 10 points. Its notoriety has since increased, with Nicola Sturgeon and others in the yes camp insisting that Brexit means its central pledge \u2013 that Scotland\u2019s prosperity and security would be guaranteed by remaining in the UK, has been comprehensively broken. Unionists insist the vow has been honoured: it promised \u201cpermanent and extensive new powers\u201d for Holyrood; equitable sharing of resources across the UK; full control of NHS spending remaining at Holyrood. A new Scotland act, brokered after cross-party talks involving the SNP, allowed Holyrood to control income tax. Public spending in Scotland is nearly \u00a32,000 per head higher than the UK average, due to higher taxes and Treasury grants. Foote told the Herald newspaper yesterday he had always favoured independence. \u201cI have always been sympathetic to the cause,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who knows me knows - this does not come as a surprise to them.\u201d On the vow, he said: I had a job to do. My job was to represent the views of the readership of the Daily Record. That was what I did to the best of my ability, regardless of my political persuasion. The BBC could end up as defunct as Blockbuster unless it finds a new way of remaining relevant and viable in the digital age, Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, is warning today. The corporation has always been slightly nervous of its prospects under Conservative governments, and relations with Boris Johnson\u2019s government are particularly fraught, partly because Downing Street is boycotting the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs programme, Today on Radio 4, for reasons that have never been fully explained in public. Now a cabinet minister is raising the prospect of the BBC facing extinction. Morgan, who quit the Commons at the last election and now sits in the House of Lords, is making a speech today that will confirm an overnight announcement about how the government is launching a consultation on whether to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee. This sounds like one of those consultations where there is little doubt about what the outcome will be. The BBC claims the move could cost it \u00a3200m. My colleague Jim Waterson\u2019s overnight story about the plan is here. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has stressed that this is not a consultation about the future of the licence fee funding model in principle. But it does say that, if non-payment is decriminalised, any change in the law would not come into effect until April 2022 and the government would consider the impact of this when starting negotiations on the overall licence fee settlement later this year. And, in an article for the Daily Mail, Morgan makes it clear that ministers do want to open up a conversation about how the BBC should be funded in the long term. She writes: Twenty years ago Blockbuster, the then heavyweight of video rentals, turned down a \u00a338m merger offer from Netflix. Today Netflix is worth \u00a350bn, 1,300 times its offer to Blockbuster \u2013 which has gone from 3,000 stores to a museum in Oregon, for people who want to remember what video cassettes look like ... We need to think carefully about how the BBC \u2013 and indeed public service broadcasting more generally \u2013 can stay relevant in the years ahead. As we move into an increasingly digital age, where there are more and more channels to watch and platforms to choose from, it is clear that many people consider it an anachronism that you can be imprisoned effectively for not paying for your TV licence ... We make no apology for being bold and ambitious. As the world around us changes, our laws must change too. It will require the BBC to be innovative and to move with the times. We don\u2019t want a beacon of British values and world-class entertainment ending up like Blockbuster. Morgan has said she will stand down from the cabinet at the reshuffle, which is expected to happen next week (although one theory is that it could come tomorrow). She won\u2019t be around to take the final decisions, although what she says today almost certainly reflects the wider view in government. During the general election campaign Boris Johnson himself confirmed that he was considering scrapping the licence fee, and he suggested it was hard to justify that method of funding the BBC in the modern era. At the time this looked like a transparent attempt to distract the media from a negative story about a boy being forced to sleep on a hospital floor, but it subsequently emerged that BBC funding reform was something he and aides had been mulling over in Downing Street for a while. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, gives a speech on the future of the BBC. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 12.30pm: Emily Thornberry, a candidate for the Labour leadership, takes part in a webchat for Mumsnet. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "How does a political party lose its heartlands? The question tortures a devastated Labour movement. How it\u2019s answered by the next great red hope will help decide whether Boris Johnson spends just five years at No 10 or many, many more. Whatever Westminster types may think, voters deserting the party that was once their home isn\u2019t a one-off event that only happens way up the M1, in some faraway land where locals reminisce about Arthur Scargill as if he were a distant cousin. It is a process that can be replicated wherever a giant gulf opens up between voters and their representatives \u2013 and if politicians and pundits only look, a prize example of how a party can lose its people is happening right now in the capital. Haringey in north London is not what lefty romantics mean by heartlands. Yet the council has been Labour-run almost since its creation. Of the area\u2019s two parliamentary seats, Tottenham has kept the red flag flying for half a century. Lose the teary sentiment and the reality for Labour today is that its core voter is not always a white man in a factory town long since retired off an assembly line but as likely to be a black woman in the inner city who gets by on low-paid care work. Make no mistake, if Labour loses the likes of Tottenham, then it really is finished. Yet over the past few days the jarring din of a voter base pulling up anchor from its bed has been coming out of Tottenham politics, and it signals trouble for Labour. The thing about heartlands is you lose them over decades, but one day you wake up and your one-party statelet is gone. Just ask Dennis Skinner. The past fortnight has seen a chaotic council meeting in which the leader was drowned out by heckling from the gallery and a party meeting in which delegates and even cabinet councillors turned on the cabinet.

      "bodyText": "Police officers are looking to update the offence of \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d for the 21st century to ensure they have the necessary powers to tackle protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion, the Metropolitan police commissioner has said. Cressida Dick told the London assembly she had been holding discussions with the Home Office to toughen up powers and legislation so police could clamp down on protests that aimed to \u201cbring policing to its knees\u201d. Dick said the force wanted public nuisance to be made a statutory offence, rather than a common law offence, which would provide greater clarity for officers seeking to prosecute protesters and could give them greater powers. The comments come as police forces face increased scrutiny over their handling of Extinction Rebellion after the Guardian revealed counter-terrorism policing had produced documents featuring the group and other non-violent organisations. About 3,000 protesters were arrested across the two major periods of action staged by Extinction Rebellion in April and October last year. The group is calling for greater action from government and the public in tackling the climate emergency. The common law offence of public nuisance, which was typically used for \u201cobstructing the highway\u201d, has all but disappeared and been replaced by specific criminal offences under different legislation. There could be a political advantage to writing the offence into statute, as it would allow politicians to send a message to the public that they support or reject such a move. Dick told the assembly: \u201cEver since the first large-scale Extinction Rebellion protest in April last year I have been talking publicly and with the government about the potential for change to powers and to legislation that would enable the police to deal better with protests in general given that the act that we work to \u2013 thePublic Order Act \u2013 is now very old, [dating to] 1986. \u201cBut specifically to deal with protests where people are not primarily violent or seriously disorderly but, as in this instance, had an avowed intent to bring policing to its knees and the city to a halt and were prepared to use the methods we all know they did to do that.\u201d Dick repeated previous calls for a review of the act, as well as a lowering of the threshold before which conditions can be imposed on protests or assemblies. \u201cThere is a phrase which is we need to be satisfied that \u2018serious\u2019 disorder, damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community [has taken place],\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not further defined. But it seems in law, a high threshold.

Belgium\u2019s health agency announced on Tuesday that a Belgian woman was found to be carrying the virus after travelling back from Wuhan on a French repatriation flight on Sunday. Confirmation of the case has caused concerned among a group of 11 British residents who were on the flight with her and are now in quarantine in Arrowe Park in Wirral. They said they had not been given any information about it from the UK authorities.

      "bodyText": "A whistleblower raised the alarm over patient safety at Matt Hancock\u2019s local hospital because of concerns about the behaviour of a doctor who had been seen injecting himself with drugs, the Guardian can reveal. The incident had already prompted internal complaints from senior staff at West Suffolk hospital, but the whistleblower decided to take matters a step further when the same doctor was later involved in a potentially botched operation. The whistleblower then wrote to relatives of a dead patient and urged them to ask questions about the conduct of the doctor and his background. When they did this, the hospital launched a widely criticised \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d in an attempt to find out the identity of the leaker. The doctor\u2019s drug use, which the trust has never acknowledged until now, helps explain why it demanded fingerprint and handwriting samples from staff \u2013 tactics which the NHS regulator roundly condemned in a hard-hitting report last week. Last month Hancock ordered the trust to undergo a rapid review from which he recused himself after failing to act on doctors\u2019 concerns about bullying. In an anonymous letter to widower Jon Warby, the whistleblower said the self-injecting doctor was later present when medical blunders were made before the death of Warby\u2019s 57-year-old wife, Susan, in August 2018. The letter said: \u201cHe had injected himself with drugs before, while in charge of a patient and it was all hushed up. \u201cYou need to ask questions about this doctor and what investigations had been [made] about him before. We think there is a big cover-up.\u201d Consultants at the trust had already raised the alarm that the doctor\u2019s use of injected drugs could pose a risk to patients by impairing his judgment and coordination. But rather than address the criticism of its handling of the problem, the trust\u2019s management launched an extraordinary hunt to identify the whistleblower. The Care Quality Commission said the lengths to which the hospital was going to find the whistleblower were \u201cunprecedented and concerning\u201d as it handed out its biggest ever rating downgrade. It said the \u201cquestionable\u201d tactics left doctors feeling intimidated, at loggerheads with bosses who it said were too focused on who sent the letter rather than why they had done so. One doctor at the trust told the Guardian \u201cmore than 10 people felt really concerned\u201d about the doctor\u2019s behaviour after he was seen injecting himself intravenously with magnesium sulphate and another drug used as painkiller. They claimed the trust failed to properly respond to the incident and offer the doctor appropriate support and time off work. A letter from a consultant sent to the trust\u2019s medical director, Dr Nick Jenkins, in March 2018, confirmed there was \u201ca great deal of concern\u201d after the self-injecting episode was logged as a patient safety incident. The letter, one of four formal complaints on the issue, said: \u201cRapid IV administration of magnesium can cause arrhythmias and hypotension and it is only given in this way in monitored patients. The self-administration of this drug intravenously whilst being on call can therefore only put patient safety at risk.\u201d It recommended that the doctor be given a \u201ca period of leave whilst doubts are put to rest\u201d. A trust investigation into the incident found the doctor had done no harm to patients. The General Medical Council was informed but recommended no disciplinary sanctions. Dozens of staff had accessed Warby\u2019s hospital records, but it was those who had expressed concern about the drug-taking doctor who were asked to provide fingerprint and handwriting samples, insiders claim. A doctor said: \u201cStaff who were asked for their fingerprints were the doctors who had raised concerns about the drug-injecting doctor. Many colleagues raised concerns about him and his patients\u2019 safety, that were ignored.\u201d The Guardian can also disclose that the trust is still trying to discipline a suspected whistleblower using handwriting samples and demands for fingerprints despite being heavily criticised for the practice by CQC and publicly stating it had stopped using it. After the Guardian first revealed the trust\u2019s tactics, managers delivered written apologies \u201cfor the stress and upset caused\u201d to all staff involved and said it \u201cno intention of pursuing fingerprint requests further\u201d. Despite this public display of contrition, bosses have since refused to drop disciplinary action against a doctor accused of being the mole on the basis of handwriting samples and their refusal to provide fingerprints. The trust\u2019s chief executive, Steve Dunn, personally assured a meeting of consultants that the management would no longer be using handwriting and fingerprints to pursue the matter. A doctor said: \u201cThere is no contrition. The trust continued to pursue an aggressive and intimidatory campaign based on biometrics culminating in accusing an entirely blameless individual.\u201d A spokeswoman for the trust refused to discuss the investigation directly but pointed out that it was now subject to the rapid review, being overseen by the health minister Edward Argar. She said: \u201cIn these complex cases, an independent review with maximum transparency is the right way forward, and we are in support of this approach.\u201d On the self-injecting doctor she said: \u201c\u201cThe matter was investigated in line with trust policies and discussed with the GMC. The individual no longer works at the trust, but, as part of our duty of care, support was provided to ensure they were fit and well to be at work during their time here.\u201d The doctor\u2019s lawyer refused to comment. The letter to Warby prompted Suffolk\u2019s senior coroner to refer the drug claim to the police. Suffolk police decided not to investigate after establishing that no illegal drugs were involved.",

But I\u2019m a fan of the Marathon spring roll. Being a kid growing up in the 1990s and eating small Asian spring rolls since I was born, I liked how the Marathon spring roll was massive.

At $5 it\u2019s a complete steal, they\u2019re super generous with the fillings, to the point where I often struggle to finish \u2013 to my great shame as a professional eater!

If you were born in South Australia, however, you would know that doughnuts are in fact always fried fresh to order, coated in cinnamon sugar and served still hot in a paper bag for $1.30 each. Together with a Farmers Union iced coffee, there is no more South Australian snack experience.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Matt Moran \u2013 chef and <a href=\"https://www.thankful4farmers.com.au/\">Thankful4Farmers</a> ambassador<br></strong><em><strong>Caramello Koala</strong></em><strong> <br></strong>\u201c[They\u2019re] my all-time favourite \u2013 you can\u2019t get more Australian than that.

Plus you can find them in most Australian airports and service stations. The chocolate and coconut combo is such a yummy flavour and really reminds me of morning tea lamingtons! Plus they\u2019re vegan and sweetened with dates.\u201d<br><br><strong>Oscar McMahon \u2013 Young Henrys co-founder<br></strong><em><strong>Swimming pool hot chips</strong></em><strong><br></strong>\u201cLearning to swim is an imperative part of growing up in this country and the promise of hot saucy chips has probably been one of the strongest influences on the wiling swimming lesson attendance.

It\u2019s funny because I didn\u2019t even realise it was Australian till I couldn\u2019t find one anywhere! I don\u2019t think there is a better way to start the day, either sitting down at a cafe with a coffee, cooking at home with my daughter or riding one-handed on a bicycle to work smashing a delicious crusty fresh roll filled with smoky bacon, fried egg, caramelised onions and BBQ sauce. It\u2019s the perfect breakfast.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Samantha Hillman \u2013 food stylist and photographer</strong><br><em><strong>Banana Paddle Pop<br></strong></em>\u201cTo be honest I\u2019m not even sure that I love Banana Paddle Pops so much as I simply crave themed food. The soapy banana flavour is divisive to say the least, but they remind me so much of Australian summers as a kid <em>(</em>hot seatbelts! Cicadas! Stanwell Park Beach kiosk!<em>)</em> that it\u2019s too late for me now. I eat them every time I\u2019m back in the country. Being frozen, they\u2019re one of the few snacks you can\u2019t just smuggle back in your suitcase.

Add the fact that you can eat it while driving a ute with a manual transmission equals perfection. It\u2019s cheap, with humble ingredients, available everywhere, and the discussion of \u201cwhich pie is best\u201d is as likely to start a fight in any pub in any state as any conversation around any code of football.

I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a huge amount of nostalgia associated with it mixed in with it being simple yet delicious and for me the perfect snapshot of the Australian summer. It was a hard decision between this and a Frosty Fruit, both of which obviously aren\u2019t imported to the UK. The general Aussie ice-cream or ice block game is strong and reigns supreme over the UK offerings. My family even sent me over a can of the crumbs. They didn\u2019t last long.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Matthew Evans \u2013 farmer at Fat Pig Farm<br></strong><em><strong>Vanilla slice <br></strong></em>\u201cI think the quintessential Aussie snack has to be the snot block. Other nations try to do it, some do posh versions (the French mille-feuille comes to mind), but the tuck shop version I grew up with, all golden-stiff custard and sickly-sweet icing, is a legend of the Ocker lunchtime. Some seem to think passionfruit icing is the go, but I\u2019m afraid they are deluded. There\u2019s only one real version, and that has plain fondant icing on top, not fancy pants icing sugar or passionfruit or lemon.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Darren Robertson \u2013 co-founder of Three Blue Ducks <br></strong><em><strong>Sausage roll<br></strong></em>\u201cI\u2019m going to say that my top quintessential Australian snack for under a fiver is the pea, mint and ricotta roll by <a href=\"https://www.thebreadsocial.com.au/\">The Bread Social</a> bakery in Tweed Heads, New South Wales. The guys at The Bread Social make incredible handmade sourdough [bread], Portuguese tarts with a cult following, and these little veggie rolls all on-site. They\u2019re made with split peas, veggies, lemon zest, mint, ricotta, spices and yoghurt. If you\u2019re craving a good old Ozzy sausage roll but want to opt for something super nutritious and very tasty, they\u2019re served with a side of tomato sauce and cost $4.50.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Anthea Loucas Bosha \u2013 CEO of Food and Wine Victoria <br></strong><em><strong>Twisties<br></strong></em>\u201cA supercharged savoury hit, these cheesy, crunchy, salty puffs are the treat snack of my childhood. Admittedly on fairly low rotation these days, I can recommend them chased with salt and vinegar Smith\u2019s chips \u2013 it\u2019s a great combo. And don\u2019t even think about the chicken version. Fun fact? They originated in Melbourne.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee8561e1ff82ef71b5aa5da136a61a384f36de96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee8561e1ff82ef71b5aa5da136a61a384f36de96/2959_1775_2940_1766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A packet of Twisties, nominated by Anthea Loucas Bosha as her favourite Australian snack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twisties: crunchy, salty puffs of cheesiness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Maeve O\u2019Meara \u2013 director of Gourmet Safari </strong><br><em><strong>Arancini balls</strong></em><br>\u201cThe best ones are from the bakeries in Haberfield [in Sydney].

It\u2019s a more grown-up version of the big-brand iced coffees and flavoured milks in cartons, that satisfies with a caffeine hit and a cool, creamy, filling long drink. Especially good if shaken vigorously in a cocktail shaker on a beach holiday.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Melissa Leong \u2013 Masterchef judge<br></strong><em><strong>Sausage sizzle<br></strong>\u201c</em>You simply can\u2019t go past a good sausage sizzle.

That perfect combination of super-refined white bread, onions that are somehow charred and yet a bit raw, a humble snag and the controversy over whether you top the lot with tomato sauce, mustard (both!) or the social outlier \u2013 I\u2019m talking about barbecue sauce \u2026 you can\u2019t get more quintessentially Australian than that.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Is there a cheap snack that feels quintessentially Australian to you?

Being a kid growing up in the 1990s and eating small Asian spring rolls since I was born, I liked how the Marathon spring roll was massive. Had a thick tasty filling of mostly cabbage, and the skin was thinner than a Chiko roll.\u201d Skye Gyngell \u2013 Spring restaurant, London Violet Crumble \u201cI love returning to Sydney, especially to eat \u2013 there are so many wonderful chefs and restaurants which I find truly inspiring. In terms of nostalgia, I left home as a teenager so most of my go-to urges when I return home are things that I ate then, but wouldn\u2019t necessarily eat so much now. Violet Crumble bars are a favourite of mine as well as Cherry Ripes. I always pack a few in the my suitcase to bring back to London with me.\u201d Mark Olive \u2013 Black Olive catering Splice ice-cream \u201cHow can you go past a cool treat on a hot summer\u2019s day? It\u2019s what I grew up with, the longing on a day after school, after sports, cooking with my grandma. A Hawaiian delight or now better known as a Pine-Lime Splice. And so my obsession with ice-cream began.\u201d Jacqui Challinor \u2013 head chef at Nomad Banh Mi from Eddy\u2019s Bakery \u201cI\u2019d say these are pretty on par with, if not better than, the infamous Marrickville pork roll and this one is dangerously much closer to my house. At $5 it\u2019s a complete steal, they\u2019re super generous with the fillings, to the point where I often struggle to finish \u2013 to my great shame as a professional eater! Multiculturalism is something I view as an iconic part of Aussie cuisine \u2013 we\u2019re so lucky to be surrounded by so much good food.\u201d Adam Liaw \u2013 chef and writer Hot cinnamon donuts from the Harbor View Donut Cafe, Victor Harbor \u201cIf you were born after the 1990s you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that donuts were giant mass-produced, room-temperature cakes covered with all manner of hideous icings and ill-considered toppings. If you were born in South Australia, however, you would know that doughnuts are in fact always fried fresh to order, coated in cinnamon sugar and served still hot in a paper bag for $1.30 each. Together with a Farmers Union iced coffee, there is no more South Australian snack experience.\u201d Matt Moran \u2013 chef and Thankful4Farmers ambassador Caramello Koala \u201c[They\u2019re] my all-time favourite \u2013 you can\u2019t get more Australian than that. I have always been a fan of chocolate and caramel, even to the extent that we created our own wattleseed version and added it to our menu at Bea in Barangaroo House.\u201d Ellie Bullen \u2013 author of The Global Vegan Blue Dinosaur lamington snack bar \u201cThis is a healthy and raw alternative to an Aussie cake, but they\u2019re great for packing on flights or a snack on the go. Plus you can find them in most Australian airports and service stations. The chocolate and coconut combo is such a yummy flavour and really reminds me of morning tea lamingtons! Plus they\u2019re vegan and sweetened with dates.\u201d Oscar McMahon \u2013 Young Henrys co-founder Swimming pool hot chips \u201cLearning to swim is an imperative part of growing up in this country and the promise of hot saucy chips has probably been one of the strongest influences on the wiling swimming lesson attendance. They are hot, crispy, slippery with vinegar and sauce and the salt cuts through the latent taste of swimming lessons chlorine. Hot chips taught us to swim. Who\u2019d have thunk it.\u201d Louis Tikaram \u2013 head chef at Stanley Bacon and egg rolls \u201cThey are a very iconic breakfast snack that I dearly missed living in LA. It\u2019s funny because I didn\u2019t even realise it was Australian till I couldn\u2019t find one anywhere! I don\u2019t think there is a better way to start the day, either sitting down at a cafe with a coffee, cooking at home with my daughter or riding one-handed on a bicycle to work smashing a delicious crusty fresh roll filled with smoky bacon, fried egg, caramelised onions and BBQ sauce. It\u2019s the perfect breakfast.\u201d Samantha Hillman \u2013 food stylist and photographer Banana Paddle Pop \u201cTo be honest I\u2019m not even sure that I love Banana Paddle Pops so much as I simply crave themed food. The soapy banana flavour is divisive to say the least, but they remind me so much of Australian summers as a kid (hot seatbelts! Cicadas! Stanwell Park Beach kiosk!) that it\u2019s too late for me now. I eat them every time I\u2019m back in the country. Being frozen, they\u2019re one of the few snacks you can\u2019t just smuggle back in your suitcase. I live for the melty bit at the end.\u201d James Erskine \u2013 Jauma winemaker Bliss balls \u201cMy partner Sophie makes these at home. What better way to reuse the leftovers from making almond milk? Throw in a few dates, nut butters, tahini, seeds and coconut flakes. It\u2019s iconically Australian because our visiting guests love them and so do we.\u201d Jake Smyth \u2013 Mary\u2019s co-founder Meat pie \u201cChunks of indeterminate meat, floating in rich gravy, wrapped in flaky pastry are three incredible things when taken together \u2013 they create true simple beauty. Add the fact that you can eat it while driving a ute with a manual transmission equals perfection. It\u2019s cheap, with humble ingredients, available everywhere, and the discussion of \u201cwhich pie is best\u201d is as likely to start a fight in any pub in any state as any conversation around any code of football. Personally, if it\u2019s from the servo my pick is Vili\u2019s pepper steak.\u201d Palisa Anderson \u2013 Boon Luck and Chat Thai farmer and restaurateur Fresh young coconut \u201cYou will need to polish your cleaver skills to open them, but once you master it, the rewards far outweigh the possibilities of losing some fingers. When you get a good one it will have soft tender jelly meat and be the most deliciously hydrating drink/food you can hope for on a hot day. I serve it at my cafe with a double shot of espresso for the ultimate morning coffee or afternoon pick-me-up.\u201d Phil Bracey \u2013 Bright and P Franco restaurateur Golden Gaytime \u201cEvery time I come back to Australia I make it a mission to head straight to a servo on the way from the airport to pick up one of these. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a huge amount of nostalgia associated with it mixed in with it being simple yet delicious and for me the perfect snapshot of the Australian summer. It was a hard decision between this and a Frosty Fruit, both of which obviously aren\u2019t imported to the UK. The general Aussie ice-cream or ice block game is strong and reigns supreme over the UK offerings. My family even sent me over a can of the crumbs. They didn\u2019t last long.\u201d Matthew Evans \u2013 farmer at Fat Pig Farm Vanilla slice \u201cI think the quintessential Aussie snack has to be the snot block. Other nations try to do it, some do posh versions (the French mille-feuille comes to mind), but the tuck shop version I grew up with, all golden-stiff custard and sickly-sweet icing, is a legend of the Ocker lunchtime. Some seem to think passionfruit icing is the go, but I\u2019m afraid they are deluded. There\u2019s only one real version, and that has plain fondant icing on top, not fancy pants icing sugar or passionfruit or lemon.\u201d Darren Robertson \u2013 co-founder of Three Blue Ducks Sausage roll \u201cI\u2019m going to say that my top quintessential Australian snack for under a fiver is the pea, mint and ricotta roll by The Bread Social bakery in Tweed Heads, New South Wales. The guys at The Bread Social make incredible handmade sourdough [bread], Portuguese tarts with a cult following, and these little veggie rolls all on-site. They\u2019re made with split peas, veggies, lemon zest, mint, ricotta, spices and yoghurt. If you\u2019re craving a good old Ozzy sausage roll but want to opt for something super nutritious and very tasty, they\u2019re served with a side of tomato sauce and cost $4.50.\u201d Anthea Loucas Bosha \u2013 CEO of Food and Wine Victoria Twisties \u201cA supercharged savoury hit, these cheesy, crunchy, salty puffs are the treat snack of my childhood. Admittedly on fairly low rotation these days, I can recommend them chased with salt and vinegar Smith\u2019s chips \u2013 it\u2019s a great combo. And don\u2019t even think about the chicken version. Fun fact? They originated in Melbourne.\u201d Maeve O\u2019Meara \u2013 director of Gourmet Safari Arancini balls \u201cThe best ones are from the bakeries in Haberfield [in Sydney]. Filled with rich bolognese sauce and a little stretchy mozzarella. These are delicious and they\u2019re made throughout the day so they\u2019re always fresh.\u201d Jackie Middleton \u2013 chief food nerd at Earl Canteen Ice latte \u201cIt may be a beverage, but a strong iced latte with lots of ice is one of my favourite summer snacks. It\u2019s a more grown-up version of the big-brand iced coffees and flavoured milks in cartons, that satisfies with a caffeine hit and a cool, creamy, filling long drink. Especially good if shaken vigorously in a cocktail shaker on a beach holiday.\u201d Melissa Leong \u2013 Masterchef judge Sausage sizzle \u201cYou simply can\u2019t go past a good sausage sizzle. Whether it\u2019s a school fete, family barbecue or a trip to Bunnings, there is something truly equalising about the humble snag. That perfect combination of super-refined white bread, onions that are somehow charred and yet a bit raw, a humble snag and the controversy over whether you top the lot with tomato sauce, mustard (both!) or the social outlier \u2013 I\u2019m talking about barbecue sauce \u2026 you can\u2019t get more quintessentially Australian than that.\u201d Is there a cheap snack that feels quintessentially Australian to you? Perhaps it reminds you of your childhood \u2013 or is a favourite treat right now. Let us know in the comments",

Although she didn\u2019t write it, Carry You feels very much like a spiritual successor to Higgins\u2019 2004 gem The Special Two; just as resigned and heartbroken, but without the naivety of teen-dom. There\u2019s dread and denial, love and lies. It\u2019s a deeper relationship that seems to have been lost, carried by a more sturdy, solemn tune.

Pound that good thing into submission, then pound it some more. Sandcastles is crammed with this stuff, and Cable Ties aren\u2019t afraid to parade them all in this four-minute punk assault. There\u2019s the interplay between the driving bass and the scrappy chords; the yelping, riot grrrl vocals that slash angrily across the verses. And then there is the pure energy of the singalong chorus, with lyrics that slap down naysayers, gatekeepers and other malignant forces. This same energy will be thrown back at them by festival crowds through the summer, with a recent signing to US powerhouse Merge Records for a forthcoming album set to speed things up.

The title track, originally from 1993\u2019s Jamu Dreaming record, is presented here as a looser, more playful rendition. Roach\u2019s soulful and gravelled vocal slides over a sparse, skipping backing, with Tiddas\u2019 Sally Dastey joining in quite beautifully during the chorus. The driving acoustic instrumentation that commands the original is missing, as are the swelling yet distracting strings. The result is a grittier sounding yet more joyful recording.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/06/archie-roach-you-can-reach-the-darkest-point-in-our-life-and-come-back-and-come-good\">Archie Roach: 'You can reach the darkest point in our life and come back, and come good'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>For more: </strong>The album Tell Me Why is out now \u2013 or start with 1990\u2019s Charcoal Lane and make your way through his career</p> <h2><strong>Montaigne \u2013 Don\u2019t Break Me</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Sia, Delta Goodrem, U2</p> <p>This song has one of the most undeniable choruses of the year, an absolute belter that many hopefuls will try and fail to harness the power of in season after season of The Voice. But before we are treated to that, Montaigne dazzles us with some moody synths that sound like they were written for the trailer to a teen movie, and a low-key verse vocal that slowly builds in intensity. A short, percussive pre-chorus echoes out like she\u2019s stomping up a stairwell, then we get that epic half-time chorus. Surely it\u2019s only a matter of time before Montaigne starts hitting Sia-levels of fame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f23eaacb3b2a9bbf922a9817660d2afd91b9297\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f23eaacb3b2a9bbf922a9817660d2afd91b9297/0_0_2263_3381/669.jpg\" alt=\"The Jezebels frontwoman Hayley Mary\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Jezebels frontwoman Hayley Mary, whose debut EP is out this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: I Oh You</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Hayley Mary \u2013 Like A Woman Should</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Deborah Conway, Little Birdy, the Jezabels</p> <p>There\u2019s a type of sunny, powerful Australian pop song that existed on FM radio in the 90s which no longer finds itself too welcome amid codeine mumble-rap and self-conscious dance music. Hopefully this sterling new single from Jezabels vocalist Hayley Mary reverses the trend. A bright, jangly rhythm section plays second fiddle to a versatile vocal performance that echoes Katy Steele at her finest. Like A Woman Should is an earworm from start to finish, with gloriously warm guitar tones, clean and sparkling production and that same widescreen, whooshing feeling that all the best optimistic pop music conjures.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Hayley Mary\u2019s debut EP, The Piss, the Perfume, is out now</p> <h2><strong>Alex the Astronaut \u2013 I Think You\u2019re Great</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>The DMA\u2019s, Peter Bjorn and John, Foster the People</p> <p>A baggy beat and chiming guitars propel Alex the Astronaut\u2019s first single for 2020 into rare air, as syllables skip and positive platitudes prevail. Alexandra Lynn is so adept at writing pop songs that capture the rush of young love, friendship, confusion, sadness and all those messy situations that dominate your early 20s that it\u2019s odd to think she is yet to release her debut album. \u201cThat\u2019s a fun song,\u201d she exclaims after the last notes ring out. She isn\u2019t wrong.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Alex the Astronaut will be at SXSW in March</p> <h2><strong>#1 Dads \u2013 Freedom Fighter</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Augie March, Sarah Blasko, David Grey</p> <p>The most mature of Tom Iansek\u2019s many musical projects, which include Big Scary and No Mono, has one of the silliest names possible. But stately pianos and Iansek\u2019s majestic voice make clear from the start that this is a song to take very seriously. Rather than slowly building the intensity of the backing track, Iansek ramps up the vocals, adding subtle but striking harmonies and doubling the piano melody to lift the tune. It\u2019s an expert move, and one that stems from confidence in this song\u2019s slow-burning charm. This is a mood piece first and foremost, and as the chorus jumps in suddenly one final time, like an encore you were about to yell for, you\u2019ll find your finger already hovering over the \u201crepeat\u201d button.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>The new #1 Dads album, Golden Repair, will be out 6 March</p> <h2><strong>Lenka \u2013 On My Side</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Joanna Newsom, Seeker Lover Keeper, Decoder Ring</p> <p>After 15 years spent using songwriting as an emotional salve, Lenka Kripac \u2013 also an actor \u2013 was suddenly hit with a crippling bout of writer\u2019s block. She went back to the basics, learning, dissecting and reinterpreting a varied batch of cover songs, which eventually led her back to writing originals again. One of these new gems, On My Side, is a wholly satisfying slice of chamber folk, with swelling, sweet vocals, gorgeous string-led instrumentation and a subtle slide guitar that swoops like a seagull. The whole thing is dreamy and lovely, with a middle eight that feels like diving into a sun-warmed ocean.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Lenka is touring throughout March. Her twin EPs, Recover and Discover, will be out 14 and 28 February, respectively</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc74996045357ea604f65a9a4923c221f75a9258\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc74996045357ea604f65a9a4923c221f75a9258/0_0_640_426/500.jpg\" alt=\"Musician and actor Lenka\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian musician and actor Lenka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Skipalong Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The Chats \u2013 The Clap</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>The Ramones, Rancid, the Saints</p> <p>How to follow up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LGM82uPuvA\">a breakneck punk song</a> about eating schnitzels and chips at a pub \u2013 a song that landed in the Hottest 100 and was <a href=\"https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/the-chats-pub-feed-today-show/\">performed on morning TV</a>? With a charming ode to venereal disease, of course. All the better if the chorus is a complete and shameless rip of the Go Gos\u2019 We Got the Beat and the first verse opens with the charming Rodney Rude-referencing, \u201clast week, pulled a root, in the back of my ute\u201d. The drumming sounds like garbage cans, the guitars sound as rusty as the hinges on the aforementioned ute and there\u2019s a reference to \u2013 ahem \u2013 \u201cdouble-wrapping\u201d. All in all, this is an excellent song.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>High Risk Behaviour, the Chats\u2019 debut album, is out 27 March</p> <h2><strong>Kingswood \u2013 Bittersweet</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> The Killers, Queens of the Stone Age, Alice in Chains</p> <p>Kingswood has cycled through many different incarnations throughout their career: Jet-styled rockers, sleaze merchants with an eye on the dancefloor, and anything else likely to prick the ears of radio programmers. This latest oil change is Kingswood\u2019s slickest, as they settle into a doomy, sexy Queens of the Stone Age sound, with a haunting melodic vocal structure reminiscent of System of a Down, Black Sabbath or any other metal-inspired bands that flirt with \u201cthe devil\u2019s interval\u201d and its spooky cousins. This might not get them on radio, but it is the best they have ever sounded.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Kingswood are touring nationally throughout March and April</p> <p><br></p>",

The title track, originally from 1993\u2019s Jamu Dreaming record, is presented here as a looser, more playful rendition. Roach\u2019s soulful and gravelled vocal slides over a sparse, skipping backing, with Tiddas\u2019 Sally Dastey joining in quite beautifully during the chorus. The driving acoustic instrumentation that commands the original is missing, as are the swelling yet distracting strings. The result is a grittier sounding yet more joyful recording. For more: The album Tell Me Why is out now \u2013 or start with 1990\u2019s Charcoal Lane and make your way through his career Montaigne \u2013 Don\u2019t Break Me For fans of: Sia, Delta Goodrem, U2 This song has one of the most undeniable choruses of the year, an absolute belter that many hopefuls will try and fail to harness the power of in season after season of The Voice. But before we are treated to that, Montaigne dazzles us with some moody synths that sound like they were written for the trailer to a teen movie, and a low-key verse vocal that slowly builds in intensity. A short, percussive pre-chorus echoes out like she\u2019s stomping up a stairwell, then we get that epic half-time chorus. Surely it\u2019s only a matter of time before Montaigne starts hitting Sia-levels of fame. Hayley Mary \u2013 Like A Woman Should For fans of: Deborah Conway, Little Birdy, the Jezabels There\u2019s a type of sunny, powerful Australian pop song that existed on FM radio in the 90s which no longer finds itself too welcome amid codeine mumble-rap and self-conscious dance music. Hopefully this sterling new single from Jezabels vocalist Hayley Mary reverses the trend. A bright, jangly rhythm section plays second fiddle to a versatile vocal performance that echoes Katy Steele at her finest. Like A Woman Should is an earworm from start to finish, with gloriously warm guitar tones, clean and sparkling production and that same widescreen, whooshing feeling that all the best optimistic pop music conjures. For more: Hayley Mary\u2019s debut EP, The Piss, the Perfume, is out now Alex the Astronaut \u2013 I Think You\u2019re Great For fans of: The DMA\u2019s, Peter Bjorn and John, Foster the People A baggy beat and chiming guitars propel Alex the Astronaut\u2019s first single for 2020 into rare air, as syllables skip and positive platitudes prevail. Alexandra Lynn is so adept at writing pop songs that capture the rush of young love, friendship, confusion, sadness and all those messy situations that dominate your early 20s that it\u2019s odd to think she is yet to release her debut album. \u201cThat\u2019s a fun song,\u201d she exclaims after the last notes ring out. She isn\u2019t wrong. For more: Alex the Astronaut will be at SXSW in March #1 Dads \u2013 Freedom Fighter For fans of: Augie March, Sarah Blasko, David Grey The most mature of Tom Iansek\u2019s many musical projects, which include Big Scary and No Mono, has one of the silliest names possible. But stately pianos and Iansek\u2019s majestic voice make clear from the start that this is a song to take very seriously. Rather than slowly building the intensity of the backing track, Iansek ramps up the vocals, adding subtle but striking harmonies and doubling the piano melody to lift the tune. It\u2019s an expert move, and one that stems from confidence in this song\u2019s slow-burning charm. This is a mood piece first and foremost, and as the chorus jumps in suddenly one final time, like an encore you were about to yell for, you\u2019ll find your finger already hovering over the \u201crepeat\u201d button. For more: The new #1 Dads album, Golden Repair, will be out 6 March Lenka \u2013 On My Side For fans of: Joanna Newsom, Seeker Lover Keeper, Decoder Ring After 15 years spent using songwriting as an emotional salve, Lenka Kripac \u2013 also an actor \u2013 was suddenly hit with a crippling bout of writer\u2019s block. She went back to the basics, learning, dissecting and reinterpreting a varied batch of cover songs, which eventually led her back to writing originals again. One of these new gems, On My Side, is a wholly satisfying slice of chamber folk, with swelling, sweet vocals, gorgeous string-led instrumentation and a subtle slide guitar that swoops like a seagull. The whole thing is dreamy and lovely, with a middle eight that feels like diving into a sun-warmed ocean. For more: Lenka is touring throughout March. Her twin EPs, Recover and Discover, will be out 14 and 28 February, respectively The Chats \u2013 The Clap For fans of: The Ramones, Rancid, the Saints How to follow up a breakneck punk song about eating schnitzels and chips at a pub \u2013 a song that landed in the Hottest 100 and was performed on morning TV? With a charming ode to venereal disease, of course. All the better if the chorus is a complete and shameless rip of the Go Gos\u2019 We Got the Beat and the first verse opens with the charming Rodney Rude-referencing, \u201clast week, pulled a root, in the back of my ute\u201d. The drumming sounds like garbage cans, the guitars sound as rusty as the hinges on the aforementioned ute and there\u2019s a reference to \u2013 ahem \u2013 \u201cdouble-wrapping\u201d. All in all, this is an excellent song. For more: High Risk Behaviour, the Chats\u2019 debut album, is out 27 March Kingswood \u2013 Bittersweet For fans of: The Killers, Queens of the Stone Age, Alice in Chains Kingswood has cycled through many different incarnations throughout their career: Jet-styled rockers, sleaze merchants with an eye on the dancefloor, and anything else likely to prick the ears of radio programmers. This latest oil change is Kingswood\u2019s slickest, as they settle into a doomy, sexy Queens of the Stone Age sound, with a haunting melodic vocal structure reminiscent of System of a Down, Black Sabbath or any other metal-inspired bands that flirt with \u201cthe devil\u2019s interval\u201d and its spooky cousins. This might not get them on radio, but it is the best they have ever sounded. For more: Kingswood are touring nationally throughout March and April",

On Monday, the Liberal party declared it had received $165,000 from a company named Southern Strategy, a largely inactive political consultancy business Briggs started four years ago. Briggs is a close friend and confidant of Morrison, a former New South Wales Liberal party deputy state director, a former colleague of immigration minister David Coleman, and a director of the Cronulla Sharks, where the prime minister is the number one ticket holder. He is also leading a bid to win a highly lucrative but controversial contract to privatise Australia\u2019s visa processing system on behalf of a consortium named Australian Visa Processing Pty Ltd. Labor has previously raised concerns about a conflict of interest in the procurement process, given Briggs\u2019s relationship to Morrison and the Liberal party, claims that have been strongly denied by Coalition ministers. When the Guardian queried the $165,000 donation, Briggs said Southern Strategy had never made it and that the Liberal party had made a mistake. The Liberal party also said the disclosure was a mistake. \u201cThe Liberal party\u2019s return will be amended to reflect this,\u201d a spokesman said. But neither the Liberals nor Briggs would answer questions on how the Liberal party happened to accidentally declare to the Australian electoral commission a specific donation of $165,000 from Southern Strategy \u2013 a company that has never donated before \u2013 including the company\u2019s full address in the process. \u201cThat is a matter for the Liberal party,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cAll I can confirm is that Southern Strategy made no donations to the Liberal party.\u201d When declaring the donation, the Liberals listed Southern Strategy\u2019s address as being at the same George Street office as the consortium vying for the visa contract, Australian Visa Processing Pty Ltd. The address is also home to Briggs\u2019 other company, investment firm Pacific Blue Capital, according to company records. Pacific Blue Capital made 14 donations worth about $90,000 to the Liberal party in 2018-19. Labor\u2019s shadow assistant immigration minister, Andrew Giles, said the donation and the explanation for its removal appeared \u201cfishy\u201d. \u201cIf this really is an error, then the Liberal party must give a full and proper explanation,\u201d Giles told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary that a donation for $165,000 to the Liberal party has been attributed to an entity that denies the donation ever existed.\u201d \u201cIs it any wonder the Australian people are losing faith in our politics?\u201d Company records suggest Southern Strategy is a business name held by a family trust, known as the Mezott Family Trust. The records also list its principal place of business as Briggs\u2019 family home in Sydney\u2019s Sutherland Shire. Removing donations from a party\u2019s annual return takes some time. No change had yet been made at 9am Thursday. Evidence that it was originally declared by the Liberal party before being later deleted will remain on the Australian electoral commission\u2019s website permanently. The plan to privatise Australia\u2019s visa processing system has been met with significant criticism. It has prompted fears that thousands of jobs will be lost and sensitive private information will be compromised. The main public service union, the Community and Public Sector Union, has warned it will give private companies too much of a say over who is allowed to come to Australia. Briggs\u2019 consortium Australian Visa Processing Pty Ltd is one of two key players vying for the visa privatisation contract. Any suggestion of a conflict has been hotly disputed by Coalition ministers, who say Morrison has no role in deciding the tender. Morrison and Coleman have reportedly removed themselves from any cabinet and expenditure review committee discussions about the contract. Similar privatisation in the United Kingdom has led to exorbitant costs and extensive delays for migrants seeking visas. Freedom of information documents released last year showed that legislative change would be needed to privatise the visa system. That could delay the government\u2019s plans considerably, because Labor and key crossbenchers have indicated their opposition.

I was not exactly positive (I am more of an economic glass-half-empty kind of guy), but I believe we should just be a bit cautious before declaring a recession is on the way.</p> <p>But this talk of a recession also brought with it a bit of a debate over just how we should calculate it.</p> <p>As I noted on Tuesday, the standard (and misnamed) \u201ctechnical\u201d recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.</p> <p>That measure is not only rather simplistic, it is also a pretty high bar to reach. Such a measure for example allows us to boast that we have not had a recession since the early 1990s despite pretty good evidence that we did have a small recession during the GFC.</p> <p>We could perhaps use per capita GDP growth, as that would remove the impact of population growth. But such a measure would have had us in a recession in 2006, when we were decidedly not, and even during the GFC we did not have two consecutive periods of negative GDP per capita growth, and yet we did last year.</p> <p>We could measure the growth of the private sector. This would remove government spending that might artificially keep GDP growing.</p> <p>Again, such a measure is useful, but does not produce two quarters of consecutive negative growth during the GFC (although there were three out of five such quarters), while last year there were two such consecutive quarters.</p> <p>That is a good way of showing that last year the economy was performing poorly; however, any measure that suggests last year was a recession, but the GFC was not, is a failure.</p> <p>We could also look at the private domestic economy \u2013 in effect GDP minus government spending and exports \u2013 to give us private sector \u201cgross national expenditure\u201d.</p> <p>This measure suggests we had a recession in 2001, 2009, 2014 and have also been in one since the end of 2018.</p> <p>That again highlights just how poorly the economy is currently performing, but perhaps suffers from the bar of a \u201crecession\u201d being set too low. It also means we are discounting exports which is not particularly useful when wishing to examine the entire economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"National accounts - quarterly growth\">  <iframe title=\"National accounts -quarterly growth\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5YO9y/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>All these measures also suffer from a time lag. We will only find out the GDP growth of the March quarter on 3 June, and for the following quarter on 2 September.</p> <p>Thus we might be in a recession now, but will only have it confirmed in seven months time.</p> <p>The Grattan Institute\u2019s Matt Cowgill and a number of other commenters on Twitter suggested using a measure devised by an economist from the US Federal Reserve, Claudia Sahm.</p> <p>Her measure focuses purely on unemployment. This has the benefit of looking at the measure we most care about (do we give a damn if GDP shrinks, but unemployment doesn\u2019t rise?), and because unemployment figures come out each month, it is faster than GDP.</p> <p>She suggests comparing a rolling three month average of the unemployment rate with the lowest rate in the past 12 months. She argues when this goes above 0.5% pts, we are in a recession.</p> <p>Therefore, if the current three month average of the unemployment rate is 5.6%, and at some point in the past 12 months the rate was 5%, that would mean a gap of 0.6% pts and indicate a recession.</p> <p>This measure is similar to my ready guide of looking at the 12 months change in the unemployment rate.</p> <p>Indeed both measures have very similar \u201cpeaks\u201d, and both would indicate that we had recessions in 2001, during the GFC, and also went close to one from 2013-2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Recession measures\">  <iframe title=\"Recession measures\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LnR6n/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>You could quibble and argue a 0.5% pt change is too small for a recession, but the reality is most times when the gap goes above 0.5% pt, it then rises to 1% pt.</p> <p>We could also measure instead underutilisation and suggest a 1% pt increase is a recession. In that case we also did have a recession in 2014 and 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Adjusted Sahm recession measure - underutilisation\">  <iframe title=\"Adjusted Sahm recession measure - underutilisation\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7JdoJ/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And what the Sahm measure also highlights is that when a recession occurs, it occurs quickly.</p> <p>On average the unemployment rate does not move at all each month \u2013 a 0.1% pt move one month will be cancelled out soon after by a 0.1% pt move in the opposite direction.</p> <p>But in the months before we hit a recession, the move is up, and up fast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly change in unemployment rate prior to a recession\">  <iframe title=\"Monthly change in unemployment rate prior to a recession\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RLHsI/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This is again why relying on GDP to decide if we are in a recession is silly \u2013 not only does it miss out on the important aspects of the economy, it comes too late for policy maker to do anything about it.</p> <p>The good news is the current \u201cSahm rule\u201d measure of recession is just 0.22% pts, and it has improved recently.</p> <p>The bad news is things can change very quickly.

But this talk of a recession also brought with it a bit of a debate over just how we should calculate it. As I noted on Tuesday, the standard (and misnamed) \u201ctechnical\u201d recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. That measure is not only rather simplistic, it is also a pretty high bar to reach. Such a measure for example allows us to boast that we have not had a recession since the early 1990s despite pretty good evidence that we did have a small recession during the GFC. We could perhaps use per capita GDP growth, as that would remove the impact of population growth. But such a measure would have had us in a recession in 2006, when we were decidedly not, and even during the GFC we did not have two consecutive periods of negative GDP per capita growth, and yet we did last year. We could measure the growth of the private sector. This would remove government spending that might artificially keep GDP growing. Again, such a measure is useful, but does not produce two quarters of consecutive negative growth during the GFC (although there were three out of five such quarters), while last year there were two such consecutive quarters. That is a good way of showing that last year the economy was performing poorly; however, any measure that suggests last year was a recession, but the GFC was not, is a failure. We could also look at the private domestic economy \u2013 in effect GDP minus government spending and exports \u2013 to give us private sector \u201cgross national expenditure\u201d. This measure suggests we had a recession in 2001, 2009, 2014 and have also been in one since the end of 2018. That again highlights just how poorly the economy is currently performing, but perhaps suffers from the bar of a \u201crecession\u201d being set too low. It also means we are discounting exports which is not particularly useful when wishing to examine the entire economy. All these measures also suffer from a time lag. We will only find out the GDP growth of the March quarter on 3 June, and for the following quarter on 2 September. Thus we might be in a recession now, but will only have it confirmed in seven months time. The Grattan Institute\u2019s Matt Cowgill and a number of other commenters on Twitter suggested using a measure devised by an economist from the US Federal Reserve, Claudia Sahm. Her measure focuses purely on unemployment. This has the benefit of looking at the measure we most care about (do we give a damn if GDP shrinks, but unemployment doesn\u2019t rise?), and because unemployment figures come out each month, it is faster than GDP. She suggests comparing a rolling three month average of the unemployment rate with the lowest rate in the past 12 months. She argues when this goes above 0.5% pts, we are in a recession. Therefore, if the current three month average of the unemployment rate is 5.6%, and at some point in the past 12 months the rate was 5%, that would mean a gap of 0.6% pts and indicate a recession. This measure is similar to my ready guide of looking at the 12 months change in the unemployment rate. Indeed both measures have very similar \u201cpeaks\u201d, and both would indicate that we had recessions in 2001, during the GFC, and also went close to one from 2013-2015. You could quibble and argue a 0.5% pt change is too small for a recession, but the reality is most times when the gap goes above 0.5% pt, it then rises to 1% pt. We could also measure instead underutilisation and suggest a 1% pt increase is a recession. In that case we also did have a recession in 2014 and 2015. And what the Sahm measure also highlights is that when a recession occurs, it occurs quickly. On average the unemployment rate does not move at all each month \u2013 a 0.1% pt move one month will be cancelled out soon after by a 0.1% pt move in the opposite direction. But in the months before we hit a recession, the move is up, and up fast. This is again why relying on GDP to decide if we are in a recession is silly \u2013 not only does it miss out on the important aspects of the economy, it comes too late for policy maker to do anything about it. The good news is the current \u201cSahm rule\u201d measure of recession is just 0.22% pts, and it has improved recently. The bad news is things can change very quickly. This is why rather than waiting for the GDP to tell us if the bushfires and coronavirus have put us into a recession we, the government and the RBA should be watching the unemployment rate. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "As the Morrison government seeks support to expand the cashless debit card to the Northern Territory, it has also rebooted calls for a national expansion of the card. While the government has previously focused on the card as a policy to reduce what it calls \u201cwelfare-fuelled alcohol, gambling and drug misuse\u201d, now it is also arguing that it is a \u201cbroad financial and budgeting tool\u201d. Those benefits are fiercely contested by welfare groups and Indigenous organisations, which say the card is discriminatory and not backed by adequate evidence. So how does it work? The card is operated by Indue and is currently being trialled in Ceduna in South Australia, East Kimberley in Western Australia, the Goldfields in WA and Hervey Bay in Queensland. It quarantines 80% of a person\u2019s income support payments. The money on the card cannot be used to withdraw cash from automatic teller machines or Eftpos terminals, or to buy alcohol, tobacco or gambling products. The rest is paid into their bank account as cash. For example, Bundaberg resident Jodie McNally, 33, is on Newstart and is unable to work full-time due to a range of chronic illnesses. She told Guardian Australia she receives $532 a fortnight on the card and $133 that she can access in cash. \u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely terrible from the very start,\u201d she said. What is the government doing? The Morrison government is currently trying to pass its planned expansion of the cashless debit card to the NT. Welfare recipients in the NT are already on the far-more restrictive Basics card, which was introduced under the Intervention 12 years ago and quarantines 50% of their income. This split will stay in place for NT cardholders. At the same time, the social services minister, Anne Ruston, is spruiking what she says are the card\u2019s benefits as part of what the government hopes might one day be a national rollout. \u201cThis card, because of technology, is now able to provide a broad financial and budgeting tool assistance to people,\u201d she said recently. The government has commissioned an independent report after an earlier study that found positive impacts was heavily criticised by an audit. It is yet to release the latest report. What are the restrictions? Obviously you can\u2019t use the card in the cash economy \u2013 that is anywhere where there are no Eftpos machines. Examples often cited by critics include garage sales, fetes and roadside market stalls where cardholders say they could previously buy fruit and vegetables at cheaper prices. The Australian Council of Social Service chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said the card made it \u201charder for people to buy from op-shops, buy second-hand furniture, rent in shared accommodation or to provide children with money for school activities\u201d. McNally said the card had caused her issues renting in emergency accommodation and inhibited her ability to buy second-hand goods. For example, she said she had to borrow cash from a relative to buy parts to fix her car from a wrecker that only accepted cash. \u201cWhat kind of a drug, or gambling or alcohol is that,\u201d she said. Some online retailers and eBay are also banned. To purchase second-hand products from Facebook Marketplace, McNally said she was required to take a screenshot of the advertisement in question and make an application to Indue. \u201cThen you take these forms to Indue and say, \u201cCan I please buy this item? It can be four days until they decide whether you can buy it or not,\u201d said McNally, who joined a protest against the card in Canberra this week. In general, Indue currently blocks merchants rather than products. It provides a list of banned merchants, most of which are pubs and bars in the trial areas. The government says it is automatically accepted at about 900,000 businesses across the country. It notes that the card is also available at major retailers where alcohol is sold, such as Woolworths, Coles and Australia Post. But cardholders have complained about having their cards declined at retailers that do not primarily sell these banned goods. One woman told of her humiliation of being denied at Just Jeans. A Senate inquiry has heard claims that one mother who could not buy a children\u2019s book from a bookstore was told her card was blocked because the shop also sold books on distilling alcohol. In another alleged case, a nursing student on placement was unable to buy a stethoscope and university books from the Medshop. The submission claimed that Indue staff said she could not buy those things as she may be trying to buy hand sanitisers to drink. How exactly are the banks involved? The government has established a working group that includes the big four banks and some other financial institutions to make this happen. Coles and Woolworths have also provided advice to the government. Asked by Guardian Australia about their work on the card, the big banks, Woolworths and Coles said they were only providing advice upon request from the government. None would say they supported the card. They are not being paid for their advice, they said. The banks have been asked to provide technical advice on product-level blocking, meaning that items such as alcohol, gambling and cash withdrawals could be blocked when a transaction was made. In cases where a prohibited product is not sought, the card would work like any other, and could be used anywhere that Eftpos is available. While this already occurs at some major retailers, the aim is to extend this to small businesses. Goldie said if they signed up to the \u201cpoliticised and unproven cashless debit card [it] would do little to restore public confidence in the major banks\u201d. \u201cThe banks need to rule out working with the government on this stigmatising, impractical scheme, which would be a colossal waste of public funds,\u201d she said.",

On Wednesday the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission confirmed it will no longer hold further hearings as part of the inquiry, which last year uncovered evidence of the widespread misuse of strip search powers by police in NSW. The LECC had been due to hold more public hearings in either late January or February into the psychological impacts of strip searching on minors, but in a brief statement a spokeswoman for the LECC said it now had \u201cno intention to call further evidence at this stage\u201d. While the report will still be published its release date is \u201cyet to be determined\u201d, she said. The decision to cut the inquiry short comes just a month after the NSW government announced it would not renew the term of its chief commissioner, Michael Adams, which prompted accusations his removal was a \u201ccynical\u201d attempt to cut the inquiry short. The public hearings \u2013 and wider concerns about the strip searching of minors \u2013 had caused significant embarrassment for the NSW government and police force, and on Wednesday NSW Labor\u2019s shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, questioned why the hearings had been cancelled after Adams\u2019 removal. \u201cIf the strip search inquiry has been prematurely shut down because the government wouldn\u2019t extend the term of the chief commissioner, then the government stands condemned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is entirely their fault.

Following his removal in December, a report in The Australian said the government had not renewed Adams\u2019 contract after a confidential inquiry found the agency was \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and raised concerns about leadership at the highest levels.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s nothing so compelling as watching things go wrong. This is especially true in a world as serious and self-important as broadcast news. It\u2019s the moment where we peel back the facade, the limelight fades and suddenly the slick and confident hosts become as scared and human as the rest of us.</p> <p>The Australian news blooper is a unique beast in itself. Internationally, bloopers are mostly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cZr8hWy5sI\">slips of the tongue</a> or <a href=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/BSlT06uWiOeyQrmZq1cSb44HyUD-YEgmCNhUtf5R73E.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b476ae2ac57857327e08196ce57c1772e8766191\">unintentionally funny graphics</a>. A small slip in a ruthlessly professional operation. An Australian blooper, on the other hand, is closer to the kind of fiasco you\u2019d usually associate with a school theatre production where the backdrops crash to the ground and Peter Pan is left dangling helplessly forever. Indeed, sometimes this is <a href=\"https://tvtonight.com.au/2017/05/studio-10-audience-members-taken-to-hospital-after-injury.html\">much more literal</a> than you\u2019d think.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to define what counts as a blooper. Former opposition leader Tony Abbott\u2019s central processing unit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OxBjDHrEZg\">melting during a live interview</a>, leaving him gawping like a goldfish, was unbelievably weird but it\u2019s not a blooper.</p> <p>Equally, morning sewerage delivery service Sunrise\u2019s baffling choice to<strong> </strong>force a clearly uncomfortable Kristin Davis into playing out their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6XuYA6YtJE\">Sex and the City fan fiction</a> and the acid trip that was the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDYla-gjgRs\">Reject the Recession dancers</a> had, remarkably, been planned. Granted, those plans were made by people who work in the world of breakfast television which is as damaging to the mind as taking an anvil to the skull \u2013 but nevertheless, they aren\u2019t bloopers.</p> <p>As for what does count as a blooper? To steal a quote from former supreme court justice Potter Stewart talking about pornography: \u201cI know it when I see it.\u201d And these are the ones that you simple can\u2019t unsee.</p> <h2><strong>Category: distressingly human bloopers</strong></h2> <p>The best bloopers are the ones that show consummate professional newsreaders as almost human.</p> <p>Whether they\u2019re caught out not paying attention:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6xkSOTsv-E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j6xkSOTsv-E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Locked in a petty argument:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRAdjpbcuJY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CRAdjpbcuJY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Being casually destroyed in the usually bland banter:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpuEHdLPAo4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rpuEHdLPAo4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Or even revealing a powerful thirst when they didn\u2019t realise the camera is rolling:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISnGo-nt-jo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ISnGo-nt-jo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>Category winner</strong></h2> <p>The most painfully human moment of all.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s nothing so compelling as watching things go wrong. This is especially true in a world as serious and self-important as broadcast news. It\u2019s the moment where we peel back the facade, the limelight fades and suddenly the slick and confident hosts become as scared and human as the rest of us. The Australian news blooper is a unique beast in itself. Internationally, bloopers are mostly slips of the tongue or unintentionally funny graphics. A small slip in a ruthlessly professional operation. An Australian blooper, on the other hand, is closer to the kind of fiasco you\u2019d usually associate with a school theatre production where the backdrops crash to the ground and Peter Pan is left dangling helplessly forever. Indeed, sometimes this is much more literal than you\u2019d think. It\u2019s important to define what counts as a blooper. Former opposition leader Tony Abbott\u2019s central processing unit melting during a live interview, leaving him gawping like a goldfish, was unbelievably weird but it\u2019s not a blooper. Equally, morning sewerage delivery service Sunrise\u2019s baffling choice to force a clearly uncomfortable Kristin Davis into playing out their Sex and the City fan fiction and the acid trip that was the Reject the Recession dancers had, remarkably, been planned. Granted, those plans were made by people who work in the world of breakfast television which is as damaging to the mind as taking an anvil to the skull \u2013 but nevertheless, they aren\u2019t bloopers. As for what does count as a blooper? To steal a quote from former supreme court justice Potter Stewart talking about pornography: \u201cI know it when I see it.\u201d And these are the ones that you simple can\u2019t unsee. Category: distressingly human bloopers The best bloopers are the ones that show consummate professional newsreaders as almost human. Whether they\u2019re caught out not paying attention: Locked in a petty argument: Being casually destroyed in the usually bland banter: Or even revealing a powerful thirst when they didn\u2019t realise the camera is rolling: Category winner The most painfully human moment of all. This disaster. Category: torturing the weather guy bloopers A great tradition of breakfast television is attempting to liven up literally talking about the weather by putting the presenter in mortal peril. Sunrise had a young Grant Denyer pass out in a stunt plane: The Today Show\u2019s Stevie Jacobs was bitten on the butt by a pelican: Why do this? Simply put, when left to their own devices, presenters will break a child\u2019s toy in front of them. They can\u2019t be trusted: Category winner: The perfect scream emitted by Stevie Jacobs when he was attacked by a different bird. Category: specifically bird-related bloopers For years now, Australian news has been openly at war with all birds. It\u2019s common enough that it is deserving of its own category. Birds have harassed reporters trying to present live crosses: And revealed that Channel Nine legend Peter Hitchener is actually the size of a potato chip: But the reporters are far from innocent, particularly when they hook and reel in a duck on live television: Category winner: Come on. It\u2019s Stevie Jacobs being scared by the chicken again. You cannot see it enough. Category: tabloid journalism getting what it deserves In a world of neighbours from hell, dodgy plumbers and men who bark like dogs, it\u2019s hard to know what actually counts as a blooper on tabloid news: But if I had to guess, I\u2019d say mistakenly announcing the Queen stepping down in 2017 would count: Also, having the cameras themselves turn against you would, too: Category winner: Let\u2019s not overthink this.

      "bodyText": "The European parliament has insisted it has no plans to introduce facial recognition technology after a leaked internal memo discussing its use in security provoked an outcry. A page on the European parliament\u2019s intranet, seen by the Guardian, suggested that facial recognition could be used \u201cin the context of biometric-based security and services to members [MEPs]\u201d. Titled \u201cartificial intelligence for better services\u201d, the page discussed how such technologies, including facial recognition and AI-assisted translation, would have \u201cconsequences on working methods, processes, staff profiles and the contracting of services\u201d. The page on the parliament\u2019s 2019-21 \u201cdigital transformation programme\u201d was removed on Wednesday after a prominent MEP and staff unions questioned the potential use of facial recognition in the parliament. A spokesperson for the parliament said: \u201cThere is no project of facial recognition in the European parliament,\u201d adding that it was \u201cnot foreseen at any level\u201d. The incident is an embarrassment for the parliament, coming shortly before the EU executive is expected to announce a temporary ban on the use of facial recognition technology in public places. The European commission is expected to announce the ban this month, covering the use of the technology in stations, stadiums and shopping centres and lasting three to five years, to allow regulators time to assess the impact of the fast-developing technology. The Dutch Liberal MEP Sophia in \u2019t Veld, who sits on the European parliament\u2019s civil liberties committee, wrote to the parliament\u2019s top official, Klaus Welle, to question how members and their assistants could \u201cbenefit\u201d from \u201cbiometric-based security and services\u201d, picking up wording used on the parliament\u2019s intranet site. She also sought information on costs, impact studies and whether such plans would be in line with the EU\u2019s data protection regulations. An internal staff union voiced a complaint in an email sent to all 705 MEPs and many of the parliament\u2019s 7,500 officials. \u201cMs In \u2019t Veld, we share your concerns about face recognition in parliament,\u201d said the email from the SGPOE union, which is currently taking part in an internal election. \u201cWhy not put staff recognition before face recognition?\u201d The page was removed shortly after the complaints emerged. A spokesperson said the complaint referred to \u201can old and outdated draft version\u201d of \u201can exploratory project\u201d that had been \u201cmisplaced on the intranet of the EP\u201d. \u201cOne exploratory project of the EP administration is to study and understand the potentials and threats of AI applied to parliamentary and administrative activities of the institution,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis old draft mentioned facial recognition as a possible field of study, nothing more. \u201cData protection is and remains a clear priority of the European parliament and its administration.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I have many Welsh-speaking friends who were annoyed by a throwaway remark in this publication. A fellow columnist wrote that something they were doing was as pointless as \u201ceating cottage cheese or learning Welsh\u201d. I happen to be very keen on both activities, but I am entirely sure they meant no harm or disrespect. In fact, depending on how you define pointless they have \u2026 well, a point.</p> <p>If the number of people in the world who speak a particular language is your measure, it\u2019s a fair point. If the number of people who speak that language, but not English, is your measure, then you have a fair point, too. I have held both of these opinions for most of my life. Proud as I am of my rather poor Croatian, I am ashamed to say I often wondered if French, Spanish or Mandarin might have had more point to them.</p> <p>But now I finally get the point of learning a language for its own sake, and that has come through learning Welsh, from scratch, in a short time. I do very few things mindfully, but you cannot learn a language intensively without being completely absorbed in the moment, and I have found the whole process incredibly soothing. Walking around, sitting in cafes, on trains, buses or whatever, listening to my app, muttering to myself in poor Welsh, all the other troubling thoughts that are stinking out my mind vanish.</p> <p>And then there is the actual communication bit, which almost came to seem like an added bonus rather than the point of the exercise. I have been friends with a Welsh speaker, the football journalist Bryn Law, for more than 30 years now. The other evening, we briefly crossed paths in a London pub. I said something to him in Welsh, he replied in Welsh, and then I actually said something back. And there the exchange ended, but in some small way we were both exhilarated. It was really something: pointless, it definitely wasn\u2019t. As soon as you formulate any sentence in a newly acquired language, I am sure you start seeing the world from a new angle, through a new prism.</p> <p>And why do we English apparently feel we can mock the Welsh language with impunity? Is it because we think it is pitiably marginal, or because we see it thriving and, for some unknown reason, are threatened by that? As Bryn fulminated (in English): \u201cThe test is to swap Irish for Welsh. Would anyone dare say it\u2019s pointless to learn Irish?\u201d And this, undoubtedly, is a fair point.</p> <p>That said, I am in Australia just now, and sit writing this on Sydney\u2019s Manly ferry.

      "bodyText": "I have many Welsh-speaking friends who were annoyed by a throwaway remark in this publication. A fellow columnist wrote that something they were doing was as pointless as \u201ceating cottage cheese or learning Welsh\u201d. I happen to be very keen on both activities, but I am entirely sure they meant no harm or disrespect. In fact, depending on how you define pointless they have \u2026 well, a point. If the number of people in the world who speak a particular language is your measure, it\u2019s a fair point. If the number of people who speak that language, but not English, is your measure, then you have a fair point, too. I have held both of these opinions for most of my life. Proud as I am of my rather poor Croatian, I am ashamed to say I often wondered if French, Spanish or Mandarin might have had more point to them. But now I finally get the point of learning a language for its own sake, and that has come through learning Welsh, from scratch, in a short time. I do very few things mindfully, but you cannot learn a language intensively without being completely absorbed in the moment, and I have found the whole process incredibly soothing. Walking around, sitting in cafes, on trains, buses or whatever, listening to my app, muttering to myself in poor Welsh, all the other troubling thoughts that are stinking out my mind vanish. And then there is the actual communication bit, which almost came to seem like an added bonus rather than the point of the exercise. I have been friends with a Welsh speaker, the football journalist Bryn Law, for more than 30 years now. The other evening, we briefly crossed paths in a London pub. I said something to him in Welsh, he replied in Welsh, and then I actually said something back. And there the exchange ended, but in some small way we were both exhilarated. It was really something: pointless, it definitely wasn\u2019t. As soon as you formulate any sentence in a newly acquired language, I am sure you start seeing the world from a new angle, through a new prism. And why do we English apparently feel we can mock the Welsh language with impunity? Is it because we think it is pitiably marginal, or because we see it thriving and, for some unknown reason, are threatened by that? As Bryn fulminated (in English): \u201cThe test is to swap Irish for Welsh. Would anyone dare say it\u2019s pointless to learn Irish?\u201d And this, undoubtedly, is a fair point. That said, I am in Australia just now, and sit writing this on Sydney\u2019s Manly ferry. The young man next to me who has just said hello turns out to be a first-language Welsh-speaker from Cardiff called Tomos. I can\u2019t tell you what he is doing here because I asked him in Welsh and he replied in Welsh and I didn\u2019t quite understand what he said.

      "bodyText": "A major review of failures in the Scottish care system has called for it to be scrapped and replaced by a new unified service. The independent care review, set up by Nicola Sturgeon in 2017, estimates that the \u201cfractured and bureaucratic\u201d system operating in Scotland costs the country more than \u00a32.7bn a year. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not a system,\u201d said Fiona Duncan, the review\u2019s chair. \u201cIt\u2019s lots of different bureaucracies and rules that all operate alongside each other and bump into one another.\u201d The review called for a new unified children\u2019s care service and strategy, based around a 10-year plan written by all the services and agencies involved in the current care system, which need to be properly funded by Sturgeon\u2019s government. Sturgeon told MSPs on Wednesday afternoon that the review was one of the most important during her tenure as first minister. Scotland had let too many care-experienced children down, she said, often damaging lives. With opposition parties promising support in implementing its recommendations as quickly as possible, she said the reformed system \u201cshould have love and nurture at its heart. [The] priority must be the provision not of a series of placements and arrangements driven by the needs of bureaucracy, but one of stable, safe and loving lives.\u201d In what is thought to be most forensic analysis ever undertaken, the review said \u00a3942m was spent each year by councils and agencies on the formal care system, including fostering, adoption, secure care and the youth justice system. There are about 15,000 children currently in the Scottish care system. Another \u00a3198m is spent on other public services linked to those services, including mental health provision. In addition, the review estimates a further \u00a3875m is spent on fixing the system\u2019s mistakes and failings, leading to a total cost to the public sector of over \u00a32bn. The review\u2019s analysts said nearly all that spending can be attributed to devolved services overseen the Scottish government. Its overall budget is just over \u00a330bn a year, implying that nearly 7% of its budget goes on supporting care-experienced children and adults. Drawing on analysis and studies from across the UK, they calculated that another \u00a3732m in taxes and national insurance payments was lost because care-experienced adults have significantly lower incomes, adding to the system\u2019s overall costs. The review, which included 5,500 interviews with care-experienced people and those who worked or lived with them, said the care-experienced were two-and-a-half times more likely to be excluded from school and almost twice as likely to use drugs moderately. Children living in the poorest 10% of neighbourhoods were 20 times more likely to be taken into care than those in the wealthiest 10%; care-experienced people were twice as likely to have no educational qualifications and twice as likely to experience homelessness. On average, their incomes are three-quarters that of non-care-experienced workers and they are more than three times as likely not to have had a full-time job by the age of 26. \u201cThey\u2019re over-represented in places where they shouldn\u2019t be over-represented, like homelessness and justice, and they under-represented in places where they should have the same opportunities as everyone else, like education,\u201d Duncan said, as she launched the review\u2019s conclusions. Across nearly 80 recommendations, it called for children and young people to have far greater say in their care; far greater investment on building life-long relationships and a heavier focus on keeping families intact. \u201cThere\u2019s a legislative labyrinth which pushes people around a system that actually isn\u2019t enabling,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an enabling legislative environment in Scotland for us to do the right thing for children and families.\u201d The care system \u201chas to provide safe, therapeutic and loving environments for children\u201d, she added. \u201cIt has to, as far as possible, put children in family settings where they can grow up and thrive and flourish.\u201d John Carnochan, the former police officer who helped set up Strathclyde police\u2019s violence reduction unit, said about 50% of inmates in Barlinnie prison in Glasgow were care-experienced. \u201cThe evidence is now so compelling that if we don\u2019t invest in early years, supporting families, we will continue to spend more in their later lives, and throughout their lives,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "More than half a million people have been displaced in Syria\u2019s last rebel stronghold by a deadly regime offensive that has led Turkey to intervene in the fighting and has raised tensions between Damascus, Ankara and Moscow. Weeks of intensive aerial bombardment by the forces of Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies and a bruising ground offensive have emptied entire towns in north-west Idlib province and sent huge numbers of civilians fleeing north towards the Turkish border. On Monday, a rare exchange of fire between newly deployed Turkish troops and Assad\u2019s forces killed eight Turkish military personnel and at least 13 Syrian troops, the most significant clash between the two sides in the nine-year-old conflict. On Wednesday, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said if Syrian government forces did not pull back to an earlier ceasefire line by the end of the month, Turkey would take further military action. Erdo\u011fan said he had reiterated the ultimatum to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Assad\u2019s main backer, during a late-night phone call on Tuesday. The recent violence has tested the already brittle relationship between Ankara and Moscow, the key foreign brokers of the conflict. \u201cThis is a new era in Syria. Nothing can remain the same where the Turkish soldier\u2019s blood has been shed,\u201d Erdo\u011fan told politicians from his ruling party. \u201cThe air and ground elements of the Turkish armed forces will freely move in the Idlib region and if needed will launch an operation,\u201d he added. The Turkish president is seeking to shore up a de-escalation agreement for Idlib brokered in 2018 by Moscow and Ankara, which supports some rebel groups in the area. The ceasefire has been routinely broken by both sides, but regime attacks have escalated since Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian affiliate, seized control of the area last year. A full-scale air and ground offensive began in December. The violence has put Idlib\u2019s population of 3 million at risk of what aid agencies say could be Syria\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis yet. Turkey, already home to around 4 million refugees, is unwilling to open its border to more. \u201cSince 1 December, some 520,000 people have been displaced from their homes, the vast majority \u2013 80% \u2013 of them women and children,\u201d said David Swanson, a spokesperson for the United Nation\u2019s humanitarian coordination office, OCHA. The exodus, coinciding with a biting winter, is one of the largest since the start of the conflict in 2011, since when more than half of Syria\u2019s pre-war population of 20 million have been displaced from their homes, sometimes several times. Mohammad Bahjat, 34, said he and his family had escaped bombardment for a third time in days. \u201cWe fled in the middle of the night and have no idea where to go,\u201d he told Agence France-Presse, sitting in the front of a pickup truck next to his wife and three small boys. \u201cYou never know when a rocket or shell is going to hit.\u201d The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has called the escalation \u201cextremely worrying\u201d and appealed for a cessation of hostilities. Syrian forces have retaken dozens of villages and some towns, including the former rebel bastion of Maaret al-Numan, and continue to advance, pushing displaced populations ever closer to the Turkish frontier. Syrian soldiers and allied militia groups have seized much ground in the enclave\u2019s south and are also attacking from Aleppo province to the east, taking more than 20 settlements from rebels and jihadists over the past 24 hours, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Syrian state news agency Sana. In the town of Hazano, an AFP correspondent saw dozens of small trucks and vans piled high with belongings crawling along a main road. They advanced bumper to bumper, carrying men, women and children along with blankets, carpets, washing basins and furniture. Almost 300 civilians have been killed since mid-December by bombardment in the Idlib region, according to the Observatory. UN experts said on Tuesday the latest attacks on Idlib could constitute violations of international law. The UN\u2019s independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic cited reports of \u201cattacks on civilian infrastructure, including schools, markets, and medical facilities\u201d in the last two weeks. \u201cThe deliberate and systematic targeting of hospitals follows a pattern already documented by the commission and may amount to war crimes,\u201d it said in a statement.",

      "body": "<p>Federico Fellini\u2019s 1960 masterpiece La Dolce Vita premiered in his native Italy 60 years ago today, eventually trickling into American theaters just as they were getting hospitable to foreign films. Stateside moviegoers in the 60s looked at the latest releases from the big-name masters \u2013 Bergman, Kurosawa, Godard \u2013 as two-hour passports to far-off lands, and the ineffable Italian-ness of Fellini\u2019s cinema played a significant role in its US reception. As world-weary gossip columnist Marcello Rubini, the great Marcello Mastroianni embodied the image of Euro-cool, resplendent in his jet-black sunglasses and slickly tailored suits. The film\u2019s <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b0/ae/4b/b0ae4b2df8430fd6fb1b6a39c88b24db.jpg\">rear-projection driving scenes</a> are, simply put, the greatest in the history of the medium; Americans were instantly smitten with Marcello\u2019s sporty little hot rod, his disaffected scowl, and the seductive artifice of the filmed nighttime splayed across the background.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/02/all-federico-fellinis-films-ranked\">All Federico Fellini's films \u2013 ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With over a half-century of perspective, it makes perfect sense that that exotic quality would\u2019ve been a major draw for domestic viewers at the time, considering how alien Marcello\u2019s inner struggle is to the American way of life. He\u2019s tormented by his own conscience, caught between the promise of the sacred (marriage, family, religion) and the temptations of the profane (sex, wealth, luxury). He makes his entry literally straying from the path of Christ, peeling off from the trail of a helicopter transporting a Jesus statue to flirt with some sunbathing beauties who can\u2019t hear him over the chopper. Throughout the film, he navigates a tony milieu of nobles and socialites unfamiliar to and incompatible with American terrain.</p> <p>The passage of time has double-underscored the disconnect between the alluring sleekness of Italian high society and its gauche equivalent in the States, where all money is new money. Fellini dazzled with visions of indulgence so intoxicating that they could conceal the moral rot festering within, but our one-percenters could never quite get the hang of that, and they\u2019ve only gotten worse. At this point, it\u2019s nearly nostalgic to revisit a time when being rich was so damn tasteful.</p> <p>Marcello stumbles through the episodic plot as he stumbles through his own existence, fundamentally passive about his cushy lifestyle. He makes a good salary paying off waiters to let slip which Duke had the snails, and when he gets tired of the mistress that he goes to when he gets tired of his wife, he can cavort about with a buxom Swedish movie star. He has access to the uppermost slice of the upper crust, welcome at their parties and an eligible sexual prospect. His trouble is that he has just enough moral fiber to feel shame about their excesses, and yet not quite enough to commit himself to a more principled path.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a248424dbfbc1afdda7e01e7168ff765eb67e065\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a248424dbfbc1afdda7e01e7168ff765eb67e065/0_223_2723_1633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>La Dolce Vita remains the ravishing, existentially punishing experience that it\u2019s always been because Fellini does a bang-up job selling us on sin. He gives in to his urges to cue up the film\u2019s most famed sequence, the frolic in the Trevi fountain with the Swedish starlet portrayed by Anita Ekberg. At first, he resists her invitations to join her in the water, joining her in a symbolic concession to the flesh. His internal plight is understandable; it would take a titanium will to resist the dizzying mix of rushing water and blonde hair and black fabric. Glamour on that level seeps out of everything, from the chic costuming to the slinky dance moves and the gorgeous interior production design. With corrosion of the soul like this, who needs virtues?</p> <p>For every decade since its original gutting at Fellini\u2019s hands, the ideal of extreme wealth has lost a little bit of its luster. The 1960s were really the final years before the upper class would be subsumed by the soul-deep tackiness that came to define the moneyed elite in the second half of the 20th century. New York\u2019s new It Attraction is the TWA Hotel, a retro-aesthetic novelty harkening back to the Mad Men era, and its paradigm of haute style.

      "bodyText": "Federico Fellini\u2019s 1960 masterpiece La Dolce Vita premiered in his native Italy 60 years ago today, eventually trickling into American theaters just as they were getting hospitable to foreign films. Stateside moviegoers in the 60s looked at the latest releases from the big-name masters \u2013 Bergman, Kurosawa, Godard \u2013 as two-hour passports to far-off lands, and the ineffable Italian-ness of Fellini\u2019s cinema played a significant role in its US reception. As world-weary gossip columnist Marcello Rubini, the great Marcello Mastroianni embodied the image of Euro-cool, resplendent in his jet-black sunglasses and slickly tailored suits. The film\u2019s rear-projection driving scenes are, simply put, the greatest in the history of the medium; Americans were instantly smitten with Marcello\u2019s sporty little hot rod, his disaffected scowl, and the seductive artifice of the filmed nighttime splayed across the background. With over a half-century of perspective, it makes perfect sense that that exotic quality would\u2019ve been a major draw for domestic viewers at the time, considering how alien Marcello\u2019s inner struggle is to the American way of life. He\u2019s tormented by his own conscience, caught between the promise of the sacred (marriage, family, religion) and the temptations of the profane (sex, wealth, luxury). He makes his entry literally straying from the path of Christ, peeling off from the trail of a helicopter transporting a Jesus statue to flirt with some sunbathing beauties who can\u2019t hear him over the chopper. Throughout the film, he navigates a tony milieu of nobles and socialites unfamiliar to and incompatible with American terrain. The passage of time has double-underscored the disconnect between the alluring sleekness of Italian high society and its gauche equivalent in the States, where all money is new money. Fellini dazzled with visions of indulgence so intoxicating that they could conceal the moral rot festering within, but our one-percenters could never quite get the hang of that, and they\u2019ve only gotten worse. At this point, it\u2019s nearly nostalgic to revisit a time when being rich was so damn tasteful. Marcello stumbles through the episodic plot as he stumbles through his own existence, fundamentally passive about his cushy lifestyle. He makes a good salary paying off waiters to let slip which Duke had the snails, and when he gets tired of the mistress that he goes to when he gets tired of his wife, he can cavort about with a buxom Swedish movie star. He has access to the uppermost slice of the upper crust, welcome at their parties and an eligible sexual prospect. His trouble is that he has just enough moral fiber to feel shame about their excesses, and yet not quite enough to commit himself to a more principled path. La Dolce Vita remains the ravishing, existentially punishing experience that it\u2019s always been because Fellini does a bang-up job selling us on sin. He gives in to his urges to cue up the film\u2019s most famed sequence, the frolic in the Trevi fountain with the Swedish starlet portrayed by Anita Ekberg. At first, he resists her invitations to join her in the water, joining her in a symbolic concession to the flesh. His internal plight is understandable; it would take a titanium will to resist the dizzying mix of rushing water and blonde hair and black fabric. Glamour on that level seeps out of everything, from the chic costuming to the slinky dance moves and the gorgeous interior production design. With corrosion of the soul like this, who needs virtues? For every decade since its original gutting at Fellini\u2019s hands, the ideal of extreme wealth has lost a little bit of its luster. The 1960s were really the final years before the upper class would be subsumed by the soul-deep tackiness that came to define the moneyed elite in the second half of the 20th century. New York\u2019s new It Attraction is the TWA Hotel, a retro-aesthetic novelty harkening back to the Mad Men era, and its paradigm of haute style. The 70s and 80s, with the surge of new millionaires minted in the wake of Reaganomics, introduced the image of the over-tanned, proudly garish moneybags as the new standard of class. The purest avatar of that movement now sits in the White House, providing new living proof on a daily basis that money can\u2019t buy you class. (To quote a woman who successfully infiltrated the glitterati, and then went to work dragging the Count-and-Countess set down to her brow level.) Shifting sociological tides have turned capital into a mark of shame, and completely reoriented ideas of status. The emerging generation of young people aspire to more meaningful things than a hefty bank account, and find only distaste in the exclusive and rarefied nature that made Marcello\u2019s subjects a topic of interest. Marcello may have been influential enough to coin the term paparazzi, but the gossip columnist is on his way out as a fixture, supplanted by the everywhere-at-once panopticon of social media. Royalty itself has come to feel pass\u00e9, as the two most outward-facing members of the Crown family step down from their stations. The oldest families in America are no longer objects of envy, but emblems of decline. Marcello\u2019s crisis is one of creative integrity, a concept increasingly remote in the anything-goes scrum between art and commerce that makes up today\u2019s entertainment industry. Marcello toys with the notion of going into literature, and adopting a more intellectually nourishing life to go with it. He eventually ends up as a publicity agent, a devolution that critic Ty Burr described in his book on the essential cinema canon as \u201ca Pilgrim\u2019s Regress\u201d. The anxiety over that personal compromise scans as downright quaint in 2020; our version can\u2019t possibly be Lizzo gladly snapping a selfie with Jeff Bezos in a private box at the Super Bowl, can it? Marcello ends the film unmoored, shouting unheard words, just as in his first appearance.

Once you are finished with your jeans, you send them back and they will be recycled.

It also offer free repairs for life.</p> <h2>How to shop sustainably for jeans</h2> <h2>Start with vintage</h2> <p>Whether you are a denim aficionado or a student on a budget, you can find jeans to suit your budget and your style if you shop secondhand.</p> <h2>Raw is best</h2> <p>Raw denim hasn\u2019t been washed and treated multiple times. This is what denim used to look like before we started to sandblast, bleach and rip it to make it look old. Buy a pair of unwashed jeans and let them age with you.</p> <h2>Avoid stretch</h2> <p>Let leggings be leggings and jeans be jeans. One hundred per cent means the denim in your jeans can eventually be recycled.</p> <h2>Look at the label</h2> <p>If you are buying new, check the fabric composition. You might want to do some research online first. Look for recycled cotton, <a href=\"https://www.global-standard.org/the-standard/general-description.html\">GOTS certified</a> organic cotton, <a href=\"https://bettercotton.org/\">Better Cotton Initiative</a> cotton, or G-Star\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.g-star.com/en_gb/sustainablejeans\">Cradle 2 Cradle Gold certification</a>, which means it is 98% recyclable, 100% organic and uses the minimum amount of water.</p> <h2>Wash cold, if at all</h2> <p>One of the biggest sources of water impact and energy use is during the consumer use phase. Roian Atwood advises a cold wash. Hiut Denim has a <a href=\"https://hiutdenim.co.uk/blogs/story/101833089-the-no-wash-club\">No Wash Club.</a></p> <h2>Repair your jeans</h2> <p>A good pair of jeans can last for decades if you look after them and repair them. Ask your denim brand where you can have your jeans repaired. Levi\u2019s has a number of <a href=\"https://www.levi.com/GB/en_GB/features/tailor-shop\">tailor shops</a> where you can customise or repair jeans. <a href=\"https://www.nudiejeans.com/repair-spots#mobile-repair\">Nudie Jeans</a> offers free repairs for life in their shops or, if you can\u2019t get to one, they will send you a free repair kit. <a href=\"http://:https://hiutdenim.co.uk/\">Hiut Jeans</a> also offer free repairs.</p>",

Hiut Jeans, which has revitalised the denim industry in Cardigan, Wales, makes just 100 pairs of jeans per week. \u201cWe are here to try and make the best jeans we can and not the most jeans we can,\u201d it says. It also offer free repairs for life. How to shop sustainably for jeans Start with vintage Whether you are a denim aficionado or a student on a budget, you can find jeans to suit your budget and your style if you shop secondhand. Raw is best Raw denim hasn\u2019t been washed and treated multiple times. This is what denim used to look like before we started to sandblast, bleach and rip it to make it look old. Buy a pair of unwashed jeans and let them age with you. Avoid stretch Let leggings be leggings and jeans be jeans. One hundred per cent means the denim in your jeans can eventually be recycled. Look at the label If you are buying new, check the fabric composition. You might want to do some research online first. Look for recycled cotton, GOTS certified organic cotton, Better Cotton Initiative cotton, or G-Star\u2019s Cradle 2 Cradle Gold certification, which means it is 98% recyclable, 100% organic and uses the minimum amount of water. Wash cold, if at all One of the biggest sources of water impact and energy use is during the consumer use phase. Roian Atwood advises a cold wash. Hiut Denim has a No Wash Club. Repair your jeans A good pair of jeans can last for decades if you look after them and repair them. Ask your denim brand where you can have your jeans repaired. Levi\u2019s has a number of tailor shops where you can customise or repair jeans. Nudie Jeans offers free repairs for life in their shops or, if you can\u2019t get to one, they will send you a free repair kit. Hiut Jeans also offer free repairs.",

      "bodyText": "It appears that investors think the worst of the coronavirus outbreak is well and truly priced in on stock markets, with a new record high for the tech-focused Nasdaq in the US. Strong US data has also added to a more positive mood, thanks in part to ADP jobs numbers beating expectations spectacularly. IHS Markit\u2019s services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) recorded the strongest expansion in 10 months. A revised reading of 53.4 in January up from 52.8 in Decembe, above the 50 expansion mark. The oil price has surged, initially aided by a report of a coronavirus treatment that was played down by the World Health Organisation. Brent crude futures were up by almost $2 a barrel to $55.8 \u2013 a gain of 3.4% today. The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, saw similar gains. In Europe markets have gained more than 1% in many of the major markets. Germany\u2019s Dax, which is particularly export-sensitive, rose by 1.4%. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has gained 0.8% to reach 7,496 points with under two hours of trading left. The FTSE 250 has gained 0.6%. Thanks for reading today, and join us tomorrow for more economics, business and markets. JJ And it\u2019s a record high for the Nasdaq, even amid a global public health emergency. Investor sentiment was buoyed earlier in the day by a Chinese TV report that an effective treatment had been found. The World Health Organisation quickly played this down, but the gains in stock and oil prices were nevertheless sustained. Confidence was also aided by the ADP jobs number, which suggested that the US private sector added twice as many jobs as expected. The US dollar has now gained 0.5% against the British pound, which fell below $1.30. Confirmed: a strong open in New York. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones both rose by 1%, while the Nasdaq increased by 1.1%. US stock futures are pointing to a strong open on Wall Street. S&amp;P 500 futures suggest a 0.8% bump at the opening bell, while the Dow Jones industrial average will gain about the same. Improved investor sentiment around the effects of the coronavirus (however warranted) appear to be one of the factors explaining the increase, while the ADP jobs numbers have added momentum for market bulls. Notable trade figures from the US: the trade deficit has fallen for the first time in six years in 2019 as the White House\u2019s trade war with China curbed the import bill. The US Commerce Department said on Wednesday the trade deficit fell 1.7% to $616.8bn last year, the first drop since 2013. The news does not quite fit the agenda of Trump, who also wants to make trading partners accept more \u201cmade in the USA\u201d products, theoretically boosting the regions with a high concentration of manufacturing jobs that backed him in 2016. Tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods imports from China (and the retaliation) appeared to weigh on trade. From Reuters: Goods imports tumbled 1.7% last year, with exports decreasing 1.3%, showing that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda decreased the flow of goods. An interesting reading from the US ADP private payrolls number \u2013 it\u2019s an absolute blowout, the highest since 2015. The ADP number is often seen as a sneak preview of the crucial non-farm payrolls, the key US labour market indicator. That\u2019s due on Friday. ADP reported that the US private sector added 291,000 jobs in January \u2013 almost double the 156,000 expected by economists, and a big increase from the revised reading of 199,000 in December. Stock futures and the US dollar have both risen in the aftermath of the data. Music streaming service Spotify has reported that it added a record number of subscribers at the end of 2019, but it made an operating loss as it spent on promotions. The number of paying users rose by 11m in the final quarter of 2019 thanks to free trials. At the end of 2019 Spotify\u2019s number of monthly active users, including free users, had grown to 271 million, a 31% increase from a year earlier 2020 will be an \u201cinvestment year\u201d, Spotify said. *This post has been corrected: Spotify made an operating loss during the last quarter of 2019, not a loss. Mike Lynch, the man once hailed as Britain\u2019s Bill Gates, has submitted himself for arrest as he prepares to fight extradition to the US, where he faces fraud charges. Lynch has been involved in a long-running civil trial in the UK, where he has been accused of fraudulently inflating the value of Autonomy, the tech firm he founded and sold to Hewlett-Packard in 2011. Lynch denied all of the allegations. Representatives for the British businessman said the arrest is a formality, required as part of the extradition process initiated by the US Department of Justice. Lynch is contesting the extradition. In a statement Lynch\u2019s lawyers, Chris Morvillo and Reid Weingarten, said: Since HP first raised these allegations more than seven years ago, Dr Lynch has steadfastly denied them and has worked hard to properly respond and set the record straight. The UK SFO previously investigated and did not pursue the allegations. Dr Lynch has now answered HP\u2019s claims in the appropriate forum, the High Court in London, where he attended court every day of the 10-month trial. During that trial, Dr Lynch testified about all of these allegations for more than 20 days. He has not hidden, nor has he shied away from defending his conduct. Having patiently and diligently defended the case in England for several years, he awaits the civil trial judgment. The US DOJ should not have commenced extradition proceedings prior to the judgment of the English High Court. Dr Lynch vigorously rejects all the allegations against him and is determined to continue to fight these charges. Just after midday the FTSE has retreated slightly, for a gain of 0.6%. Sterling is up by 0.2% against the US dollar at $1.3056, and by 0.4% against the euro at \u20ac1.1844. Brent crude oil futures prices have also fallen back from the day\u2019s highs, but are still up by 2.3% today. Here\u2019s some lunchtime reading (for GMT readers at least): FTSE 100 firms including Tui, British Airways owner IAG and the London Stock Exchange Group have been accused of dragging their feet on diversity targets ahead of a looming 2021 deadline. Amazon employees under pressure to work faster have called on retail giant to improve conditions \u2013 and take their complaints seriously. Boris Johnson should consider setting targets to level up the UK\u2019s weakest regions to tackle widespread inequality, said a Bank of England official. An aside in the still extraordinary tale of Tesla in the last few days: even one of the investors responsible for the \u201cBig Short\u201d has had his fingers burned. Steve Eisman made a big bet against the housing sector before the financial crisis, earning him a portrayal by Steve Carell in the (excellent) Big Short film. But today he said that he has moved to cover his short (closing at least part of the position) in an interview with Bloomberg TV. There\u2019s only so far short sellers can hold on when shares surge, he acknowledged. Short sellers\u2019 potential losses are theoretically infinite as they must buy back the shares they have borrowed and sold on, even if the price has risen exponentially. In Tesla\u2019s case that has happened, with prices doubling in the course of 2020. Well let\u2019s see what the market reaction is to this: a World Health Organisation spokesman says there is no known treatment for coronavirus. The spokesman in Geneva said, via Reuters: \u201cThere are no known effective therapeutics.\u201d Markets have responded with extraordinary vigour to an unconfirmed report from Chinese television that an effective treatment had been found. So far oil prices and stock markets have sustained those gains. Expectations of larger central bank stimulus efforts may also have played into the gains, which came after prices dipped at the start of London\u2019s trading day. Vodafone is to remove Huawei equipment from the sensitive, core parts of its mobile networks across Europe at a cost of \u20ac200m (\u00a3169m) over the next five years. The group, which has 111 million customers across Europe, has taken the decision after the UK government\u2019s move last week to limit the use of Huawei equipment in the country\u2019s 5G network, writes the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney. Read the full story here: A quick stock market stock take: the FTSE 100 is up by 0.76%, flirting with the 7,500 point mark after the unconfirmed report of a coronavirus treatment buoyed investor sentiment. The Euro Stoxx 600 index has gained 1%, with Germany\u2019s export-sensitive Dax up by 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac 40 up by 0.9%. Oil prices have held on to most of their gains, with Brent crude futures still up by 2.8%. Some further reading on the implications of the coronavirus outbreak for you is here: And you can follow all the latest news on the outbreak more generally here: Protestors have blocked access to BP\u2019s head office in London to mark the first day for its new chief executive, Bernard Looney. More than 100 Greenpeace activists attempted to place 500 solar panels in front of the building in St James\u2019 Square, blocking the entrances with oil barrels, the group said in a statement. Police reportedly arrested nine activist, Reuters reported. Several activists chained themselves to the oil barrels. BP responded, via Reuters: Looney, who was visiting staff in Germany on Wednesday, shares the \u201cdeep concerns\u201d of the climate protesters, BP said in a statement. He will set out his vision for BP\u2019s response to the low carbon energy transition in a speech next week. BP said Looney \u201chopes that what he has to say then will give people a sense that we get it and are very serious about working to address the problem.\u201d Across the Channel, PMI readings suggest that the Eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected thanks to services \u2013 despite really weak retail sales. The PMI composite reading for the Eurozone was also stronger than flash data, at 51.3 points in January versus an earlier 50.9 expansion, IHS Markit said. (50 is the expansion mark.) Bert Colijn, senior Eurozone economist at ING, said: The final services PMI in January were better than expected. This indicates that recent service sector activity has been decent, despite the sharp decline in retail sales in December. December retail sales fell by 1.6%, bringing it down to its lowest reading since February 2019. Some reactions on the services PMI data. Pantheon Macroeconomics sugggests that the 16-month-high means the Bank of England\u2019s growth forecasts for the first quarter may be too low. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy, said that it was \u201canother encouraging sign that the post-election recovery in the economy is gathering momentum\u201d. He added It\u2019s clear responses received later in the month were much stronger than those at the start, consistent with the idea that the recovery is strengthening. Simon French, chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, injects a note of caution about volatility in the data, but adds that it seems there was an election bounce: Breaking off momentarily from coronavirus and PMI, new car sales in the UK fell by 7.3% in the first month of 2020, according to figures published today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The lobby group blamed continued confusion surrounding diesel and clean air zones and ongoing weak consumer and business confidence for the declines. The industry is under serious pressure from the government\u2019s plans to bring forward a ban on all hybrid and other fossil fuelled cars to 2035. Some 149,279 vehicles left showrooms in January, with diesel sales down by more than a third and petrol sales also falling by a tenth. However, the rapid rise of battery electric sales continued, with sales tripling year-on-year. Sterling has risen against the euro and the US dollar in the wake of the services PMI reading. Against the euro the pound is up by 0.4% for the day at \u20ac1.1853, while it gained 0.25% against the US dollar to reach $1.3063. Yields on UK government bonds, gilts, rose to the highest in almost two weeks as investor demand for safe-haven debt diminished slightly. The 10-year gilt yield rose by four basis points to 0.606%. The election, and the consequent narrowing of Brexit possibilities, appeared to help UK business and consumer spending, IHS Markit said. Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said: January\u2019s PMI surveys give a clear signal that the UK economy has picked up since the general election, as a diminishing headwind from political uncertainty translated into rising business and consumer spending. Signs of greater willingness to spend and renewed positivity about the domestic economic outlook has helped lift service providers\u2019 growth projections to the highest for just under five years. The strongest reading for the UK services PMI in 16 months came because of increased confidence among businesses and consumers, according to IHS Markit. The reading is consistent with UK GDP rising by approximately 0.2% in the first quarter of 2020, the data company said. Survey respondents noted that the headwind from delayed decision-making had lifted since the general election and helped to deliver a return to business activity growth in January. This was also reflected in a robust improvement in order intakes, with the rate of new business expansion accelerating to its strongest since June 2018. However, the data were compiled before 23 January, when the outlook on the coronavirus outbreak worsened. The British services sector expanded faster than previously thought in January, according to IHS Markit\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index. The final reading for the closely followed index was 53.3 points, representing a stronger expansion than the 52.9 indicated by early data. That oil price reversal is gaining momentum: Brent crude futures prices are up by 3% at the time of writing at $55.60 per barrel \u2013 having started the day just above $54. US stock market futures have gained as well after the unconfirmed reports of an effective treatment from Chinese media. The price of futures tracking the S&amp;P 500 index of major US stocks have risen by 0.55% today, while the equivalent futures for the Dow Jones industrial average point to a gain of 0.7% for the blue-chip index. Oil prices, weighed down by concerns on coronavirus\u2019s impact on demand, have gained a dollar after the unconfirmed Chinese TV reports of a treatment. Brent crude oil futures prices jumped from a low of $54.12 per barrel just after 8am to over $55.1 an hour later. They are now up by 2.2% for the day. Stock markets have staged a rapid reversal in the last few minutes, apparently after a report of an effective treatment for coronavirus. The reports remain unconfirmed. The FTSE 100 is now up by 0.5% at about 7,477 points, having previously been down by 0.3%. The Euro Stoxx 600 index, which measures large companies across Europe, is now up by 0.5% for the day, having previously dipped. Reuters reports that traders have cited a Chinese TV report that a research team at Zhejiang University has found an effective drug to treat people with the new coronavirus. Here\u2019s the FTSE 100 performance: The biggest faller on the FTSE 100 is Imperial Brands, the tobacco maker, which fell by 9% after it warned that profits will be hit because of regulation on vaping products in the US. The company, whose brands include Davidoff, Gauloises and Lambert and Butler, on Wednesday said profits in the first half of the year will fall by 10% and cautioned on full-year earnings because of the ban on some flavours of cartridge-based vapour devices and weaker consumer demand, Reuters reported. Vaping was once hailed as the future for cigarette makers as users turned towards products they deem to be less likely to harm them, but they are suffering a backlash after a spate of deaths and lung injuries associated with their use. Imperial, whose main vaping brand is called Blu, said: Regulatory uncertainty and adverse news flow continues to affect demand in the US and Europe. European markets have dipped mildly at the open, with the FTSE 100 down by 0.3% and the FTSE 250 flat. France\u2019s Cac 40 index has fallen by 0.2%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is down by 0.26% in the first half hour of trading. It came after Asian markets rebounded again, following a delayed reaction on markets when investors returned from an extended lunar new year holiday. Bethel Loh, a macro strategist at forex trading platform ThinkMarkets, said: The truth of the matter is that [coronavirus\u2019s] impact remains significant and unknown, and still demands immediate interest from most affected economies. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The coronavirus outbreak remains the dominant theme across the business world, with supply chains disrupted in a crucial manufacturing region, widespread travel issues, and market volatility as investors try to work out longer-term effects. Airbus today became the latest company to warn of serious disruption. It said that its Tianjin final assembly line facility near Beijing is currently closed, and that travel restrictions inside China were causing logistical challenges. The Tianjin facility manufactures some of the company\u2019s A320 planes, which recently overtook Boeing\u2019s 737 as the bestselling family of aircraft ever. In a statement on Wednesday morning the European manufacturing giant said: Airbus is constantly evaluating the situation and monitoring any potential knock on effects to production and deliveries and will try to mitigate via alternative plans where necessary. Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific Airways has asked all its 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave in coming months as it battles a fall in demand caused by the virus outbreak, the company said on Wednesday. Cruise operator Royal Caribbean yesterday warned that the virus would knock its earnings as it cancelled holidays in China and said that passengers from the region would be denied boarding. And US sportswear retailer Nike warned of a financial impact after it closed about half its own stores in China and cut operating hours at the rest. German rivals Adidas and Puma (founded by brothers) could also come under pressure, analysts warned. However, Asian markets rose on Wednesday, after previously sustaining heavy losses. Analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Craig Nicol said it may be slightly more positive news on the virus epidemiology that has improved market sentiment. The fact that there appears to be a slowing in independent incidents in countries outside of China and a slowing in the rate of transmission in cases outside of Wuhan province appear to be making investors more comfortable for now. It all comes at a time when the Chinese economy appeared to be slowing, as data this morning appeared to illustrate. Growth in China\u2019s services sector slowed for a second month in January, a traditionally busy sales season, hitting a three-month low as companies cut prices and new orders dipped, according to the Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The reading, which is unlikely to have felt the main effects of the outbreak because of the survey\u2019s timing, slowed to 51.8 last month, from 52.5 in December, but was still higher than an 8-month low hit in October, Reuters reported.

      "body": "<p>I cannot think of a more ideal innovation in the Premier League\u2019s consciously uncoupled relationship with football than the winter break. One of my pet theories (there are about 12 of them, covering all human experience) is that football fans detest talking about football. Honestly, anything to get away from it.</p> \n<p>They mainly don\u2019t even want to read about it. Tactics, technique, deep analysis \u2013 these are niche interests and obsessions, in which most people largely feign vaguely respectful interest because they\u2019re regarded as being a traditional but clearly tangential part of the much larger experience. A bit like the gherkin in a Big Mac. Indeed, many discard them entirely. A very small section of people really do care about those things, of course, which is why there is a very small amount of content among the vast tumult of football content to cater to them. But in the main, people would do anything to avoid this stuff.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/the-unpredictables-liverpool-leicester-and-sheffield-united-make-fools-of-us-all\">The unpredictables: Liverpool, Leicester and Sheffield United make fools of us all</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By contrast, they \u2013 indeed, we \u2013 are unable stop talking about what might be termed football-adjacent matters. A huge part of being a football fan in keeping with the times is having well-aired views about things that are not football: people, money, all manner of social media dramas, the antics of a vast firmament of soap opera characters to hate, envy, occasionally even love \u2026 you know the sort of matters. The good thing for the content providers, as we now call the clubs, is those things are happening all week long. It\u2019s not just the odd 90-minutes here and there.</p> \n<p>Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with all that, you understand. But in this context the winter break is a stroke of absolute genius. It is a break from having to pretend to talk about football, because there is no football \u2013 only all the other, more popular football-adjacent stuff. Having said that, there is a small bit of football, it turns out \u2013 but that is far better discussed in terms of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/03/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-fa-cup-replay-shrewsbury-laptop\" title=\"\">who might not have been in the dugout</a> for it, as opposed to the actual football itself.</p> \n<p>I have hugely enjoyed the lengthy and lively coverage of the winter break kick-off on the various breakfast shows. I concede it might have been so vigorously discussed in part because it is a novelty. But my strong suspicion is that it was mainly embraced so enthusiastically because it freed everyone from even the pretence of having to discuss football.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c191f0f4ba6caf84a215ab639295a0f1eba0d3a8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c191f0f4ba6caf84a215ab639295a0f1eba0d3a8/0_148_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r can use his time off working out how to win football games.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Certainly the absence of football has been remorselessly covered in all media outlets in the days and even weeks leading up to its temporary hiatus. You cannot move for sensational headlines seeking to put you inside the action of the lack of action. Even the headlines set my pulse racing. \u201cPremier League Winter Break Explained: What You Need to Know.\u201d \u201cArsenal\u2019s winter break UNCOVERED\u201d. \u201cHow does the Premier League\u2019s Winter Break Work?\u201d Well \u2026 I want to say that it\u2019s a break? Which happens in winter? But from everything I have managed to glean its mysteries would seem slightly more arcane than those of the Iowa caucus.</p> \n<p>Either way, top-flight football increasingly feels like a world in which football is a plot device \u2013 what Hitchcock called a MacGuffin. You need it for the story to happen, and to provoke the characters you care about into behaving in certain consumable ways \u2013 but in and of itself, it is relatively insignificant in the grand scheme. As Hitchcock explained it once: \u201cThe MacGuffin is the thing that the spies are after but the audience don\u2019t care.\u201d Rather like the FA Cup. In advance of Liverpool\u2019s Tuesday night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/04/liverpool-shrewsbury-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">fourth-round replay against Shrewsbury</a> Town, there must have been at least three times as much chat and three times as many articles about J\u00fcrgen Klopp not breaking his winter break to attend it as there were about the game and build-up itself. You could luxuriate in coverage of the row about him not being there, of his pushback against the row, of the technical process via which he might watch the match in absentia and phone in during it, and all the descriptions of how his spirit had permeated the Anfield setup so totally that it would be almost like he was there.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3834e095-2c8c-4d98-8773-896e7a885f7c\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>For Manchester United, meanwhile, the winter break offers a chance to beef up off-pitch output, particularly in concert with their many official partners. Admittedly, the current travails of the club\u2019s official football partner are unfortunate \u2013 but the break will allow a focus on those United plotlines and content items that are doing much better. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/28/fans-attack-home-ed-woodward-manchester-united\" title=\"\">Off-pitch drama</a>, for instance, or sponsor relations.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s all just a slightly different kind of output in the great football-adjacent universe \u2013 like Big Band week on the X Factor, or a camping episode in a popular sitcom. It just means that rather than appearing in content beamed from Old Trafford, this week Fred is appearing in content beamed from the Maldives. Look \u2013 here is an Instagram snap of him shooting off a waterslide! Meanwhile, Victor Lindel\u00f6f is in Morocco! Other dramas?

      "bodyText": "I cannot think of a more ideal innovation in the Premier League\u2019s consciously uncoupled relationship with football than the winter break. One of my pet theories (there are about 12 of them, covering all human experience) is that football fans detest talking about football. Honestly, anything to get away from it. They mainly don\u2019t even want to read about it. Tactics, technique, deep analysis \u2013 these are niche interests and obsessions, in which most people largely feign vaguely respectful interest because they\u2019re regarded as being a traditional but clearly tangential part of the much larger experience. A bit like the gherkin in a Big Mac. Indeed, many discard them entirely. A very small section of people really do care about those things, of course, which is why there is a very small amount of content among the vast tumult of football content to cater to them. But in the main, people would do anything to avoid this stuff. By contrast, they \u2013 indeed, we \u2013 are unable stop talking about what might be termed football-adjacent matters. A huge part of being a football fan in keeping with the times is having well-aired views about things that are not football: people, money, all manner of social media dramas, the antics of a vast firmament of soap opera characters to hate, envy, occasionally even love \u2026 you know the sort of matters. The good thing for the content providers, as we now call the clubs, is those things are happening all week long. It\u2019s not just the odd 90-minutes here and there. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with all that, you understand. But in this context the winter break is a stroke of absolute genius. It is a break from having to pretend to talk about football, because there is no football \u2013 only all the other, more popular football-adjacent stuff. Having said that, there is a small bit of football, it turns out \u2013 but that is far better discussed in terms of who might not have been in the dugout for it, as opposed to the actual football itself. I have hugely enjoyed the lengthy and lively coverage of the winter break kick-off on the various breakfast shows. I concede it might have been so vigorously discussed in part because it is a novelty. But my strong suspicion is that it was mainly embraced so enthusiastically because it freed everyone from even the pretence of having to discuss football. Certainly the absence of football has been remorselessly covered in all media outlets in the days and even weeks leading up to its temporary hiatus. You cannot move for sensational headlines seeking to put you inside the action of the lack of action. Even the headlines set my pulse racing. \u201cPremier League Winter Break Explained: What You Need to Know.\u201d \u201cArsenal\u2019s winter break UNCOVERED\u201d. \u201cHow does the Premier League\u2019s Winter Break Work?\u201d Well \u2026 I want to say that it\u2019s a break? Which happens in winter? But from everything I have managed to glean its mysteries would seem slightly more arcane than those of the Iowa caucus. Either way, top-flight football increasingly feels like a world in which football is a plot device \u2013 what Hitchcock called a MacGuffin. You need it for the story to happen, and to provoke the characters you care about into behaving in certain consumable ways \u2013 but in and of itself, it is relatively insignificant in the grand scheme. As Hitchcock explained it once: \u201cThe MacGuffin is the thing that the spies are after but the audience don\u2019t care.\u201d Rather like the FA Cup. In advance of Liverpool\u2019s Tuesday night fourth-round replay against Shrewsbury Town, there must have been at least three times as much chat and three times as many articles about J\u00fcrgen Klopp not breaking his winter break to attend it as there were about the game and build-up itself. You could luxuriate in coverage of the row about him not being there, of his pushback against the row, of the technical process via which he might watch the match in absentia and phone in during it, and all the descriptions of how his spirit had permeated the Anfield setup so totally that it would be almost like he was there. For Manchester United, meanwhile, the winter break offers a chance to beef up off-pitch output, particularly in concert with their many official partners. Admittedly, the current travails of the club\u2019s official football partner are unfortunate \u2013 but the break will allow a focus on those United plotlines and content items that are doing much better. Off-pitch drama, for instance, or sponsor relations. It\u2019s all just a slightly different kind of output in the great football-adjacent universe \u2013 like Big Band week on the X Factor, or a camping episode in a popular sitcom. It just means that rather than appearing in content beamed from Old Trafford, this week Fred is appearing in content beamed from the Maldives. Look \u2013 here is an Instagram snap of him shooting off a waterslide! Meanwhile, Victor Lindel\u00f6f is in Morocco! Other dramas? Rising tensions in the Middle East mean United\u2019s Qatar training camp was cancelled; rising tensions elsewhere mean Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r must use the time off to solve the fiendish puzzle of how to win more football games. What a wondrous lot of this stuff there is. If you find yourself at any point wondering whether any of it could technically ever be branded as \u201cfootball\u201d, please don\u2019t. Just relax. Submit. Let the content wash over you like a rainfall shower by Kohler, the principal bathware partner of Manchester United. Give yourself a break. No \u2013 give yourself a WINTER break.",

      "bodyText": "John Rolfe had no expectations of finding anything valuable when he arrived at a ramshackle two-up, two-down cottage tucked away in a remote West Country valley. But as the auctioneer began to explore by the light of his mobile phone torch the glint of gold caught his eye. Rolfe began to turn out drawers and cupboards and found them full of valuable coins. \u201cIt was mind-blowing. I felt like a pirate in a grotto,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a coin here, a coin there. If I opened a drawer there were more coins.\u201d He even found a coin among sugar cubes in a bowl. The coins were removed from the cottage near Stroud, in Gloucestershire. Most were commemorative and specimen coins in mint condition and sold for a total of \u00a380,000 at Wotton Auction Rooms. The precise location of the find and the identity of the hoarder, who died some months ago, is not being disclosed on the request of his family. It is understood he is is a former City of London worker who retired to his remote, damp, rat-infested bolthole, where he lived alone. He clearly had an eye for gold and kept the coins in excellent condition, most in their original plastic and with the receipts. The most valuable lot was No 210, a 1937 specimen coin set comprising a \u00a35 coin and sovereigns in a Morocco leather case, which sold for \u00a38,000. There were also coins commemorating royal occasions and historical events and figures, celebrating great artists and marking sporting events. A set of gold coins minted for the Queen\u2019s jubilee in 2002 (with box and paperwork) sold for \u00a35,000. Someone paid \u00a33,400 for a set of Channel Islands gold coins produced to mark the 150th anniversary of the Duke of Wellington\u2019s death. Rolfe explained that he got to know about the cottage from the solicitors for the family of the deceased. \u201cWhen you get a call like that and hear about coins you think it\u2019s going to be a few coppers and maybe a Georgian halfpenny. If you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll find \u00a320- or \u00a330-worth. I thought it was going to be as dull as dishwater.\u201d Rolfe drove out to the cottage on a rainy day. \u201cThere was flooding and the van only just made it there. It had steam coming out of the bonnet.,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cottage was in the middle of nowhere. To say the place was ramshackle doesn\u2019t quite cover it. It was damp, rat-infested. There was an old car on the drive that looked as if it had never been moved. \u201cThe gentleman was a hoarder. We go into an lot of properties but I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. You could barely get through the front door. We couldn\u2019t turn the lights on. There were boxes and boxes of paperwork floor to ceiling in every room.\u201d But then he saw the glinting. \u201cAlmost every coin was in mint condition still stored in its original plastic with its receipt. I got a team down to clear the property. That was no mean feat. A normal house clearance will take a day or two. This took three weeks of four men every day.\u201d Rolfe said the collector clearly had a penchant for gold \u2013 and for keeping his coins pristine while the rest of the cottage crumbled. The auction at Wotton-under-Edge was packed and attracted bids from across the world. The hoard fetched about double the estimated price and every lot was sold. Rolfe said: \u201cI\u2019ve spent my whole life pricing up house clearances. I\u2019ve never done anything like it. I may never see anything like it again.\u201d Knockout medal with royal pedigree to be sold The George Medal awarded to one of the civilians who thwarted the attempted armed kidnap of Princess Anne is to go under the hammer. Ronnie Russell, a former heavyweight boxer, punched Ian Ball twice in the head as he tried to kidnap the princess at gunpoint in central London in March 1974. For his bravery he was awarded the George Medal by the Queen, who told him: \u201cThe medal is from the Queen, but I want to thank you as Anne\u2019s mother.\u201d Russell, now 72 and living in Bristol, is reluctantly selling the medal as he is in poor health having suffered several strokes, and wants to be able to provide for his future. \u201cIt was something I said I would never, ever do. I am so proud and honoured to have done such a thing and be involved in it that I would never, ever sell it,\u201d he said.",

Mary Lou McDonald, the republican party\u2019s leader, was forced on the defensive on Wednesday as the campaign unexpectedly swerved towards the 2007 killing of Paul Quinn, forcing McDonald to revisit the party\u2019s links with the IRA. McDonald faced calls to sack Conor Murphy, a Sinn F\u00e9in minister for finance in the Stormont government, over comments he previously made claiming the victim was a criminal. On 20 October 2007, up to 10 men beat Quinn with iron and nail-studded bars, breaking every major bone in his body. It was one of the most brutal murders allegedly involving IRA members since the Good Friday agreement. The attack, in a cowshed near Castleblayney in county Monaghan on Ireland\u2019s border with Northern Ireland, left the 21-year-old victim resembling a \u201clump of jelly\u201d, a Garda officer said at the time. Quinn\u2019s family said the local IRA killed him because he had got the better of the son of a local republican in a fist fight. Sinn F\u00e9in denied any IRA involvement. McDonald stumbled in an RTE television debate on Tuesday night when a moderator asked her to explain contradictory statements about the atrocity. McDonald, usually a polished media performer, appeared flummoxed and ended up calling on Murphy, her party colleague, to apologise to Quinn\u2019s family. It was the most electric moment of a debate in which Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, and Miche\u00e1l Martin, the leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, tried to dent Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s surge in popularity.

      "body": "<p>To understand where the Labour party\u2019s leadership contest is heading, it\u2019s important to understand who the members are. It\u2019s not an exact science, but they can be roughly divided into three parts. One-third will vote for whoever they perceive as the leftwing candidate, another third will vote for whoever isn\u2019t the leftwing candidate, and then there\u2019s the remaining third.

The culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, suggested the television licence was an increasingly outdated way of funding the BBC, saying that while she would guarantee its existence in the short term, it was time to look at new ways of subsidising public service broadcasting. Launching a consultation on whether to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee, Morgan compared the corporation to the defunct video rental chain Blockbuster, warning that once-mighty media institutions could collapse quickly if they failed to adapt to new formats. \u201cIf you have to criminalise non-payment of the licence fee in order for the BBC to remain relevant then that suggests something is wrong with the model,\u201d she told an audience in central London. \u201cCriminal sanctions are for issues that are damaging to society.\u201d Morgan said she would guarantee the current model until the end of 2027 but \u201cwe must all be open-minded about the future of the licence fee beyond this point\u201d, with alternative suggestions including a system in which different broadcasters would bid for a central pot of funding to produce public service output. Plans to decriminalise the licence fee and turn non-payment into a civil offence, a move which the BBC estimates will cost it at least \u00a3200m in funding and force it to make even more cuts to its output, are a long-term aim of many on the free-market wing of the Conservative party. But the proposal has also been backed by women\u2019s charities and prison reform campaigners, who say it is unfair that the vast majority of prosecutions are against women. Naima Sakande, a women\u2019s justice advocate at the law charity Appeal, said: \u201cWhile the fee funds an important part of our media landscape, it cannot be right that non-payment of this household bill is treated differently from all other expenses. \u201cCriminal sanctions for this are sexist, outdated and unhelpful. These measures have no place in a modern system of justice.\u201d More than 120,000 people a year are prosecuted for non-payment of the licence fee, with five people sent to prison in 2018 for failing to pay fines relating to their cases. The BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, announced last month that he would stand down to allow his successor to conduct negotiations with the government over the amount it can charge for the licence fee \u2013 currently set at \u00a3154.50 a year \u2013 between 2022 and 2027.

      "body": "<p>Robert Sheldon, Lord Sheldon, the former Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, who has died aged 96, was the sort of politician who is in decreasing supply in a modern House of Commons dominated by shrill and inexperienced young former political advisers. No one ever accused Sheldon of being shrill or attention-seeking in nearly 37 years in the Commons.</p> <p>Sheldon would probably have had a longer ministerial career, having been financial secretary to the Treasury for four years throughout the economically troubled and precarious years of the Callaghan government in the late 1970s, had Labour not been thrown out of power for the best part of two decades.</p> <p>There was never a doubt about his Labour allegiance, though he was out of sympathy with some of the more doctrinaire positions the party adopted in the 70s and 80s.</p> <p>He chose to make his parliamentary career as the widely respected and influential long-serving chairman of the public accounts committee and latterly as one of the first chairs of the standards and privileges committee, set up to investigate accusations of sleaze among MPs. Both committees sought cross-party consensus and generally achieved it under his bipartisan leadership.</p> <p>Sheldon\u2019s parents, Meir Shamash, and his wife, Betty, were Jewish immigrants from Iraq who settled in Manchester, where he was born and where his father worked as a textile exporter and businessman. His birth name was Isaac Shamash, which he changed by deed poll. He was educated at Burnley grammar school and at technical colleges in Lancashire to gain engineering training, and later was awarded an external degree from London University.</p> <p>He married his cousin Eileen Shamash in 1945. In the same year he joined the Labour party, linking up with two other young Manchester-based Jewish hopefuls with an interest in economic policy: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/03/lord-barnett\" title=\"\">Joel Barnett</a>, who became a lifelong friend, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Edmund Dell</a>.</p> <p>All three eventually entered the Commons in their early 40s and later served in James Callaghan\u2019s government. Having had careers in industry and commerce, they each became MPs: Sheldon for Ashton-under-Lyne, Barnett for nearby Heywood and Royton, and Dell for Birkenhead, following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson</a>\u2019s narrow general election victory in October 1964.</p> <p>In the Commons, all three, believers in economic Keynesianism and scarcely leftwingers, made life difficult for their government by arguing for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from its expensive post-imperial military commitments east of Suez and, increasingly strongly, for devaluation of the pound, a policy that Wilson and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\" title=\"\">J</a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\" title=\"\">ames Callaghan</a>, the chancellor of the exchequer, fought hard and unavailingly to oppose. There was a run on the pound when Callaghan refused to answer Sheldon\u2019s demand, at Treasury questions, whether a $1,000m IMF loan had been applied for to support sterling.</p> <p>Later, as the party embraced its anti-Common Market phase, Sheldon joined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/06/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Roy Jenkins</a> in voting for entry. He remained pro-European: \u201cI voted for entry into the community against a three-line whip and I have never seen any reason to regret it,\u201d he said later.</p> <p>In 1998 he also urged Tony Blair to take the country into European monetary union \u201cto reduce interest rates, reduce the level of the pound, improve investment and lead to that rarest of economic phenomena, a free lunch\u201d. Perhaps it was just as well that Sheldon was never a charismatic or particularly convincing public speaker.</p> <p>Such early rebellions did not prevent Sheldon and Barnett becoming ministers at the Treasury under Denis Healey during the Labour government between 1974 and 1979, as the country stumbled from one economic crisis to the next. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>\u2019s victory in 1979, both men and Dell retreated to the backbenches \u2013 Dell later leaving for the SDP. In 1983 Sheldon rejected Foot\u2019s offer to become deputy speaker, instead following in Barnett\u2019s footsteps to become chair of the public accounts committee, the most important of the select committees and one that gained an increasing public profile as it investigated government waste and incompetence in public spending.</p> <p>Sheldon relished the role, ferreting out egregious small-scale corruption, such as the Welsh Development Agency official discovered to be entertaining models in a hotel room at taxpayers\u2019 expense, and the much more serious wasted multimillion-pound government investment in the sports car firm run by the American conman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/21/guardianobituaries.usa\" title=\"\">John DeLorean</a> and the \u00a34bn overrun in defence spending.</p> <p>He even advised the Queen in 1992 to make a \u201cvoluntary adjustment\u201d in her finances to pay tax, several months before she was eventually obliged to do so by the weight of public opinion.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s reports were all the more compelling for being unanimous. \u201cAll we are doing is to make sure the taxpayer is protected. That overcomes party differences,\u201d Sheldon told an interviewer grimly. \u201cHow much is it going to cost? What are you trying to achieve? What went wrong?\u201d he would ask quaking civil servants, compelled to appear before the committee\u2019s inquisition in public.</p> <p>After Labour\u2019s return to power in 1997, Sheldon, by then in his mid-70s, joined the revamped standards and privileges committee as it investigated Neil Hamilton, accused of accepting cash in brown envelopes for asking Commons questions on behalf of Mohamed Al Fayed, and a number of other MPs who were taking advantage of lax Commons procedures.</p> <p>Sheldon himself fell marginally foul of this as a vengeful and partisan Tory backbencher accused him of failing to declare an interest \u2013 his well-known business background \u2013 when taking part in debates on industry. Largely cleared and only mildly rebuked, Sheldon was supported by several Tory MPs who knew his probity well.</p> <p>By then, however, his health was suffering. His<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/mar/01/uk.politicalnews1\" title=\"\"> life was saved by the swimmer Duncan Goodhew in 2000</a> when he collapsed with a heart attack while walking to the Commons through St James\u2019s Park, an echo of the testimonial he himself had received from the Royal Humane Society in 1966 after rescuing a man from drowning.</p> <p>He retired as an MP at the 2001 general election and entered the Lords, where he could often be seen dining with his old friend and colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/03/lord-barnett\" title=\"\">Lord Barnett</a>, retiring in turn from the Lords in 2015.</p> <p>Eileen died in 1969. Sheldon is survived by his second wife, Mary (nee Shield), whom he married in 1971, by the children, Terry and Gill, of his first marriage, and two grandchildren, David and Helen.</p> <p>\u2022 Robert Edward Sheldon, Lord Sheldon, politician, born 13 September 1923; died 2 February 2020</p>",

His birth name was Isaac Shamash, which he changed by deed poll. He was educated at Burnley grammar school and at technical colleges in Lancashire to gain engineering training, and later was awarded an external degree from London University. He married his cousin Eileen Shamash in 1945. In the same year he joined the Labour party, linking up with two other young Manchester-based Jewish hopefuls with an interest in economic policy: Joel Barnett, who became a lifelong friend, and Edmund Dell. All three eventually entered the Commons in their early 40s and later served in James Callaghan\u2019s government. Having had careers in industry and commerce, they each became MPs: Sheldon for Ashton-under-Lyne, Barnett for nearby Heywood and Royton, and Dell for Birkenhead, following Harold Wilson\u2019s narrow general election victory in October 1964. In the Commons, all three, believers in economic Keynesianism and scarcely leftwingers, made life difficult for their government by arguing for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from its expensive post-imperial military commitments east of Suez and, increasingly strongly, for devaluation of the pound, a policy that Wilson and James Callaghan, the chancellor of the exchequer, fought hard and unavailingly to oppose. There was a run on the pound when Callaghan refused to answer Sheldon\u2019s demand, at Treasury questions, whether a $1,000m IMF loan had been applied for to support sterling. Later, as the party embraced its anti-Common Market phase, Sheldon joined Roy Jenkins in voting for entry. He remained pro-European: \u201cI voted for entry into the community against a three-line whip and I have never seen any reason to regret it,\u201d he said later. In 1998 he also urged Tony Blair to take the country into European monetary union \u201cto reduce interest rates, reduce the level of the pound, improve investment and lead to that rarest of economic phenomena, a free lunch\u201d. Perhaps it was just as well that Sheldon was never a charismatic or particularly convincing public speaker. Such early rebellions did not prevent Sheldon and Barnett becoming ministers at the Treasury under Denis Healey during the Labour government between 1974 and 1979, as the country stumbled from one economic crisis to the next. After Margaret Thatcher\u2019s victory in 1979, both men and Dell retreated to the backbenches \u2013 Dell later leaving for the SDP. In 1983 Sheldon rejected Foot\u2019s offer to become deputy speaker, instead following in Barnett\u2019s footsteps to become chair of the public accounts committee, the most important of the select committees and one that gained an increasing public profile as it investigated government waste and incompetence in public spending. Sheldon relished the role, ferreting out egregious small-scale corruption, such as the Welsh Development Agency official discovered to be entertaining models in a hotel room at taxpayers\u2019 expense, and the much more serious wasted multimillion-pound government investment in the sports car firm run by the American conman John DeLorean and the \u00a34bn overrun in defence spending. He even advised the Queen in 1992 to make a \u201cvoluntary adjustment\u201d in her finances to pay tax, several months before she was eventually obliged to do so by the weight of public opinion. The committee\u2019s reports were all the more compelling for being unanimous. \u201cAll we are doing is to make sure the taxpayer is protected. That overcomes party differences,\u201d Sheldon told an interviewer grimly. \u201cHow much is it going to cost? What are you trying to achieve? What went wrong?\u201d he would ask quaking civil servants, compelled to appear before the committee\u2019s inquisition in public. After Labour\u2019s return to power in 1997, Sheldon, by then in his mid-70s, joined the revamped standards and privileges committee as it investigated Neil Hamilton, accused of accepting cash in brown envelopes for asking Commons questions on behalf of Mohamed Al Fayed, and a number of other MPs who were taking advantage of lax Commons procedures. Sheldon himself fell marginally foul of this as a vengeful and partisan Tory backbencher accused him of failing to declare an interest \u2013 his well-known business background \u2013 when taking part in debates on industry. Largely cleared and only mildly rebuked, Sheldon was supported by several Tory MPs who knew his probity well. By then, however, his health was suffering. His life was saved by the swimmer Duncan Goodhew in 2000 when he collapsed with a heart attack while walking to the Commons through St James\u2019s Park, an echo of the testimonial he himself had received from the Royal Humane Society in 1966 after rescuing a man from drowning. He retired as an MP at the 2001 general election and entered the Lords, where he could often be seen dining with his old friend and colleague Lord Barnett, retiring in turn from the Lords in 2015. Eileen died in 1969. Sheldon is survived by his second wife, Mary (nee Shield), whom he married in 1971, by the children, Terry and Gill, of his first marriage, and two grandchildren, David and Helen. \u2022 Robert Edward Sheldon, Lord Sheldon, politician, born 13 September 1923; died 2 February 2020",

      "body": "<p>It is cold. It is dark. It is winter. And post-Christmas, we all feel skint. How do you lift spirits and put some sizzle in your cooking without spending much? We asked some of Britain\u2019s best chefs: if you had a fiver or less to spend \u2013 what would you buy??</p> <h2><strong>Kikkoman dark soy sauce </strong><br><em><strong>Stephen Harris, chef-owner, the Sportsman, Seasalter, Kent</strong></em></h2> <p>The Dutch East India company listed soy sauce in 1737. It has a long history in Europe, but I don\u2019t think British people understand how powerful it is. It\u2019s liquid umami for a couple of quid and, used judiciously, it\u2019s amazing in bolognese, chilli, stews and marinades. If you\u2019re frying mushrooms and want a real flavour boost, bung a tablespoon in and reduce it down. </p> <h2><strong>Chilli paste </strong><br><em><strong>Yotam Ottolenghi, Ottolenghi restaurants, London</strong></em></h2> <p>Hat tip on this to Tara Wigley, who I write with. Buy as many green and red chillies as you can, finely slice and salt them (one tablespoon per 250g). Refrigerate in a sealed container for three days, then blitz with cider vinegar (3 tbsp) and lemon juice (1 tbsp). In a new container, seal the paste with olive oil and keep in the fridge. Spoon over and into anything savoury to ramp up its flavour.</p> <h2><strong>Too Good To Go food bag </strong><br><em><strong>Sally White, chef-owner, Salcooks, Birmingham</strong></em></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/06/food-waste-how-to-get-cheap-grub-and-help-save-the-planet\" title=\"\">Too Good to Go </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/06/food-waste-how-to-get-cheap-grub-and-help-save-the-planet\" title=\"\">app helps fight food waste</a>. Customers buy a magic bag from a listed cafe or restaurant \u2013 maybe a chain like Yo! Sushi or an indie like us \u2013 filled with food that would have been binned. You can\u2019t be too fussy. You might get meat, veg or a bag of cakes, and sometimes the bags are cancelled and refunded if places get busy. But you do get excellent deals. Our bags cost \u00a33 for \u00a39- or \u00a310-worth of food. If you need inspiration for the contents, you can pick up some brilliant cookbooks second-hand for under a fiver. For example, Merry White\u2019s Cooking for Crowds, Claudia Roden\u2019s A New Book of Middle Eastern Food or Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s reliable River Cottage Veg Every Day.</p> <h2><strong>7 Up </strong><br><em><strong>Lee Johnson, chef and co-owner, Bong Bong\u2019s Manila Kanteen, London</strong></em></h2> <p>I was born in Manila, and Filipino cooking is a real combination of sweet and sour, often in the form of vinegar-based dipping sauces. At Bong Bong we use 7 Up (some Filipinos think it should be Sprite) in a sweet 24-hour pork-rib marinade. I presume this came from Americans in the Philippines during the second world war, who used Coke in BBQ marinades and that kind of thing. Ours is half-and-half 7 Up and soy sauce, plus garlic, ginger, chilli, sugar and fresh lemongrass, which creates good caramelisation and sweet, citrusy, fragrant ribs.</p> <h2><strong>Kiwi knives</strong><strong> </strong><br><em><strong>Shaun Hurrell, Barrio Comida, Durham</strong></em></h2> <p>I used expensive Japanese knives for years before an Aussie chef put me on to the Thai-brand Kiwi knives. They\u2019re my go-to knives for daily prep \u2013 ultra-sharp, super-lightweight and with a very thin blade you can quickly put an edge on. You can pick them up for about \u00a35.</p> <h2><strong>Smoked butter </strong><br><em><strong>Tom Kerridge, Hand &amp; Flowers, Marlow</strong></em></h2> <p>Buy 200g, divide into 10 cubes and freeze them individually. As needed, stir one into a casserole, chilli, puy lentils or even a curry to give it a massive enhancement. At 40p a pop, it\u2019s an incredibly cost-effective way to drive flavour into dishes.</p> <h2><strong>Lemon </strong><br><em><strong>Miguel Barclay, chef and author of One Pound Meals</strong></em><br></h2> <p>A squeeze of lemon will transform almost any food you can think of; you need that balance of acidic tartness, even in a bolognese. A lemon is what, 30p? That\u2019s the kind of cooking that real chefs do. You\u2019ll notice the difference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"22462073dfefdf066df7e95cf7334414c44733fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22462073dfefdf066df7e95cf7334414c44733fc/0_257_5386_3232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A squeeze of lemon will transform almost any food.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A squeeze of lemon will transform almost any food.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: funkyfood London - Paul Williams/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Maldon smoked sea salt </strong><br><em><strong>Grace Regan, chef-owner, SpiceBox, London</strong></em></h2> <p>I\u2019m salt-obsessed, and this salt takes things to the next level. I add it to salads, roasted veg and cooked grains. Sprinkled over cauliflower roasted in curry powder, its smokiness makes the soft, charred cauliflower almost meaty-tasting. </p> <h2><strong>Flat-leaf parsley </strong><br><em><strong>Esther Miglio, chef and co-owner, OWT, Leeds</strong></em></h2> <p>I\u2019m French and both my grandmas use parsley all the time. It\u2019s about 70p a bunch on Kirkgate Market and you can do amazing stuff with it. We use a lot of parsley sauce made with garlic, vinegar, mustard, oil, salt and pepper. You can put this vibrant green sauce on eggs, sandwiches, pasta or with fish. It keeps for five days in the fridge. </p> <h2><strong>Belazu rose harissa </strong><br><em><strong>Helen Graham, head chef, Bubala, London</strong></em></h2> <p>I use this to jazz up pasta sauces. It\u2019s pretty punchy. Blend a tin of chopped tomatoes with one heaped tablespoon of harissa until smooth, cook for 30 minutes on a medium heat, season with salt, add pasta, parsley and feta and you\u2019ve got a delicious dinner.</p> <h2><strong>Wok spatula</strong><strong> </strong><br><em><strong>Andrew Chongsathien, Brother Thai, Cardiff</strong></em></h2> <p>If you have a decent carbon-steel wok, ditch that wooden spoon and get a proper 14in plastic-handled stainless steel wok spatula, also known as a wok chuan or turner. Chinese supermarkets have them for about a fiver and because this shovel-like utensil is designed to fit the wok\u2019s curves, it\u2019s like having your own hand in there. It\u2019s much easier to move things around and char them properly. </p> <h2><strong>Lentils and pulses </strong><br><em><strong>Ravinder Bhogal, chef-founder, Jikoni, London</strong></em></h2> <p>I stock up on every type of lentil and pulse I can to make dhal. LSD, life-saving dhal, as the great Madhur Jaffrey calls it. I never get bored of it. Hodmedods\u2019 British lentils and pulses have become a cheap, reliable store-cupboard essential for me. I love to fry onion, garlic and dried mint, then braise the lentils with a punctured dried Iranian lime and veg stock. Add tons of parsley and dill at the end. It\u2019s such a nourishing, flavourful meal with bread or rice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"afa8c11c62fdf157ee2e3cc94d0260ccc166c915\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afa8c11c62fdf157ee2e3cc94d0260ccc166c915/0_190_4670_2802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lentils and pulses: cheap, reliable store-cupboard essentials.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lentils and pulses: cheap, reliable store-cupboard essentials.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Fedorina/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Toban djan sauce </strong><br><em><strong>Larkin Cen, chef-owner, Woky Ko restaurants, Bristol</strong></em></h2> <p>My secret weapon. A salty, savoury sauce made from chillies and fermented soy beans, which I use instead of salt in a lot of food. I put it on everything.

      "bodyText": "It is cold. It is dark. It is winter. And post-Christmas, we all feel skint. How do you lift spirits and put some sizzle in your cooking without spending much? We asked some of Britain\u2019s best chefs: if you had a fiver or less to spend \u2013 what would you buy?? Kikkoman dark soy sauce Stephen Harris, chef-owner, the Sportsman, Seasalter, Kent The Dutch East India company listed soy sauce in 1737. It has a long history in Europe, but I don\u2019t think British people understand how powerful it is. It\u2019s liquid umami for a couple of quid and, used judiciously, it\u2019s amazing in bolognese, chilli, stews and marinades. If you\u2019re frying mushrooms and want a real flavour boost, bung a tablespoon in and reduce it down. Chilli paste Yotam Ottolenghi, Ottolenghi restaurants, London Hat tip on this to Tara Wigley, who I write with. Buy as many green and red chillies as you can, finely slice and salt them (one tablespoon per 250g). Refrigerate in a sealed container for three days, then blitz with cider vinegar (3 tbsp) and lemon juice (1 tbsp). In a new container, seal the paste with olive oil and keep in the fridge. Spoon over and into anything savoury to ramp up its flavour. Too Good To Go food bag Sally White, chef-owner, Salcooks, Birmingham The Too Good to Go app helps fight food waste. Customers buy a magic bag from a listed cafe or restaurant \u2013 maybe a chain like Yo! Sushi or an indie like us \u2013 filled with food that would have been binned. You can\u2019t be too fussy. You might get meat, veg or a bag of cakes, and sometimes the bags are cancelled and refunded if places get busy. But you do get excellent deals. Our bags cost \u00a33 for \u00a39- or \u00a310-worth of food. If you need inspiration for the contents, you can pick up some brilliant cookbooks second-hand for under a fiver. For example, Merry White\u2019s Cooking for Crowds, Claudia Roden\u2019s A New Book of Middle Eastern Food or Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s reliable River Cottage Veg Every Day. 7 Up Lee Johnson, chef and co-owner, Bong Bong\u2019s Manila Kanteen, London I was born in Manila, and Filipino cooking is a real combination of sweet and sour, often in the form of vinegar-based dipping sauces. At Bong Bong we use 7 Up (some Filipinos think it should be Sprite) in a sweet 24-hour pork-rib marinade. I presume this came from Americans in the Philippines during the second world war, who used Coke in BBQ marinades and that kind of thing. Ours is half-and-half 7 Up and soy sauce, plus garlic, ginger, chilli, sugar and fresh lemongrass, which creates good caramelisation and sweet, citrusy, fragrant ribs. Kiwi knives Shaun Hurrell, Barrio Comida, Durham I used expensive Japanese knives for years before an Aussie chef put me on to the Thai-brand Kiwi knives. They\u2019re my go-to knives for daily prep \u2013 ultra-sharp, super-lightweight and with a very thin blade you can quickly put an edge on. You can pick them up for about \u00a35. Smoked butter Tom Kerridge, Hand &amp; Flowers, Marlow Buy 200g, divide into 10 cubes and freeze them individually. As needed, stir one into a casserole, chilli, puy lentils or even a curry to give it a massive enhancement. At 40p a pop, it\u2019s an incredibly cost-effective way to drive flavour into dishes. Lemon Miguel Barclay, chef and author of One Pound Meals A squeeze of lemon will transform almost any food you can think of; you need that balance of acidic tartness, even in a bolognese. A lemon is what, 30p? That\u2019s the kind of cooking that real chefs do. You\u2019ll notice the difference. Maldon smoked sea salt Grace Regan, chef-owner, SpiceBox, London I\u2019m salt-obsessed, and this salt takes things to the next level. I add it to salads, roasted veg and cooked grains. Sprinkled over cauliflower roasted in curry powder, its smokiness makes the soft, charred cauliflower almost meaty-tasting. Flat-leaf parsley Esther Miglio, chef and co-owner, OWT, Leeds I\u2019m French and both my grandmas use parsley all the time. It\u2019s about 70p a bunch on Kirkgate Market and you can do amazing stuff with it. We use a lot of parsley sauce made with garlic, vinegar, mustard, oil, salt and pepper. You can put this vibrant green sauce on eggs, sandwiches, pasta or with fish. It keeps for five days in the fridge. Belazu rose harissa Helen Graham, head chef, Bubala, London I use this to jazz up pasta sauces. It\u2019s pretty punchy. Blend a tin of chopped tomatoes with one heaped tablespoon of harissa until smooth, cook for 30 minutes on a medium heat, season with salt, add pasta, parsley and feta and you\u2019ve got a delicious dinner. Wok spatula Andrew Chongsathien, Brother Thai, Cardiff If you have a decent carbon-steel wok, ditch that wooden spoon and get a proper 14in plastic-handled stainless steel wok spatula, also known as a wok chuan or turner. Chinese supermarkets have them for about a fiver and because this shovel-like utensil is designed to fit the wok\u2019s curves, it\u2019s like having your own hand in there. It\u2019s much easier to move things around and char them properly. Lentils and pulses Ravinder Bhogal, chef-founder, Jikoni, London I stock up on every type of lentil and pulse I can to make dhal. LSD, life-saving dhal, as the great Madhur Jaffrey calls it. I never get bored of it. Hodmedods\u2019 British lentils and pulses have become a cheap, reliable store-cupboard essential for me. I love to fry onion, garlic and dried mint, then braise the lentils with a punctured dried Iranian lime and veg stock. Add tons of parsley and dill at the end. It\u2019s such a nourishing, flavourful meal with bread or rice. Toban djan sauce Larkin Cen, chef-owner, Woky Ko restaurants, Bristol My secret weapon. A salty, savoury sauce made from chillies and fermented soy beans, which I use instead of salt in a lot of food. I put it on everything. It tastes delicious stirred into cooked rice. Gnocchi paddle Masha Rener, head chef, Lina Stores, London I would recommend this to any home cook. After cutting freshly made gnocchi, you roll it softly across the board to score it, not just to make it pretty but also to create a better surface area for your pasta sauce to coat. This little board can also be used for different pastas as such garganelli and conchiglie. Marmite Tom Cenci, chef-owner, Loyal Tavern, London Marmite is essential in my cooking.

The traders sell bowls of veg for \u00a31. You might get five aubergines in one or a couple of white cabbages, which I use to make sauerkraut in the winter. For \u00a35 you can get a grade-A French black-legged chicken. On Fridays, there is a chap who sells squabs for \u00a32.50. It\u2019s first class.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a new chapter for France and the goal is 2023. They are going to have some growing pains along the way but at the start of a difficult voyage you often get off to a good start. It gives you confidence for the journey to follow.</p> <p>In his book, The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho calls it the principle of favourability or, in simpler terms, beginner\u2019s luck. Maybe because I believe in that, it came so readily to my mind as I watched on at the Stade de France and saw the game unfold.</p> <p>All week in Paris there was a feelgood factor about the French team. The selection of <em>Les Bleus </em>was welcomed across the board as a positive one and it was backed up with staff changes that also gave the feeling of something new afoot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/05/anthony-watson-england-miss-six-nations-scotland-injury-calcutta-cup\">Anthony Watson ruled out of England return against Scotland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Antoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack are the poster boys for the new wave but quickly followed by the likes of the injured Damian Penaud, Julien Marchand, Virimi Vakatawa and Charles Ollivon. I actually think you could keep naming many more \u2013 the production line is long and with lasting talent.</p> <p>Media-wise it was all underplayed and understated. The results of all this were pretty evident in those first 40 minutes. Tackles stuck and momentum was made. The bigger picture is the 2023 World Cup in France and with the age and talent profile of the team they are on course to reach maturity at the right time.</p> <p>You can see there is still more to do and I\u2019m sure France will have some bumps along the way, but the foundations are clearly being put in place. The togetherness was also evident and it was based firmly on effort and outcome. It looked natural, and it just didn\u2019t look like that on the other side of the pitch with England.</p> <p>I\u2019m lucky enough in my day\u2011to\u2011day working life to see some amazing high-performance environments. Many of them have so many moving parts that you always have to remind yourself of what really needs the focus. Get too close to everything and the \u201cnoise\u201d can just drown out the \u201csignals\u201d. It felt like that with England. It didn\u2019t always look authentic. It didn\u2019t look owned. Then on comes Ellis Genge and I see a player doing his thing the way he wants and I park that thought.</p> <p>Maybe I\u2019m the one that\u2019s over\u2011analysing it all. Then the feeling re-emerges when you notice a forced pat on the back after something on the field that didn\u2019t need that. So it continued. A loop of what looks natural and what looks coerced.</p> <p>You look up at the England coaches\u2019 box and what sticks out is an England security guard who is standing up for the entire game as the coaches watch over their flock. It all just feels overly managed and, while not suffocating, short of breath.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think this England team have underperformed in various games for any other reason than they have lacked autonomy and freedom from external control. Having a bus not turn up on purpose or a meeting changed at the last minute is not creating autonomy. It\u2019s creating a false ownership. It\u2019s not creating a mental safety net for the players to really feel they can do what they want without fear.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/03/england-in-transition-good-enough-recover-france-loss\">England are in transition but good enough to recover from defeat in France | Nick Evans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is not totally absent and you see snippets of ownership and freedom but it\u2019s not shining through as it does with the very best teams. Yes, create structure and clear black-and-white on and off the field. But make what\u2019s inside those guardrails full of autonomy and player-led decisions. That would give enhanced belief and purpose to allow this England team to move on and genuinely reach for the lofty goals they publicly set out last week.</p> <p>This result wasn\u2019t about the French having freedom and England not. It was about a resurgent France that England couldn\u2019t respond to, bar Jonny May\u2019s individual efforts. Selection and Plan Bs are just a side story.</p> <p>The real reason England are not always at the level they can be is autonomy. They need to be truly allowed to be in the driving seat. If it stays the same, well, the rollercoaster will continue.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a new chapter for France and the goal is 2023. They are going to have some growing pains along the way but at the start of a difficult voyage you often get off to a good start. It gives you confidence for the journey to follow. In his book, The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho calls it the principle of favourability or, in simpler terms, beginner\u2019s luck. Maybe because I believe in that, it came so readily to my mind as I watched on at the Stade de France and saw the game unfold. All week in Paris there was a feelgood factor about the French team. The selection of Les Bleus was welcomed across the board as a positive one and it was backed up with staff changes that also gave the feeling of something new afoot. Antoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack are the poster boys for the new wave but quickly followed by the likes of the injured Damian Penaud, Julien Marchand, Virimi Vakatawa and Charles Ollivon. I actually think you could keep naming many more \u2013 the production line is long and with lasting talent. Media-wise it was all underplayed and understated. The results of all this were pretty evident in those first 40 minutes. Tackles stuck and momentum was made. The bigger picture is the 2023 World Cup in France and with the age and talent profile of the team they are on course to reach maturity at the right time. You can see there is still more to do and I\u2019m sure France will have some bumps along the way, but the foundations are clearly being put in place. The togetherness was also evident and it was based firmly on effort and outcome. It looked natural, and it just didn\u2019t look like that on the other side of the pitch with England. I\u2019m lucky enough in my day\u2011to\u2011day working life to see some amazing high-performance environments. Many of them have so many moving parts that you always have to remind yourself of what really needs the focus. Get too close to everything and the \u201cnoise\u201d can just drown out the \u201csignals\u201d. It felt like that with England. It didn\u2019t always look authentic. It didn\u2019t look owned. Then on comes Ellis Genge and I see a player doing his thing the way he wants and I park that thought. Maybe I\u2019m the one that\u2019s over\u2011analysing it all. Then the feeling re-emerges when you notice a forced pat on the back after something on the field that didn\u2019t need that. So it continued. A loop of what looks natural and what looks coerced. You look up at the England coaches\u2019 box and what sticks out is an England security guard who is standing up for the entire game as the coaches watch over their flock. It all just feels overly managed and, while not suffocating, short of breath. I don\u2019t think this England team have underperformed in various games for any other reason than they have lacked autonomy and freedom from external control. Having a bus not turn up on purpose or a meeting changed at the last minute is not creating autonomy. It\u2019s creating a false ownership. It\u2019s not creating a mental safety net for the players to really feel they can do what they want without fear. It is not totally absent and you see snippets of ownership and freedom but it\u2019s not shining through as it does with the very best teams. Yes, create structure and clear black-and-white on and off the field. But make what\u2019s inside those guardrails full of autonomy and player-led decisions. That would give enhanced belief and purpose to allow this England team to move on and genuinely reach for the lofty goals they publicly set out last week. This result wasn\u2019t about the French having freedom and England not. It was about a resurgent France that England couldn\u2019t respond to, bar Jonny May\u2019s individual efforts. Selection and Plan Bs are just a side story. The real reason England are not always at the level they can be is autonomy. They need to be truly allowed to be in the driving seat. If it stays the same, well, the rollercoaster will continue.",

      "bodyText": "Pete Buttigieg threw everything into winning the Iowa Democratic caucuses and \u2013 with 71% of the vote in following Monday\u2019s results debacle \u2013 his gamble may well have paid off. If so, the former mayor of tiny South Bend, Indiana, may look back on this moment as the peak of his political career, or the start of a long, hard slog that could take him all the way to the White House. Supporters of Buttigieg, a military veteran and intellectual whose appeal recalls that of Barack Obama, see him as a fresh, upbeat voice of moderation who could potentially unite the party and unseat Donald Trump. Critics say he is an inexperienced, policy-lite novice who worked as a management consultant for McKinsey, holds fundraisers in the \u201cwine caves\u201d of the super-rich, and has no record of the support among non-whites he would need to win the Democratic nomination and the November election. The great unknown is whether the US would vote for a gay president. Those dismissing such worries point to Obama twice proving the US could elect a black man, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s netting of 3m more votes than Trump in 2016, which showed a woman could win the popular vote. Further back, John F Kennedy overcame suggestions a Catholic could never win the White House. An October poll showed only half of American voters said they were ready for a gay president, and some have put the gender gap in Buttigieg\u2019s support down partially to male homophobia. A voter in Iowa asking to rescind her vote for Buttigieg after learning that he was gay was widely reported this week. \u201cAre you saying that he has the same-sex partner?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody like that in the White House.\u201d Born in 1982 to a Maltese-born father and an American mother, Pete Buttigieg \u2013 pronounced buddha-judge \u2013 attended Harvard and Oxford and worked as a management consultant before serving in the US naval reserve from 2009 to 2017, reaching the rank of lieutenant and being awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal following his seven-month tour in Afghanistan in 2014. After working for John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential bid, among other political campaigns, he was elected mayor of his home city of South Bend in 2012. He came out as gay in 2015 and won that year\u2019s election with 80% of the vote, marrying his partner, Chasten Glezman, in 2018. His time as mayor was not without controversy \u2013 some of which partly explains suspicion of him among some African-American Democrats. He notoriously received less than 1% support from black Democrats in one 2019 poll. In 2012, Buttigieg asked for the resignation of the city\u2019s first black police chief amid a row over the illegal taping of officers\u2019 telephone calls, and the city was sued for racial discrimination. In 2019, he was seen as reacting in a flat-footed way to the killing of an African-American man by a white police officer. \u201cYou\u2019re running for president and you want black people to vote for you? That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d one woman told him. It\u2019s a problem Buttigieg \u2013 who backs a publicly run health insurance scheme, background checks for gun-buyers, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and tackling climate change \u2013 will have to resolve if he is to make the case that Joe Biden is not as electable as he seems and that the centrist Democratic establishment should unite around him instead. He can hope for a good showing in the New Hampshire primary next week, but the diverse electorates of South Carolina, California and Texas will prove much more difficult terrain, and may see him eclipsed. Meanwhile, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2013 who plans to join the race in earnest in March and has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising in California and elsewhere \u2013 will be making the same argument to Democratic moderates that he is the most electable moderate. The billionaire doubled his spending on TV ads following the Iowa debacle, clearly sensing an opening. And if the centrist vote splits three ways between Buttigieg, Biden and Bloomberg, that could end up benefiting the man who seems to have come second in Iowa \u2013 the veteran socialist senator Bernie Sanders. \u201cIn order to govern, in order to lead, in order to move this country forward, we need a president focused on the future and ready to leave the politics of the past in the past,\u201d Buttigieg said in New Hampshire on Tuesday. His opponents will hope to leave the former mayor\u2019s strong showing in Iowa in the past instead.",

      "body": "<p>Fictions about the rich are a sneaky bunch. While uncovering the machinery of a fantasy, they also indulge the longing for an invitation to the party. Characters often stand out for their enormous wealth and property, and for the silence and lies that bind them to that exalted status.</p> <p>In the US, for example, the word <em>slavery</em> \u2013 the institution that created so much of the nation\u2019s wealth \u2013 does not appear anywhere in our constitution, and our fictions dramatise that silence over and over again, showing the strongholds of property and power that defend boundaries of class, colour and bloodline.</p> <p>Often, these are multi-generational stories of families, of great houses. They are tales of place, power, privilege \u2013&#xa0;and parties, of course. Parties where the uninvited or accidental outsider can sneak in. </p> <p>\u201cEverything happens at a party,\u201d a character remarks in my new novel <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-guest-book-9780670920433.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Guest Book</a>, which follows three generations of the Miltons, an \u201cold money\u201d family that has run out of cash. The Miltons\u2019 wealth is gone, but not their place \u2013 an island off the coast of Maine \u2013&#xa0;or the sense that it is theirs. \u201cWe repeat what we don\u2019t know,\u201d another character says. What this family \u201cdoesn\u2019t know\u201d is the racism that underpins their status, the bed beneath their dream. </p> <p>The following fictions taught me how to imagine and shape my own. They are big, juicy stories of love, betrayal and memory; rich in the stuff and sorrow of dreams. </p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/03/what-makes-great-gatsby\">The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald</a><br></strong>Not much unites the US at the moment, but almost every US citizen has read The Great Gatsby. Why? The benighted, besotted James Gatz from nowhere, from no <em>place,</em> believes he can write his own future, and \u2013 given enough money \u2013&#xa0;<em>rewrite</em> his past. The spectacle of his gorgeous, doomed vision has been taught as the expression of the American Dream and of its impossibility, Gatsby\u2019s glorious parties spinning out into the summer nights, never mind the darkness, never mind the rules of class, or of race, or the truth of the past.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.thejoandidion.com/run-river\">Run River by Joan Didion</a></strong><br>Didion\u2019s first novel begins with the sound of a gunshot heard by a woman calmly fastening a watch to her wrist in her bedroom, and takes us back through the events leading up to that shot \u2013&#xa0;back through her memory, and further back into the history of her family, among the first settlers of the state of California. The novel combines Didion\u2019s characteristically minute observation of class and power with a plot that spins relentlessly forward, never letting you forget that it must return to the moment of that opening shot.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/works/howards-end\">Howards End by EM Forster</a><br></strong>The<strong> </strong>Schlegel sisters, clear-eyed, witty members of the intelligentsia, comfortably off and highly educated, are at the centre of a novel that pits their situation and point of view against l of the \u201cnew money\u201d family who possess the old family house of the title \u2013 a place that burnishes the family\u2019s sense of superiority, even though none of them choose to live there. A secret of inheritance buried at the beginning of the story hangs in plain sight, begging to be revealed.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lady-chatterley-s-lover-9781509843190.html\">Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover by DH Lawrence</a></strong> <br>I would pair this 1928 novel with <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-awakening-9780241341421.html\">Kate Chopin\u2019s The Awakening</a> (1899), both stories about women coming to see the gilded bars surrounding their social class. Chopin\u2019s novel is set in a summer colony off the coast of New Orleans, where the heat and languor and beauty of her cage pairs with the intensity of her sexual awakening. In much the same way, the natural, excessive beauty of the Chatterley estate, the deep green afternoons dripping after rain, underscore Lady Chatterley\u2019s release into a kind of freedom in the arms of the gamekeeper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48e2b657f9b11596fbd3310807506ba4494c4ffb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48e2b657f9b11596fbd3310807506ba4494c4ffb/0_141_2625_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Pfeiffer in The Age of Innocence (1993).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gilded anguish \u2026 Michelle Pfeiffer in The Age of Innocence (1993).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Columbia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-age-of-innocence-9781509890033.html\">The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton</a><br></strong>Wharton\u2019s 1920 novel skewers the turn-of-the century <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/19th-century/gilded-age\">Gilded Age</a>, when the social, political and economic power of the US was centred in the 400 families of Old Manhattan who danced in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Schermerhorn_Astor\">Caroline Astor\u2019s ballroom</a>, and \u201cdreaded scandal more than disease\u201d.

This story of a girl coming to find her voice in the face of a world that would dismiss her is one of my touchstones. </p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-sound-and-the-fury-by-william-faulkner-book-of-a-lifetime-9174915.html\">The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner</a></strong><br>The story of the beautiful and tragic Caddy Compson is told in three separate monologues by her brothers: the mentally damaged Benjy, the suicidal Quentin, and the monstrous Jason. Chronicling her quest to escape her family, the town in which they live as high-society-gone-to-seed, and the systemic poison of the post-bellum south, the voices in the novel fuse so that you are often not precisely certain who is speaking. At times the story breaks into narration by one of several of the family\u2019s former slaves. The sense of a house, a town and a country in a perpetual state of blindness, though speaking all the while, builds and builds through this masterpiece.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-forsyte-saga-9780141184180.html\">The Forsyte Saga by John Galsworthy</a></strong><br>The immense pleasure of this enormous novel is its breadth, moving slowly, magisterially forward through a wealth of characters, a mass of overlapping secrets, desires and ambitions. Such misunderstandings and false starts might undergird any family, but they centre here on Soames Forsyte, Galsworthy\u2019s \u201cMan of Property\u201d. Beginning in 1896 and ending in the 1920s, it is the saga of a nation seen through the particular lens of one of its families as much as it is a love story and the story of a house.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/20/arcadia-review-tom-stoppard\">Arcadia by Tom Stoppard</a></strong><br>Stoppard\u2019s 1993 play tells the tragic story of Thomasina Coverly, moving back and forth between two generations of her family, one in 1809 and the other in the present. The pathos of history \u2013 when the past doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s coming, and the present doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s past \u2013 is laid bare here. The play, which remains compelling on the page, alternates past and present while remaining in one place \u2013 the room of the family\u2019s estate \u2013 an image of the layering of history. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/11/top-10-dinner-parties-in-fiction\">Top 10 dinner parties in fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/31/the-swimmer-by-john-cheever-into-a-suburban-darkness\">The Swimmer by John Cheever</a><br></strong>Just as this list must begin with Gatsby, it must end with John Cheever\u2019s landmark short story from 1964. One midsummer Sunday afternoon, Neddy Merrill sits beside a friend\u2019s pool, one hand around a glass of gin, the other submerged in the water, and decides to swim the eight miles home, through friends\u2019 and neighbours\u2019 yards, from pool to pool. What begins as one man\u2019s lark, firmly rooted in the wealthy suburban world outside New York City, slowly grows into an allegory of the traps and cages of the rich, and of the desperate, physical yearning to swim out of oneself. Where Neddy Merrill finds himself when he reaches home is as hauntingly beautiful as that green light signalling the end of Gatsby\u2019s dream at the end of Daisy\u2019s dock.</p> <p><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/181/181876/the-guest-book/9780670920433.html\">T</a>he Guest Book by Sarah Blake is published by Viking.

The play, which remains compelling on the page, alternates past and present while remaining in one place \u2013 the room of the family\u2019s estate \u2013 an image of the layering of history. 10. The Swimmer by John Cheever Just as this list must begin with Gatsby, it must end with John Cheever\u2019s landmark short story from 1964. One midsummer Sunday afternoon, Neddy Merrill sits beside a friend\u2019s pool, one hand around a glass of gin, the other submerged in the water, and decides to swim the eight miles home, through friends\u2019 and neighbours\u2019 yards, from pool to pool. What begins as one man\u2019s lark, firmly rooted in the wealthy suburban world outside New York City, slowly grows into an allegory of the traps and cages of the rich, and of the desperate, physical yearning to swim out of oneself. Where Neddy Merrill finds himself when he reaches home is as hauntingly beautiful as that green light signalling the end of Gatsby\u2019s dream at the end of Daisy\u2019s dock. \u2022 The Guest Book by Sarah Blake is published by Viking.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Priti Patel, has bowed to pressure from rank-and-file police officers and is seeking to rip up changes to bail rules spearheaded by Theresa May. Patel has proposed doubling or trebling the length of pre-charge bail, which since 2017 has been limited to 28 days under changes drawn up by May when she was home secretary and implemented when she was prime minister. The proposals put out to consultation by Patel would delay the point at which magistrates\u2019 approval for the extension of bail is required from three months to six, nine or 12 months. May introduced the cap on pre-charge bail as part of the Policing and Crime Act 2017. The cap followed a series of high-profile cases, during which the suspect remained on bail for more than a year before ultimately being released without charge. Among the most notable cases was that of the broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, who backed the 28-day limit after he was placed on police bail for a year while officers investigated unfounded allegations of historical sexual abuse, which he always denied, before the case against him was dropped. He claimed lost earnings and legal fees had cost him more than \u00a3200,000. But the Police Federation, which represents tens of thousands of rank-and-file officers, has levelled severe and sustained criticism of May\u2019s changes since they were first proposed. The domestic abuse charity Women\u2019s Aid has previously called for the changes to be reversed as releasing suspects without bail conditions can leave abuse survivors unprotected while they wait for perpetrators to be charged. Patel said the proposals would provide a \u201cvoice to victims\u201d and give the police the support they need to protect the public from harm. Other changes include removing the presumption against pre-charge bail and allowing officers of a lower rank to authorise and extend pre-charge bail. A duty on officers to use pre-charge bail in cases where it is necessary and proportionate, including for cases where there are risks to victims and where it could prevent reoffending, is proposed. The Home Office said it would consult victims of crime as well as individuals who have been released under investigation about how the current system could be improved, as well as seeking views on the effectiveness of existing bail conditions. The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for bail management, the chief constable Darren Martland, said: \u201cIn the years since the bail legislation was amended, the police service has worked hard to implement the changes in the spirit they were introduced.

The language is deliberate in its exclusion of M\u0101ori as New Zealanders and dismissive of our mamae [pain]. Our anger is a bore and a buzzkill. He declined the opportunity to own those words at Waitangi in 2017, perhaps out of fear or contempt that he would be held accountable. We will never know \u2013 his party lost the election in September later that year.</p> <p>In 2017, the tide shifted. Labour spent five days on the whenua [land] to listen, reciprocate the manaakitanga [hospitality, generosity] shown and invest in kanohi kitea [physical presence, represent]. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern, hapu [pregnant] with baby Neve, made the promises of her government to M\u0101ori explicit. Her speech underlined the need for the government to be held accountable; a process which National, among others, had expropriated from M\u0101ori the year before. The change in tact was palpable \u2013 it rippled across the motu. </p> <p>In 2019, Labour returned. Murmurs of discontent were to be expected after what felt like a year of working groups, reviews and inquiries \u2013 a lot of talk; a lack of action. Anticipation for delivery was ripe. But Ardern stumbled on what should have been an easy question \u2013 the articles of Te Tiriti. She leaned on her M\u0101ori colleagues before deferring to the principles. Her whaik\u014drero reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to closing the gap between M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori. This, she said, should be a ubiquitous goal of any party; not to be politicised but to be measured against, and held accountable to.</p> <p>This year, Ardern\u2019s speech felt like much of the same. More adept and aware of her audience than opposition leader, Simon Bridges. But repetitive \u2013 more mahi [work] to be done; bridges built and bridges crossed. Again, she asked \u201chold me to account, and I will keep coming back here so you can do just that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/feb/04/forget-anti-racism-this-waitangi-day-demand-our-land-back\">Forget anti-racism.

      "bodyText": "This week, to mark Waitangi Day, the Guardian is publishing five pieces of commentary from M\u0101ori writers. Bill English once said of Waitangi Day that New Zealanders were bored of the spectacle \u2013 the unnecessary controversy \u2013 and deserved a more positive national day. The language is deliberate in its exclusion of M\u0101ori as New Zealanders and dismissive of our mamae [pain]. Our anger is a bore and a buzzkill. He declined the opportunity to own those words at Waitangi in 2017, perhaps out of fear or contempt that he would be held accountable. We will never know \u2013 his party lost the election in September later that year. In 2017, the tide shifted. Labour spent five days on the whenua [land] to listen, reciprocate the manaakitanga [hospitality, generosity] shown and invest in kanohi kitea [physical presence, represent]. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern, hapu [pregnant] with baby Neve, made the promises of her government to M\u0101ori explicit. Her speech underlined the need for the government to be held accountable; a process which National, among others, had expropriated from M\u0101ori the year before. The change in tact was palpable \u2013 it rippled across the motu. In 2019, Labour returned. Murmurs of discontent were to be expected after what felt like a year of working groups, reviews and inquiries \u2013 a lot of talk; a lack of action. Anticipation for delivery was ripe. But Ardern stumbled on what should have been an easy question \u2013 the articles of Te Tiriti. She leaned on her M\u0101ori colleagues before deferring to the principles. Her whaik\u014drero reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to closing the gap between M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori. This, she said, should be a ubiquitous goal of any party; not to be politicised but to be measured against, and held accountable to. This year, Ardern\u2019s speech felt like much of the same. More adept and aware of her audience than opposition leader, Simon Bridges. But repetitive \u2013 more mahi [work] to be done; bridges built and bridges crossed. Again, she asked \u201chold me to account, and I will keep coming back here so you can do just that.\u201d Labour\u2019s relationship with M\u0101ori is of course not solely epitomised by Ardern\u2019s speeches at Waitangi. Beyond the mahau [veranda] at Te Whare R\u016bnanga, the coalition government under her leadership has sown discord among M\u0101ori. This was most pronounced at Ihum\u0101tao and Ardern\u2019s indecisiveness as to whether to even visit the whenua [land], let alone intervene. On it went. Oranga Tamariki and the state\u2019s theft of our tamariki [children]. The government relinquishing any commitment to implementing a comprehensive Capital Gains Tax. Failures of Kiwibuild, and the M\u0101ori Housing initiative. The glue that bonds these issues, together with Ardern\u2019s leadership, her k\u014drero [speech] and the action \u2013 or inaction \u2013 of the coalition government, is accountability. Ardern found herself on the defensive at Waitangi last year, listing the policy developments made under her government.

Ardern\u2019s speeches endorse an inveterate position in the state\u2019s relationship to M\u0101ori.

Let me ask you a question: who is Katy Perry?</p> <p><strong>She is a singer and television reality show judge.</strong> Right. And where is she from?</p> <p><strong>She was born in Santa Barbara, California.</strong> OK. Now, is Santa Barbara in Britain?</p> <p><strong>No.</strong> Follow-up: is Santa Barbara in Asia?</p> <p><strong>No?</strong> Right! Santa Barbara is nowhere near Asia. Now, knowing that Perry is an American woman from Santa Barbara who is neither British or Asian, would you choose her to be an ambassador for an organisation called the British Asian Trust?</p> <p><strong>This feels like a trap. Is the answer \u201cno\u201d?</strong> Yes, the answer is \u201cno\u201d. Nobody in their right mind would look at Perry \u2013 a woman who wore a stars and stripes dress to a Hillary Clinton rally and ended her Super Bowl halftime show by shouting: \u201cGod bless America\u201d \u2013 and think: \u201cThere\u2019s a woman who inhabits the values of the British Asian community.\u201d And yet, on Tuesday night, Prince Charles did just that.</p> <p><strong>Now steady on, </strong><strong>Perry has British ancestry.</strong> Oh, come on, that hardly counts.</p> <p><strong>Well, OK, she was married to Russell Brand and is engaged to Orlando Bloom, and they are both British.</strong> Oh. good for her. How about I go and have relationships with a load of Belgian people so that I can score a non-executive role with the Union des progressistes juifs de Belgique?</p> <p><strong>But it\u2019s different with </strong><strong>Bloom.</strong> She recently told Vogue India that they\u2019re on an \u2018\u201cemotional and spiritual journey\u201d together. It\u2019s like \u201ca never-ending cleanse\u201d, she said. So she is in touch with her emotions. If anything that makes her even less British.</p> <p><strong>Why did Prince Charles ask her, then?</strong> According to the speech he gave, it is because Perry has a \u201clong-standing commitment to charitable causes around the world\u201d.</p> <p><strong>That makes sense.</strong> Hardly specific, though, is it? Lots of people have a long-standing commitment to charitable causes around the world. You would hope at least some of them were more British and/or Asian than Perry.</p> <p><strong>But there are plenty of British Asian ambassadors of the trust.</strong> Asad Ahmad, Azhar Mahmood, Nihal Arthanayake, Dr Zaf Iqbal, Gurinder Chadha, Konnie Huq, James Caan \u2026 That still makes Perry a weird anomaly.</p> <p><strong>So what does the British Asian Trust do? </strong>It campaigns against child labour in India.</p> <p><strong>OK, let me get this straight. Prince Charles asked </strong><strong>Perry if she would like to join the fight against child labour in India?</strong> Yes, that\u2019s right.</p> <p><strong>And you\u2019re angry at her for saying yes? </strong>Well, I mean it isn\u2019t quite as simple as that, but \u2026</p> <p><strong>Would you say no in her position? Would you say: \u201cNo, Prince Charles, you\u2019re fine. I\u2019m actually quite OK with the notion of Indian child labour, all things considered\u201d?</strong> No, of course I wouldn\u2019t. What I\u2019m trying to say is the complications of \u2026</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re a monster.</strong> Yes, fine, I\u2019m a monster.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cKaty Perry is the new ambassador for the British Asian Trust.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cPresumably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/31/ghost-in-the-shells-whitewashing-does-hollywood-have-an-asian-problem\" title=\"\">Scarlett Johansson</a> was busy.\u201d</p>",

Nobody in their right mind would look at Perry \u2013 a woman who wore a stars and stripes dress to a Hillary Clinton rally and ended her Super Bowl halftime show by shouting: \u201cGod bless America\u201d \u2013 and think: \u201cThere\u2019s a woman who inhabits the values of the British Asian community.\u201d And yet, on Tuesday night, Prince Charles did just that. Now steady on, Perry has British ancestry. Oh, come on, that hardly counts. Well, OK, she was married to Russell Brand and is engaged to Orlando Bloom, and they are both British. Oh. good for her. How about I go and have relationships with a load of Belgian people so that I can score a non-executive role with the Union des progressistes juifs de Belgique? But it\u2019s different with Bloom. She recently told Vogue India that they\u2019re on an \u2018\u201cemotional and spiritual journey\u201d together. It\u2019s like \u201ca never-ending cleanse\u201d, she said. So she is in touch with her emotions. If anything that makes her even less British. Why did Prince Charles ask her, then? According to the speech he gave, it is because Perry has a \u201clong-standing commitment to charitable causes around the world\u201d. That makes sense. Hardly specific, though, is it? Lots of people have a long-standing commitment to charitable causes around the world. You would hope at least some of them were more British and/or Asian than Perry. But there are plenty of British Asian ambassadors of the trust. Asad Ahmad, Azhar Mahmood, Nihal Arthanayake, Dr Zaf Iqbal, Gurinder Chadha, Konnie Huq, James Caan \u2026 That still makes Perry a weird anomaly. So what does the British Asian Trust do? It campaigns against child labour in India. OK, let me get this straight. Prince Charles asked Perry if she would like to join the fight against child labour in India? Yes, that\u2019s right. And you\u2019re angry at her for saying yes? Well, I mean it isn\u2019t quite as simple as that, but \u2026 Would you say no in her position? Would you say: \u201cNo, Prince Charles, you\u2019re fine. I\u2019m actually quite OK with the notion of Indian child labour, all things considered\u201d? No, of course I wouldn\u2019t. What I\u2019m trying to say is the complications of \u2026 You\u2019re a monster. Yes, fine, I\u2019m a monster. Do say: \u201cKaty Perry is the new ambassador for the British Asian Trust.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cPresumably Scarlett Johansson was busy.\u201d",

So she chose an <a href=\"https://jobs.axa.co.uk/early-careers/apprenticeships\" title=\"\">apprenticeship at insurance giant Axa</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a no-brainer,\u201d Binge says of the underwriting apprenticeship she started in 2016, evaluating and pricing risk in Bolton. \u201cI\u2019m not stuck with debt.

School-leavers can skip university and train to become a banker, paralegal or software developer through an apprenticeship.</p> <p>Many employers now offer the best of both worlds: degree apprenticeships that combine university study with on-the-job learning. In 2017, Morrisons teamed up with the University of Bradford and Sheffield Hallam University to create four degree apprenticeships in retail, logistics, manufacturing, and corporate teams.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e98d3e2769a74fda060feef195fcddc15148a238\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e98d3e2769a74fda060feef195fcddc15148a238/0_0_4032_6048/667.jpg\" alt=\"Apprenticeships for Deloitte Press Handout for Apprenticeships Supplement\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At Deloitte, up to 350 school-leavers will be hired for the BrightStart apprenticeship programme in 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deloitte</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The grocer hopes to hire 57 more degree apprentices in 2020.

Morrisons pays them a full salary and covers the full cost of attending university.</p> <p>Alison Guest, a senior people manager, says of the scheme: \u201cIt\u2019s tremendous. These young people flourish. They are key to the future of Morrisons.\u201d</p> <p>In part, the company created the programme in response to the apprenticeship levy, a payroll tax on big business that can be clawed back to spend on apprenticeships. A target for large public sector firms to employ at least 2.3% of staff as apprentices every year until 2021, is also increasing opportunities for school-leavers, says Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the Institute of Student Employers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/05/what-are-apprenticeships-how-long-do-they-take-questions-answered\">What are apprenticeships? Essential questions answered</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Companies say they value apprentices for their innate technology skills and diversity of backgrounds. In 2017, Axa scrapped two of its three graduate schemes to improve social mobility. Like at many companies, the intakes tended to come from private schools, says Emma Austen, head of employer brand and professional qualifications.</p> <p>Since 2017, Axa\u2019s crop of new and existing apprentices has grown in number from 17 to 130. Anecdotally, Austen says they come from a wider range of socioeconomic backgrounds than graduates because the financial barrier to an apprenticeship is lower than for university. \u201cTo serve our customers best we need people in the workforce who are replicas of our customers,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>At Deloitte, up to 350 school-leavers will be hired for the <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/careers/articles/brightstart-business-apprenticeship-scheme.html\" title=\"\">BrightStart apprenticeship programme</a> in 2020. Initially, they will earn less than the professional service firm\u2019s graduate intake, which reflects the latter\u2019s extra education. But on completion of their respective training schemes, the two intakes are on a par, in terms of salary and seniority (assistant manager or an equivalent rank in their business area, from audit to real estate).</p> <p>Other than the apprentices\u2019 younger age, there is little difference between the two intakes, says Georgia Greer, head of student recruitment, with both groups working with clients from day one. \u201cOur career opportunities are based on merit,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jan/29/charity-grants-to-crowdsourcing-how-to-pay-for-a-postgraduate-degree\">Charity grants to crowdsourcing: how to pay for a postgraduate degree</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Civil Service apprentices can progress fast. Those with A-levels earn about \u00a323,000 initially. Within a decade they could manage a team and earn around \u00a350,000 working in government departments, bodies or agencies such as HMRC. \u201cWe offer mentoring and coaching and the chance to move between departments to learn and grow,\u201d says Jacqui Toogood, interim deputy director of early talent.</p> <p>But competition for places on top schemes can be intense: Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer hires just a handful of paralegal apprentices each year. Olivia Balson, director of the law firm\u2019s service centre, recommends showcasing soft skills such as communication, as legal knowledge is gained on the apprenticeship.</p> <p>She also encourages people to apply: \u201cWe want to open up access to the legal profession beyond those who can afford to go to university.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Emily Binge finished A-levels at Pendleton sixth form college in Salford, she did not follow many of her friends who flocked to university. The 21-year-old was in part deterred by the debt she would incur, with undergraduates expected to owe an average of \u00a350,800, according to the IFS. So she chose an apprenticeship at insurance giant Axa. \u201cIt was a no-brainer,\u201d Binge says of the underwriting apprenticeship she started in 2016, evaluating and pricing risk in Bolton. \u201cI\u2019m not stuck with debt. I\u2019m earning money and gaining hands-on experience.\u201d She is also earning professional qualifications from the Chartered Insurance Institute. Apprenticeships offer abundant avenues into elite professions. School-leavers can skip university and train to become a banker, paralegal or software developer through an apprenticeship. Many employers now offer the best of both worlds: degree apprenticeships that combine university study with on-the-job learning. In 2017, Morrisons teamed up with the University of Bradford and Sheffield Hallam University to create four degree apprenticeships in retail, logistics, manufacturing, and corporate teams. The grocer hopes to hire 57 more degree apprentices in 2020. The recruits are released for week-long blocks of study at university six times each year, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in business management or retail leadership in three years. Morrisons pays them a full salary and covers the full cost of attending university. Alison Guest, a senior people manager, says of the scheme: \u201cIt\u2019s tremendous. These young people flourish. They are key to the future of Morrisons.\u201d In part, the company created the programme in response to the apprenticeship levy, a payroll tax on big business that can be clawed back to spend on apprenticeships. A target for large public sector firms to employ at least 2.3% of staff as apprentices every year until 2021, is also increasing opportunities for school-leavers, says Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the Institute of Student Employers. Companies say they value apprentices for their innate technology skills and diversity of backgrounds. In 2017, Axa scrapped two of its three graduate schemes to improve social mobility. Like at many companies, the intakes tended to come from private schools, says Emma Austen, head of employer brand and professional qualifications. Since 2017, Axa\u2019s crop of new and existing apprentices has grown in number from 17 to 130. Anecdotally, Austen says they come from a wider range of socioeconomic backgrounds than graduates because the financial barrier to an apprenticeship is lower than for university. \u201cTo serve our customers best we need people in the workforce who are replicas of our customers,\u201d she adds. At Deloitte, up to 350 school-leavers will be hired for the BrightStart apprenticeship programme in 2020. Initially, they will earn less than the professional service firm\u2019s graduate intake, which reflects the latter\u2019s extra education. But on completion of their respective training schemes, the two intakes are on a par, in terms of salary and seniority (assistant manager or an equivalent rank in their business area, from audit to real estate). Other than the apprentices\u2019 younger age, there is little difference between the two intakes, says Georgia Greer, head of student recruitment, with both groups working with clients from day one. \u201cOur career opportunities are based on merit,\u201d she says. Civil Service apprentices can progress fast. Those with A-levels earn about \u00a323,000 initially. Within a decade they could manage a team and earn around \u00a350,000 working in government departments, bodies or agencies such as HMRC. \u201cWe offer mentoring and coaching and the chance to move between departments to learn and grow,\u201d says Jacqui Toogood, interim deputy director of early talent. But competition for places on top schemes can be intense: Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer hires just a handful of paralegal apprentices each year. Olivia Balson, director of the law firm\u2019s service centre, recommends showcasing soft skills such as communication, as legal knowledge is gained on the apprenticeship. She also encourages people to apply: \u201cWe want to open up access to the legal profession beyond those who can afford to go to university.\u201d",

Thumbnails by Felicity Cloake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Local resident Jeanne Strang notes that \u201cas it is hard work to beat the mixture, this is traditionally the role of the man of the house, sometimes even assisted by another strong man\u201d. Fortunately, if you\u2019re making it in domestic quantities, you don\u2019t need to be a man, let along a strong one, to make perfect aligot.</p> <h2>Potatoes</h2> <p>Though Fran\u00e7ois-R\u00e9gis Gaudry\u2019s gloriously comprehensive book Let\u2019s Eat France informs me that aligot was bread-based until a series of failed wheat harvests in the 17th century (the curious should note that <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2791988-french-regional-cooking\" title=\"\">Anne Willan\u2019s French Regional Cooking</a> contains a recipe using bread), potatoes are now de rigeur. As <a href=\"https://www.countrylife.co.uk/food-drink/recipes/greatest-recipes-ever-elizabeth-davids-cheesy-potato-25014\" title=\"\">Elizabeth David notes in French Provincial Cooking</a>, it\u2019s one of the few French potato dishes suited to the floury varieties more common in the UK. <a href=\"https://culturecheesemag.com/recipes/french-cheese-dip-aligot\" title=\"\">Many American recipes use waxy potatoes</a>, whose lower starch content does not make them ideal for this purpose, though if that\u2019s all you have, by all means use them. Moderately floury potatoes such as Rooster, maris pipers or desiree are much better (I only list them in such length because potato buying can be confusing in the UK, with spuds labelled simply as \u201croasting\u201d or \u201csalad\u201d, rather than anything more specific, so do check the small print).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dbc5de141121dae52115ea67a6cbf2ce396bb504\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbc5de141121dae52115ea67a6cbf2ce396bb504/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Geraldene Holt\u2019s aligot: \u2018a generous dollop of creme fraiche\u2019.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geraldene Holt\u2019s aligot: \u2018A generous dollop of creme fraiche.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starch is important both for absorbing all that melted cheese and for giving the dish its characteristic elasticity. According to <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mIVKCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1186&amp;lpg=PT1186&amp;dq=starch+aligot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D0YEPTMA9m&amp;sig=ACfU3U0VApDGl0A_hKZwugz4ANAWO6jldQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjggNPKtIDnAhVXi1wKHQL0DNgQ6AEwEHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">The Cook\u2019s Illustrated Science of Good Cooking</a>, \u201cas it turns out, there is something different about the starch in potatoes that makes it possible to form the super stretch of aligot. Unlike the starch from other plants, the molecules in potato starch contain a small number of negative electrical charges. When combined with cheese proteins, parts of which contain positive electrical charges, an electrical bond between the two is created [and] the combination becomes very springy and stretchy.\u201d</p> <p>To retain as much starch in the potato as possible, I\u2019d advise cooking them whole in their skins, then peeling the skins off afterwards, like Strang, Diana Henry, <a href=\"https://geraldeneholtcom.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Geraldene Holt</a> and Elizabeth David (who watched the dish being made in a hotel kitchen in Entraygues after hearing about it from \u201ca very ancient lady in the shop where I was buying local cooking pots\u201d). It takes a bit longer, but the peeling is much faster, and you end up with drier potatoes to boot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c2782ade9800acdeb3ee1259a923314724515ac0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2782ade9800acdeb3ee1259a923314724515ac0/0_0_1440_1800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Morgan McGlynn\u2019s aligot: \u2018a spring in its step\u2019.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morgan McGlynn\u2019s aligot has \u2018a spring in its step\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The mashing</h2> <p>What aligot does have in common with other French mashed potato recipes, however, is an almost sinister smoothness. In theory, all mashed, rather than crushed, potatoes ought to be smooth, but here I mean <em>really</em> smooth, silky-smooth: as smooth as a newly waxed leg in sheer tights, which is a goal that\u2019s easier to achieve with a food mill or potato ricer than a standard British masher. Some recipes suggest using a food processor in shocking contravention of the <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/11/how-to-make-mashed-potatoes-thanksgiving-sides-fluffy-creamy.html\" title=\"\">accepted wisdom that cooked potatoes + mechanical blades = glue</a>. Actually, glue isn\u2019t unhelpful if you\u2019re after a show-stoppingly stretchy consistency, but it can\u2019t be denied that creamy is preferable to gluey, so if you\u2019re able to put in the elbow grease yourself, it\u2019s worth it here.</p> <h2>The cheese</h2> <p>Potatoes may be easy to source in this country, but <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tome_fra%C3%AEche\" title=\"\">tomme fraiche</a> or tomme de l\u2019Aubrac, the cheese traditionally used for aligot, is not, so this recipe is necessarily a compromise. Tomme is a category of small, round, squidgy cheese found in many regions of France, but the tomme used for aligot is a very young, unsalted example, with a mild, slightly acidic flavour that is very hard to find abroad. This means the older tommes often suggested as substitutes, such as cantal or savoie, tend to be too strong, as are the cheddar, gruy\u00e8re, beaufort and other Alpine cheeses that also pop up in many recipes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"25053eb2419d212e85df37d12ed6372227b162e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25053eb2419d212e85df37d12ed6372227b162e8/0_0_2712_2712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Babybel aligot: \u2018bland and slightly bouncy\u2019.

Remember, aligot ought to be elastic, but never rubbery.</p> <p>Many older recipes tell you to add the cheese in thin slices, rather than grating it in. I try both methods, and I\u2019m still puzzled why it would make any difference: all suggestions appreciated.</p> <p>But, however you cut it, you\u2019ll need to make sure the potato mixture is still warm enough to melt the cheese, so put the pan back over a very low heat, or if you\u2019re nervous of it sticking, use a bain-marie, as Ferguson does, because I can confirm you\u2019ll need a determined dog to clean the pan if it does. You\u2019ll also have to beat the mixture hard; Stein and Erskine recommend using a whisk, but you\u2019ll need a strong one, or a strong arm and a wooden spoon. Local lore says you should stir the pan in only one direction, but I\u2019m ambivalent on this point.</p> <h2>The dairy</h2> <p>Though you might think cheese needed no extra gilding, all the recipes I try add extra dairy \u2013 often butter, but always cream, whether single, double or cultured in the form of creme fraiche; only Stein adds milk instead. I don\u2019t think that butter is necessary, mostly because I like to eat aligot in quantity, and butter makes it too rich to do this comfortably. But a generous dollop of creme fraiche, as in Holt and Gaudry\u2019s versions, helps amplify the natural tanginess of the cheese, while milk loosens the texture, so it slides satisfyingly around the plate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4a4c635850cf3c15fd339ae495506391d6b8b13d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a4c635850cf3c15fd339ae495506391d6b8b13d/0_0_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Perfect aligot: Lancashire cheese, and a bit of mozzarella, with a dash of creme fraiche and garlic.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect aligot features lancashire cheese, a bit of mozzarella, and a dash each of creme fraiche and garlic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Seasonings</h2> <p>Garlic is popular, but not mandatory \u2013 Stein, Holt, Ferguson and David all use it, McGlynn and Erskine do not, while <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=psWIDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT794&amp;lpg=PT794&amp;dq=elisabeth+luard+aligot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gdw3d-fKDr&amp;sig=ACfU3U3uVRQASiLXlZpzce1lXJL7olvz7w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjL5f3twYXnAhWkRxUIHVR3B_8Q6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=elisabeth%20luard%20aligot&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Elisabeth Luard rubs the pot with a cut clove as a halfway house</a>.

      "bodyText": "A speciality of Auvergne in south-west France, where it\u2019s claimed it was created by the monks of Aubrac to serve hungry pilgrims on their way to Compostela, aligot \u2013 or \u201cmagical cheesy mashed potato\u201d, as cheesemonger Morgan McGlynn puts it \u2013 is one of those dishes I\u2019d certainly walk 500 miles and more for. Silky-smooth pommes puree enriched with generous amounts of cheese, its extraordinary stretchiness has propelled it into the global spotlight in recent years \u2013 indeed, my Tokyo correspondent reports that aligot has become \u201ca bit of a cult food in Japan\u201d. But it\u2019s still a popular dish at village fetes, weddings and markets in its home region, where the theatre of its preparation is an attraction in itself. Local resident Jeanne Strang notes that \u201cas it is hard work to beat the mixture, this is traditionally the role of the man of the house, sometimes even assisted by another strong man\u201d. Fortunately, if you\u2019re making it in domestic quantities, you don\u2019t need to be a man, let along a strong one, to make perfect aligot. Potatoes Though Fran\u00e7ois-R\u00e9gis Gaudry\u2019s gloriously comprehensive book Let\u2019s Eat France informs me that aligot was bread-based until a series of failed wheat harvests in the 17th century (the curious should note that Anne Willan\u2019s French Regional Cooking contains a recipe using bread), potatoes are now de rigeur. As Elizabeth David notes in French Provincial Cooking, it\u2019s one of the few French potato dishes suited to the floury varieties more common in the UK. Many American recipes use waxy potatoes, whose lower starch content does not make them ideal for this purpose, though if that\u2019s all you have, by all means use them. Moderately floury potatoes such as Rooster, maris pipers or desiree are much better (I only list them in such length because potato buying can be confusing in the UK, with spuds labelled simply as \u201croasting\u201d or \u201csalad\u201d, rather than anything more specific, so do check the small print). Starch is important both for absorbing all that melted cheese and for giving the dish its characteristic elasticity. According to The Cook\u2019s Illustrated Science of Good Cooking, \u201cas it turns out, there is something different about the starch in potatoes that makes it possible to form the super stretch of aligot. Unlike the starch from other plants, the molecules in potato starch contain a small number of negative electrical charges. When combined with cheese proteins, parts of which contain positive electrical charges, an electrical bond between the two is created [and] the combination becomes very springy and stretchy.\u201d To retain as much starch in the potato as possible, I\u2019d advise cooking them whole in their skins, then peeling the skins off afterwards, like Strang, Diana Henry, Geraldene Holt and Elizabeth David (who watched the dish being made in a hotel kitchen in Entraygues after hearing about it from \u201ca very ancient lady in the shop where I was buying local cooking pots\u201d). It takes a bit longer, but the peeling is much faster, and you end up with drier potatoes to boot. The mashing What aligot does have in common with other French mashed potato recipes, however, is an almost sinister smoothness. In theory, all mashed, rather than crushed, potatoes ought to be smooth, but here I mean really smooth, silky-smooth: as smooth as a newly waxed leg in sheer tights, which is a goal that\u2019s easier to achieve with a food mill or potato ricer than a standard British masher. Some recipes suggest using a food processor in shocking contravention of the accepted wisdom that cooked potatoes + mechanical blades = glue. Actually, glue isn\u2019t unhelpful if you\u2019re after a show-stoppingly stretchy consistency, but it can\u2019t be denied that creamy is preferable to gluey, so if you\u2019re able to put in the elbow grease yourself, it\u2019s worth it here. The cheese Potatoes may be easy to source in this country, but tomme fraiche or tomme de l\u2019Aubrac, the cheese traditionally used for aligot, is not, so this recipe is necessarily a compromise. Tomme is a category of small, round, squidgy cheese found in many regions of France, but the tomme used for aligot is a very young, unsalted example, with a mild, slightly acidic flavour that is very hard to find abroad. This means the older tommes often suggested as substitutes, such as cantal or savoie, tend to be too strong, as are the cheddar, gruy\u00e8re, beaufort and other Alpine cheeses that also pop up in many recipes. I even have a go with Babybel, on a slightly flippant suggestion from chef Alex Jackson (who only uses the real deal when he has aligot on the menu at his London restaurant Sardine). I can confirm the bland flavour and slightly bouncy texture work pretty well \u2013 the same goes for the emmental deployed by Rick Stein in his new book, Secret France. In fact, they all yield delicious results, because they\u2019re cheesy mashed potato (the version I try with gubbeen from cheesemonger Giana Ferguson\u2019s cookbook of the same name deserves a particular mention in this department). But for a flavour that\u2019s as close as possible to the original, you need something mild, with a lactic tang, but not too much salt. David and Holt\u2019s French Country Kitchen both instead recommend caerphilly, \u201ca mild cheese that melts easily\u201d \u2013 and indeed, the flavour profile of both caerphilly and crumbly lancashire are suitably acidic. Even better, however, is cheshire \u2013 the modern, supermarket sort, rather than the rightly lauded old-fashioned type made by the likes of Appleby\u2019s, which has less salt and a fresh, almost lemony bite. But to my disappointment, cheshire does not melt easily, so the best compromise I find is creamy lancashire \u2013 milder and milkier than the crumbly kind, but perfect for this purpose. Not what you might expect in a Gallic classic, perhaps, but then, this Gallic classic might not be quite as you might imagine if you\u2019ve watched waiters or stall-holders stretching the potatoes several feet in the air to prove their extraordinary elasticity. Interestingly, it seems this could be a relatively recent development in aligot\u2019s long history; David, writing in 1960, makes no reference to it, and Strang simply describes the dish as \u201ccreamy\u201d. That said, given tomme fraiche is naturally rather stringy when melted, I\u2019d recommend also sneaking in a bit of mozzarella, as McGlynn and Gizzi Erskine\u2019s Slow suggest, to give your aligot a little spring in its step. How much you add depends on how extreme you\u2019d like the end result to be, so I\u2019ve provided a range below. McGlynn\u2019s recipe in The Modern Cheesemaker suggests 900g gruy\u00e8re and 450g mozzarella to 1.5kg potatoes, which gives an extremely satisfying, stretchy consistency, but you may want to dial down the cheese content, because, as Holt notes, \u201cit largely depends on the nature of the rest of the meal\u201d (and perhaps the state of your arteries, though really, anyone with concerns in that department should probably steer clear of this recipe in the first place). Remember, aligot ought to be elastic, but never rubbery. Many older recipes tell you to add the cheese in thin slices, rather than grating it in. I try both methods, and I\u2019m still puzzled why it would make any difference: all suggestions appreciated. But, however you cut it, you\u2019ll need to make sure the potato mixture is still warm enough to melt the cheese, so put the pan back over a very low heat, or if you\u2019re nervous of it sticking, use a bain-marie, as Ferguson does, because I can confirm you\u2019ll need a determined dog to clean the pan if it does. You\u2019ll also have to beat the mixture hard; Stein and Erskine recommend using a whisk, but you\u2019ll need a strong one, or a strong arm and a wooden spoon. Local lore says you should stir the pan in only one direction, but I\u2019m ambivalent on this point. The dairy Though you might think cheese needed no extra gilding, all the recipes I try add extra dairy \u2013 often butter, but always cream, whether single, double or cultured in the form of creme fraiche; only Stein adds milk instead. I don\u2019t think that butter is necessary, mostly because I like to eat aligot in quantity, and butter makes it too rich to do this comfortably. But a generous dollop of creme fraiche, as in Holt and Gaudry\u2019s versions, helps amplify the natural tanginess of the cheese, while milk loosens the texture, so it slides satisfyingly around the plate. Seasonings Garlic is popular, but not mandatory \u2013 Stein, Holt, Ferguson and David all use it, McGlynn and Erskine do not, while Elisabeth Luard rubs the pot with a cut clove as a halfway house. Do as you will. Salt to taste, and add white pepper, as Erskine suggests, for a hint of heat. I also very much enjoy her addition of nutmeg, though I suspect the Auvergnats would strongly disapprove. Still, what you do in the privacy of your own own home is up to you. Serve with sausages, as is the local custom, and a glass of rustic red.

Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Neil Basu said there could have been a point earlier in Amman\u2019s life when he could have been diverted from hate and violence, but the moment had passed. And he warned further attacks would happen as police and the security services were dealing with 3,000 subjects of interest and could not \u201cwatch all of them all the time\u201d. His comments come after his boss, the Met commissioner Cressida Dick, defended the surveillance team that was tailing Amman before he stabbed two people on Streatham High Road on Sunday, 10 days after his release from prison. The government has subsequently unveiled plans to retrospectively alter the conditions of jail sentences imposed on terrorist offenders to ensure none of them are automatically released before their full term is spent. Basu said: \u201cPolice and the security services knew the attacker posed a significant risk and we were, unfortunately, proved right in our decision to place him under surveillance. \u201cBut with 3,000 or so subjects of interest currently on our radar and many convicted terrorists soon due to be released from prison, we simply cannot watch all of them all the time. \u201cPart of the solution must be ensuring that those who pose the greatest threat to our society are removed from it, and so my colleagues and I are supportive of the government\u2019s plans to strengthen our ability to keep the most dangerous terrorists locked up for longer.\u201d Basu said Amman\u2019s case reinforced the importance of Prevent, a controversial anti-radicalisation programme that sees thousands of individuals referred to authorities over suspicions they may turn to terrorism. He said: \u201cWe know that rehabilitating and deradicalising terrorist offenders is incredibly difficult.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy rebounded in January as fading political uncertainty since Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory helped service sector companies record the strongest upturn in activity since mid-2018. The services sector \u2013 which includes banking, insurance, restaurants and hotels \u2013 makes up about 80% of the economy. According to the latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, business activity grew for the first time since August. Powered by a rise in domestic activity as exports remained muted, service firms reported that greater clarity over the political outlook had bolstered consumer spending and business investment across the country. The IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers index (PMI) for the sector rose to 53.9 last month, the highest since September 2018. The reading was slightly above initial estimates of 52.9, on a scale where a reading below 50 signals contraction. Staff hiring increased, while the prospect of faster political decision-making led to an upturn in companies\u2019 willingness to spend, according to the PMI survey. Tim Moore, an economics associate director at IHS Markit, said the PMI readings indicated that GDP would rise by about 0.2% in the first quarter of the year \u2013 a marked turnaround from the end of 2019 when growth, in effect, stalled. \u201cSigns of greater willingness to spend and renewed positivity about the domestic economic outlook has helped lift service providers\u2019 growth projections to the highest for just under five years,\u201d he said. Despite the rise in optimism, economists cautioned that the survey of about 650 service sector companies was conducted before the coronavirus outbreak hit business activity in China. Analysts have warned that quarantine efforts in the country could drag down growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy, with spillover effects for other countries. The PMI also showed that orders for UK service sector companies from the EU remained sluggish as continuing Brexit uncertainty dented demand in January. Although early snapshots indicate a bounce for the economy since the Conservatives\u2019 unexpectedly decisive election victory, analysts warn that the complexity of Brexit negotiations could increase political uncertainty again towards the end of the year. Johnson has promised that Britain will come out of the Brexit transition period, which maintains free trade with the EU until the end of December, with or without a comprehensive new trade agreement with Brussels. Chris Sood-Nicholls, the head of professional services at Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cThe mood among firms is currently one of cautious optimism as the pipeline of work put on ice in 2019 begins to flow again. However, many are acutely aware of the reality that we are not out of the woods yet.\u201d",

International coverage of China\u2019s response has tempered expressions of concern about the country\u2019s authoritarian politics with awe. Yes, Xi Jinping is an autocrat, the thinking seems to be, but he\u2019s also a pragmatist. \u201cLogistically, it\u2019s stunning,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-china-hubei.html\" title=\"\">US public health expert William Schaffner said</a> of the Wuhan quarantine. \u201cIt was done so quickly.\u201d</p> <p>This wonder at China\u2019s logistical prowess is symptomatic of a recurrent trope among western commentators. We might call it the \u201cif we could just be China for a day\u201d view. For free-market economies such as Britain and the US, where the private sector has replaced state-run enterprises and public investment in infrastructure has shrunk over decades, China can seem like a miracle. The GDP of its state-controlled economy has <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=CN\" title=\"\">more than doubled in the past decade</a>, while its technology companies rival the giants of Silicon Valley. The journalist Thomas Friedman, for example, periodically claims that although he wouldn\u2019t want to see China\u2019s political model become an international standard, he enjoys fantasising about how <a href=\"https://www.mrc.org/articles/friedman-again-hails-communist-chinas-one-party-autocracy-superior-american-democracy\" title=\"\">dramatically his country\u2019s infrastructure could be improved</a> were Beijing\u2019s engineer-leaders free to work their magic.</p> <p>But when it comes to a public health epidemic, there are worrying limits to the Chinese Communist party\u2019s control. To maintain authority, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) must convince the public that everything is going to plan. This hampers its ability to respond to epidemics. Although the first case of coronavirus was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51245373\" title=\"\">reported on 8 December</a>, the Wuhan health authorities took more than three weeks to issue a notice. As New York Times reporters Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers have found, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">doctor Li Wenliang warned an online chat group on 30 December</a> of a mysterious illness in the city, but was subsequently required to sign a police statement that his warning constituted \u201cillegal behaviour\u201d. In <a href=\"http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2019123108989\" title=\"\">a statement published the following day on its website</a>, the Wuhan health authority announced that 27 people were affected by pneumonia \u2013 and said the disease was \u201cpreventable and controllable\u201d.</p> <p>The Sars disease rippled across the world in 2003, helped in part by the Communist party\u2019s attempts to conceal its spread for months. During the Sars outbreak, Hong Kong had greater press freedom than mainland China.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhat is the news from China?\u201d are the words that open the 1900 book World-Crisis in China, though they could equally apply to coverage of coronavirus. The short account of an anti-Christian uprising towards the end of China\u2019s Qing dynasty, written by the journalist Allen Sinclair Will, documented \u201ca startling succession of events that seem destined to shake the world\u201d. Today, a different crisis is unfolding across the country. An outbreak that began in the city of Wuhan, capital of China\u2019s Hubei province, has infected more than 20,000 people. The World Health Organization has declared it a \u201cglobal health emergency\u201d. Coronavirus has thrown light on the sheer logistical power of the Chinese state. In a matter of days, the Communist party erected a hospital that would take months to build elsewhere. It has used drones equipped with speakers to force citizens to wear face masks and shut down 16 cities across the country, quarantining an estimated 50 million people. China\u2019s railway operator is using big data to track down passengers who were in the same carriage as those who contracted the virus. International coverage of China\u2019s response has tempered expressions of concern about the country\u2019s authoritarian politics with awe. Yes, Xi Jinping is an autocrat, the thinking seems to be, but he\u2019s also a pragmatist. \u201cLogistically, it\u2019s stunning,\u201d the US public health expert William Schaffner said of the Wuhan quarantine. \u201cIt was done so quickly.\u201d This wonder at China\u2019s logistical prowess is symptomatic of a recurrent trope among western commentators. We might call it the \u201cif we could just be China for a day\u201d view. For free-market economies such as Britain and the US, where the private sector has replaced state-run enterprises and public investment in infrastructure has shrunk over decades, China can seem like a miracle. The GDP of its state-controlled economy has more than doubled in the past decade, while its technology companies rival the giants of Silicon Valley. The journalist Thomas Friedman, for example, periodically claims that although he wouldn\u2019t want to see China\u2019s political model become an international standard, he enjoys fantasising about how dramatically his country\u2019s infrastructure could be improved were Beijing\u2019s engineer-leaders free to work their magic. But when it comes to a public health epidemic, there are worrying limits to the Chinese Communist party\u2019s control. To maintain authority, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) must convince the public that everything is going to plan. This hampers its ability to respond to epidemics. Although the first case of coronavirus was reported on 8 December, the Wuhan health authorities took more than three weeks to issue a notice. As New York Times reporters Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers have found, the doctor Li Wenliang warned an online chat group on 30 December of a mysterious illness in the city, but was subsequently required to sign a police statement that his warning constituted \u201cillegal behaviour\u201d. In a statement published the following day on its website, the Wuhan health authority announced that 27 people were affected by pneumonia \u2013 and said the disease was \u201cpreventable and controllable\u201d. The Sars disease rippled across the world in 2003, helped in part by the Communist party\u2019s attempts to conceal its spread for months. During the Sars outbreak, Hong Kong had greater press freedom than mainland China. This helped accurate information come to light there, mitigating some of the damage of China\u2019s attempts at an official cover-up. The Chinese government\u2019s grip over the internet, media and civil society has tightened dramatically since the Sars outbreak. Under Xi\u2019s rule, the party has taken an increasingly hardline stance towards Hong Kong, attempting to crush democratic protests and bring the territory under tighter control, while its censors have worked diligently to scrub the internet across the mainland of anything that diverges from the party\u2019s line. Articles and comments about coronavirus continue to be deleted online and the government has issued warnings against spreading \u201crumours\u201d. While the party claims to be learning everything it can from the Sars crisis, it seems blind to important lessons. That Beijing is determined to prevent Taiwan from joining the World Health Organization is another glaring example of how party ideologies have trumped pragmatism. Taiwan has long functioned as a self-governing country, but the CCP insists it is part of Chinese territory. Following in the footsteps of organisations such as Interpol, the WHO has acceded to Beijing\u2019s wishes, blocking Taiwan from attending emergency briefings. This has slowed the country\u2019s access to international health information \u2013 despite Taiwan already counting 10 cases of coronavirus.

Trump brags of \u2018great American comeback\u2019 amid walkouts Hours before his near-inevitable acquittal by the US Senate, Donald Trump on Tuesday delivered a State of the Union address so divisive and bullish that it prompted House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to tear up the text, saying she could not find \u201cone page with truth on it\u201d. Having snubbed Pelosi\u2019s handshake before the speech, Trump bragged of a \u201cgreat American comeback\u201d, touting the economy and fanning the flames of the culture wars, to which Democrats responded with heckles and walkouts. Rush Limbaugh. Trump awarded the controversial conservative \u201cshock jock\u201d the Presidential Medal of Freedom during his address, a day after Limbaugh announced he had advanced lung cancer. Rhetorical flourish? In the absence of facts, says Richard Wolffe, Trump\u2019s speechwriters turned to nonsensical rhetorical flourishes, such as \u201cFreedom unifies the soul\u201d. What? Susan Collins says she will vote for president\u2019s acquittal Any lingering hope that Trump might yet be convicted in his impeachment trial was all but dashed on Tuesday when Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who had last week voted in vain to hear from witnesses, said she would choose to acquit the president on both articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of congress. Senators continued making speeches on the matter before a final vote scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. Past presidents. Trump looks set to be the third president to remain in office following an impeachment trial. Tom McCarthy looks back to the previous examples for signs of what the near future might hold. Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa as partial results released Pete Buttigieg, the previously little-known 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, held a narrow lead over Bernie Sanders in the Iowa Democratic caucuses on Tuesday night, with 71% of precincts reporting. The partial results put Elizabeth Warren in third place, trailed by the erstwhile frontrunner, Joe Biden. The chaos of this year\u2019s caucus, apparently caused by a smartphone app, could see Iowa lose its long-held position as the nation\u2019s first primary state \u2013 and the outsize political influence that comes with it. Tech mishaps. In fact, Iowa is far from the first state to see its election day disrupted by untested new technology and administrative incompetence, as Andrew Gumbel reports. Cruise ship carrying quarantined in Japan over coronavirus A cruise ship carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew has been quarantined off the coast of Japan after 10 people onboard tested positive for the coronavirus. In Hong Kong, anyone arriving from mainland China faces compulsory quarantine amid efforts to prevent the further spread of the outbreak, which has killed 490 people in China and infected more than 23,000. On Wednesday morning, markets and oil prices jumped following unconfirmed reports of an effective treatment for the virus. Escape from Wuhan. Australian Daniel Ou Yang shares his experience of being onboard an evacuation flight out of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak. Cheat sheet At least 138 Salvadoran migrants and asylum seekers have been murdered and dozens more raped and tortured after being deported back to El Salvador by the US between 2013 and 2019, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. The number of homeless public school students in the US has gone up by 15% in the past three years, with more than 1.5 million students reported experiencing homelessness during the 2017-18 school year \u2013 the highest number in a decade. Twitter has said it will start to label and even remove doctored or manipulated content designed to mislead people, amid fears that partisan so-called \u201cdeepfake\u201d videos could be used to interfere with the 2020 election. Police in the Indian metropolis of Mumbai, describing their city as \u201cthe honking capital of the world\u201d, are trialling a new traffic light system designed to encourage patient driving by resetting the lights to red if the noise from car horns tops 85 decibels.

Making federal buildings \u2018beautiful again\u2019 The Trump administration has drafted an executive order mandating future federal buildings be designed in \u201cthe classical architectural style\u201d. But, as Martin Pengelly reports, that goes against longstanding government guidelines \u2013 not to mention the principles of 21st century liberal democracy. New York\u2019s Amazon workers condemn warehouse conditions Amazon has signed a deal to expand its New York warehouse space by 450,000 sq ft. But employees are unhappy about their working conditions at the city\u2019s existing warehouse sites, which, they tell Michael Sainato, are both unfair and unsafe. The unsettling art of the American deep south A landmark exhibition in Margate, England, collects the esoteric art of Alabama and its near neighbours in the US deep south to tell a secret history of black America, writes Lanre Bakare. Opinion The World Health Organization is facing criticism for how it allowed China to handle the early days and weeks of the coronavirus outbreak. But health diplomacy with an increasingly authoritarian Beijing is a difficult business, writes Peter Beaumont. [The coronavirus outbreak] asks how the UN\u2019s international health diplomacy, confronted with a potential pandemic where a timely and accurate flow of information is crucial, should interact with one of the world\u2019s most powerful, and controlling, states. Sport The Jacksonville Jaguars are to play two \u201chome\u201d games in London next year, potentially strengthening links with the UK as the franchise looks for ways to increase its revenue to compete with traditionally richer NFL sides.

Detailed talks about the World Cup, a biennial event that does not resonate deeply within the sport, have been ongoing for several months. The plan would boost the competition\u2019s purse from $7m to upwards of $10m, with female golfers entering the fold seen as commercially beneficial. A bigger prize fund would, of course, be welcomed by male participants, but it would make a more significant impact on the women\u2019s game as players look to close the pay gap to members of the PGA Tour in particular. The US-based LPGA Tour announced what was essentially a takeover of the Ladies European Tour in late 2019. Improvements to the women\u2019s schedule in Europe that followed were widely heralded. Origin Sports Group, where the multimillionaire Sir Keith Mills is a director, has been integral to the World Cup project. Australia hosted it last November but even the event\u2019s place in the golfing calendar may be subject to change, with venues in Europe and the Middle East expressing interest in the World Cup under a fresh guise. Nothing is expected to be in place by the time the World Cup tees off this year \u2013 with Thomas Pieters and Thomas Detry to defend the trophy on behalf of Belgium \u2013 but alterations for 2022 are entirely plausible. Origin declined to comment on its involvement when contacted by the Guardian, beyond confirming: \u201cThe PGA Tour is working on a variety of options to potentially relaunch the World Cup of Golf and we\u2019ve been in touch with them on several concepts.\u201d A PGA Tour spokesman did not mention the World Cup directly but said: \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at new ways to promote the game of golf through new formats and certainly an event that would include PGA Tour and LPGA players is something we will continue to explore.\u201d In 2016 the PGA and LPGA Tours announced a strategic alliance that pointed heavily towards the introduction of joint events.

That, however, has not stopped some states including Georgia from ordering expensive new systems that raise more questions than they answer \u2013 or to yield to the temptations of online voting, despite repeated warnings from computer scientists of major, insurmountable security concerns. Even before Monday\u2019s caucuses, Politico described Iowa as the \u201cfirst election security test\u201d of an anxiety-ridden 2020 election season. And it is now apparent it has failed the test.",

But what might it mean for Trump\u2019s future that he was impeached at all? Here\u2019s a look at the two previous impeachment cases, and at the one case in which a president resigned in the face of impeachment. Visit our previous coverage for more details of why past presidents were impeached. Impeachment No 1: Andrew Johnson (1868) Even if Trump does not win re-election in 2020, he will be hard-pressed to match Andrew Johnson for a disastrous post-impeachment career. The Republican party\u2019s embrace of Trump has only grown with impeachment. By contrast, the Democratic party turned its back on Johnson in 1868, declining to nominate him for a new term.

A month later, benefiting from \u201cwidespread support for his policies and skepticism about the media\u2019s coverage of the allegations\u201d, according to a Pew Research study, Clinton\u2019s approval rating was 10 points higher at 71%. While Clinton at the time of his impeachment was leagues ahead of Trump in terms of popularity, a Gallup poll published on Tuesday indicated that Trump\u2019s approval rating has likewise climbed to near all-time highs post-impeachment, with 49% of respondents giving him good marks. However, a renewed focus on past sexual assault allegations against Clinton in the #MeToo era and a reconsideration of the power dynamics of his relationship with Lewinsky have diminished his public standing in recent years. \u201cI now see how problematic it was that the two of us even got to a place where there was a question of consent,\u201d Lewinsky wrote in Vanity Fair in 2018. \u201cInstead, the road that led there was littered with inappropriate abuse of authority, station and privilege.\u201d Near miss: Richard Nixon (1974) Richard Nixon resigned under pressure from fellow Republicans before he could be impeached.

Botched vote reporting in the Iowa Democratic party caucuses on Monday night meant that no opposition candidate was clearly boosted in the process, while the party emerged with a black eye and a damaging internal fight on its hands. A Gallup poll published on Tuesday, meanwhile, indicated Trump\u2019s approval rating is at or near all-time highs, including 94% approval among Republicans and rising support among independents. With the momentum seemingly on Trump\u2019s side, the chances improved that the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, would deliver a clean party-line acquittal vote for the president on Wednesday afternoon. The Republicans hold a 53-seat majority in the Senate. Two Republicans, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, broke with the party during the trial to vote in favor of calling witnesses and issuing subpoenas for documents blocked by the Trump administration.

But that\u2019s not the main reason people attend, according to Sophie Duniam, one half of underground electronic music duo My Bad Sister, which started out MCing at illegal events. \u201cIt offers people a place where they can come together as a community without prejudice and without intimidation,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are risking arrest just to create a space where people can come together, no matter who they are, in a country where social divides are increasing. What the Tory government, and all governments, want to do is to isolate people so they can control them. When communities are united they are stronger and they can\u2019t be pushed around.\u201d</p> <p>Duniam says that the ability of clubs and festivals to provide a similar space for free expression has been curtailed in recent years due to more stringent attitudes towards licence requirements. Drug-related incidents have led to the closure of several clubs in recent years, including The Arches, which used to be located in Glasgow and had its nightclub licence revoked in 2015, after the death of an underage clubber. In 2016, London superclub Fabric also saw its licence taken away for five months, following the death of two 18-year-olds after taking drugs on the premises. It reopened in 2017 with stricter security regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s like 1920s prohibition in America,\u201d Duniam says of the legal clubbing scene. \u201cWhen we perform at Fabric all of the punters are searched and have their passports photocopied before they are allowed into the club \u2013 and you can get chucked out for having a vape.\u201d</p> <p>Many believe the rave scene is filling a void left after a decline in grassroots venues, defined by the mayor of London\u2019s office as those that focus mainly on music, and play an important role in local communities or as a hub for musicians. In July, figures revealed there were only 100 grassroots music venues in the capital, 30% fewer than in 2007. It\u2019s representative of a nationwide decline: <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/733/73307.htm#footnote-122\">a government select committee report</a> published in 2019 warned that the \u201cclosure of music venues presents a significant and urgent challenge to the UK\u2019s music industry and cultural vibrancy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb3c1fa9446381fd4bea46977b2b7f3d6efcefb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb3c1fa9446381fd4bea46977b2b7f3d6efcefb4/0_0_5558_3312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Original nuttahs ...

She also believes that the UK\u2019s squat party scene offers a unique space for people to come together. \u201cAs a transgender woman, I\u2019ve been two different people in the rave scene, and I have been openly welcomed throughout the whole thing. You get every single walk of life.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s 10am on the Old Kent Road, New Year\u2019s Day. A flood of new people enter the former Office Outlet warehouse from another unlicensed event, which took place in an office block on the South Bank and was shut down after police seized the sound system in the early hours. As the pale morning light streams through the skylights, hundreds of ravers are dancing to a hardtek remix of DJ Nehpets\u2019 Bounce, Ride. A man with a wild head of grey hair is cutting intricate lines through the peripheries of a crowd of a pair of roller skates, swooping inches away from a teenager asleep on the floor wrapped up in a large yellow \u201cStore Closing\u201d sign.</p> <p>Since the original boom in acid house parties in the late 80s, the unlicensed rave scene has been the target of media scare stories about drug overdoses and violence, but many of those who regularly attend say they feel safer than when they attend legal club nights. \u201cParties take place without a problem every weekend,\u201d says Duniam, comparing them with licensed events where \u201cpeople are kicked out at four in the morning, or earlier if they have done something to piss off the security. If you are a teenage girl and you haven\u2019t got money for a cab, and the trains don\u2019t start running until six or seven in the morning, being thrown out can leave you in a very vulnerable position. This would never happen at most illegal raves where, because no one is getting paid to look after anyone, everyone is looking out for each other as a community.\u201d</p> <p>The police claim this utopian vision is false. In 2017, two people were shot when gunmen wearing masks let off semi-automatic weapons at an illegal party in Leyton, and over the course of 2014 two teenage boys died after taking drugs at separate unlicensed raves in London. The Met\u2019s Dave Musker says: \u201cThe obvious public risk comes from unsafe derelict buildings, overcrowding and youths being exposed to alcohol and illegal drugs in an environment which encourages excess. The revellers at these events are often unlikely to report crimes, including serious sexual assault, due to the culture of taking part in an illegal activity. Young people under the influence of alcohol or drugs are also at risk of being victims of crime or violence as they leave the venue.\u201d He maintains the police\u2019s priority is \u201cto protect vulnerable people\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"814c82d7c0b99962c301bd4f029c6ef44512ea6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/814c82d7c0b99962c301bd4f029c6ef44512ea6e/0_884_5184_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A South coast beach rave in August 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"496\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A beach rave on the south coast in August 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wil Crisp</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is all a gross misrepresentation, according to Mandidextrous. \u201cI\u2019ve been attending illegal raves for more than 20 years, attending hundreds of illegal parties, and I have hardly seen any violence,\u201d she says. \u201cAny I have seen has actually come from the presence of police. If you go down any high street on a Saturday night you see bar brawls and fights on the streets; if you go to a rave, no one is fighting. Everyone is there to have a good time. Occasionally you get a few bad people \u2013 but nine times out of 10 they are marched out of the rave as soon as they do something wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The rave in Carpetright at least passes off without incident: by 9pm, the last of the equipment is being packed into vans while a handful of remaining partygoers sit around a small fire in the yard of the warehouse. Some are discussing the Tory campaign pledge to change the law on trespass and give police new powers to arrest and seize the property and vehicles of those \u201cwho set up unauthorised encampments\u201d. The plans have been seen as an attempt to criminalise Gypsies and Travellers, and could also have ramifications for the free party scene. \u201cEven if the laws get changed raves will carry on in some form,\u201d says one person. \u201cThere are too many crews and too many sound systems.\u201d As if to illustrate their point, another white van pulls up, and another crew get out to clean up the venue ahead of their own party the following weekend.</p>",

A man with a wild head of grey hair is cutting intricate lines through the peripheries of a crowd of a pair of roller skates, swooping inches away from a teenager asleep on the floor wrapped up in a large yellow \u201cStore Closing\u201d sign. Since the original boom in acid house parties in the late 80s, the unlicensed rave scene has been the target of media scare stories about drug overdoses and violence, but many of those who regularly attend say they feel safer than when they attend legal club nights. \u201cParties take place without a problem every weekend,\u201d says Duniam, comparing them with licensed events where \u201cpeople are kicked out at four in the morning, or earlier if they have done something to piss off the security. If you are a teenage girl and you haven\u2019t got money for a cab, and the trains don\u2019t start running until six or seven in the morning, being thrown out can leave you in a very vulnerable position. This would never happen at most illegal raves where, because no one is getting paid to look after anyone, everyone is looking out for each other as a community.\u201d The police claim this utopian vision is false. In 2017, two people were shot when gunmen wearing masks let off semi-automatic weapons at an illegal party in Leyton, and over the course of 2014 two teenage boys died after taking drugs at separate unlicensed raves in London. The Met\u2019s Dave Musker says: \u201cThe obvious public risk comes from unsafe derelict buildings, overcrowding and youths being exposed to alcohol and illegal drugs in an environment which encourages excess. The revellers at these events are often unlikely to report crimes, including serious sexual assault, due to the culture of taking part in an illegal activity. Young people under the influence of alcohol or drugs are also at risk of being victims of crime or violence as they leave the venue.\u201d He maintains the police\u2019s priority is \u201cto protect vulnerable people\u201d. This is all a gross misrepresentation, according to Mandidextrous. \u201cI\u2019ve been attending illegal raves for more than 20 years, attending hundreds of illegal parties, and I have hardly seen any violence,\u201d she says. \u201cAny I have seen has actually come from the presence of police. If you go down any high street on a Saturday night you see bar brawls and fights on the streets; if you go to a rave, no one is fighting. Everyone is there to have a good time. Occasionally you get a few bad people \u2013 but nine times out of 10 they are marched out of the rave as soon as they do something wrong.\u201d The rave in Carpetright at least passes off without incident: by 9pm, the last of the equipment is being packed into vans while a handful of remaining partygoers sit around a small fire in the yard of the warehouse. Some are discussing the Tory campaign pledge to change the law on trespass and give police new powers to arrest and seize the property and vehicles of those \u201cwho set up unauthorised encampments\u201d. The plans have been seen as an attempt to criminalise Gypsies and Travellers, and could also have ramifications for the free party scene. \u201cEven if the laws get changed raves will carry on in some form,\u201d says one person. \u201cThere are too many crews and too many sound systems.\u201d As if to illustrate their point, another white van pulls up, and another crew get out to clean up the venue ahead of their own party the following weekend.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s one anniversary I won\u2019t be celebrating: 10 years ago this week, the Lancet retracted an article published in 1998 that linked the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. The retraction followed a General Medical Council (GMC) ruling that lead author Andrew Wakefield had been dishonest. After the original paper, and despite the immediate objections raised by the medical community, there was a significant drop in MMR rates in the UK. In my GP surgery, rational people expressed concerns along the lines of \u201cThere\u2019s no smoke without fire\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll wait until my child is older so that I can be sure they\u2019re not autistic\u201d, \u201cMy friend\u2019s child was diagnosed with autism a few months after his MMR\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll get the jabs done privately so they can be given separately\u201d.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

The latest confirmed case of novel coronavirus is a 37-year-old Chinese national from Wuhan, who is currently isolated in Gold Coast University hospital. He is part of the same tour group associated with Queensland\u2019s other three cases of the novel coronavirus \u2013 a 44-year-old man, a 42-year-old woman and an eight-year-old boy. All four are in a stable condition. Five other people from the same tour group remain in isolation in the Gold Coast University hospital. An Air New Zealand flight left Wuhan on Wednesday carrying 100 New Zealanders, 23 Australians, and 70 people from Pacific countries. Those 23 Australians and 12 permanent residents will be put on a flight to Christmas Island after they landed in Auckland, via Brisbane. \u201cThey\u2019ll go plane to plane on the tarmac. So it will be a very quick process as I understand,\u201d Dutton said on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThey\u2019ll stay on the plane in Brisbane when there\u2019s a crew change and then they\u2019ll go on to their final destination at Christmas Island from there.\u201d As of now, there are 240 Australians and permanent residents on Christmas Island who were evacuated by the Australian government from Wuhan currently in quarantine for 14 days to ensure they are not infected with the coronavirus. Dutton flagged that if the situation continues, and there are other issues like infections on cruise ships, or more provinces in China being shut down, there is the possibility that Christmas Island could reach capacity. There was confirmation on Wednesday that two Australians were among the 10 people confirmed to have the coronavirus on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Yokohama in Japan. Dutton said one option would be for people to share rooms, or potentially even open up other locations away from the rest of the Australian population. \u201cThere are isolated mining camps or the prospect of hotels that you could take over. But I think we\u2019ll look at all of those in order of what we think is the best response, but all of this is in the spirit of preparation.\u201d Some of the people quarantined on Christmas Island have complained the centre is unhygienic, and the shared bathrooms risk exacerbating the potential for transmission of coronavirus. Dutton dismissed the concerns. \u201cI think frankly, overwhelmingly, except for one photo of one cockroach, most people are complimentary of what has happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the scale of this in China, and the way in which these numbers continue to expand, I think gives people an understanding of the gravity of what it is we\u2019re dealing with, not just in China but now as we see on cruise ships and movements of Australians.\u201d An eight-year-old boy already in isolation in Queensland became the 13th confirmed case of coronavirus in Australia. There are currently 24,305 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world. A total of 490 people have died from the virus.",

But their efforts have often been frustrated, mostly for a more fundamental reason than the technological barrier in place since August: they believe the aid community sent to help them is not listening.</p> <p>\u201cThe Rohingya community are not weak, but the situation makes us weak,\u201d says Mohammad Arfaat, an activist who was part of a Rohingya team that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6vWA0hdQPk\">made a short film</a> about how violence had forced them from Myanmar in 2017.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/29/bangladesh-grants-rohingya-refugee-children-access-to-education\">Bangladesh grants Rohingya refugee children access to education</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He has been calling for more help for Rohingya to launch their own initiatives, for everything from education to arts, but complains there has been no support. \u201cThe Rohingya youth are very talented \u2026 but nobody sits, nobody talks with them, so their voices have stopped,\u201d says Arfaat.</p> <p>These concerns have risen since August, when Bangladesh responded to a failed attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/21/not-without-our-rights-rohingya-refugees-refuse-to-return-to-myanmar\">repatriate the Rohingya</a> \u2013 for which not a single refugee volunteered \u2013 by imposing tighter restrictions on their movement and communication.</p> <p>Arfaat says that, despite the crackdown, UN agencies and international aid groups have not been present.</p> <p>\u201cNo one comes to research what\u2019s happening. [They] have protection officers, but what are they protecting? Whenever there\u2019s violence, they\u2019re not here,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see them on social media, talking to the public, but they don\u2019t come to talk to us.\u201d</p> <p>Lack of education has been a particularly pressing concern among Rohingya activists, who have campaigned for years against a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/12/03/are-we-not-human/denial-education-rohingya-refugee-children-bangladesh\">government ban</a> on all but the most basic level of schooling, warning of a \u201clost generation\u201d.</p> <p>They won a victory last month when Bangladesh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/29/bangladesh-grants-rohingya-refugee-children-access-to-education\">announced a pilot programme</a> to teach children between 11 and 13 the Myanmar curriculum. Rohingya teachers and activists had little knowledge of how the plan would work, however.</p> <p>The restrictions have been in place since the existing camps were established in 1991, when the same fears about future generations prompted Rohingya who had been educated in <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/myanmar\">Myanmar</a> to set up their own independent learning centres in secret, funded by small monthly contributions from parents.</p> <p>Similar models have become more prevalent since 2017, when the Kutupalong refugee camp became the <a href=\"https://www.wfpusa.org/stories/rohingya-crisis-a-firsthand-look-into-the-worlds-largest-refugee-camp/\">world\u2019s largest</a> as it absorbed the hundreds of thousands of people who fled a Myanmar military operation described by the UN as having \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya-un/myanmar-generals-had-genocidal-intent-against-rohingya-must-face-justice-un-idUSL8N1VH04R\">genocidal intent</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eadadd254d01ef1d85a9e2a31ea60cc4b54fd0d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eadadd254d01ef1d85a9e2a31ea60cc4b54fd0d5/0_194_3586_2152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rohingya children playing in Cox\u2019s Bazar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists warn of a \u2018lost generation\u2019 in Cox\u2019s Bazar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Joyce/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Activist Khin Maung says that despite three decades of Rohingya experience in the refugee camps, their expertise is not tapped by humanitarian workers.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have the interest to develop our children, they just have the interest to implement their [own] projects,\u201d says Maung, who heads the Rohingya Youth Association. \u201cThey are ignoring us because we are refugees. If they treated us as human beings, they would listen to us.\u201d</p> <p>He complains that organisations implementing education projects often employ underqualified tutors who teach only basic phrases and nursery rhymes, failing to utilise the talents of refugees.</p> <p>A 2019 <a href=\"https://www.wfpusa.org/stories/rohingya-crisis-a-firsthand-look-into-the-worlds-largest-refugee-camp/\">study</a> by the Peace Research Institute Oslo said that, despite the barriers imposed on the humanitarian community by the government\u2019s education ban, more could have been done to map out the work carried out by Rohingya themselves.</p> <p>\u201cThe humanitarian sector often falls short on centring community voices in this way, which I think is due in part to policy restrictions, limited resources and a lack of flexibility,\u201d says the report\u2019s co-author Jessica Olney.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also due to quick staff turnaround, as many humanitarian staff are new to the Rohingya community and aren\u2019t encouraged or permitted by their agencies to spend time in the camps just talking to people and listening to gain a deep understanding of the context and people\u2019s needs.\u201d</p> <p>The relationship between the Rohingya and the humanitarian community has been strained by a recent government order to stop paying refugee volunteers in cash, which the authorities claim is used to buy false documents. The government has encouraged the hiring of Bangladeshis instead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They ignore us but without Rohingya involvement they can\u2019t do anything in the camps</p> <footer> <cite>Khin Maung, activist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Refugees claim they have been removed from volunteer roles, which typically pay a daily stipend of less than \u00a33, which forces them to rely solely on the aid supply of oil, lentils and rice.</p> <p>NGOs operating in the area claim \u201cmiscommunication\u201d was a reason some Rohingya had been dismissed.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a major communication breakdown between some international humanitarian organisations and the Rohingya refugee volunteers about why they are being dismissed,\u201d says John Quinley, human rights specialist for the advocacy group Fortify Rights, which has documented the dismissals.</p> <p>There was a similar outcry by refugees when the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/uk/news/press/2018/6/5b1787e64/unhcr-undp-sign-memorandum-understanding-mou-myanmar-support-creation-conditions.html\">signed an agreement with Myanmar on repatriating the Rohingya</a> in 2018. Refugees said they were not consulted on that deal, or about a system for biometric registration.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the UNHCR says the agency used several methods to share information with refugees and engage community leaders, including face-to-face meetings, drama performances and podcasts.</p> <p>The spokesperson adds: \u201cThe Rohingya refugee population in Cox\u2019s Bazar is more than 850,000 people. This alone presents a challenge in terms of ensuring that all voices are heard. Furthermore, to communicate effectively with a very large population requires the utilisation of technology. Currently, this presents challenges in Cox\u2019s Bazar due to restrictions on mobile connectivity.</p> <p>\u201cUNHCR works to ensure that refugees are consulted on key issues and are involved in decision-making processes including through regular protection monitoring and profiling, as well as community outreach. Refugees should be consulted on all issues related to their daily lives and not only significant political developments.\u201d</p> <p>Maung says the role played by refugees in the humanitarian response over the past two years, from volunteering as translators to other key roles, has been underestimated.</p> <p>\u201cThey ignore us but without Rohingya involvement they can\u2019t do anything in the camps, they can\u2019t even understand us properly. They don\u2019t know our language,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are the nuts and bolts.\u201d</p>",

But their efforts have often been frustrated, mostly for a more fundamental reason than the technological barrier in place since August: they believe the aid community sent to help them is not listening. \u201cThe Rohingya community are not weak, but the situation makes us weak,\u201d says Mohammad Arfaat, an activist who was part of a Rohingya team that made a short film about how violence had forced them from Myanmar in 2017. He has been calling for more help for Rohingya to launch their own initiatives, for everything from education to arts, but complains there has been no support. \u201cThe Rohingya youth are very talented \u2026 but nobody sits, nobody talks with them, so their voices have stopped,\u201d says Arfaat. These concerns have risen since August, when Bangladesh responded to a failed attempt to repatriate the Rohingya \u2013 for which not a single refugee volunteered \u2013 by imposing tighter restrictions on their movement and communication. Arfaat says that, despite the crackdown, UN agencies and international aid groups have not been present. \u201cNo one comes to research what\u2019s happening. [They] have protection officers, but what are they protecting? Whenever there\u2019s violence, they\u2019re not here,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see them on social media, talking to the public, but they don\u2019t come to talk to us.\u201d Lack of education has been a particularly pressing concern among Rohingya activists, who have campaigned for years against a government ban on all but the most basic level of schooling, warning of a \u201clost generation\u201d. They won a victory last month when Bangladesh announced a pilot programme to teach children between 11 and 13 the Myanmar curriculum. Rohingya teachers and activists had little knowledge of how the plan would work, however. The restrictions have been in place since the existing camps were established in 1991, when the same fears about future generations prompted Rohingya who had been educated in Myanmar to set up their own independent learning centres in secret, funded by small monthly contributions from parents. Similar models have become more prevalent since 2017, when the Kutupalong refugee camp became the world\u2019s largest as it absorbed the hundreds of thousands of people who fled a Myanmar military operation described by the UN as having \u201cgenocidal intent\u201d. Activist Khin Maung says that despite three decades of Rohingya experience in the refugee camps, their expertise is not tapped by humanitarian workers. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the interest to develop our children, they just have the interest to implement their [own] projects,\u201d says Maung, who heads the Rohingya Youth Association. \u201cThey are ignoring us because we are refugees. If they treated us as human beings, they would listen to us.\u201d He complains that organisations implementing education projects often employ underqualified tutors who teach only basic phrases and nursery rhymes, failing to utilise the talents of refugees. A 2019 study by the Peace Research Institute Oslo said that, despite the barriers imposed on the humanitarian community by the government\u2019s education ban, more could have been done to map out the work carried out by Rohingya themselves. \u201cThe humanitarian sector often falls short on centring community voices in this way, which I think is due in part to policy restrictions, limited resources and a lack of flexibility,\u201d says the report\u2019s co-author Jessica Olney. \u201cIt\u2019s also due to quick staff turnaround, as many humanitarian staff are new to the Rohingya community and aren\u2019t encouraged or permitted by their agencies to spend time in the camps just talking to people and listening to gain a deep understanding of the context and people\u2019s needs.\u201d The relationship between the Rohingya and the humanitarian community has been strained by a recent government order to stop paying refugee volunteers in cash, which the authorities claim is used to buy false documents. The government has encouraged the hiring of Bangladeshis instead. Refugees claim they have been removed from volunteer roles, which typically pay a daily stipend of less than \u00a33, which forces them to rely solely on the aid supply of oil, lentils and rice. NGOs operating in the area claim \u201cmiscommunication\u201d was a reason some Rohingya had been dismissed. \u201cThere is a major communication breakdown between some international humanitarian organisations and the Rohingya refugee volunteers about why they are being dismissed,\u201d says John Quinley, human rights specialist for the advocacy group Fortify Rights, which has documented the dismissals. There was a similar outcry by refugees when the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, signed an agreement with Myanmar on repatriating the Rohingya in 2018. Refugees said they were not consulted on that deal, or about a system for biometric registration. A spokesperson for the UNHCR says the agency used several methods to share information with refugees and engage community leaders, including face-to-face meetings, drama performances and podcasts. The spokesperson adds: \u201cThe Rohingya refugee population in Cox\u2019s Bazar is more than 850,000 people. This alone presents a challenge in terms of ensuring that all voices are heard. Furthermore, to communicate effectively with a very large population requires the utilisation of technology. Currently, this presents challenges in Cox\u2019s Bazar due to restrictions on mobile connectivity. \u201cUNHCR works to ensure that refugees are consulted on key issues and are involved in decision-making processes including through regular protection monitoring and profiling, as well as community outreach. Refugees should be consulted on all issues related to their daily lives and not only significant political developments.\u201d Maung says the role played by refugees in the humanitarian response over the past two years, from volunteering as translators to other key roles, has been underestimated. \u201cThey ignore us but without Rohingya involvement they can\u2019t do anything in the camps, they can\u2019t even understand us properly. They don\u2019t know our language,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are the nuts and bolts.\u201d",

On Tuesday, the petition started by the general secretary of the University of Sydney\u2019s student representative council, Abbey Shi, gathered more than 4,000 signatures, reported the student newspaper, Honi Soit. The petition asks for classes at Sydney University, scheduled to start on 24 February, to be pushed back to 9 March. In a statement, the president of the student representative council, Liam Donohoe, said the ban would unfairly disadvantage international students returning for the start of the year. \u201cThis travel ban will significantly disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, who are central to student communities at the University of Sydney and beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of these students are losing out on learning, work, relationships, and communities, and may never return.\u201d Nearly 100,000 Chinese international students with valid student visas are currently outside of Australia, according to the latest figures from the department of home affairs.

On Tuesday, it was reported that 70 international students, some of whom had already been en route to Australia when the travel ban was announced, had been detained upon arrival at Sydney airport. The University of Sydney student union, along with the New South Wales branch of the National Tertiary Education Union are organising a protest calling for a \u201chealth-based policy response to the coronavirus\u201d, rather than \u201can approach based on fear and sinophobia\u201d. A University of Sydney spokeswoman told the Sydney Morning Herald the university had no plans to delay semester but was \u201caware of the petition and understand the anxiety and concern\u201d of students. The university has however extended the period that students can enrol by two weeks \u2013 until 9 March \u2013 and will let affected international students defer their studies for the semester. The University of Melbourne also said it would not delay semester, but would \u201cconsider special arrangements for students\u201d. The two universities, and many others, are also offering online replacements for classes.

      "bodyText": "Video has emerged online of a member of Scott Morrison\u2019s electorate staff being lauded for helping Cronulla Sailing Club win an $8,400 grant, as the Senate moved on Wednesday to set up an inquiry into the controversial $100m community sport infrastructure grant program. In the video posted to Facebook, a representative of the club thanks the staffer, identifying her as \u201cScott Morrison\u2019s PA\u201d, for helping push her to apply for a grant for a new stainless steel barbecue. GrantConnect shows the grant was approved in December 2017 as part of the stronger communities program. The Morrison staffer thanks the club, crediting the fact \u201cyour application was extremely well written\u201d for the grant. She urged the crowd \u201cit\u2019s not me who gives you the money, it\u2019s ScoMo [Scott Morrison] \u2013 so vote Liberal come May \u2026 Because if you don\u2019t I don\u2019t have a job.\u201d The stronger communities program grants every electorate a fund of $150,000, allocated by the infrastructure department on the advice of a committee including the local MP to pay for small community projects, funding everything from BBQs to iPads and lawnmowers. A spokesman for Morrison said: \u201cThe only support the member for Cook [Morrison] and his office have offered applicants is technical advice to ensure their applications comply with the eligibility requirements. \u201cThe staff member regrets her comment and apologises but all our ministers, members, senators and staff are proud of how a programme our government initiated has supported local communities across every Liberal, Labor, National, Greens and independent electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cAll applications are appropriately independently assessed by the department taking account of actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest and they come forward based on the recommendations from community leaders.\u201d The constitutional expert Anne Twomey has warned that both the stronger communities program and sports grants program could be unconstitutional because the commonwealth lacks a head of power to make grants for those purposes. On Wednesday Labor and the Greens successfully established a select Senate committee to inquire into the community sport infrastructure program, subject of a scathing auditor general\u2019s report finding Bridget McKenzie had targeted projects at marginal seats. The government had attempted to draw a line under the saga when McKenzie resigned from cabinet and as the deputy Nationals leader on Sunday. The new deputy Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has conceded the partisan allocation of projects by party representation in marginal seats is not \u201cthe best way to do it\u201d. On Wednesday the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, claimed Littleproud had been \u201cmisrepresented\u201d and argued that both the projects awarded funding due to McKenzie\u2019s intervention \u2013 and those recommended by Sport Australia with a higher score \u2013 were \u201call worthy projects\u201d. The terms of the inquiry include \u201cthe role of the offices of the minister, the prime minister and deputy prime minister, and any external parties, in determining which grants would be awarded and who would announce the successful grants\u201d. Morrison has claimed his office\u2019s role was limited to relaying representations from MPs to the sport minister about potential projects, but Labor is keen to probe reports staff in the prime minister\u2019s office asked for adjustments of which received funding. Labor also intends to call Phil Gaetjens, the secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who found McKenzie had breached ministerial guidelines by failing to declare a membership to the Wangaratta Clay Target Club, which she then gave a $36,000 grant. Morrison has selectively quoted the report written by his former chief of staff to suggest McKenzie was cleared of other wrongdoing, but refused to release it, and likewise has not released advice from the attorney general Christian Porter that McKenzie had authority to give grants. On Wednesday the Senate also passed an order to produce the Gaetjens report and emails from the prime minister\u2019s office to McKenzie about the grant program. The Greens senator, Larissa Waters, who moved the motion, said the \u201ccommunity deserves to know what really went on\u201d. The shadow public services minister, Katy Gallagher, told the Senate that the Gaetjens report\u2019s conclusion that he \u201cdid not find evidence that this process was unduly influenced by reference to marginal or targeted electorates\u201d was the \u201ccompletely opposite\u201d view to the one taken by the auditor general. She said Morrison had either misled the public about the Gaetjens report or that Gaetjens had engaged in a \u201cwhitewash\u201d to protect the prime minister from scrutiny. Earlier, the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told the lower house that Morrison was attempting \u201cnot to clean up but to cover up\u201d the handling of the program \u201cwith a secret report from a former Liberal party staffer\u201d. Before question time, Labor members delivered a series of speeches accusing the government of having \u201ccheated\u201d more deserving clubs. The shadow youth minister, Amanda Rishworth, raised the example of South Adelaide Football Club, which she said had \u201cmore women\u2019s premierships than changerooms\u201d but missed out on grant funding. She noted the Old Collegian rugby club in the marginal seat of Sturt was given funding for women\u2019s changerooms despite not having fielded a women\u2019s team since 2018. Asked in question time if the government had funded the projects with the most merit, Morrison replied: \u201cI believe funding community sports infrastructure always has merit.\u201d Morrison claimed the auditor general had concluded that McKenzie \u201chad the authority to make those decisions\u201d. In fact, the Australian National Audit Office report said it is \u201cnot evident to the Anao what the legal authority was\u201d for McKenzie to approve grants. It noted that although the sport minister has a power to direct Sport Australia \u201cit was not used\u201d. Morrison again left the door open to fund unsuccessful clubs, noting that sports clubs had proposed a total of $400m of projects and the government had funded $100m. \u201cAs I said last week, we think this infrastructure is important to local communities,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be working with the treasurer as we prepare for this year\u2019s budget to see how we can provide further support for this important infrastructure that brings communities together.\u201d At the adjournment of the Senate, McKenzie made a short statement declaring in her opinion her memberships did not cause any \u201creal or apparent\u201d conflict of interest, but apologising for the failure to disclose them to the Senate. She announced she is no longer a member of the Wangaratta Clay Target Club.",

      "body": "<p>How many people does it take to make a piece of dance? Dozens could be involved in staging a whole production, but usually there is one choreographer\u2019s name at the top of the bill. It\u2019s rare to walk into a studio, such as this large, bright space in Leeds, and see three people at the helm, all calling the shots.</p> <p>This is the home of <a href=\"https://www.phoenixdancetheatre.co.uk/\">Phoenix Dance Theatre</a>, whose latest work, Black Waters, is being co-created by Phoenix\u2019s artistic director, Sharon Watson, alongside Shambik Ghose and Mitul Sengupta, who are both from the Kolkata-based company <a href=\"https://www.rhythmosaic.com/\">Rhythmosaic</a>.</p> <p>How does that even work, I ask them, sitting in Watson\u2019s office between rehearsals. \u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201d says Watson. \u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019s working!\u201d says Ghose and the trio laugh as if they\u2019re surprised that\u2019s the answer. But how do they agree on what to do? \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasurable conflict,\u201d adds Ghose, with a big, infectious smile.</p> <p>Working with Ghose and Sengupta fits with Watson\u2019s vision for Phoenix, a company <a href=\"https://www.phoenixdancetheatre.co.uk/about/history/\">founded by black British dancers in the 1980s</a>, to bring a broader range of voices to the stage. For Black Waters, Watson and her collaborators focused on \u201ctwo narratives that really hit home\u201d, both shameful episodes from British colonial history that resonated with the three choreographers. First, from 1781, the massacre aboard the Zong slave ship, when around 130 slaves were thrown overboard in order to claim insurance on their lives. Then the events at the K\u0101l\u0101 P\u0101n\u012b prison (Hindi for black waters) in India\u2019s Andaman Islands, where Indian independence activists were tortured in the early 20th century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"db54f8c1775d03097049cf1308868689e6d38f7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db54f8c1775d03097049cf1308868689e6d38f7f/0_0_5969_3984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rehearsals for Black Waters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It takes an hour to create a few minutes of choreography \u2026 rehearsals for Black Waters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Camilla Greenwell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trio felt that both episodes were not well enough known. \u201cThey\u2019re things that have affected all of us in terms of our cultural histories,\u201d says Watson. \u201cBut it feels very relevant today that we\u2019re still having these challenges around the British colonial conversation, the lack of visibility, being written out of history.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than try to tell complex stories in full, the choreographers focus on common themes: forced transportation, entrapment, emancipation. They don\u2019t mind if viewers don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s happening; in fact, Watson wants you to be puzzled, but to get so involved in the images and emotional journeys of the dancers, that you go home and read up on the facts.</p> <p>Using multiple choreographers recognises that there\u2019s no single viewpoint on history, but the three of them still have to create something coherent that works on stage. Their dance backgrounds are completely different, Watson from contemporary, Sengupta from Indian kathak, Ghose from jazz, ballet and modern. They\u2019re not making a cut-and-paste of styles, but \u201clooking for an image which is workable for all of us,\u201d says Sengupta, and watching the dancers you can see some of the sharp diagonal lines and flowering fingers of kathak mixed with earthy contemporary undulations.</p> <p>Four weeks into a six-week creation process, \u201cthe flow is on\u201d says Ghose. \u201cNow we can read each other very well.\u201d But there are still disagreements. \u201cShambik\u2019s line is: \u2018You can think about it,\u2019\u201d says Watson, \u201cBut sometimes I say, you know what, I\u2019m not even going to think about it!\u201d</p> <p>As well as different dance techniques there are different working dynamics to manage. \u201cEven the tone in the studio,\u201d says Watson. \u201cThey are both talking at each other, conversations overlapping, the volume of the discussion growing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSharon taught us one thing the first week, which was keeping quiet,\u201d laughs Ghose. \u201cI never keep quiet, never in my life!\u201d The reason for keeping quiet is not only because there are two other choreographers to listen to, but the dancers are also involved in the creation \u2013 and this, too, is a new approach for Ghose and Sengupta.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f769c7664251c1ec0dca7a7053e6ecc76ba1b67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f769c7664251c1ec0dca7a7053e6ecc76ba1b67/0_0_4960_3311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Watson in rehearsals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It feels very relevant today\u2019 \u2026 Sharon Watson during rehearsals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Camilla Greenwell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI came from a very orthodox tradition where dancers were never allowed to say anything,\u201d says Sengupta. \u201cHere it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d Watching the rehearsal, at first Sengupta and Ghose hardly intervene as the dancers take the lead in working out their entrance. The most confident put their ideas forward first, then quieter dancers speak up. \u201cI feel it needs to be smaller.\u201d \u201cHow about you fall and I catch?\u201d \u201cIf this is rubbish, you tell me,\u201d says one before offering up an idea. \u201cAh, yes!\u201d claps another in response. \u201cWhat vibe are we feeling?\u201d she asks before they attempt a try-out. \u201cMake people cry,\u201d comes the suggestion from behind.</p> <p>Only then do Ghose and Sengupta step in, choosing, refining and shaping steps. It takes an hour to create a few minutes of choreography, but each moment is formed through rigorous inquisition, attending to tiny subtleties of tone, placement and attack.</p> <p>All three choreographers say this experience has made them think in new ways. \u201cI can\u2019t keep growing as an artist if I\u2019m not fed by other creative voices,\u201d says Watson, although she admits it\u2019s hard to let go of needing to be the one with all the answers. Ghose and Sengupta have worked collaboratively before, but never as fruitfully as this. \u201cEvery moment something is happening,\u201d says Ghose. \u201cWe have so many ideas we can\u2019t contain them.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Black Waters is at <a href=\"https://www.phoenixdancetheatre.co.uk/whats_on/black-waters/\">Leeds Playhouse</a>, 12-15 February.

Dozens could be involved in staging a whole production, but usually there is one choreographer\u2019s name at the top of the bill. It\u2019s rare to walk into a studio, such as this large, bright space in Leeds, and see three people at the helm, all calling the shots. This is the home of Phoenix Dance Theatre, whose latest work, Black Waters, is being co-created by Phoenix\u2019s artistic director, Sharon Watson, alongside Shambik Ghose and Mitul Sengupta, who are both from the Kolkata-based company Rhythmosaic. How does that even work, I ask them, sitting in Watson\u2019s office between rehearsals. \u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201d says Watson. \u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019s working!\u201d says Ghose and the trio laugh as if they\u2019re surprised that\u2019s the answer. But how do they agree on what to do? \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasurable conflict,\u201d adds Ghose, with a big, infectious smile. Working with Ghose and Sengupta fits with Watson\u2019s vision for Phoenix, a company founded by black British dancers in the 1980s, to bring a broader range of voices to the stage. For Black Waters, Watson and her collaborators focused on \u201ctwo narratives that really hit home\u201d, both shameful episodes from British colonial history that resonated with the three choreographers. First, from 1781, the massacre aboard the Zong slave ship, when around 130 slaves were thrown overboard in order to claim insurance on their lives. Then the events at the K\u0101l\u0101 P\u0101n\u012b prison (Hindi for black waters) in India\u2019s Andaman Islands, where Indian independence activists were tortured in the early 20th century. The trio felt that both episodes were not well enough known. \u201cThey\u2019re things that have affected all of us in terms of our cultural histories,\u201d says Watson. \u201cBut it feels very relevant today that we\u2019re still having these challenges around the British colonial conversation, the lack of visibility, being written out of history.\u201d Rather than try to tell complex stories in full, the choreographers focus on common themes: forced transportation, entrapment, emancipation. They don\u2019t mind if viewers don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s happening; in fact, Watson wants you to be puzzled, but to get so involved in the images and emotional journeys of the dancers, that you go home and read up on the facts. Using multiple choreographers recognises that there\u2019s no single viewpoint on history, but the three of them still have to create something coherent that works on stage. Their dance backgrounds are completely different, Watson from contemporary, Sengupta from Indian kathak, Ghose from jazz, ballet and modern. They\u2019re not making a cut-and-paste of styles, but \u201clooking for an image which is workable for all of us,\u201d says Sengupta, and watching the dancers you can see some of the sharp diagonal lines and flowering fingers of kathak mixed with earthy contemporary undulations. Four weeks into a six-week creation process, \u201cthe flow is on\u201d says Ghose. \u201cNow we can read each other very well.\u201d But there are still disagreements. \u201cShambik\u2019s line is: \u2018You can think about it,\u2019\u201d says Watson, \u201cBut sometimes I say, you know what, I\u2019m not even going to think about it!\u201d As well as different dance techniques there are different working dynamics to manage. \u201cEven the tone in the studio,\u201d says Watson. \u201cThey are both talking at each other, conversations overlapping, the volume of the discussion growing.\u201d \u201cSharon taught us one thing the first week, which was keeping quiet,\u201d laughs Ghose. \u201cI never keep quiet, never in my life!\u201d The reason for keeping quiet is not only because there are two other choreographers to listen to, but the dancers are also involved in the creation \u2013 and this, too, is a new approach for Ghose and Sengupta. \u201cI came from a very orthodox tradition where dancers were never allowed to say anything,\u201d says Sengupta. \u201cHere it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d Watching the rehearsal, at first Sengupta and Ghose hardly intervene as the dancers take the lead in working out their entrance. The most confident put their ideas forward first, then quieter dancers speak up. \u201cI feel it needs to be smaller.\u201d \u201cHow about you fall and I catch?\u201d \u201cIf this is rubbish, you tell me,\u201d says one before offering up an idea. \u201cAh, yes!\u201d claps another in response. \u201cWhat vibe are we feeling?\u201d she asks before they attempt a try-out. \u201cMake people cry,\u201d comes the suggestion from behind. Only then do Ghose and Sengupta step in, choosing, refining and shaping steps. It takes an hour to create a few minutes of choreography, but each moment is formed through rigorous inquisition, attending to tiny subtleties of tone, placement and attack. All three choreographers say this experience has made them think in new ways. \u201cI can\u2019t keep growing as an artist if I\u2019m not fed by other creative voices,\u201d says Watson, although she admits it\u2019s hard to let go of needing to be the one with all the answers. Ghose and Sengupta have worked collaboratively before, but never as fruitfully as this. \u201cEvery moment something is happening,\u201d says Ghose. \u201cWe have so many ideas we can\u2019t contain them.\u201d Black Waters is at Leeds Playhouse, 12-15 February. Then touring.",

      "body": "<p>The Chrysler Building in New York was not originally a great success. In 1928, the automobile magnate Walter P Chrysler set out to create the greatest skyscraper on Earth, but the record for the world\u2019s tallest building was held for only 11 months before it was overshadowed by the Empire State Building. The terraced crown that is the Chrysler\u2019s most distinctive feature \u2013 a seven-storey decorative shell without floors or glazed windows \u2013 was dismissed by critics as a gimmick.</p> <p>But, in 2020, the Chrysler is the height of fashion. It has become an architectural icon, a beloved art deco treasure, as symbolic of Manhattan as the Eiffel Tower is of Paris. And the signature silhouette \u2013 the elegant, wedding-cake tiers, graphic but graceful, tapering skyward \u2013 is the most on-trend shape. The tiered dress is to fashion today what the hourglass was during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/feb/16/christian-dior-french-fashion-1947\" title=\"\">the New Look craze of 1947</a> or what the bellbottom was to 1971.

In its wearable, everyday form, it has a simple neckline and skims the body to the waist, where it connects to a waist-to-hip tier with a little more fabric, so that the silhouette gets looser and a little wider. A little lower, there is another horizontal seam and a lower tier with yet more fabric, and so on, to the hem. The fabric is soft and unstructured, so that the shape falls with a natural gravity, rather than a grand, stiff kind of volume.</p> <p>The Chrysler silhouette crosses all fashion divides. It was a key look for fashion\u2019s biggest labels in their first collections of this decade. There was a monochrome gown at Chanel, with white buttons on a white bodice and a floor-length skirt of three tiers of black organza. At Dior, a polka-dot sheer dress was embroidered at the horizontal seams dividing the four stacked layers of the skirt, to emphasise the tiered construction.</p> <p>Tiers were everywhere, from the avant garde catwalk of Simone Rocha \u2013 where overlapping layers of black lace were worn with a crochet harness and a latex skullcap \u2013 to \u00d3scar de la Renta, the favourite label of New York\u2019s socialites, where a floral, floor-length gown in tiers of cream and caramel, with matching belt and bag, was garden-party perfect.</p> <p>What is remarkable about the popularity of the Chrysler shape is that this dress does not make you look thin. It does not emphasise the waist, nor does it slim your silhouette. It simply does not kowtow to the age-old tyranny of thinness in fashion. This makes it supremely relaxing to wear \u2013 you can breathe out, literally \u2013 which lends it a laid-back kind of mood-music when you wear it. They say that flattery will get you everywhere, but the triumph of the tiered dress shows that, in fashion, this is no longer the case. \u201cFlattering\u201d is no longer the be-all and end-all of compliments, from a style point of view.

Traditionally, sugar-pink is the most feminine of colours, an international aesthetic code for conventional prettiness. But splayed on the sofa in her giant triangular dress, Villanelle had all the cockiness of a man-spreader on a tube carriage.

      "bodyText": "Sales of organic food and drink in the UK rose by 4.5% last year to a record \u00a32.45bn, fuelled by strong growth online and in home delivery, and outpacing a sluggish food and drink market overall. The sector grew for the eighth consecutive year, having fallen after the recession, and is on target to hit \u00a32.5bn by the end of 2020, according to a report from the Soil Association, the trade body which licenses organic products and promotes organic farming. Last year\u2019s total, up from \u00a32.3bn in 2018, compares with the pre-recession high of \u00a32.1bn in 2008. An estimated \u00a3200m a month is now spent on organic food and drink, and shoppers typically make two more monthly trips to buy it than they did five years ago, the report says. Independent retailers \u2013 the traditional high street home of organic \u2013 enjoyed a 6.5% uplift in sales. But the biggest single growth channel was online retail and home delivery \u2013 including organic veg box schemes such as Abel &amp; Cole and Riverford \u2013 where sales rose by 11.2%. \u201cWith the climate crisis and British farming dominating the headlines, organic is more relevant than ever as a way for shoppers looking for simple choices to reduce their environmental impact,\u201d said Clare McDermott, business development director at Soil Association Certification. Supermarket sales of organic food and drink increased again in 2019, up 2.5%, outpacing the overall market, although their overall share of the UK\u2019s organic market fell slightly. Non-organic sales at supermarkets edged up by only 0.2% over the same period, the report said. The UK is the ninth largest organic market in the world, down from seventh position last year. Organic wine was the standout winner, with sales soaring nearly 50%. However, the organic market is still dwarfed by the size of the overall food and drink sector, now the largest manufacturing segment in the UK and worth \u00a328bn, according to the Food and Drink Federation.",

The former prime minister was asked by Johnson to be the president of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) but Cameron rejected the offer. Cameron said: \u201c[There are] a lot of things I have already agreed to do this year, not least the work I do for Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, so I thought it was important that I carried on with that work.\u201d He called the climate change conference \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d, adding that he wished the government well. \u201cI\u2019m sure that there will be a government minister, or someone, who will be able to do the job and do it very well. The government has my backing as they go forward.\u201d Asked about his relationship with Johnson, Cameron declined to answer. Lord Barker of Battle, who served as an energy and climate change minister under Cameron and is a close friend and ally of the former prime minister, told BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight on Tuesday that he understood Cameron felt \u201cit was just a little too soon for him personally to come back into a frontline political role\u201d. The former Conservative leader William Hague was also reported to have been offered it and to have also declined. On Tuesday during the conference\u2019s launch event, Johnson refused to answer questions about who would take on the job. The former clean growth minister Claire O\u2019Neill, who stood down as a Tory MP at the general election, was sacked on Friday as president of the talks by the prime minister\u2019s special adviser, Dominic Cummings. The government said the post would be a ministerial role in future. The UN climate talks, to be held in Glasgow in November, are the most important since the Paris agreement to curb global warming was secured in 2015. Countries are expected to deliver more ambitious domestic plans for cutting greenhouse gases by 2030, as current proposals are not enough to prevent dangerous temperature rises. Pressure is also on countries to set out long-term plans for cutting emissions, with the science clear that the world must reduce greenhouse gases to zero in a matter of decades to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The run-up to the talks will require a major diplomatic effort from the UK to secure ambitious climate action from countries, at a time when Britain is also negotiating trade agreements with the EU and other nations. On Tuesday Johnson set out his vision for forging a new global consensus on the climate crisis, promising \u201cwe will crack it\u201d. Johnson has brought forward the UK\u2019s phaseout of diesel and petrol vehicles by five years to 2035 and hastened the phaseout of coal-fired power by a year to 2024. He reaffirmed the UK\u2019s pledge to switch to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 and urged other nations \u2013 without naming any \u2013 to do the same. \u201cI hope that we can as a planet and as a community of nations get to net zero within decades,\u201d Johnson said at the COP 26 launch on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it by 2050, we\u2019re setting the pace, I hope everybody will come with us. Let\u2019s make this year the moment when we come together with the courage and the technological ambition to solve manmade climate change and to choose a cleaner and greener future for all our children and grandchildren.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Widespread rain is forecast for much of New South Wales with warnings in place for severe weather and possible flooding in some parts of the state. An initial flood watch is in place for possible riverine flooding along the coastal rivers from the Tweed to the Hastings from Thursday. A surface trough over central NSW and Queensland was beginning to bring rainfall in areas from Goondawindi to Coonamble on Wednesday. Heavier falls are expected along the north and north-east coast of NSW on Thursday and Friday before the rain extends southwards into Sydney and the South Coast over the weekend. The Bureau of Meteorology said it was possible the rainfall would extend to parts of the state with active bushfires as the weather system moves south. But Grace Legge, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said it was too early to forecast how much rain would make it to those areas. She said while rainfall was welcome, fire grounds were also more vulnerable to severe weather that could increase runoff of ash and silt into waterways. WaterNSW is monitoring forecasts for areas around the Warragamba Dam, the source of 80% of untreated supply for greater Sydney. The extent of any water quality impacts on water in the dam will depend on the timing and intensity of the rainfall. Two silt curtains designed to trap material that could pose a risk to water quality have been in place since January. \u201cWaterNSW is working closely with the BoM to anticipate potential rain impacts in coming days,\u201d a spokesman said. At this stage, the BoM is forecasting widespread rain of 20mm to 50mm for central Queensland and eastern NSW, with the potential for up to 100mm in some areas. The NSW Department of Primary Industries has warned agricultural producers to prepare their properties and stock for potential effects from heavy rain, thunderstorms and flash flooding. The department said on Wednesday the heavy falls would also increase the risk of organic debris ending up in waterways, which could reduce water quality and \u201cmay trigger fish deaths in already stressed river systems\u201d. Several fish kills have already occurred this year as the result of ash from bushfires, and other organic matter and sediment, washing into local catchments. \u201cDespite these short-term risks, the resumption of flow and subsequent replenishment of refuge holes and connectivity along waterways will provide long-term benefits to native fish populations during the current drought period,\u201d a spokeswoman said. In Western Australia, a tropical low off the north coast is expected to develop into a tropical cyclone on Thursday morning. Legge said it was expected to deepen and could become a category three cyclone by Saturday as it moved toward land. She said there was still \u201clarge uncertainty\u201d as to whether it would make landfall, but if it did that could occur in the region from Port Hedland down to Onslow on either Saturday or Sunday. On Wednesday there was also a flood watch in place for parts of the western and northern Kimberley.",

And a week later, he\u2019s in Trinity, allegedly the cushiest place in Wandsworth. But even Trinity has its hierarchy: to be given a decent cell, a prisoner\u2019s IEP (incentives and earned privileges) level needs to be Enhanced, and Atkins, as a new arrival, is Standard. By signing up for a dry lining course, without knowing what dry lining is, he improves his prospects. Then a lucky break earns him a place on H wing, \u201cthe prison equivalent of Hampstead\u201d, among white-collar professionals and ex-public schoolboys like himself.</p> <p>Entering (or re-entering) this \u201cbubble of white privilege\u201d makes him feel guilty: \u201cIn a strange mirror of wider society, the more educated and affluent prisoners carved out the best jobs and places to live,\u201d while \u201cthe most vulnerable people on the outside often got the worst deal behind bars too.\u201d Still, you can\u2019t blame Atkins for trying to avoid the worst of Wandsworth. Ingratiation is the route to integration, and as \u201cthe screws\u2019 bitch\u201d he\u2019s able to move more freely about the prison, delivering food or handing out slips and in return sneaking in a quick phone call or shower. Each month he discovers more about the place and the petty madness of its rules. And each chapter of his book begins with a list of things he has learned, whether \u201chow to build a drugs empire\u201d or how \u201crehabilitation programmes can actually increase crime\u201d.</p> <p>As that suggests, Atkins\u2019s liberalism has its limits. Prison reformers may be keen on cheerily titled rehab courses (\u201cGetting it Right!\u201d, \u201cBe a Hero!\u201d) but their effectiveness is doubtful. One prisoner confesses how by signing up for a victim awareness course, and using the right buzzwords, he\u2019ll improve his chances of being released and resuming his life of crime. And while teetotal Muslims sign up for AA programmes as a break from being locked up, there\u2019s precious little funding for mental health services.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Healthcare is stuck in the Middle Ages \u2013 'It wouldn\u2019t have been out of place if they\u2019d started dispensing leeches'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Atkins is shocked by the amount of self-harm he sees and by the number of prisoners who are mentally disturbed rather than malevolent. He cites the example of an inmate called Dex, who is forever in trouble for cutting himself or trashing his cell: \u201cHe\u2019s too disturbed to conform to the prison\u2019s regime, but isn\u2019t deemed mad enough to be committed to a psychiatric unit.\u201d The longer he spends inside, the more catch-22s he encounters: the prisoner unable to present his report on the consequences of being locked in his cell all day because he\u2019s locked in a cell all day; the men not given definite release dates whose behaviour deteriorates from the uncertainty and whose release dates are then further deferred; the fact that the prison wing where inmates are sent to get clean of drugs is also the easiest place to obtain drugs (heroin, coke, weed, speed, skunk and crack \u2013 everything but paracetamol).</p> <p>Soon Atkins is having one-to-one sessions with his fellow cons, having been enlisted as a \u201cListener\u201d, lending an ear to any prisoner going through a crisis. The experience confirms that half of them are illiterate; that prison healthcare is stuck in the Middle Ages (\u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been out of place if they\u2019d started dispensing leeches\u201d); that the authorities waste their energy on fiddle-faddles (decreeing that inmates be called \u201cmen\u201d rather than \u201cprisoners\u201d for example) rather than real reform. His biggest complaint is that Wandsworth is stuck in a time-warp, with a decaying building and little or no use of IT.</p> <p>Atkins admits that keeping his diary was personally helpful \u2013 a way of staying sane. It\u2019s also, for all its knockabout humour, fantastically informative. Along with examples of prison slang \u2013 an electronic tag is a \u201cchav nav\u201d or \u201cPeckham Rolex\u201d; to \u201cbank it\u201d is to smuggle drugs into prison in your anus \u2013 there are boxes full of statistics he\u2019s unearthed and insights he\u2019s gleaned. It\u2019s well known that the UK has the largest prison population in the EU, the highest reoffending rate, and that under Chris Grayling the number of prison officers was cut by a third. But I didn\u2019t know how little confiscation there is of criminal proceeds (26p in every \u00a3100), or how many children in the UK have a parent behind bars (around 200,000), or that 58% of remand prisoners do not receive prison sentences, or that, though those remand prisoners make up only 13% of the prison population, they account for 46% of suicides.</p> <p>Nine months after entering Wandsworth, Atkins moved on, to serve the rest of his sentence in a couple of open prisons; the journal stops at that point. He feels little nostalgia for his time in jail, but thinks it has made him less judgmental and that we might all benefit from a spell inside. His epilogue lists the changes he\u2019d introduce were he ever appointed justice secretary. They are humane, straightforward and make good sense. What are the chances of them being adopted by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/21/justice-secretary-denies-government-rushing-new-anti-terror-laws\" title=\"\">current incumbent, Robert Buckland</a>?

Entering (or re-entering) this \u201cbubble of white privilege\u201d makes him feel guilty: \u201cIn a strange mirror of wider society, the more educated and affluent prisoners carved out the best jobs and places to live,\u201d while \u201cthe most vulnerable people on the outside often got the worst deal behind bars too.\u201d Still, you can\u2019t blame Atkins for trying to avoid the worst of Wandsworth. Ingratiation is the route to integration, and as \u201cthe screws\u2019 bitch\u201d he\u2019s able to move more freely about the prison, delivering food or handing out slips and in return sneaking in a quick phone call or shower. Each month he discovers more about the place and the petty madness of its rules. And each chapter of his book begins with a list of things he has learned, whether \u201chow to build a drugs empire\u201d or how \u201crehabilitation programmes can actually increase crime\u201d. As that suggests, Atkins\u2019s liberalism has its limits. Prison reformers may be keen on cheerily titled rehab courses (\u201cGetting it Right!\u201d, \u201cBe a Hero!\u201d) but their effectiveness is doubtful. One prisoner confesses how by signing up for a victim awareness course, and using the right buzzwords, he\u2019ll improve his chances of being released and resuming his life of crime. And while teetotal Muslims sign up for AA programmes as a break from being locked up, there\u2019s precious little funding for mental health services. Atkins is shocked by the amount of self-harm he sees and by the number of prisoners who are mentally disturbed rather than malevolent. He cites the example of an inmate called Dex, who is forever in trouble for cutting himself or trashing his cell: \u201cHe\u2019s too disturbed to conform to the prison\u2019s regime, but isn\u2019t deemed mad enough to be committed to a psychiatric unit.\u201d The longer he spends inside, the more catch-22s he encounters: the prisoner unable to present his report on the consequences of being locked in his cell all day because he\u2019s locked in a cell all day; the men not given definite release dates whose behaviour deteriorates from the uncertainty and whose release dates are then further deferred; the fact that the prison wing where inmates are sent to get clean of drugs is also the easiest place to obtain drugs (heroin, coke, weed, speed, skunk and crack \u2013 everything but paracetamol). Soon Atkins is having one-to-one sessions with his fellow cons, having been enlisted as a \u201cListener\u201d, lending an ear to any prisoner going through a crisis. The experience confirms that half of them are illiterate; that prison healthcare is stuck in the Middle Ages (\u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been out of place if they\u2019d started dispensing leeches\u201d); that the authorities waste their energy on fiddle-faddles (decreeing that inmates be called \u201cmen\u201d rather than \u201cprisoners\u201d for example) rather than real reform. His biggest complaint is that Wandsworth is stuck in a time-warp, with a decaying building and little or no use of IT. Atkins admits that keeping his diary was personally helpful \u2013 a way of staying sane. It\u2019s also, for all its knockabout humour, fantastically informative. Along with examples of prison slang \u2013 an electronic tag is a \u201cchav nav\u201d or \u201cPeckham Rolex\u201d; to \u201cbank it\u201d is to smuggle drugs into prison in your anus \u2013 there are boxes full of statistics he\u2019s unearthed and insights he\u2019s gleaned. It\u2019s well known that the UK has the largest prison population in the EU, the highest reoffending rate, and that under Chris Grayling the number of prison officers was cut by a third. But I didn\u2019t know how little confiscation there is of criminal proceeds (26p in every \u00a3100), or how many children in the UK have a parent behind bars (around 200,000), or that 58% of remand prisoners do not receive prison sentences, or that, though those remand prisoners make up only 13% of the prison population, they account for 46% of suicides. Nine months after entering Wandsworth, Atkins moved on, to serve the rest of his sentence in a couple of open prisons; the journal stops at that point. He feels little nostalgia for his time in jail, but thinks it has made him less judgmental and that we might all benefit from a spell inside. His epilogue lists the changes he\u2019d introduce were he ever appointed justice secretary. They are humane, straightforward and make good sense. What are the chances of them being adopted by the current incumbent, Robert Buckland? As someone who once invested in a film partnership that HMRC investigated as a tax avoidance scheme, he and Atkins have some common ground. Let\u2019s hope against hope they get together and that some of the reforms proposed here are implemented before conditions in our prisons get even worse. \u2022 A Bit of a Stretch is published by Atlantic (RRP \u00a316).

Human Rights Watch has documented 138 deported Salvadorans murdered by gang members, police, soldiers, death squads and ex-partners between 2013 and 2019. The majority were killed within two years of deportation by the same perpetrators they had tried to escape by seeking safety in the US. The report, Deported to Danger: United States deportation policies expose Salvadorans to death and abuse, also identifies more than 70 others who were subjected to beatings, sexual assault and extortion \u2013 usually at the hand of gangs \u2013 or who went missing after being returned. El Salvador, the most densely populated country in Central America with just over 6 million citizens, has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of homicide and sexual violence. In addition, almost 11,000 people were registered missing during the last decade - more than the number of people who disappeared during the 1979-1992 civil war. Authorities are largely ineffective in protecting the population from this violence, which is often perpetrated by street gangs which have 60,000 or so members across the country. Extrajudicial executions, sexual assaults, enforced disappearances and torture have also been perpetrated by state security forces with almost total impunity. Amid widespread terror and impunity, the number of Salvadorans fleeing has soared, with asylum applicants in the US increasing by almost 1,000% in five years to 60,000 in 2017, according to UN figures.

\u201cvery large\u201d due to the \u201clarge-scale destruction of homes, farms and businesses as well as public infrastructure\u201d.</p> <p>He said that, taking into account the expected rebuilding effort, government grants and insurance payouts, the fires would not affect economic growth across the whole year.</p> <p>However, the fires would cut economic growth by about 0.2 percentage points in the December quarter and the current quarter.</p> <p>Lowe said that despite the disasters, the economy was going through \u201ca gentle turning point for the better\u201d, predicting modest increases in growth and consumer spending over the coming two years.</p> <p>He also defended the bank\u2019s decision to cut official interest rates to a historic low of 0.75% against charges that it has spooked consumers into closing their wallets.</p> <p>Instead, Australians were adapting to a period of consistently low wages growth, high household debt and a fall in home prices by paying down their

coronavirus travel ban</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Tourism sector takes a hit</h2> <p>Simon Westaway, the executive director of the Australian Tourism Industry Council, said his body was working on an estimate of the \u201csignificant\u201d hit the sector would take from the ban on Chinese nationals entering Australia.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to run into the many hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said the government had given industry no guidance on whether the ban would be extended when it expires on 15 February.</p> <p>\u201cIndustry\u2019s not confident we\u2019re going to see flights return any time soon but we\u2019ve got to be constructive and we are being constructive behind the scenes.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s flight ban on Saturday followed China\u2019s decision last week to stop group travel, which makes up about a quarter of the Australian market.</p> <p>Westaway said tour operators in areas popular with Chinese groups, including the Great Ocean Road and the Yarra Valley in Victoria, and the Gold Coast and Cairns in Queensland, were already feeling the effect of cancelled bookings.</p> <h2>Passenger numbers decline</h2> <p>Of airports in Australia and New Zealand, the flight ban will hit Melbourne\u2019s the hardest, according to ratings agency S&amp;P.</p> <p>\u201cThe coronavirus crisis, sluggish economic conditions across Asia-Pacific, and the impact of the Australian bushfires will dent growth in passenger traffic to ANZ [Australia and New Zealand] airports,\u201d analyst Parvathy Iyer said.</p> <p>In a report issued on Wednesday, Iyer said that because Chinese traffic makes up 16% of airport business in Australia and New Zealand, international visitor numbers may fall.</p> <p>\u201cFurther, the full impact of the Australian bushfires has yet to play out,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cRegional communities and small businesses are severely affected, and travel warnings issued by some countries over December-January will crimp passenger numbers.\u201d</p> <h2>Casino earnings expected to fall</h2> <p>S&amp;P says James Packer\u2019s Crown Resorts operations are also set to take a hit from coronavirus \u2013 although its controversial suitor, Hong Kong\u2019s Melco, is likely to fare worse.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe the coronavirus will likely reduce both VIP and mass-market visitation to Crown Resorts\u2019s properties in Australia,\u201d the agency said.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it is still too early to quantify the outbreak\u2019s eventual effect on the company\u2019s earnings given Australia\u2019s still-strong domestic economy and our view that it has a smaller cash flow exposure to the outbreak than the firms operating in Macau and Singapore.\u201d</p> <p>These include Melco, which runs casinos in the former Portuguese colony of Macau, and is currently embroiled in controversy over its attempts to buy 20% of Crown that are to be examined at public hearings in NSW.</p> <p>S&amp;P said Melco \u201chas limited flexibility to absorb a prolonged and severe decline in its cash flow\u201d because it needs money to build an expansion to its Studio City casino in Macau.</p> <h2>Up to $8bn drop in education income</h2> <p>The International Education Association of Australia <a

a global reputation taskforce set up by education minister Dan Tehan last month to deal with the effects of the bushfires.</p> <p>The tertiary education sector is expecting \u201csignificant

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus outbreak may further hurt an economy already suffering from bushfires and drought, the governor of the Reserve Bank says. In a speech to the National Press Club in Sydney, Philip Lowe said the RBA was closely monitoring the economic effect of the epidemic, which has killed more than 490 people. He said the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on the Australian economy could be worse than that of the 2003 Sars epidemic because \u201cChina is a larger part of the global economy and it is more closely integrated, including with Australia\u201d. Sectors including tourism and education are likely to suffer billions of dollars worth of damage if the Morrison government keeps travel bans in place for more than six months, while the price of another key export to China, iron ore, has fallen by more than 10% in a month. The RBA expects the ongoing drought to cut 0.25 percentage points from growth this year. Lowe said the economic impact on bushfire areas was \u201cvery large\u201d due to the \u201clarge-scale destruction of homes, farms and businesses as well as public infrastructure\u201d. He said that, taking into account the expected rebuilding effort, government grants and insurance payouts, the fires would not affect economic growth across the whole year. However, the fires would cut economic growth by about 0.2 percentage points in the December quarter and the current quarter. Lowe said that despite the disasters, the economy was going through \u201ca gentle turning point for the better\u201d, predicting modest increases in growth and consumer spending over the coming two years. He also defended the bank\u2019s decision to cut official interest rates to a historic low of 0.75% against charges that it has spooked consumers into closing their wallets. Instead, Australians were adapting to a period of consistently low wages growth, high household debt and a fall in home prices by paying down their mortgages instead of going to the shops, he said. In a report released on Wednesday, Deloitte Access Economics partner Stephen Smith said the RBA\u2019s series of cuts to interest rates meant that \u201cmany consumers and businesses now believe that the economy and its prospects are worse than they actually are\u201d. He said uncertainty about energy policy was also limiting investment in electricity infrastructure. \u201cOverall, although private business investment is forecast to grow through the course of 2020, the pace of those gains is now set to be more modest than previously expected,\u201d he said. Tourism sector takes a hit Simon Westaway, the executive director of the Australian Tourism Industry Council, said his body was working on an estimate of the \u201csignificant\u201d hit the sector would take from the ban on Chinese nationals entering Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s going to run into the many hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d he said. He said the government had given industry no guidance on whether the ban would be extended when it expires on 15 February. \u201cIndustry\u2019s not confident we\u2019re going to see flights return any time soon but we\u2019ve got to be constructive and we are being constructive behind the scenes.\u201d The government\u2019s flight ban on Saturday followed China\u2019s decision last week to stop group travel, which makes up about a quarter of the Australian market. Westaway said tour operators in areas popular with Chinese groups, including the Great Ocean Road and the Yarra Valley in Victoria, and the Gold Coast and Cairns in Queensland, were already feeling the effect of cancelled bookings. Passenger numbers decline Of airports in Australia and New Zealand, the flight ban will hit Melbourne\u2019s the hardest, according to ratings agency S&amp;P. \u201cThe coronavirus crisis, sluggish economic conditions across Asia-Pacific, and the impact of the Australian bushfires will dent growth in passenger traffic to ANZ [Australia and New Zealand] airports,\u201d analyst Parvathy Iyer said. In a report issued on Wednesday, Iyer said that because Chinese traffic makes up 16% of airport business in Australia and New Zealand, international visitor numbers may fall. \u201cFurther, the full impact of the Australian bushfires has yet to play out,\u201d she said. \u201cRegional communities and small businesses are severely affected, and travel warnings issued by some countries over December-January will crimp passenger numbers.\u201d Casino earnings expected to fall S&amp;P says James Packer\u2019s Crown Resorts operations are also set to take a hit from coronavirus \u2013 although its controversial suitor, Hong Kong\u2019s Melco, is likely to fare worse. \u201cWe believe the coronavirus will likely reduce both VIP and mass-market visitation to Crown Resorts\u2019s properties in Australia,\u201d the agency said. \u201cHowever, it is still too early to quantify the outbreak\u2019s eventual effect on the company\u2019s earnings given Australia\u2019s still-strong domestic economy and our view that it has a smaller cash flow exposure to the outbreak than the firms operating in Macau and Singapore.\u201d These include Melco, which runs casinos in the former Portuguese colony of Macau, and is currently embroiled in controversy over its attempts to buy 20% of Crown that are to be examined at public hearings in NSW. S&amp;P said Melco \u201chas limited flexibility to absorb a prolonged and severe decline in its cash flow\u201d because it needs money to build an expansion to its Studio City casino in Macau. Up to $8bn drop in education income The International Education Association of Australia estimates that if Chinese students aren\u2019t able to enrol for the next six months it will cost the industry between $6bn and $8bn. A spokesman said the ITEA was working on a better estimate and should have one ready in advance of a meeting of a meeting of a global reputation taskforce set up by education minister Dan Tehan last month to deal with the effects of the bushfires. The tertiary education sector is expecting \u201csignificant impact\u201d, the Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia said. It said 13,604 Chinese residents were estimated to be enrolled in Australian vocational education and training, with 10,935 of them already in the country and 2,669 holding a valid student visa but marooned abroad. Mining companies exposed The price of Australia\u2019s most important export to China, iron ore, fell 11% in January due to the virus outbreak, ratings agency Moody\u2019s said. Australia exports more than $60bn a year worth of iron ore to China, and the industry is a major source of tax revenue. According to Moody\u2019s, mining magnate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals is the Australian miner most exposed to a downturn in China because it makes 93% of its sales there. But the two big Anglo-Australian miners, BHP and Rio Tinto, are also heavily exposed, selling 55% and 45% respectively to China.",

She says: \u201cIf [my eldest] starts school, it\u2019s like I have everything.\u201d Her son drew a picture of his hopes, which he showed his teacher, saying: \u201cI want a house and my mum to be happy, because she cries all the time.\u201d Hopefully, one will lead to the other. \u2022 Some names have been changed",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Berlin: The political class is divided on how harsh to be</strong></h2> <p>The German government is bracing itself for tough negotiations. Berlin sees the UK\u2019s decision to put a 31 December time limit on the process as a tactical manoeuvre by Boris Johnson, calculated to step up the pressure on the EU towards the end of 2020. Germany holds the EU presidency until the end of December and will have to oversee negotiations on the next EU budget, which will involve juggling increasingly difficult demands. It will also be the last major test for Chancellor Angela Merkel, coming shortly before she leaves office in 2021.</p> <p>According to officials, a bare-bones EU-UK trade agreement that obviates only the introduction of customs duties and import quotas is fully negotiable within this time. If the agreement touches only on areas the EU has sole responsibility for, it will be quickly ratified. Greater difficulties arise in what are known as \u201cmixed\u201d agreements, where member states themselves also retain power. Here, national or even regional parliaments must agree, and ratification can take at least two years.</p> <p>The German government no longer expects agreement on the \u201clevel playing field\u201d provisions (outlawing competition by undercutting EU standards). London is unlikely to automatically submit to EU rules. Still, Berlin is determined not to allow EU environmental protection standards, social policies or data protection to be undermined. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b35a2b42f062945ad4788c51b73862c0e0b308e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b35a2b42f062945ad4788c51b73862c0e0b308e5/0_0_3380_2544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel leaving the Bundestag in Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Merkel leaving the Bundestag in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hayoung Jeon/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For that reason a new legal idea is being examined, one that would allow for a close UK connection with the single market. This, however, would involve an enormous amount of bureaucracy for British industry. What is at issue here is the so-called principle of equivalence. The EU can decree that the regulations applied by a non-EU state have equal value to those applying under community law. Once this is established, the EU can grant free access to the single market.</p> <p>This principle is already used in the implementation of EU law by the member states. States must not treat EU law as inferior to national law, and must prove it. Applied to the UK post-Brexit, this would mean that the British side is responsible for the proper implementation of EU rules, and would have to provide evidence they have done so. Should they fail, there would be a price to pay in terms of market access or tariffs.</p> <p>However, German politics is divided on how harshly the UK should be treated. Given the scale of the UK\u2019s economic interdependence with the EU, the German government expects quick solutions in areas such as research, science, education, security and military cooperation.

Italy exported goods and services worth \u20ac24.8bn (up 4.3% on 2017), and imported UK goods to the value of \u20ac19.7bn (an increase of 2.4% on 2017). Italy was the UK\u2019s ninth biggest trading partner globally in 2018, a position that Rome plans to defend, if not improve. So doing the least possible to disrupt the current state of affairs is of fundamental interest. \u201cWhat we want,\u201d diplomats say, \u201cis a balanced agreement: zero dumping, and import and export quotas stripped to the bone.\u201d Business activities and credit facilities, conditions for the roughly 1,000 Italian companies based in the UK, financial channels and Milan stock exchange\u2019s membership of the London Stock Exchange Group must not be interrupted, not now and not after the negotiations \u2013 which won\u2019t be easy.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the outset we\u2019ve been using the English expression \u2018level playing field\u2019, precisely to avoid misunderstandings,\u201d says one of the politicians closest to the trade negotiations.

One source laments the EU\u2019s lack of \u201ccunning\u201d in its dealings with Theresa May. \u201cWinning the negotiations doesn\u2019t always mean you end up with the best possible situation,\u201d he says. This is a reference to the Northern Ireland backstop and, above all, the customs union, contained in the deal negotiated by May but defeated three times in Westminster. \u201cNow with Johnson\u2019s agreement we\u2019re starting out with a more complicated situation, at least for the Italians, who want to see our interests represented in a relationship with London that\u2019s very like the one we have at present.\u201d</p> <p>As to security, both internal and external, existing cooperation mechanisms are plainly going to be lost.

      "bodyText": "Berlin: The political class is divided on how harsh to be The German government is bracing itself for tough negotiations. Berlin sees the UK\u2019s decision to put a 31 December time limit on the process as a tactical manoeuvre by Boris Johnson, calculated to step up the pressure on the EU towards the end of 2020. Germany holds the EU presidency until the end of December and will have to oversee negotiations on the next EU budget, which will involve juggling increasingly difficult demands. It will also be the last major test for Chancellor Angela Merkel, coming shortly before she leaves office in 2021. According to officials, a bare-bones EU-UK trade agreement that obviates only the introduction of customs duties and import quotas is fully negotiable within this time. If the agreement touches only on areas the EU has sole responsibility for, it will be quickly ratified. Greater difficulties arise in what are known as \u201cmixed\u201d agreements, where member states themselves also retain power. Here, national or even regional parliaments must agree, and ratification can take at least two years. The German government no longer expects agreement on the \u201clevel playing field\u201d provisions (outlawing competition by undercutting EU standards). London is unlikely to automatically submit to EU rules. Still, Berlin is determined not to allow EU environmental protection standards, social policies or data protection to be undermined. For that reason a new legal idea is being examined, one that would allow for a close UK connection with the single market. This, however, would involve an enormous amount of bureaucracy for British industry. What is at issue here is the so-called principle of equivalence. The EU can decree that the regulations applied by a non-EU state have equal value to those applying under community law. Once this is established, the EU can grant free access to the single market. This principle is already used in the implementation of EU law by the member states. States must not treat EU law as inferior to national law, and must prove it. Applied to the UK post-Brexit, this would mean that the British side is responsible for the proper implementation of EU rules, and would have to provide evidence they have done so. Should they fail, there would be a price to pay in terms of market access or tariffs. However, German politics is divided on how harshly the UK should be treated. Given the scale of the UK\u2019s economic interdependence with the EU, the German government expects quick solutions in areas such as research, science, education, security and military cooperation. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t want to make Brexit a model for others \u2013 there must be clear advantages to EU membership, or so it is argued. Germany is eagerly awaiting a more detailed British negotiating mandate \u2013 Johnson\u2019s speech in Greenwich this week didn\u2019t amount to one. Will he maintain his generally unpredictable political style or take his lead from the domestic UK political mood? The German chancellor is said to still have great sympathy with the British, but she has not forgotten how Johnson treated her on the way to his election victory last year. \u2022 Stefan Kornelius writes for S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung Madrid: Looming on the horizon is Gibraltar Spain knows the road ahead won\u2019t be easy. The levels of bilateral economic interdependence, both trading and financial, are intense. Both nations have hundreds of thousands of citizens working and living in each other\u2019s territories.

So doing the least possible to disrupt the current state of affairs is of fundamental interest. \u201cWhat we want,\u201d diplomats say, \u201cis a balanced agreement: zero dumping, and import and export quotas stripped to the bone.\u201d Business activities and credit facilities, conditions for the roughly 1,000 Italian companies based in the UK, financial channels and Milan stock exchange\u2019s membership of the London Stock Exchange Group must not be interrupted, not now and not after the negotiations \u2013 which won\u2019t be easy. \u201cFrom the outset we\u2019ve been using the English expression \u2018level playing field\u2019, precisely to avoid misunderstandings,\u201d says one of the politicians closest to the trade negotiations. And while Italy might have been happier with a longer negotiation on the future relationship, it is resigned to the 31 December end date: \u201cWe\u2019ll see to it that this timeframe is used to its best advantage.\u201d Immediately after the Brexit referendum in 2016, Italy set up an ad-hoc taskforce, coordinated by the prime minister\u2019s office. One source laments the EU\u2019s lack of \u201ccunning\u201d in its dealings with Theresa May. \u201cWinning the negotiations doesn\u2019t always mean you end up with the best possible situation,\u201d he says. This is a reference to the Northern Ireland backstop and, above all, the customs union, contained in the deal negotiated by May but defeated three times in Westminster. \u201cNow with Johnson\u2019s agreement we\u2019re starting out with a more complicated situation, at least for the Italians, who want to see our interests represented in a relationship with London that\u2019s very like the one we have at present.\u201d As to security, both internal and external, existing cooperation mechanisms are plainly going to be lost. So it\u2019s important, both for Italy and the other EU countries, that similar mechanisms replace them. One intelligence officer says that keeping channels open for the exchange of data and information \u2013 on terrorism and security policies, for instance \u2013 is crucial. Italy (and Europe) can\u2019t do without London in this respect, and, for as long as the UK is part of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance, finding a way of relating to this structure in new and advantageous ways is seen in Rome as the definitive challenge. \u2022 Francesca Sforza and Alberto Simoni write for La Stampa London: It\u2019s frictionless trade versus full political sovereignty Britain knows it has taken a leap in the dark by ending its 47-year relationship with the EU. The divorce took more than three years, but Boris Johnson has given his negotiating team only 11 months to forge an enduring new settlement. Already there have been wobbles in the British cabinet about the extent to which it wants the UK economy to diverge from the European model. Johnson has never truly revealed his brand of Euroscepticism. In order to secure the withdrawal agreement, he largely accepted the form of Northern Ireland backstop first offered by Brussels. But that episode only revealed his pragmatic determination to achieve Brexit. He played to the Eurosceptic gallery to win the leadership of the Conservative party. But is he prepared to inflict the economic shock to the UK of a looser trading relationship with Europe in pursuit of maximum political sovereignty? He has a large Commons majority, but there are constraints. His new cadre of \u201cblue wall\u201d MPs in England\u2019s Midlands and northern regions will see their constituents suffer most if barriers to trade are erected in 2021. The more barriers start to rise, the more onerous the border checks will be on goods crossing the Irish Sea from Britain into Northern Ireland. The more Northern Ireland looks damaged by Brexit, the louder will be the demands for Scottish independence. Business, agriculture and manufacturing will raise the alarm at the sight of European markets disappearing behind a wall of tariffs. The risk then becomes that Brexit looks like a project for English south. For the first few months of this year, before the talks start in earnest in late spring, Johnson will be able to avoid hard choices. But at some point he will have to acknowledge that frictionless trade and full political sovereignty are incompatible. Downing Street believes its diplomatic cards will produce compromise. Brussels will not want a deregulated behemoth on its doorstep. The collective discipline the EU showed in the first round of talks may be tested. The UK also believes that Germany and France, needing British defence assets, want to cooperate with the UK on defence. On foreign policy the EU 3 group, deployed in policymaking over Iran and Libya, makes Britain a necessary partner for Europe. UK officials believe national capitals will be more assertive this year \u2013 especially if, for instance, central European states, locked in difficult EU budget talks, feel France is being too tough. Moreover, the threat of other countries going down the Brexit route has diminished. The EU\u2019s very survival is no longer at stake, especially if Johnson does not play the role of disruptor that Trump might like. The Foreign Office thinks that France, for wider issues of security, will in any case want to cooperate. Britain may not share Emmanuel Macron\u2019s exasperation with Nato or American isolationism, and it would greatly alarm Poland \u2013 Britain\u2019s greatest ally in the EU \u2013 if it did. But Macron\u2019s call for a stronger EU defence pillar gives the UK an entry point into the discussion on future European defence. \u2022 Patrick Wintour is diplomatic editor for the Guardian",

Allen, who was elected for the seat of Higgins in May, is one of a number of Liberal MPs who have been arguing internally for the government to increase its ambition on climate change against resistance from conservatives in the Coalition. Allen\u2019s suggestion for a climate change portfolio was made in a group chat of MPs in a discussion about how the government\u2019s policies could be better communicated, sources have confirmed. She did not advocate in the group that the government needed to do more, but suggested there was frustration that voters were not hearing the government\u2019s message. She argued that the \u201csignificant investment\u201d being made by the government did not appear to be acknowledged in the community. Allen proposed that her fellow Victorian MP Tim Wilson would be a good advocate to communicate the government\u2019s policies. Both Allen and Wilson declined to comment on the discussion. Wilson was one of the MPs who spoke in Tuesday\u2019s partyroom in favour of more ambitious climate action and has also urged the government to consider nuclear power. His call for more action was backed up by Allen, along with the member for Reid, Fiona Martin, and the North Sydney MP, Trent Zimmerman, who argued that the government needed to ensure it respected divergent views on the issue, and acknowledged the strength of feeling for more action in inner city seats. Nationals MPs George Christensen, Barnaby Joyce and David Gillespie argued that the government should not succumb to pressure from inner city voters to do more on climate, with Joyce saying it was a \u201chobby horse\u201d that was being pursued through the tragedy of bushfires.

So we won\u2019t be bullied into higher taxes or higher electricity prices. What we\u2019ll do is take practical action that deals with these challenges.\u201d Morrison also dismissed overnight calls from the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, for other countries to join Britain in striving for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. \u201cI would never make a commitment like that if I couldn\u2019t tell the Australian people what it would cost them,\u201d Morrison said. As the Coalition seeks to reposition on climate, Morrison faced questions in Parliament about the government\u2019s response to the bushfires. In response to a question from the Warringah MP, Zali Steggall, asking for a bipartisan approach to climate change in the wake of the crisis, Morrison said Australia was already acting. \u201cEmissions reduction is important. We\u2019re acting on that reduction.

Morrison said the government had responded in an \u201cunprecedented\u201d manner to the fires, and it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d that Labor was trying to \u201cpoliticise the bushfires\u201d. Earlier, Liberal MP John Alexander used his condolence speech on the bushfires to call climate change \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d. \u201cToday is a day for commemoration, not politics. But one thing I would like to say is the need to recognise that these fires are not a warning about climate change \u2013 they are climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe leader of the opposition said that \u2018this is not normal\u2019. I fear this is actually the new normal. \u201cIn focusing on saving this country for our grandchildren, we risk forgetting we need to save our neighbours.

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has refused to release any legal advice on the botched Centrelink robodebt scheme to a Senate inquiry examining the program, prompting claims from Labor of a \u201cwhitewash\u201d. Guardian Australia has learned that the government services minister, Stuart Robert, has refused to provide the inquiry with any legal advice the government has ever sought about the legality of the program. Citing public interest immunity, he has also declined to say when any advice may or may not have been provided or who it was prepared by, if indeed it exists. Doubt swirls over the future of the program \u2013 including how many welfare recipients will be affected by the decision to review debts that were issued using \u201cincome averaging\u201d, a much maligned process the government abandoned late last year under the shadow of a court challenge. Labor\u2019s government services spokesman, Bill Shorten, said the public deserved to know what led the government to believe that the \u201cscheme was legally justified\u201d. \u201cThere are three possibilities. Either they got bad legal advice, they got good legal advice and ignored it or they recklessly commenced their program against innocent Australians without ever seeking legal advice as to its legality,\u201d he said. Shorten said Labor would \u201cconsider all options to fight this whitewash in the interest of giving the myriad victims of robodebt the answers they so justly deserve\u201d. \u201cHundreds of thousands of Australians have had more than a billion dollars taken from them in suspect debt claims by the inaccurate robodebt scheme,\u201d he said. In general, federal governments, including the previous Labor government, have refused to release legal advice, citing decades\u2019 of historical precedent. A spokesman for Robert said: \u201cIt has been the long-standing practice of successive Australian governments not to disclose legal advice.\u201d The Senate inquiry, chaired by the Greens Rachel Siewert, was established last year amid growing public anger at the scheme. In November, the government settled a legal challenge brought by Victoria Legal Aid on behalf of a Melbourne woman. The court declared by consent that the $2,500 debt \u2013 which was issued using \u201cincome averaging\u201d and eventually revised by Centrelink to less than $2 \u2013 was \u201cnot validly made\u201d. Days earlier, the government overhauled the scheme, saying it would only issue debts where it had gathered evidence of the income earned by welfare recipients rather than simply averaging a person\u2019s annual income across 26 fortnights. At the time, the attorney-general, Christian Porter, said the government would not waive privilege over any legal advice it had sought about the program. But Porter appeared to confirm the government had sought legal advice in some form. \u201cYou could imagine that any government \u2026 seeks advice on those individual matters, and that\u2019s fed in, obviously, to decision-making in the Department of Human Services and in the minister\u2019s office,\u201d he said.

Well done to <strong>Bridget McKenzie</strong> for doing just that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Reminder: we have no idea what Gaetjens has said. The spreadsheet was colour-coded according to party.

Constitutional expert Anne Twomey who has questioned the constitutionality of the sports grants funding, has also previously questioned the constitutionality of \u2018Stronger Communities\u2019 grants (which is what the Cronulla Sailing Club was awarded its BBQ through, in the post with Scott Morrison\u2019s PA) From AAP: Labor has failed to force the Morrison government to establish a national integrity commission before reviving a union-busting bill in the Senate. The opposition also wanted the recommendations of the banking and aged care royal commissions implemented before the government\u2019s \u201censuring integrity\u201d laws are debated. The three lofty conditions were designed to ward off a vote on the legislation, which would make it easier to deregister unions and ban officials. The Morrison government suffered a humiliating defeat last year when One Nation made the shock decision to shoot the bill down in the Senate in December. But Labor frontbencher Katy Gallagher\u2019s motion was voted down 36 votes to 31 on Wednesday, with minor parties One Nation and Centre Alliance opposed. Labor\u2019s motion would have erected a parliamentary roadblock until: * legislation to establish a national integrity commission receives royal assent * all recommendations from the banking royal commission are legislated * the interim recommendations of the aged care royal commission are legislated. Tasmanian independent Jacqui Lambie, who looms as the crucial senator on the union bill, abstained from the vote. The government has flagged it will have another crack at trying to pass the legislation, arguing the reforms would clamp down on unions repeatedly breaking the law This is being handed down next Tuesday Say it with me: Police debunked the arsonist claim Fire authorities repeatedly said their window to carryout hazard reduction burns was shortened by warmer seasons Just because something is eligible, doesn\u2019t mean it is all OK Oh this is going swimmingly well Thank you, but your application was extremely, extremely well written. And its not me who gives you money, it\u2019s ScoMo. So vote Liberal, otherwise I won\u2019t have a job!\u201d That\u2019s the whole quote from Scott Morrison\u2019s personal assistant, who is announced as the person who helped the Cronulla Sailing Club with its successful application in the grant connect round * *Not Bridget McKenzie\u2019s sport grants program The Senate is whipping through the motions for documents: Mehreen Faruqi\u2019s motion to order the release of Bridget McKenzie\u2019s emails relating to her $156k hobby report into recreational shooting just passed: This also passed: This is one way to paint the town red: Mike Bowers was in the chamber for question time. Here is some of what he saw: Malcolm Roberts is once again displaying his complete inability to understand the difference between the weather and the climate in the Senate. Labor has just won a vote in the Senate (37 votes to 33) to set up an inquiry into lessons to be learned from the bushfire season. The full terms are: Senator Watt: To move\u2014That the following matter be referred to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for inquiry and report by the last sitting day in 2021: Lessons to be learned in relation to the preparation and planning for, response to and recovery efforts following the 2019-20 Australian bushfire season, with particular reference to: (a) advice provided to the federal government, prior to the bushfires, about the level of bushfire risk this fire season, how and why those risks differed from historical norms, and measures that should be taken to reduce that risk in the future; (b) the respective roles and responsibilities of different levels of government, and agencies within government, in relation to bushfire planning, mitigation, response, and recovery; (c) the federal government\u2019s response to recommendations from previous bushfire royal commissions and inquiries; (d) the adequacy of the federal government\u2019s existing measures and policies to reduce future bushfire risk, including in relation to assessing, mitigating and adapting to expected climate change impacts, land use planning and management, hazard reduction, Indigenous fire practices, support for firefighters and other disaster mitigation measures; (e) best practice funding models and policy measures to reduce future bushfire risk, both within Australia and internationally; (f) existing structures, measures and policies implemented by the Federal Government, charities and others to assist communities to recover from the 2019-20 bushfires, including the performance of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency; (g) the role and process of advising government and the federal parliament of scientific advice; (h) an examination of the physical and mental health impacts of bushfires on the population, and the federal government\u2019s response to those impacts; and (i) any related matters. From AAP: A powerful parliamentary committee will not consider whether Energy Minister Angus Taylor misled parliament over his use of a fake document to criticise Sydney\u2019s mayor. Manager of opposition business Tony Burke asked Speaker Tony Smith last December to look at whether Mr Taylor had misled parliament and should be referred to the privileges committee. If found to have misled parliament it would constitute being in contempt of parliament. Mr Burke had pointed to six statements Mr Taylor made to parliament, where he said his office had used travel figures downloaded from the City of Sydney\u2019s website. The figures used by Mr Taylor to attack Clover Moore cited travel spending of more than $15 million, when the council had spent about $6000. Slapping down the referral to the privileges committee, Mr Smith said there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to show Mr Taylor had misled parliament. \u201cI understand this matter is surrounded by differing views,\u201d he told parliament. \u201cHowever, the matter of misleading the House is a very serious one and, rightly, there should be prima facie evidence that the House has been misled, and that the misleading has been deliberate.\u201d A NSW police investigation into the fake travel figures has been referred to the Australian Federal Police. Before I run screaming from the room, here is what the police said about those arson figures in January: From the police: Victoria police say there is no evidence any of the devastating bushfires in the state were caused by arson, contrary to the spread of global disinformation exaggerating arsonist arrests during the current crisis. A misleading figure suggesting 183 arsonists have been arrested \u201csince the start of the bushfire season\u201d spread across the globe on Wednesday, after initial reports in News Corp were picked up by Donald Trump Jr, US far-right websites and popular alt-right personalities. The figure included statistics from some states covering the entirety of 2019, rather than just the current bushfire season, which began in September. Peter Dutton continues: Obviously, as we\u2019ve all pointed out, we\u2019re experiencing hotter weather, longer summers, but did the bushfires start in some of these regions because of climate change? No. It started because somebody lit a match. There are 250 people as I understand it or more that have been charged with arson. That\u2019s not climate change. Pulled up by Patricia Karvelas that the most common start to the fires were lightning strikes, not arson, Dutton says: Nobody\u2019s disputing that. There\u2019s been lightning strikes for as long as there have been bushfires in this country. I\u2019m happy to accept the involvement of climate change but your point was about the views in our party room. I think the views in our party room say that we want action on climate change. Yes, we\u2019ve got that climate change action now happening. And we\u2019re responding to it. Equally let\u2019s be honest about the role that the fuel load played in some of these forests. I just think it\u2019s, I think it\u2019s completely disingenuous if people aren\u2019t recognising the different elements. There\u2019s three elements, including people who have started fires in significant numbers. Some fires that have been put out and then restarted by people. I think all that\u2019s happening in our party room is that people are saying we want recognition of those three elements so that we don\u2019t have the same intensity of the bushfires next season, but because the work of our firefighters, of people in my own department, and many other people across the commonwealth including scores of volunteers, we should pay tribute to them because I think thousands of more homes would have been lost. Hundreds more lives would have been lost and I think the response has been quite remarkable from every element of our society. I think we should be very proud of the way in which we\u2019ve responded as a society to deal with the bushfires and to respond in the aftermath. Peter Dutton on the \u2018non-existent\u2019 debate on climate change within the Coalition party room. Please make sure your eyes remain in your head and your jaw stays within catching distance: Look, I\u2019ve been following this debate for a long time and I\u2019ve been in parliament for 18 years. I don\u2019t see huge points of difference in our party room. I think the way in which the PM went through all of that which we\u2019re doing, the targets we\u2019re exceeding, the uptake of renewable energy, our investment in to new technologies, when you look at what he had to say the other day, I think that is absolutely reflective of the view that\u2019s in the party room. I think the point that is made frankly by some which maybe it\u2019s a matter of interpretation or ways in which people want to massage this according to their own interpretation, I think people in our party room are saying we want action on climate change but in relation to the bushfires we absolutely believe that a large number of the bushfires were more intense because of the fact there hadn\u2019t been back-burning. Peter Dutton is apparently now #teamsourdough Here he is on Michael McCormack: I trust Michael McCormack\u2019s judgement completely. I\u2019ve got to say. I watch him in Cabinet in the NSC [national security committee] and leadership group and he has a very sound common sense decency about him. Patricia Karvelas asks Peter Dutton about David Littleproud\u2019s comments on 7.30 last night. As a reminder, here they are from Paul Karp\u2019s report: Asked if it was right for the former sports minister to hand grants out according to a spreadsheet colour-coded by the party holding the electorate in which it was located, Littleproud replied: \u201cWell, obviously I don\u2019t think that necessarily getting as partisan as that is the best way to do it.\u201d Dutton claims that Littleproud, who said the comments directly in his own words, in response to a question, which he answered, using his own mouth, was \u201cmisrepresented\u201d. I didn\u2019t see those comments from him. I was in a conversation with him this morning where it was quite clear he had been misrepresented in what he said. But the general point is that recommendations were made in relation to sporting grants, all of the projects, those that were awarded and those that were recommended but not awarded are all worthy projects. Peter Dutton is talking about the border force response to coronavirus on the ABC. It includes this exchange between himself and Patricia Karvelas: PK: China says it wasn\u2019t given enough warning about the travel ban. Do you know when they were notified of it? Dutton: Obviously it\u2019s on DFAT\u2019s side of the ledger. We\u2019ve been very positive about the way in which China is engaged with the foreign affairs department. But our staff in China and the ambassador there. We\u2019ve had very productive engagement. All of us are reacting very quickly to changing circumstances, the health advice changes. We need to be malleable in terms of the way in which we respond as well. There are decisions we\u2019ll make which are in our country\u2019s best interest but we\u2019ll have a very short lead time. We gave notice to the Chinese. We worked with them very closely around the uplift of these people and in particular in terms of the announcements that we make otherwise. It\u2019s important to point out that [Queensland] Premier [Annastacia] Palaszczuk, having heard the recommendation from the expert medical committee, where her chief medical officer in Queensland was part of the discussion, knew that recommendation was coming to the PM and went out there gratuitously, calling for us to stop incoming flights from China, knowing frankly that was probably the decision we were going to make. So we need to move quickly, particularly when there\u2019s been that sort of breach, pretty agregious breach of the committee\u2019s work and Premier Palaszczuk still hasn\u2019t apologised for that. PK: [Are you alleging] Queensland premier gaming the system, using confidential information to try and get political capital out of it? Dutton: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any allegation. It\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s exactly what happened. I think the premier of Queensland has got a lot of explaining to do, to be honest. All of these factors will lead into those decisions. Just for context - the Queensland election is in October. Paul Karp has the terms of reference for that inquiry: That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Administration of Sports Grants, be established to inquire into and report on the administration and award of funding under the Community Sport Infrastructure Grant Program, with particular reference to: (a) program design and guidelines; (b) requirements placed on applicants for funding; (c) management and assessment processes; (d) adherence to published assessment processes and program criteria; (e) the role of the offices of the Minister, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, and any external parties, in determining which grants would be awarded and who would announce the successful grants; and (f) any related programs or matters. (2) That the committee present its final report on or before Tuesday 24 March 2020. (3) That the committee consist of 5 senators, as follows: (a) 2 nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate; (b) 2 nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate; and (c) 1 nominated by the Leader of the Australian Greens. The Labor [and Greens] motion to establish a Senate inquiry into the sport grant affair has passed the Senate \u2013 and in the end, the opposition did not need the crossbench. It seems like not even the government senators (of which Bridget McKenzie leads the Nationals in that chamber) opposed it. Joe Hockey will be the 7.30 guest tonight. I assume he will be wearing a shirt (see his instagram if you need the context) For those who want to see all the MPI, you can watch parliament live, here. Anthony Albanese has the matter of public importance today. It\u2019s on \u2018the failure of the government to provide leadership\u2019. Albanese: Everyone knows that this has been a summer of disaster. For the prime minister and this government though, it has been a summer of complacency. It has been one whereby their arrogance and their hubris has been on full display before the Australian people. One in which the prime minister refuses to ever admit that he made a mistake. One in which facts are twisted to suit the prime minister\u2019s own political position. One in which he has been exposed as an ad-man without a plan. On the matter of deliberately misleading the house, Tony Smith says there is not a prima facie case that he did. Therefore, it will not be referred to the privileges committee. Tony Smith is dealing with the issue Tony Burke raised in the last sitting year of whether or not Angus Taylor deliberately misled the House. There is one last question on the new veterans commission and the first question time of the year is done. Here is where Scott Morrison says \u201chazard reduction is important, if not more important, than emissions reduction when it comes to protecting people from fire and hotter, drier, longer summers in the future\u201d. But given the window to complete hazard reduction burns is rapidly shortening because of those \u201chotter, drier, longer\u201d summers \u2013 when are we supposed to do the hazard reduction burns safely? And that\u2019s a point which has been raised by the current fire chiefs Morrison says he listens to, not just the former fire chiefs. Exactly And it\u2019s back: Matt Canavan has been allowed to speak in the Senate: We are at the swap chamber sides of the motion death gurgle. Richard Marles manages to get out \u201ccorrupt sports rorts\u201d (which he repeats) before he is shut down (he doesn\u2019t care, he said what he wanted). While the MPs are moving around the motion of not passing motions, the new Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has taken the time to tweet and delete: From AAP: A man has been arrested, the bomb squad are attending the scene and multiple busy streets in Melbourne\u2019s CBD have been locked down. Police shut down the Flinders and William streets intersection on Wednesday afternoon following the arrest. The closed-off area was expanded to include parts of King, William, Market and Queensbridge streets. Trams are being delayed because of the arrest, but trains have resumed after initially being told to stop. Scott Morrison, who has repeatedly said he won\u2019t be told how to govern by the people on Twitter, is now doing tweet threads (or some poor person in his office is): Christian Porter has moved that Anthony Albanese will no longer be heard, which will win, and then a second Labor MP will attempt to move the motion. Then that will be shut down. The first motion from Anthony Albanese: That this House one, notes the prime minister: a) has repeatedly refused to admit his failings in handling the ongoing bushfire crisis. b) has tried to cover up his failings with a series of false claims. c) is ignoring the damning report of the independent auditor general concerning his corrupt sports rorts scheme, and is instead relying on a secret report by his former chief of staff. d) refuses to give straight answers to simple questions. e) has no plan for this country, only a marketing plan for himself. And two, therefore calls on the prime minister to stop acting in his own interest and start acting in the national interest. While we go through the motions of not having a motion, David Littleproud and Michael McCormack are looking very concerned over some document in their hand. I assume it is not a hardcopy of the blog. There\u2019s an app for that. Leave is not granted. We move on to the next part (which will also not be granted). Anthony Albanese is seeking leave to suspend standing orders to move a motion on the prime minister being terrible (my take of what Albanese is saying). This will fail. I was just about to do a post on this, but now I don\u2019t have to (my boss is always a million steps ahead of me): Sarah Martin, who is in the chamber, tells me a protester stood up to yell \u201cwhat would it take for the prime minister to declare a climate emergency\u201d, which received applause from others in the public gallery. He was removed. The member for Solomon, Luke Gosling, was asked to withdraw an unparliamentary remark. \u201cWhich one,\u201d he quips, before withdrawing. Scott Morrison continues that answer (which shows you how under pressure the government feels on this): So the minister who had the authority to make those decisions made those decisions and as she made very clear in her own statements at the time, she was seeking to make those decisions in the best interests of that program, what it was seeking to do. The point I was making is that the commonwealth government rules and grants rules and guidelines are there to ensure that where a minister may take a view about what she believes is a project with greater merit, there\u2019s a process for setting out how it\u2019s different to the recommendations received. The auditor general report did not find that elected members of this House, it did not find that ministers should not be making decisions about the expenditure of public monies to suit the programs that have been established. The process is to ensure you get good advice, and you can consider that advice, but ministers must make decisions. If those opposite think that ministers should be audit takers from public officials, that\u2019s for them to say. I believe that each member advocates for the needs of their community. And these members advocated for the needs of their community. And the minister made decisions, all eligible projects, and made the final decision as was her authority under the program as it was established. Where there are improvements to be made to that program in the future, they have been accepted. Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: In his previous answer, the prime minister failed to endorse decisions made by his own government to reject projects that were assessed above 90 out of 100 for merit. Were the projects that received money under the Community Sport Infrastructure scheme the ones that had the most merit? Morrison: As the member knows, the program was set up that gave total authority to the minister, to make decisions ... ... I\u2019m only referring to the findings of the auditor general\u2019s report. That report articulated, Mr Speaker, that the authority to make those decisions was by the minister, Mr Speaker, and the auditor general\u2019s report made a very important recommendation, which the government accepts. And that recommendation was recommendation four, which deals with the issue of the application of the commonwealth grant rules and guidelines, Mr Speaker. Now, as the auditor general\u2019s report outlines, which we accept, it says that those guidelines should be applied in the future, by organisations such as Sport Australia. The government has accepted that recommendation and we believe that will assist these ... Burke interjects: The question does not go to future programs. The question goes to decisions made by this government and whether or not the prime minister believes those decisions were made on merit. Tony Smith allows Morrison to go on: The point I was seeking to make, the minister made the decisions about where the projects should be supported, Mr Speaker. Based on her assessment, based or her assessment that what would be the projects of greatest support and merit in the community. She had the authority to do that. Pat Conroy to Scott Morrison: Are the projects that received money under the Community Sport Infrastructure scheme the ones that had the most merit? Morrison: I believe funding community sports infrastructure always has merit. As much merit as most on the frontbench, I would say. Peter Dutton makes an appearance to tell you how safe you are from coronavirus. As safe as the government can make you. He is missing his usual Dutton-ness. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Will the prime minister fund all projects recommended by Sport Australia under the Community Sport Infrastructure scheme, but not funded by this government? Morrison: Funding these important infrastructure projects is and has been a priority of this government. We have \u2013 the program received applications for some $400m, $400m, Mr Speaker. And we allocated $100m. As I said last week, we think this infrastructure is important to local communities. And I did say, at the press club last week, I\u2019ll be working with the treasurer as we prepare for this year\u2019s budget to see how we can provide further support for this important infrastructure that brings communities together. He is asked for relevance, but he has concluded his answer. Sidenote: we are getting a few more mentions of the \u201cMorrison-McCormack government\u201d today, a phrase which was previously only trotted out when Michael McCormack was being asked a question. Seems like this is one of the bones the Liberals are throwing to McCormack, as they try to remind people he exists. Joel Fitzgibbon, who was being touted as the perfect leader of the Nationals yesterday, has a question for Michael McCormack: My question is to the deputy prime minister. Why is it that yesterday when the rest of the parliament was focused only on memorialising bushfire victims, National party ministers and members were more focused on fighting amongst themselves? It is ruled out of order, but not because it would bring McCormack back to the dispatch box. Only the prime minister can answer questions about everything. Other ministers only have to answer on their portfolios. We\u2019ll get through coronavirus, says Greg Hunt. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister explain how his entire office found time to attend a marketing seminar run by adman Russel Howcroft on a catastrophic fire day in December? Why did he refuse to meet with the 23 former fire chiefs pleading for the government to take this bushfire season seriously? Morrison: Well, Mr Speaker, the meeting you refer to was not a meeting that I attended. Mr Speaker ... The meeting that you also said was requested and was well publicised, related to former fire chiefs. I engage with current fire chiefs, Mr Speaker. And the current fire chiefs have provided the advice going into this fire season was the same fire advice that was provided by Emergency Management Australia, when I asked Emergency Management Australia to come and brief cabinet well, well before the fire season, Mr Speaker. Last year, to advise us what was necessary and to ensure we were compliant and we were taking action to ensure the commonwealth\u2019s position was in the best position it could be to support state and territory authorities as they moved through this devastating fire season. That included the additional funding that we announced that I referred to earlier in response to the member for Gilmore\u2019s question, to provide the additional support for the aerial bombers. It ensured in November the government undertook a trial program for the compulsory callout of reserves to ensure in the event we would move to that situation it would be done seamlessly. This has been one of the most significant responses of the government to ensure we went from a situation of around 895 defence force personnel on the ground in December, to 6,500 and more on the ground in January. That changed because the government changed the disposition of the commonwealth\u2019s deployment of defence forces on the ground. Not to respond to requests, but to take this to the extreme of the constitutionality, Mr Speaker. The extreme of constitutionality to respond, Mr Speaker, to the situation that emerged that week, where on the Thursday it was the first day the national state of disaster was declared in Victoria. That hadn\u2019t occurred before. That happened on the Thursday. There was the compulsory callout on the Saturday and the preparations for that compulsory callout were already under way when Victoria made that declaration. Mr Speaker, those opposite in the questions today are seeking to politicise this disaster and it\u2019s very disappointing. The second set of Labor questions in Senate question time is again to Richard Colbeck on sports rorts \u2013 and the auditor general\u2019s finding that funding went to target marginal seats. At first, Colbeck deploys the reverse-pork barrelling defence that Bridget McKenzie\u2019s intervention lifted the proportion of projects in Labor electorates from 26% to 34%. Then, he quoted a 2010 auditor general\u2019s report that found an aspect of Labor\u2019s fiscal stimulus program \u201cdisproportionately favoured ALP held seats\u201d. Anthony Albanese defended the program at the time by noting: \u201cThe allocation of funding across federal electorates was in line with the political makeup of the House of Representatives. Put simply, Labor MPs held 55.3% of the electorates and their local councils secured 56.7% of the funding from the program\u2019s Strategic Projects component.\u201d Just a bit more on what Scott Morrison said in answer to Zali Steggall (and why, no matter how they brand it, or what words they choose to market it, or if they even decide to appoint a minister to directly deal with it, \u2018climate action now\u2019 is just hollow doublespeak that won\u2019t lead to any actual changes): Of course, Australia must continue to table the actions if we are to meet and beat our emissions reductions target, which have already seen us reduce emissions, Mr Speaker, by 12.8% since 2005. We have a reduction target we took to the Australian people out to 2030 that will see emissions per capita fall by half. We are ahead of countries like New Zealand, ahead of countries like Canada in meeting and beating our targets, some 411m tonnes we will have beat our Kyoto emissions target. At the same time, our renewable energy, Mr Speaker, per capita is half what it\u2019s been \u2013 is double, I should say, more than double what\u2019s being achieved in Germany, and in many other countries around the world and we have one of the highest levels of investments in renewable energy anywhere in the world. In the developed world. We have one of the highest \u2013 in fact, we have the highest target of emissions reduction now to 2030 in Asia compared to those nations. Emissions reduction is important. We\u2019re acting on that reduction. I can tell you also resilience to climate is also important. Hazard reduction is important, if not more important, than emissions reduction when it comes to protecting people from fire and hotter, drier, longer summers in the future. Also, in a country ravaged by drought, and the impacts that we have experienced, and that drought continues, building dams is climate action now. There you go. Burning the trees that help to create clean air and create rainfall, is EVEN MORE IMPORTANT in protecting you from the longer, hotter, drier summers than emissions reduction. The next dixer is on why the budget might be looking a little sad, because of the summer \u2013 plus drought, plus coronavirus, plus those pesky global headwinds. \u201cUnprecedented\u201d is being thrown around again. It\u2019s almost like surprises can happen that you can\u2019t prepare for \u2013 like the global financial crisis \u2013 which impact your bottom line. Sidenote: Josh Frydenberg still hasn\u2019t worked out how microphones work. Pro tip: they amplify your voice so you DON\u2019T HAVE TO YELL. The member for Gilmore, Fiona Phillips, to Scott Morrison: Why does the prime minister claim he always acted on the advice of fire commissioners when he ignored for two years their advice to provide a permanent boost to Australia\u2019s aerial firefighting capability? Morrison: I thank the member for her question. And can I, through her, pass on again my sincere condolences and sympathies and support to all those members in her electorate. I have members of my own family who live in your electorate. I want to thank you for the work that you have done, as all members have done, over the course of this bushfire season in supporting their local communities. I would be grateful if you could do that, if you have the opportunity. The member has raised the matter of the recommendations that were made through fire chiefs regarding the aerial firefighting assets. And what the government had done was respond to that, with two separate tranches of funding, which matched what they originally asked for. I dealt with this matter during the course of the bushfire season, but in addition to those two funding allocations of $11m, on top of that we announced a further $20m. That was over and above the $15m that was being provided each and every year as part of the arrangement that we had. We were pleased to do that. I also noted that the ongoing funding, which was being sought, would be addressed in this year\u2019s budget. \u201cBuild back better\u201d is not a personality. Labor\u2019s Josh Burns becomes the second MP thrown out this year. Lucky him. The sentient sourdough loaf serving as the deputy prime minister is doing his best to string words together about resilience and regional Australia, but it\u2019s hard when you are still fermenting. Keith Pitt inflicts Michael McCormack on us for the first question time of 2020 \u2013 almost a sure sign that he is in the ministry. And maybe his biggest sin so far. Labor\u2019s Terri Butler becomes the first MP to be kicked out for 2020. Zali Steggall asks about what the government is doing about emissions reduction and the answer is so depressing (you have heard it all before \u2013 Australia is doing amazing, sweetie) and I want to stab myself in the face with a fork. Oh \u2013 and also hazard reduction and \u201cbuilding dams is climate action now\u201d, according to Scott Morrison. You can build all the holes in the ground you want. It won\u2019t make it forking rain. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I refer to his previous answer where he suggested that it was necessary to have a Liberal party authorisation on his ad which had a Liberal party donation button attached to it. Isn\u2019t it a fact that only electoral matter requires party authorisation and there is long precedent for government information which is not party political to not require such an authorisation? The only reason why it was authorised by the Liberal party is because it was so political. Morrison: The video presentation was posted on my Facebook page, Mr Speaker. And that requires an authorisation and that is the advice that is provided to me. That is the same as is practiced by the leader of the opposition and I table, Mr Speaker, his tweet that says: \u201cListening to people, respecting people, putting forward practical suggestions that would make a difference \u2013 that\u2019s what I have been focused on. That is what I will continue to do. Authorised by Anthony Albanese, ALP, Canberra.\u201d I have followed the practice in communicating with the Australian people. To the Labor party, to characterise it in the way they have is simply false and a misrepresentation by a Labor party leader who wants to politicise the bushfires. Except one is from an opposition leader and one was about the Australian government response to a national emergency. Which was not on behalf of the Liberal party, but at the behest of the Australian government, using Australian resources. But you can see where this is going. The sport minister, Richard Colbeck, has been asked about the sports rorts program \u2013 specifically whether he has seen the colour-coded spreadsheet from which former minister Bridget McKenzie selected projects. At first, Colbeck takes the chance to \u201cextol the virtues of the program\u201d that gave $100m to 684 sports clubs in the form of grants. After numerous points of order, Colbeck finally answers that he hasn\u2019t \u201cseen that document because the ABC hasn\u2019t published it\u201d \u2013 he has only seen excerpts of the spreadsheet. Asked about a probe into whether the health department of Sport Australia was the source of the leak, Colbeck replies there is \u201cno issue\u201d with the department, it is confident it was not the source of the leak. But he has not received advice from Sport Australia, which had \u201calready commenced a process to satisfy themselves\u201d before Colbeck asked. Next dixer is on the government\u2019s new commission into veterans\u2019 suicides and mental health. \u2022 For information and support in Australia call Lifeline on 13 11 14, Mensline on 1300 789 978 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636 Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret using his official resources to create and launch a party political advertisement on a catastrophic day at the height of bushfire crisis, which included defence imagery, a jingle and a link to a Liberal party donation button? Morrison: The leader of the opposition has come to that dispatch box and told a complete falsehood. The government and the members opposite know ... (INTERJECTIONS) ... on any ... I note the constant interjections on matters of bushfires, Mr Speaker, from those opposite. But on every piece of communication that you provide in video, the advice is that that material must be authorised, Mr Speaker, and I have noted that the leader of the opposition ... (Tony Smith tells the house to settle down) Morrison: Those communications require an authorisation to be compliant, and that\u2019s what the government has done. That\u2019s what the leader of the opposition has done, Mr Speaker, with his video communications on these types of issues. Mr Speaker, the only people trying to politicise the response to the bushfire crisis is the leader of the opposition. Except this was an Australian government announcement, which was authorised by Scott Morrison of the Liberal party, not the Australian government, and it did, when first launched, go to the Liberal party site, where it asked for donations to the Liberal party. The first dixer is on how amazing the government\u2019s bushfire response was. Biggest take away \u2013 Scott Morrison really, really wants to be able to brand the past few months \u2018Black summer\u2019. It\u2019s up to you if you let him. Just a reminder that Scott Morrison put out what was basically a Liberal party ad as the climate fires reached their zenith \u2013 but is now accusing the opposition of politicising the bushfires. Anthony Albanese kicks off the first question time of the year with a question on why Scott Morrison didn\u2019t call together Coag when the fire emergency began in November: Why did the prime minister summarily dismiss Labor\u2019s constructive proposals by rejecting a national approach to the crisis saying, \u201cCoag might meet later\u201d, quote, \u201cshould the need arise\u201d. Morrison: I am sure the House won\u2019t be surprised that I don\u2019t accept the leader of the opposition\u2019s characterisation of these issues. What I can tell the House ... I can tell the House is that government\u2019s response to the national bushfire emergency over this black summer has been, Mr Speaker, unprecedented. Unprecedented with the compulsory callout of the defence force reserves, which is the first time, Mr Speaker, the first time that has occurred in the response to a national disaster of this kind. (Kevin Rudd called in the reserves, but it was not compulsory.) In addition to that, Mr Speaker, we moved quickly to establish the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and to appoint Andrew Colvin, the former head of the Australian federal police, which I thought those opposite supported these measures, but they come in here on the first question of the day, and seek to politicise the bushfire response. Now I find that disappointing. I\u2019m happy to inform the member that we not only provided additional support for aerial firefighting assets. That is the waterbombers. But we actually provided a further $20m ... Albanese interjects on relevance, but Morrison is allowed to go on. Morrison: We provided the additional funding for those waterbombers and then we provided additional funding on top of that in response to the requests from the fire chiefs, who had sought that additional support. They sought one extra. We provided four extra, Mr Speaker. I note the constant interjecting from the leader of the opposition. And he\u2019s been very chatty on this issue today. ... I would have thought he would be supporting these measures. If he wants to politicise bushfires, that reflects more on him than it does on the government. We might see Peter Dutton for the first time since the summer began. First we have a few condolence motions to get through. Question time is due to begin. Labor, led by Kristina Keneally on this, has responded to Christian Porter\u2019s announcement the commonwealth parental leave scheme (12 months unpaid leave) will now include premature and stillborn babies \u2013 but it is hoping the private sector gets on board. Parents of stillborn babies already have the same access to paid parental leave under the commonwealth scheme. These changes mean parents who devastatingly lose a child due to stillbirth or infant death will be entitled to a maximum of 12 months unpaid leave. However \u2013 whilst there has been some progress \u2013 too many private companies have yet to make both these changes. The bipartisan Senate Stillbirth Inquiry recommended changes to both the Fair Work Act and the National Employment Standards to provide consistency across all employers and employees in Australia. Labor looks forward to the government making these amendments. Last year the Senate also passed a motion calling for the equalisation of bereavement payments for parents who experience a stillbirth. Currently, parents are only eligible for this payment if a baby\u2019s heart beats after birth. If it beats once, you receive a payment, if your baby is born without a heartbeat, you don\u2019t. It\u2019s only fair that the bereavement payment for parents of stillborn children is equal. Likewise, it is only fair for subsequent stillborn baby payments for subsequent stillbirths to be equal. We look forward to the government making these announcements in the near future. Stillbirth is the biggest cause of infant death in our country today and the rate of death from stillbirth is higher than the national road toll. We must do everything to support families through the devastation of such heartbreak. Labor\u2019s social team has been hard at work this morning It is just before question time, where MPs make 90-second statements. Every single Labor MP is speaking on the sports grants affair. All of them. I missed this, this morning \u2013 but it\u2019s a new contender for favourite quote of the day. Michael McCormack was asked about how close the leadership spill vote count was yesterday (11-10 if you believe Barnaby Joyce\u2019s camp, 15-6 if you believe McCormack\u2019s, with the truth, as always, probably somewhere in the middle) and he had this to say: Just how close I am not sure. It is National party convention not to reveal the votes and at the end of the day, the votes do not count. What counts, for me, is regional Australians. At the end of the day, the VOTES DO NOT COUNT. Mate. The votes obviously count, because they are the whole reason you are still in your fricking job. Ladies and gentlemen: Australia\u2019s deputy (and sometimes acting) prime minister. Long may he beige. It seems John Alexander has learned a few things since last year when he said this about our pacific neighbours (this is not a criticism, merely noting that he has actually moved on this issue and that\u2019s a good thing): Speaking at a forum last week, Alexander reportedly noted Frank Bainimarama\u2019s repeated call for Australia to stop burning coal and developing new coalmines but said the priority should be to help people to move their settlements to higher ground. According to Nine newspapers, he said: \u2018It\u2019s very much like your house is on fire, your children are in the house \u2013 should you call the fire brigade and get the children out of the house?\u2019 The Bennelong MP later told ABC radio his point was that adaptation was a priority but \u2018we must also act to prevent further damage to our planet\u2019. For those who missed the speech: Pretty sure David Littleproud doesn\u2019t have a degree in agriculture or emergency services either, and yet he managed to accept those concepts pretty easily. Bushfires and drought are weighing on an already sluggish Australian economy, while the coronavirus epidemic may inflict further pain, the Reserve Bank governor says. Speaking to the National Press Club in Sydney, Philip Lowe also defended the bank\u2019s decision to cut official interest rates to a historic low of 0.75% against charges that it has spooked consumers into closing their wallets. Instead, Australians were adapting to a period of consistently low wages growth, high household debt and a fall in home prices by paying down their mortgages instead of going to the shops, he said. He said the economy was going through \u201ca gentle turning point for the better\u201d, predicting modest increases in growth and consumer spending over the coming two years. The RBA expects the ongoing drought to cut 0.25 percentage points from growth this year. Lowe said the economic impact on bushfire areas was \u201cvery large\u201d due to the \u201clarge-scale destruction of homes, farms and businesses as well as public infrastructure\u201d. He said that, taking into account the expected rebuilding effort, government grants and insurance payouts, the fires would not affect economic growth across the whole year. However, the fires would cut economic growth by about 0.2 percentage points in the December quarter and the current quarter. He said the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on the Australian economy could be worse than that of the 2003 Sars epidemic because \u201cChina is a larger part of the global economy and it is more closely integrated, including with Australia\u201d. Labor has just called for a quorum in the house of representatives. There are not enough government MPs in the house. It is a very busy week for Philip Lowe. If you are following the coronavirus story, you may have already seen this, but it seems not just China is annoyed at Australia now: The New Zealand foreign minister, Winston Peters, said Australian officials did not ask to use Auckland base for quarantining. We didn\u2019t make the offer because the Australians had already said what they wanted us to do. We\u2019re a small country doing the best we can with lesser resources than big countries have. John Alexander was making his condolence speech on the fires (the leftover ones have moved to the federation chamber). Here is what he had to say: The elephant in the room, of course, is climate change. Today is a day for commemoration, not politics. But one thing I would like to say is the need to recognise that these fires are not a warning about climate change \u2013 they are climate change. The leader of the opposition said that \u2018this is not normal\u2019. I fear this is actually the new normal. In focusing on saving this country for our grandchildren, we risk forgetting we need to save our neighbours. We must obviously mitigate future risks and change our ways, but we also must adapt because these longer, hotter summers will be our new normal. If we are to be a mature nation, we must be proactive in adapting our local infrastructure and the way we live, lest we risk succumbing to this new normal. Let\u2019s remember Alexander is saying this at the same time the prime minister isn\u2019t budging on anything other than \u201cnot being bullied\u201d into something no one is bullying him on, and Barnaby Joyce \u2013 one of the most vocal members of the Coalition party room \u2013 is dumping all over wind power, because windmills look bad. Maybe JA should have another chat to his leader, given this was Scott Morrison on the Nine Network this morning: And it\u2019s important to listen to everybody but take people forward on practical, balanced action that doesn\u2019t go and write people\u2019s jobs off, or industries off; that doesn\u2019t go and put taxes on people. I mean, action on climate change does not mean taxing people. It\u2019s about technology, not taxation. So we won\u2019t be bullied into higher taxes or higher electricity prices. What we\u2019ll do is take practical action that deals with these challenges. And that challenge is living in a hotter, drier and longer summer where these risk of these bushfires we need to be more resilient to. So I\u2019m going to focus on the stuff that works \u2013 the stuff that actually reduces risk and the stuff that ensures that people can be safer in summer. Who on Lizzo\u2019s green earth is bullying the prime minister into higher taxes? The man has been part of a government which has been in power since 2013. He was literally in charge of the treasury decisions for a decent chunk of that. He now leads the government and decides its policies, including taxes. Which he cut. It\u2019s like saying Grandpa Joe was actually bedridden. Liberal MP John Alexander was just in the federation chamber (where speeches go to die) talking about climate change. This is noteworthy, because he was speaking about how the bushfires are actually climate change in action and present the danger of Australia\u2019s \u201cnew normal\u201d if action isn\u2019t taken. Meanwhile, in the Coalition party room, there are many, many members still arguing about how climate change isn\u2019t an issue in their electorates. And then we get to the truly Barnaby: We have to recognise that the public acceptance of wind towers on the hill in front of their veranda is gone, and the public dissonance on that issue is as strong as any other environmental subject. We have to understand that there is no sure thing in a political debate. If zero emissions are the goal then surely nuclear energy should be supported, but it is not. If wind towers are a moral good and environmentally inoffensive, why can\u2019t we have them just off the beach at Bondi so we can feel good about ourselves while going for a surf? It would cause a riot. Do you want a 3,000ha solar farm next door to you? Lots of glass and aluminium neatly in rows pointing at the sun. I am not sure others will want to buy that view off you when you go to sell your house! The weather has determined the political climate and everyone is manipulating the recent calamitous events to push their own particular barrow. Whether there is unanimity of people\u2019s political views on the fire ground or feeding stock in drought as to what we can do to change the weather is as unlikely as to unanimity to their favourite song. When politicians do stand behind a global climate policy, the only certainty is that it will be the policy that has the least direct effect on them. Wind farms are for your backyard not mine, zero emission nuclear is for France, only support banning coal mines if the coal mines aren\u2019t in your electorate, and try not to get caught on a sticky question of what replaces our nation\u2019s largest export. There is a desire for intermittent power generation such as solar but an inability to afford the pump hydro to make it dispatchable. Simple answers are generally wrong. So 2020 has started with quite some colour politically and tragedy nationally. The art form of politics will be the cogent response that the parliament can show the Australian people in two years\u2019 time. Barnaby Joyce goes on: Now, my first attentions go back to where they were before this week: the New England, drought, fires and now the threat of coronavirus. We arrive now at the period two years prior to the next election. This period is vital in setting the agenda that the Australian people will make their judgement on as to whether we remain with the reigns of the nation in two years\u2019 time after the next election. There is difficulty in standing behind a promise; it is so much easier to stand beside delivery if you want to get re-elected. I have disdain when the term \u201clearnings\u201d is used. Leaning is a verb, knowledge is a noun and \u201clearnings\u201d is nonsense. The knowledge we have attained from the bushfires and drought has to further develop our policy of building resilience into the future. As a government we have to deliver on what we have learnt from these natural disasters and be standing beside them by the time of the next election. For fires, better access to reliable water supplies to fight fires, clearing of road corridors to get access in and out safely to the fire grounds, communication facilities that can stand the challenge of fires, hazard reduction and upgrade of fire trails. This is to name but a few. If you want a macro climate policy to show the world our leadership on reducing carbon emissions then we must bring in nuclear power and development of the most efficient coal power technology that uses the least units of coal for the greatest output of power. Wanting to develop the most efficient coal fired power technology in the world is not disavowing the realities of climate change, it is actually something that could be provided to substantially curtail emissions. Michael McCormack in the SMH and the Age today: I didn\u2019t get blasted out. You always take learnings. I\u2019ll take on board what my colleagues said [but] I don\u2019t agree necessarily with everything the media has written about this latest attempt. Barnaby Joyce has a few things to say on Facebook: Firstly I would like to congratulate Michael McCormack on winning the leadership ballot and by so doing acknowledge the re-endorsement of his position as leader of the Nationals party. It is appropriate that if a political issue needs resolving to put aside contentions held by some, a process is there to allow the clearing of the air. That process has been followed and the issue is finalised. Our nation does not have a president nor are we cursed with a tyrant. We have a free media, transparency in government and as recent events have shown, problems don\u2019t happen with such things as sports grants that you will not later hear of in the public forum. One of the conditions of this freedom in our nation is the capacity for members of parliament to challenge their political office holders, if so desired, in the party room. For the Nationals this process was made as brief as possible, prior to the first sitting of parliament for the year. There was a spill of positions, I stood and I lost. I respect and support the vote of the room and will strive for the re-election of a Morrison McCormack government. (You may remember Michael McCormack hit out at the media yesterday, in his \u201ceverything is fine, I\u2019m not angry, you\u2019re angry\u201d press conference immediately after the spill.) Scott Morrison on why he has set up a permanent commission looking into veterans\u2019 mental health and not a royal commission: There were many issues to consider. I didn\u2019t think a one-off review into the past informs enough, because the challenge we have is ongoing, each and every single day. A royal commission that looked into those past cases was not enough. Because, sadly, we know there will be more. We needed a solution. We needed a response that was ongoing. If you go to any RSL around the country, you will see the plaque \u2018the price of peace is eternal vigilance\u2019. We must be eternally vigilant about the welfare and care of those who\u2019ve served in uniform, even more so when they leave their service and they leave the protection and supports that often exist within our defence forces and they go on to the next phase of their life. And let me stress this: those men and women go off to lead successful, vibrant, positive, major-contributing lives. Let\u2019s not for a second conflate the issue and the tragedy of the terrible outcomes of veterans\u2019 suicide with the suggestion that veterans are broken. They\u2019re not. They\u2019re champions. They\u2019re heroes. But some struggle. Some are in a daily battle. And they\u2019re the veterans that we have in mind here in the announcements that we\u2019re making today. Anthony Albanese: You don\u2019t get to say that you\u2019re drawing a line under an issue just because you say it\u2019s over. This government is shambolic. It\u2019s moving from one mess to another, whether it\u2019s the challenge yesterday of Barnaby Joyce to the deputy prime minister\u2019s leadership, and then a ballot for deputy leader of the National party on a day that we were supposed to be devoting to the bushfire crisis. That underlined what is an ongoing theme of this government \u2013 that it\u2019s all concerned about itself and politics and not concerned about the national interest. This morning I attempted to move in the parliament a debate which would see those organisations where volunteers spent hundreds of hours putting in applications in good faith, thinking that there was a level playing field, thinking that there was a fair umpire and that umpire was called Sports Australia, under the legislation in which this $100m was allocated, and finding out something very different. Finding out this was a match that was fixed from the beginning. Match fixing that went to not just Bridget McKenzie, who has been thrown under the bus. They had the prime minister\u2019s office staff sitting in Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office. They had emails that clearly link the prime minister\u2019s office to the decisions asking that grants be given to clubs that didn\u2019t get as high a score as those clubs which received. I mean, here you have quite a farce. Don Farrell: I\u2019m here with the leader today to report to you the decision by Bridget McKenzie to resign doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the end of the sports rorts scandal that we\u2019ve seen over the January period. Our intention this afternoon is to move in the Senate for an inquiry into what\u2019s gone on here. We wish to investigate what the minister did, the relationship between her office and that of the prime minister, and to find out why there was no accountability and no transparency in the awarding of these grants. Thousands of clubs made applications to what they thought was a dinky-di process, an on-the-level process. What they found was that it was nothing of the sort, and they had no chance right from the start of getting any of the money. We believe we\u2019ve got the support of the crossbench for the Senate inquiry, and one way or another, we\u2019ll get to the bottom of what\u2019s happened here and we\u2019ll get some accountability, some transparency into this grants process, to make sure that this never happens again. Labor is also calling for the clubs who missed out on grants to get the money (which doesn\u2019t actually fix the problem). Don Farrell is trying very hard to lead a press conference and, well, there may be a reason why Don Farrell doesn\u2019t get to lead press conferences very often. On the failed division Labor called on the sports grants affair, all the independents voted with the opposition (except for Bob Katter, who was not in the chamber, because it is a day ending in y and there are enemies to be slain somewhere, or something). I mean, is that something a prime minister actually has to learn? Really? TO ALWAYS SHOW UP? FFS. What has Scott Morrison learned about leadership over the summer? Always to listen, always show up and always put Australians first. And Gladys Liu is officially out of the freezer, with a special mention from the prime minister. Scott Morrison: I want to say thank you to the Australian Chinese community. I want to say in particular thank you to Gladys Liu, who has been a leader in getting information to people on this issue and providing them support in her community down there in Box Hill. I know that\u2019s being done by other members. We then get some damage control in terms of China, which yesterday, quite publicly, said it was annoyed at Australia\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak (shutting the borders). Scott Morrison: Can I say thank you to the Australian Chinese community \u2013 you are magnificent. The way you have supported each other, the way you have acted in such a responsible fashion, on occasions with great provocation, which I\u2019ve found reprehensible. You are observing and taking so seriously your responsibilities, together with all Australians, to ensure that we\u2019ve been so far quite successfully able to contain the impact of the coronavirus within Australia. We have 13 confirmed cases, three of which have now left hospital and gone about their lives. So we\u2019ve actually seen a net reduction in recent times of those cases, so I say to the Chinese community in Australia: thank you, thank you for the way that you have engaged. The whole point of the quite proactive decisions that the government has taken in relation to containing the coronavirus \u2013 and we moved so much more before many other countries \u2013 was to ensure that Australians could go about their daily lives, and going about your daily lives means going where you\u2019d normally go, because Australians are taking the necessary precautions, and that includes our Chinese community. On the question of Australia going carbon neutral, Scott Morrison says: I\u2019ll give you the same response I gave you at the Press Club a week ago. That\u2019s a matter \u2013 the 2050 request that we undertook to look at in our commitment through the PIF process, and that\u2019s what I intend to do. What I said was I would never make a commitment like that if I couldn\u2019t tell the Australian people what it would cost them. And I wouldn\u2019t make a commitment like that if I couldn\u2019t tell them what it would cost them. I don\u2019t believe the action you need to take in this area is about putting taxes on people, putting their electricity prices up or driving industries out of regional areas ... That\u2019s what I took to the last election, that\u2019s what Australians endorsed, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do as prime minister. My daily correspondence with the AFP has been completed \u2013 it has still not decided whether or not to investigate Angus Taylor. Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference is back on. It\u2019s on the new commission on veteran suicide prevention. It was Stuart Robert who shut down that motion, fyi. I think we can all guess what Labor\u2019s 90-second statements will be on. If you want to know where question time will go (apart from the climate fires), here is what Anthony Albanese managed to get out before his motion was shut down by the government: I move that so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the leader of the opposition from moving the following motion \u2013 that the House calls on the government to fund all projects recommended by Sport Australia under the community sport infrastructure program but not funded by the Morrison government. The Sports rorts saga characterises everything that\u2019s wrong about this government. A government [that] doesn\u2019t represent the Australian people. A government that\u2019s obsessed just by representing its own interests. This is a corrupt scandal that goes to the very top. This is a win \u2013 and a bipartisan one at that. Kristina Keneally made this one of her big priorities when entering the Senate, and I am glad to see the change. From Christian Porter\u2019s release: The Morrison government will improve parental leave entitlements to help support families dealing with traumatic situations such as stillbirths, infant deaths and premature births. \u2018The government understands how devastating losing a child can be and recognises that the current entitlement to just six weeks of guaranteed unpaid parental leave is insufficient for many parents who need more time before they return to work,\u2019 attorney general and minister for industrial relations, Christian Porter, said. \u2018That is why we want to increase the entitlement for those who\u2019ve experienced a stillbirth or infant death to a maximum of 12 months \u2013 the same amount of unpaid leave parents of healthy babies can access. \u2018While not all parents will want to use the full 12 months, it is important that the option is available to them should they need it.\u2019 For parents of premature babies, or babies that experience birth-related complications that result in immediate hospitalisation, the government will also remove the barrier that currently prevents parents from going back to work and restarting their leave when their baby is ready to go home ... Parents will be allowed to use up to 30 days (six weeks) of their 12-month unpaid leave entitlement flexibly, up to the child\u2019s second birthday. During this time, they will also be able to choose to claim part of their 18-week paid leave entitlement. While employers and employees will remain free to agree on arrangements that suit their specific circumstances, these changes will provide Australian families with an improved minimum safety net that offers greater certainty during times of tragedy and more choices about how to structure work and family arrangements. Legislation to enact the changes to unpaid parental leave will be consulted on in the coming weeks ahead of its expected introduction to parliament in the autumn sitting period. These divisions are reminding me why I hear the lambs screaming in my sleep. A division has postponed the prime minister\u2019s press conference \u2013 it\u2019s a motion to suspend standing orders over the sports grants. It will fail. Anthony Albanese will hold a press conference at 11.30. It\u2019s with Don Farrell (the shadow minister for sport \u2013 who knew?) so I think we can guess what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s early, but my favourite quote of the day so far is this from Scott Morrison on the Nine Network today: And we\u2019ve got back straight on the job as we never departed from, as in the government. Because yes, war is peace. And if you want to keep a secret, best to also hide it from yourself. The prime minister will hold a press conference on the new commission at 10.30. Scott Morrison has announced an independent commissioner will look into the mental health of veterans. It will have some of the powers of a royal commission, but it\u2019s not a royal commission. From the release: The Morrison government will establish a permanent national commissioner for defence and veteran suicide prevention. The national commissioner will have the enduring power, scope and resources to investigate suicides and related issues as they arise, rather than being restricted by a one-off review looking at past practices. The national commissioner for defence and veteran suicide prevention will be empowered to perform two roles: The commissioner will be an independent and permanent public accountability body, with the same powers of a royal commission to compel the production of evidence and summon witnesses, and make findings and recommendations to government. The commissioner will also provide an ongoing investigative function of individual cases of suicide, working with each state and territory coronial office, making recommendations to government. The government will invest an initial $40m to support the commissioner\u2019s work and this will be expanded to ensure they have whatever resources they need. The government will also establish an immediate, independent review of historical veteran suicide cases, conducted by the commissioner, focusing on the impact of military service and veterans\u2019 post-service experience. An interim report will be delivered within 12 months. Families will be engaged in this process if they wish, with an opportunity to participate and tell their stories openly and safely. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, along with coronial and legal experts, will provide technical expertise in support of this work. Thank you to AAP for this summary: WHAT IS HAPPENING IN FEDERAL POLITICS? Scott Morrison has announced an inquiry into veteran suicide with the powers of a royal commission. The prime minister has promised a national inquiry into the bushfire season will be finished by August. Nationals MPs Darren Chester and Keith Pitt are expected to be elevated to cabinet in a ministerial reshuffle. The junior coalition partner is also trying to move on from a failed coup against Michael McCormack launched by former leader Barnaby Joyce. Legislation is being debated in both houses of parliament for the first time this year, after Tuesday was taken up with tributes to bushfire victims. Labor is expected to pursue the sports rorts scandal during question time on Wednesday. The government is also expected to cop questions over its response to the bushfires. Climate protesters continue their action outside Parliament House. It\u2019s been announced Indonesian president Joko Widodo will address parliament next week. Given that we are going to hear \u201cmeet and beat\u201d a lot in terms of emissions targets, it is worth having a listen to this Full Story podcast from Adam Morton: Is the Australian government really \u2018meeting and beating\u2019 its emissions reduction targets? Scott Morrison regularly claims Australia is \u2018meeting and beating\u2019 its emissions reduction targets. But is that true? In this episode of Full Story, environment editor Adam Morton explains why we should focus less on targets and more on emissions. So what can we expect today, given that parliament is officially back and the climate fires have been acknowledged? Well, probably an end to what has been described as the \u201csombre bipartisanship\u201d between Labor and the Coalition. Awwwwww. I bet he still believes in Santa Claus, the tooth fairy and that the Great Barrier Reef can be saved too! Here\u2019s Scott Morrison on Barnaby Joyce and the Nationals on the Nine Network this morning: Morrison: I was happy to see the Nationals deal with these matters as quickly as possible, as they did, so we could get the focus very quickly back on to the importance of yesterday, which was to honour certainly, and firstly, those who lost their lives in these terrible fires. And many of the families of those who\u2019d fallen in Australia\u2019s name were able to be there and get that comfort and support. But also to honour all of those who certainly continue to serve to this day, that Michael McCormack has made it clear this morning that he, you know, he\u2019s apologised, that there was that event yesterday morning, but they dealt with it quickly. And we\u2019ve got back straight on the job as we never departed from, as in the government. Host: I mean, it was an ugly distraction yesterday. Prime minister, you know he\u2019ll be back. Morrison: No, he said he\u2019s not challenging again. So I think that issues - Host: Because that never happens in politics. Morrison: Well, look, the media might want to talk about it, but I think Barnaby ruled a line under that pretty clearly yesterday. So we just get on with the job, which is what Australians expect us to do. An Air New Zealand evacuation flight has left Wuhan carrying a total of 193 passengers: 100 New Zealand citizens and permanent residents, 23 Australian citizens and 70 foreign nationals, predominantly from Pacific Island countries including Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Kiribati, Tonga, Fiji and the Federated States of Micronesia. On board the flight is one doctor and two paramedics from St John. When the flight arrives in Auckland at 6.30pm today, the Australian passengers will be directly transferred to a flight bound to Australia, while the New Zealanders and other nationalities will be quarantined for two weeks at Whangaparaoa airbase. The bells are ringing. May Lizzo have mercy on my decaffeinated soul. When I say Australia is wayyyyyyyyy behind on the climate conversation, I mean really, really behind. Like Warwick Capper-runs-for-politics levels of behind. Here is Boris Johnson overnight: I hope that we can as a planet and as a community of nations get to net zero within decades,\u201d Johnson said at the COP 26 launch on Tuesday. We\u2019re going to do it by 2050, we\u2019re setting the pace, I hope everybody will come with us. Let\u2019s make this year the moment when we come together with the courage and the technological ambition to solve man-made climate change and to choose a cleaner and greener future for all our children and grandchildren. He worked out it was a parody account. Still, I appreciate the wholesomeness. Still on Michael McCormack, who is desperately attempting to go from whitebread to at least sourdough in an attempt to keep his job beyond the next six months \u2013 he was asked about his new deputy David Littleproud\u2019s comments on 7.30 last night regarding Bridget McKenzie and the sports grants affair. As Paul Karp reported: Asked if it was right for the former sports minister to hand grants out according to a spreadsheet colour-coded by the party holding the electorate in which it was located, Littleproud replied: \u201cWell, obviously I don\u2019t think that necessarily getting as partisan as that is the best way to do it.\u201d McCormack, though, is sticking to the report which cleared it \u2013 the PM&amp;C report written by Scott Morrison\u2019s former chief of staff Phil Gaetjens (who was also Peter Costello\u2019s former chief of staff), despite the independent auditor general\u2019s report raising some very serious questions over the process. Added bonus \u2013 we don\u2019t get to see the Gaetjen\u2019s report, because it is cabinet-in-confidence, and as such will be locked up for 20 years. So we only have what the prime minister says it said, and we are told that is enough and every Coalition MP is using that as a get-out-of-jail-free card. Again, don\u2019t you worry about that. Anyway, it is all fine, says McCormack, because every one of the clubs which got money was eligible: We can take learnings from what the report has decreed. Phil Gaetjens has also said, the secretary, that there was no bias towards targeted or marginal seats. He has said that. And yes, we can take learnings from what the ANAO report has said, and from Mr Gaetjens and what he\u2019s also found \u2013 no bias. All projects eligible, and I\u2019m proud of the fact that we\u2019ve got a set of books which are balanced, which are coming into surplus, and which provide the ability for the government, through the expenditure review process, through the budget process, to be able to fund even more rounds of these programs. Particularly important for regional Australia. And let me tell you, when you\u2019re out in regional Australia and you\u2019re a young woman and you\u2019re wanting to play netball or AFLW or soccer or whatever the case may be, you shouldn\u2019t have to be getting dressed behind a car. You shouldn\u2019t have to be getting dressed behind a tree. You should be able to have the same sorts of facilities that the boys have always enjoyed. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m particularly pleased about with this program. Well done to Bridget McKenzie for doing just that. Reminder: we have no idea what Gaetjens has said. The spreadsheet was colour-coded according to party. It targeted marginal seats and those the Coalition wanted. And talking points are not policy. Mike Bowers has just walked into the building. I\u2019ve sent him for coffee. I mean, even putting aside BlackRock\u2019s announcement it was getting out of thermal coal investment \u2013 which, as the largest fund manager in the world is a pretty big deal \u2013 because you know that\u2019s absolutely a financial decision, let\u2019s remember that we seem to be the only democracy in the world still arguing over this stuff. Everyone else has moved on. And yet our politics still has us mired in the muck of \u201cbut the jobs\u201d, which is exactly the same argument which has been used in every single other massive change (tobacco advertising bans anyone?) and the country has not only survived \u2013 new industries have created new jobs. We are seeing it all over the world. Except for here. Much like someone who mistakes loud tropical shirts as a personality, Michael McCormack has decided that talking VERY LOUDLY about coal will substitute for policy and solutions. In response to questions from Michael Rowland on ABC Breakfast about Anglo American (a massive mining company) chief executive Mark Cutifani\u2019s comments about climate change as well as his announcement he wants out of thermal coal in the next five years (which is also an economic decision, let\u2019s be real), McCormack said: Fantastic, good on him. And he\u2019s probably done very nicely, thank you very much, out of the coal industry. Very, very nicely, and \u2013 but coal is providing for two-thirds of Australia\u2019s energy needs, power needs, it\u2019s providing for $62bn of exports, it\u2019s providing 55,000 jobs. We are a government which is looking at all forms of technology to be able to power this country. I\u2019m glad that we have just gone into an agreement with New South Wales. We need to use more gas, we need to actually get more gas and put it into the system. I know that Angus Taylor and others are doing very hard \u2013 working very hard to make sure that we bring power prices down for Australians, that\u2019s one of the most important things for them \u2013 is their energy bill and making sure that it\u2019s affordable. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Samantha Maiden of the New Daily has an update on Scott Morrison\u2019s Hawaiian holiday \u2013 you\u2019ll never learn how much it cost taxpayers. Voters will never be told the taxpayer cost of the Scott Morrison\u2019s private holidays to Fiji and Hawaii, including flying AFP officers overseas to guard his family, after a freedom of information request was dismissed on the grounds it was not in the public interest and could harm international relations. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has exempted all documents relating to the controversial trip that Mr Morrison took to Hawaii as bushfires raged across Australia, effectively slapping a suppression order on the taxpayer cost. While the prime minister paid for the flights privately, there was a taxpayer cost incurred in flying security guards overseas for the family trip, a highly unusual act by a national leader. You can read that report, here. Michael McCormack was on Sky this morning, promising his party will focus on its constituents from now on. You know \u2013 those people who are among the poorest in the country, and have suffered through one of the worst droughts this nation has seen, as well as the climate fires, and water issues, and continued simmering trade tensions in an already shaky economy. Those constituents. I appreciate that yesterday was probably necessary to take place, it has taken place. Barnaby has pledged his loyalty, he said he won\u2019t re-challenge. We now need to draw a line under it and move on and make sure as members of the National party we concentrate on the people who matter most, and that\u2019s the people we serve. Pretty sure we have heard that before. Parliament is due to start at 9.30am this morning. As promised in the government talking points, we have legislation \u2013 the government will be putting through a treasury laws amendment (to ensure the bushfire assistance is tax-free) as well as two more bills related to the banking royal commission, which was handed down about a year ago. It\u2019s the first official day of parliamentary proceedings \u2013 which you can tell, because every politician and their dog has been on the breakfast TV shows this morning, telling us it is a brand new year. Let\u2019s try and forget for a moment that the ridiculous drama of yesterday was entirely brought on by the National party itself, and had nothing to do with anyone or anything else \u2013 you don\u2019t get to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under something just because you decide it\u2019s over. Scott Morrison has been out this morning talking about the new frontbench coming \u2013 as well as the independent commissioner into veteran suicides. Darren Chester will be returning to the cabinet \u2013 that much is sure. Keith Pitt will probably get a guernsey as well \u2013 he is steady, hasn\u2019t screwed up his media appearances, and well, Michael McCormack owes him. Michelle Landry is also in line for a promotion \u2013 she was a steadfast McCormack supporter since his leadership emergence two years ago, and didn\u2019t budget. David Littleproud will also most likely get what he wants. But all of that doesn\u2019t change that the government doesn\u2019t get to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under the summer \u2013 and what\u2019s happened since they got back \u2013 just because they want to. The sports grants affair, the Nationals, the coming audits, Angus Taylor, the response to the climate fires, water, the economy \u2013 all of that doesn\u2019t go away, just because someone wants to get a stick out and draw a line under something. You have one-coffee Amy (hence the crankiness), Sarah Martin and Paul Karp with you today \u2013 with Katharine Murphy and Mike Bowers working off-site. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

I\u2019m Warren Murray presenting the right stories at the right time. Nancy Pelosi, the US House speaker, has dramatically torn up her copy of Donald Trump\u2019s speech after the president delivered his State of the Union address to a joint sitting of Congress. Earlier, as Trump came up to the podium, Pelosi had offered him a handshake that the president failed to accept. An emboldened Trump bragged in his address about the \u201cgreat American comeback\u201d and an economy with unemployment at 3.5% \u2013 the lowest in more than 50 years. Democrats begged to differ, with Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib among those staging a walkout of the House chamber during the speech. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among other Democrats who declined altogether to attend. Fred Guttenberg, the father of a girl who was killed in the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was escorted out of the House chamber after he voiced protest to Trump\u2019s pledge to protect about gun rights. Trump used the occasion to award the controversial rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, asking Melania Trump to bestow it while Democrats in the chamber said \u201cNo!\u201d. After being criticised by the White House for tearing up the speech, Pelosi offered a great American comeback of her own \u2013 quipping that it had been the \u201ccourteous thing to do considering the alternative\u201d. The Senate will hold its final vote on the two articles of impeachment against Trump this afternoon US time. Trump is virtually guaranteed to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled chamber. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Latest figures show 490 people have died in mainland China from coronavirus with 24,292 confirmed cases there.

      "body": "<p>When Robert Shaw was filming the blockbuster Jaws, the actor\u2019s young son came to visit with the hope of seeing the famous mechanical shark named Bruce. \u201cHe was strictly under wraps,\u201d recalls Ian Shaw. \u201cI was let in and someone pulled off the dust cover.\u201d How did he feel when he came face to face with the sharp-toothed Bruce? \u201cIt scared me,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt was certainly frightening, even out of the water.\u201d</p> <p>Forty-five years later, he is portraying his father in a play about the famously beleaguered Jaws shoot. The Shark Is Broken, co-written by Ian Shaw and Joseph Nixon, was a hit at the Edinburgh festival last summer and will open in London\u2019s West End in May, directed by Guy Masterson and presented by Sonia Friedman Productions. It is a three-hander following Robert Shaw and his fellow actors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/12/obituaries.usa\">Roy Scheider</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/24/richard-dreyfuss-reckless-when-i-die-i-want-the-chance-to-hit-god-in-the-face\">Richard Dreyfuss</a>, who are \u201cstuck together on a boat waiting to film\u201d as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/31/jaws-40-years-on-truly-great-lasting-classics-of-america-cinema\">Steven Spielberg\u2019s movie</a> goes wildly over budget and over schedule on location in Martha\u2019s Vineyard.</p> <p>Shaw has drawn on first-hand accounts \u2013 such as the book The Jaws Log by the film\u2019s screenwriter Carl Gottlieb \u2013 in writing the script for The Shark Is Broken. The production\u2019s main problem was Bruce, whose name was borrowed from Spielberg\u2019s lawyer, Bruce Ramer, and was given to a total of three different full-size, pneumatic sharks. These models functioned in the workshop, but became temperamental in the seawater and were unable to \u201cwithstand the elements\u201d says Shaw. \u201cSpielberg could have shot the film in a tank in California under controlled circumstances but he wanted it to look as realistic as possible. Shooting in the sea was an unusual choice and made it very difficult.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f919ac414f9d0bf818fa7ef60074d684a8407c07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f919ac414f9d0bf818fa7ef60074d684a8407c07/0_0_2664_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A curious task for an actor\u2019 \u2026 Ian Shaw as his father, Robert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A curious task for an actor\u2019 \u2026 Ian Shaw as his father, Robert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Driftwood</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the technicians wrestled with Bruce, relationships soured between the actors, in particular Shaw, who was cast as the shark hunter Quint, and Dreyfuss, who played an ichthyologist forming an uneasy alliance with Quint. \u201cThe chemistry was tricky between Richard and Robert,\u201d explains Shaw. \u201cI think Richard wound my father up at times, and my father was quite ready to express himself.\u201d Shaw says his father, who struggled with alcohol abuse, \u201cwas drinking because of all the hold-ups. It was quite a lively atmosphere.\u201d</p> <p>Shaw was eight years old when his father died in 1978. Revisiting his father\u2019s alcoholism was one of the reasons that he found the play hard to write. \u201cI was daunted. When I originally sketched out the idea for the play, I shoved it in a drawer quite quickly. I felt it was something I shouldn\u2019t go near because it was so personal. After discussing it with friends and family, I felt able to go back to it.\u201d He believes the lead trio of Jaws actors \u2013 including Scheider as police chief Brody \u2013 were playing characters who in some ways matched their own personalities. \u201cOur family tends to view my father\u2019s performance as being in some ways the most like him in real life, especially when he\u2019s being cheeky or funny.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"592f9430fbcdef7b355c71e2e8aef32e0b7514ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/592f9430fbcdef7b355c71e2e8aef32e0b7514ff/0_171_1975_1395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaws went wildly over budget and over schedule.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaws went wildly over budget and over schedule.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One story has it that Robert Shaw was goading Dreyfuss to get a better performance out of him. Shaw, who says he is a \u201cbig admirer of Dreyfuss\u201d, met him in the mid-90s when auditioning for a role in a production of Hamlet that Dreyfuss was directing at Birmingham Rep. \u201cI introduced myself as Robert Shaw\u2019s son, and he went a little pale, I thought. I\u2019d forgotten that they didn\u2019t always hit it off \u2026 He looked as if he was replaying a slightly traumatic event.\u201d</p> <p>Portraying his own father on stage is \u201ca curious task for an actor\u201d admits Shaw. \u201cHe died when I was quite young, but I adored him and have obviously watched his performances and interviews. It never felt as if it was an enormous challenge because I look like him and I sound like him. It\u2019s not a huge stretch for me to believe that I am him.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Shark Is Broken is at the Ambassadors theatre, London, 11 May-18 July</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Robert Shaw was filming the blockbuster Jaws, the actor\u2019s young son came to visit with the hope of seeing the famous mechanical shark named Bruce. \u201cHe was strictly under wraps,\u201d recalls Ian Shaw. \u201cI was let in and someone pulled off the dust cover.\u201d How did he feel when he came face to face with the sharp-toothed Bruce? \u201cIt scared me,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt was certainly frightening, even out of the water.\u201d Forty-five years later, he is portraying his father in a play about the famously beleaguered Jaws shoot. The Shark Is Broken, co-written by Ian Shaw and Joseph Nixon, was a hit at the Edinburgh festival last summer and will open in London\u2019s West End in May, directed by Guy Masterson and presented by Sonia Friedman Productions. It is a three-hander following Robert Shaw and his fellow actors Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss, who are \u201cstuck together on a boat waiting to film\u201d as Steven Spielberg\u2019s movie goes wildly over budget and over schedule on location in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Shaw has drawn on first-hand accounts \u2013 such as the book The Jaws Log by the film\u2019s screenwriter Carl Gottlieb \u2013 in writing the script for The Shark Is Broken. The production\u2019s main problem was Bruce, whose name was borrowed from Spielberg\u2019s lawyer, Bruce Ramer, and was given to a total of three different full-size, pneumatic sharks. These models functioned in the workshop, but became temperamental in the seawater and were unable to \u201cwithstand the elements\u201d says Shaw. \u201cSpielberg could have shot the film in a tank in California under controlled circumstances but he wanted it to look as realistic as possible. Shooting in the sea was an unusual choice and made it very difficult.\u201d As the technicians wrestled with Bruce, relationships soured between the actors, in particular Shaw, who was cast as the shark hunter Quint, and Dreyfuss, who played an ichthyologist forming an uneasy alliance with Quint. \u201cThe chemistry was tricky between Richard and Robert,\u201d explains Shaw. \u201cI think Richard wound my father up at times, and my father was quite ready to express himself.\u201d Shaw says his father, who struggled with alcohol abuse, \u201cwas drinking because of all the hold-ups. It was quite a lively atmosphere.\u201d Shaw was eight years old when his father died in 1978. Revisiting his father\u2019s alcoholism was one of the reasons that he found the play hard to write. \u201cI was daunted. When I originally sketched out the idea for the play, I shoved it in a drawer quite quickly. I felt it was something I shouldn\u2019t go near because it was so personal. After discussing it with friends and family, I felt able to go back to it.\u201d He believes the lead trio of Jaws actors \u2013 including Scheider as police chief Brody \u2013 were playing characters who in some ways matched their own personalities. \u201cOur family tends to view my father\u2019s performance as being in some ways the most like him in real life, especially when he\u2019s being cheeky or funny.\u201d One story has it that Robert Shaw was goading Dreyfuss to get a better performance out of him. Shaw, who says he is a \u201cbig admirer of Dreyfuss\u201d, met him in the mid-90s when auditioning for a role in a production of Hamlet that Dreyfuss was directing at Birmingham Rep. \u201cI introduced myself as Robert Shaw\u2019s son, and he went a little pale, I thought. I\u2019d forgotten that they didn\u2019t always hit it off \u2026 He looked as if he was replaying a slightly traumatic event.\u201d Portraying his own father on stage is \u201ca curious task for an actor\u201d admits Shaw. \u201cHe died when I was quite young, but I adored him and have obviously watched his performances and interviews. It never felt as if it was an enormous challenge because I look like him and I sound like him. It\u2019s not a huge stretch for me to believe that I am him.\u201d \u2022 The Shark Is Broken is at the Ambassadors theatre, London, 11 May-18 July",

      "body": "<p>\u2018I knew the moment my marriage ended that someday it might make a book \u2013 if I could just stop crying about it. One of the things I\u2019m proudest of is that I managed to convert an event that seemed to me hideously tragic at the time to a comedy \u2013 and if that\u2019s not fiction I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d</p> <p>This is what Nora Ephron wrote on the 25th anniversary of the publication of her classic novel, Heartburn, which was inspired by her divorce from the journalist Carl Bernstein. It\u2019s a quote that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/noah-baumbach-marriage-story-divorce-hope\">Noah Baumbach</a> would be more than entitled to slap on at the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/17/marriage-story-review-scarlett-johansson-adam-driver-noah-baumbach-best-film-yet\">Marriage Story</a>, a film that was inspired by his divorce from actor Jennifer Jason Leigh. For some reason, people (fools) keep comparing Baumbach\u2019s movie to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/03/meryl-streep-kramer-vs-kramer-oscar\">Kramer vs Kramer</a>, the 1979 anti-feminist divorce movie starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. But Kramer vs Kramer just converts its rage and sadness into more rage and more sadness. In Heartburn, Ephron alchemised her anger and grief into something extremely funny, honest and vulnerable. Baumbach does the same with Marriage Story, which tells the story of the collapse of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole\u2019s (Scarlett Johansson) marriage. But Baumbach goes one step further, something you almost never see in any movie, let alone one about divorce: he looks at both the man and the woman\u2019s experiences. (In fact, the only movie I can think of that is equally interested in its male and female protagonists is When Harry Met Sally, which was written by \u2026 Nora Ephron.)</p> <p>I understand why some critics think the movie ends up too much on Charlie\u2019s side, but I think they\u2019re wrong, and few are quicker than me to take offence on behalf of a female character. It\u2019s true we end the movie with Charlie, but we also see what an absolutely narcissistic dickhead he is, whereas the movie is never personally critical of Nicole. She comes across as a nice person who is just in desperate need to get on with her life. Charlie, on the other hand, seems like a self-obsessed director who constantly snaps at his child. Put it this way: which of the two characters would you rather date? Even Baumbach knows the answer to that.</p> <p>The next thing to say about Marriage Story is that it\u2019s really funny. God, it\u2019s so funny. Even the famous big fight scene, in which Charlie and Nicole finally tear one another to shreds, is actually funny. \u201cI hope you get an illness and then get hit by a car and DIE!\u201d Charlie snarls. It\u2019s mean, yes, but also hilarious, in the way adult life can be horrible and hilarious at the same time. With the exceptions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/apr/07/2\">The Squid and the Whale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/10/greenberg-review\">Greenberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/15/the-meyerowitz-stories-review-noah-baumbach-dustin-hoffman-ben-stiller\">The Meyerowitz Stories</a>, I\u2019ve found Baumbach\u2019s movies to be a little too mannered, a little too self-conscious. But in Marriage Story, he finds a tone that is both entirely unique and utterly unobtrusive. I\u2019ve never seen another film that is as simultaneously funny and sad as this one. It feels completely apt \u2013 and real \u2013 that Charlie, later in the movie, should sing Being Alive in a bar, the great song from Company by Stephen Sondheim, because no other songwriter is so good at synthesising the good and the sad in life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHi-a1n8t7M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BHi-a1n8t7M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Other depictions of divorce, including Heartburn, often shade into black and white caricatures, but Marriage Story, by and very large, doesn\u2019t. The one exception to this is Nicole\u2019s divorce lawyer, played by Laura Dern, who is so vulture-like it doesn\u2019t leave you with much doubt about Baumbach\u2019s feelings for his ex-wife\u2019s legal team. For this reason, I really don\u2019t understand the awards fuss around Dern; if people were so desperate to give something to one of the lawyers in this movie, they should have gone for Ray Liotta, who is thrillingly funny and far less cartoonish.</p> <p>Which brings us to the awards. I\u2019m delighted that Johansson and Driver have been so heavily nominated for this movie, and it\u2019s infuriating that Driver \u2013 who absolutely gives the performance of the year in this \u2013 has been awards-blocked so thoroughly by Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Joker. The moment when Charlie reads Nicole\u2019s letter about him to their son has more power in it than the whole of Joker times a million. But the really absurd story about Marriage Story is that Baumbach himself hasn\u2019t been nominated for a best director Oscar. This movie got a best film nomination, his actors got best actor and best actress, it even got a best supporting actress nomination for Dern. Instead, he was given consolation prize with a best original screenplay nomination, and I suspect he won\u2019t win that (my money for that category is on Parasite.) It reminds me of the 1992 Oscars when the host Billy Crystal referenced in his opening monologue song that Barbra Streisand hadn\u2019t been nominated for best director for <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/prince-of-tides-1991\">The Prince of Tides</a>, even though almost everyone else connected to her movie got a nomination: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCAi1744Sa0\">Seven nominations on the shelf / Did this film direct itself?</a>\u201d Crystal sang.</p> <p>Marriage Story didn\u2019t direct itself, and Baumbach deserved that nomination, certainly more than Todd Phillips does for the absurdly derivative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/02/1917-deserves-baftass-thunderous-applause-joker-does-not\">Joker</a>. As he did with The Squid and the Whale (another film for which he only got a screenplay nomination), Baumbach gives this movie an entirely original mood while also plugging deeply into the feelings of the characters. Only a gifted director can do that and it\u2019s why he deserved a director nomination and it\u2019s why the movie deserves to win best film. To paraphrase Ephron, if that isn\u2019t art I don\u2019t know what is.</p>",

Like the tortured, lovelorn and agonised songs that rang out from below the Mason-Dixon line and morphed and mutated into rock\u2019n\u2019roll \u2013 to be consumed by a white audience largely ignorant of its black origins \u2013 the Alabama art echoes throughout the work of celebrated white artists, including Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at a Rauschenberg, there\u2019s a conversation going on, but it\u2019s clearly one-sided,\u201d says the curator. \u201cThe same is true for Johns \u2013 it\u2019s all about hidden things. They exported that language in a similar way to the blues. It\u2019s like a lot that comes from the south: it\u2019s been exported but not with credit. This is a chance to redress that balance.\u201d</p> <p>That artistic lineage is also there in the work of contemporary AfricanAmerican artists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/14/mark-bradford-artist-interview-picketts-charge-civil-war\">Mark Bradford</a>, who uses discarded advertising hoardings to create his large-scale abstract works, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/25/rashid-johnson-the-hikers-interview\">Rashid Johnson</a>\u2019s Broken Men series made with oil sticks, melted black soap, wax and flooring. \u201cAll the art in the show is pre-made or from existing materials, it\u2019s about materials but it\u2019s also about using what you have and not using up resources from the world,\u201d says Collins.</p> <p>While Holley, Minter, <a href=\"https://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/artist/thornton-dial\">Thornton Dial</a>, <a href=\"http://www.purvisyoung.com/\">Purvis Young</a> and <a href=\"https://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/artist/joe-light\">Joe Light</a> from Memphis have received some recognition, the work of black female artists has largely been ignored. \u201cSome of the men have had careers as artists, but for the women we don\u2019t know about them,\u201d says Collins. \u201cThe women stayed in the yards.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, there were of course female artists in the south.

He was amazed that there was often a symmetry to the work despite its construction from cast-off cloth. \u201cHe saw art,\u201d says Bendolph, whose mother-in-law Mary Lee Bendolph is a Gee\u2019s Bend quilter. \u201cHe was amazed by the work and how the pieces balanced themselves out.

      "bodyText": "The quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend make art out of recycled cloth. Lonnie Holley crafts sculptures out of car tyres and other human detritus. Self-taught luthier Freeman Vines carves guitars out of wood that came from a \u201changing tree\u201d once used to lynch black men. The \u201cyard shows\u201d of Dinah Young and Joe Minter are permanent exhibitions of their art \u2013 a cacophony of \u201cscrap-iron elegies\u201d. Almost all of this art comes from Alabama, and it all features in We Will Walk, Turner Contemporary\u2019s groundbreaking new exhibition of African-American art from the southern state and its surroundings. Made from found and recycled material, this is art truly from the margins. It\u2019s from places such as Gee\u2019s Bend, the segregated hamlet now known as Boykin, where Martin Luther King travelled in 1965, taking his message about the importance of voter registration. Despite its humble materials, it has echoes of another Alabama son, the jazz band leader and philosopher Sun Ra, and his Afrofuturist message about his own interstellar origins and otherworldly black excellence. Cultural critic Greg Tate describes the artists in We Will Walk as \u201csouthern black visionaries and homegrown technicians of the sacred\u201d who deal in \u201cneo-hoodoo imaginations and hollering bebop ghosts \u2026 folks who made ritual look like interior decorating\u201d, and \u201cturned lawn ornamentation into a form of incantation\u201d. That esoteric mix is seen in the work of Minter, which includes a large recreation of the jail cell in Birmingham, Alabama, where King was held after an anti-segregation protest \u2013 here, it\u2019s watched over by six concrete dobermans. It is also discernible in Holley\u2019s Him and Her Hold the Root, a sculpture made up of two rocking chairs with a sprawling root draped across them, and in Ralph Griffin\u2019s Eagle, a wooden rendering of a bald eagle created from found materials. But however otherworldly the work may look, much of it has deep roots in the US civil rights struggle. \u201cThese artists were surrounded by momentous events and those events shaped their art,\u201d says curator Hannah Collins. \u201cMy grandmother helped dig the graves for three of the little girls who were in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing,\u201d Holley tells me, referring to the 1963 terrorist attack in Birmingham, which killed four black girls and stunned the country. \u201cThis is how close we were to what you call the political meaning of our existence. We lived in it in Birmingham.\u201d Holley\u2019s work tells a secret history of black America, one that needs an Enigma machine to decode. A celebrated musician still playing and making albums, he began making art in 1979 when he created an improvised gravestone for his niece and nephew who were killed in a house fire. Two years later, his work was included in a group show of Appalachian art at the Smithsonian, in Washington DC. His life story is remarkable and horrifying. One of 27 children, he picked cotton, had little formal education and ended up at what was then the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children in Mount Meigs after breaking a curfew set by Eugene \u201cBull\u201d Connor, Birmingham\u2019s notorious segregationist commissioner of public safety. \u201cIn a more just world, someone like Lonnie Holley would have been Michelangelo,\u201d says Matt Arnett, son of William Arnett, the art collector and curator who played a key role in bringing Alabama art to the world\u2019s attention. \u201cBut he was born black in America in the south, so instead of his intelligence and outlook being revered, celebrated and nurtured, he\u2019s beaten and thrown in a chain gang for children at 11.\u201d Holley would eventually leave Alabama and move in with one of his brothers in Florida, where he worked at Disney World.

His technicolour flannel is the standard under which the Tories marched to power, and they aren\u2019t going to abandon it yet. The prime minister is planning a cabinet reshuffle to reinforce his authority. The changes are unlikely to bring intellectual coherence to the government. Docile servants will be promoted. Room will be made for them by trashing those ministers with too few friends in the party to ever be dangerous.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/03/political-journalists-boycott-no-10-briefing-after-reporter-ban\">Political journalists boycott No 10 briefing after reporter ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson certainly has little to fear from the official opposition. Labour\u2019s leadership contest is defined by fear of defiling the corpse of an election result with anything like a proper postmortem. Corbynism is being embalmed for installation in the mausoleum of martyrs to public ingratitude, from where it will not disturb the government.</p> <p>One lesson from history is that Tories are better than Labour at bringing down Tory prime ministers. Another lesson: in parliaments where the government has a large majority, serious disruption must come from within the ruling party. The opposition will vote reliably and impotently against whatever Johnson proposes, so the salient question is what might cause a few dozen Conservatives to rebel. Precedent suggests hardline Eurosceptics will break first, which is why Johnson sustains his anti-Brussels rhetoric <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/03/shapeshifter-world-king-the-pm-boris-johnson-could-be-seriously-unwell\" title=\"\">at campaign pitch</a>. Tory pro-Europeans were supine even when they had the numbers to harm him.</p> <p>The EU itself will be less compliant and there are other players in this drama beyond Westminster. Scotland is not susceptible to Johnsonian wit. Nor is the global economy. The long victory parade cannot go on for ever. Even the cheerleading portion of the press has taken some exception to No 10\u2019s new, Trumpesque practice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/03/political-journalists-boycott-no-10-briefing-after-reporter-ban\" title=\"\">banishing unhelpful journalists</a> from lobby briefings.</p> <p>But external checks have limited effect when Britain\u2019s constitution bestows the privileges of a medieval crown on a prime minister with a big majority. Johnson proved his readiness to abuse that power last year, when he tried to chasten an obstructive Commons with illegal dissolution. And now he has no need to arrogate the royal prerogative if he has submissive MPs to rubber-stamp his bills.</p> <p>This is not a new flaw in the structures of democratic accountability but it is newly hazardous after the steadying voices of convention and protocol shouted themselves hoarse over Brexit, then fell silent. It is doubly troubling under a prime minister with no internal mechanism for moral restraint and every outward symptom of relishing the monarchical style that his office allows. History is clear on what must happen next. Such habits can be checked only by rebellion. A new generation of Tories will have to discover the independence of mind and insurrectionary spirit necessary to restore sovereignty to the House of Commons. Parliament\u2019s the thing that has to serve as conscience for this king.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

He calls himself a \u201cBrexity Hezza\u201d, which is the kind of thing the imagination can summon, but not for any practical purpose, like a chocolate onion. For the time being, Johnson gets away with abstract verbiage and theatrical bombast. His technicolour flannel is the standard under which the Tories marched to power, and they aren\u2019t going to abandon it yet. The prime minister is planning a cabinet reshuffle to reinforce his authority. The changes are unlikely to bring intellectual coherence to the government. Docile servants will be promoted. Room will be made for them by trashing those ministers with too few friends in the party to ever be dangerous. Johnson certainly has little to fear from the official opposition. Labour\u2019s leadership contest is defined by fear of defiling the corpse of an election result with anything like a proper postmortem. Corbynism is being embalmed for installation in the mausoleum of martyrs to public ingratitude, from where it will not disturb the government. One lesson from history is that Tories are better than Labour at bringing down Tory prime ministers. Another lesson: in parliaments where the government has a large majority, serious disruption must come from within the ruling party. The opposition will vote reliably and impotently against whatever Johnson proposes, so the salient question is what might cause a few dozen Conservatives to rebel. Precedent suggests hardline Eurosceptics will break first, which is why Johnson sustains his anti-Brussels rhetoric at campaign pitch. Tory pro-Europeans were supine even when they had the numbers to harm him. The EU itself will be less compliant and there are other players in this drama beyond Westminster. Scotland is not susceptible to Johnsonian wit. Nor is the global economy. The long victory parade cannot go on for ever. Even the cheerleading portion of the press has taken some exception to No 10\u2019s new, Trumpesque practice of banishing unhelpful journalists from lobby briefings. But external checks have limited effect when Britain\u2019s constitution bestows the privileges of a medieval crown on a prime minister with a big majority. Johnson proved his readiness to abuse that power last year, when he tried to chasten an obstructive Commons with illegal dissolution. And now he has no need to arrogate the royal prerogative if he has submissive MPs to rubber-stamp his bills. This is not a new flaw in the structures of democratic accountability but it is newly hazardous after the steadying voices of convention and protocol shouted themselves hoarse over Brexit, then fell silent. It is doubly troubling under a prime minister with no internal mechanism for moral restraint and every outward symptom of relishing the monarchical style that his office allows. History is clear on what must happen next. Such habits can be checked only by rebellion. A new generation of Tories will have to discover the independence of mind and insurrectionary spirit necessary to restore sovereignty to the House of Commons. Parliament\u2019s the thing that has to serve as conscience for this king. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

A software engineer starts at $98,750 and a director of engineering earns $179,046. Customer advocates tend to make the least, with a base salary of $60,810. Salaries are calculated based on a formula that takes into account an employee\u2019s experience level and their cost of living compared with San Francisco. There is no negotiation and no bonuses. </p> <p>Courtney Seiter, head of the People team, which oversees company culture and human relations, joined Buffer a few months after the salaries appeared online, lured in part by this policy. </p> <p>It adds an extra wrinkle to her interpersonal relations. Although she considers her $132,836 salary \u201cnormal\u201d by California standards, Seiter said this figure can seem high<strong> </strong>for where she lives in Nashville, Tennessee. With her friends, it remains curiously unspoken. </p> <p>\u201cI figure they know my salary, but we never talk about it, which is kind of weird,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents think it\u2019s really bizarre but they find everything about Buffer bizarre.\u201d</p> <p>At work, knowing her salary is common knowledge, shirking off is a far more complicated proposition.</p> <p>\u201cIt can light a fire under you to ensure you\u2019re worth what you\u2019re earning,\u201d she said.</p> <p>For product manager Mia Hamano, having her $147,290 salary online \u201cwas initially weird, but if you\u2019re curious about how much your friends make, you\u2019re going to go to Glassdoor and put in their job and location anyway\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Community strategist Arielle Tannenbaum used the spreadsheet to negotiate a raise when she was recently promoted, from $83,279<strong> </strong>to $86,643. \u201cThat objectivity in the process gave me more leverage,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to wonder if I\u2019m earning enough or if I\u2019m valued differently from my teammates.\u201d</p> <p>Research suggests that salary transparency can boost productivity, with a caveat. In a study examining its impact at a multibillion-dollar bank in Asia with 2,060 employees, Ricardo Perez-Truglia and Zo\u00eb B Cullen found that employees tended to work harder when they discovered their manager earned more than they thought. When they learned their peers earned more, however, employees\u2019 performance and hours spent working decreased.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, \u201cpeople like transparency but only some forms of transparency,\u201d said Perez-Truglia, an economist and assistant professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. In a separate study of 755 employees at the bank, he and Cullen found most employees were reticent to share salaries unless they could do so anonymously. The researchers asked employees how much money they would need to be paid to reveal how much they make to five co-workers; 38% refused to share their salaries even for $125.</p> <p>\u201cThey actually value their privacy more than they value information,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Openness can influence gender parity, according to a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/01/research-gender-pay-gaps-shrink-when-companies-are-required-to-disclose-them\">recent analysis</a> of the effects of \u2019 Denmark\u2019s 2006 Act on Gender Specific Pay Statistics, which mandates that companies of over 35 employees publish data about gender wage gaps. From 2003 to 2008, the divide shrank a modest 7%, to 17.5%, at firms that were required to report their pay data, and they notched more female hires and promotions. At companies that did not have to share this information, the gender gap remained at 18.9% .</p> <p>Wage transparency, it seems, may be just one ingredient in addressing pay inequality<strong>. </strong>The willingness to negotiate a salary and the rate at which someone climbs the ladder have an even stronger influence, said Perez-Truglia.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of the gender gap is related to promotions. More men are in higher positions so they make more money,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that sense, it\u2019s difficult for me to think that transparency can do a lot.\u201d</p> <p>So at Buffer, has it worked?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf730fb31e592c920f72a85ceaeab67ca63aa14b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf730fb31e592c920f72a85ceaeab67ca63aa14b/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hamano looks at Buffer\u2019s salary spreadsheet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hamano looks at Buffer\u2019s salary spreadsheet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Constanza Hevia H/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>More women, but there\u2019s still a gap</h2> <p>Men at the company today receive an average annual salary of $124,979, while women earn $111,615, according to January 2020 data obtained by the Guardian but not yet released. This 12% gap is over three times more than the gap in 2015.</p> <p>One reason is the company\u2019s \u201cdiversity debt\u201d, a concept proposed by former venture capitalist <a href=\"https://medium.com/@abarrica/startups-diversity-debt-and-what-to-do-about-it-cd385364506\">Andrea Barrica</a>, which holds that companies can be in the red from years of hiring a fairly homogeneous population.</p> <p>\u201cEarly on, we did hire more men than women due to our inclination biases,\u201d particularly for high-paying technical positions, said Gascoigne, \u201cand both founders were male, so we do have a lot of diversity debt\u201d.</p> <p>When Katie Womersley joined Buffer four years ago as<strong> </strong>a front-end engineer earning $85,676, for instance, there were two female engineers on a team with 18 men. \u201cI was excited because there was one other woman,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my previous experiences, I had been the only woman.\u201d</p> <p>Now she<strong> </strong>leads Buffer\u2019s engineering team<strong> </strong>and makes $220,500. But most of the 18 men who were on the engineering team when Womersley was hired are still there. In total there are 21 male engineers and 13 women, and many of the men who joined earlier are now in senior positions, earning more than many of the women.</p> <p>The gender pay gap at Buffer is for this reason widest on the engineering team (36%), which is the highest-paid in the company on average, followed by the product team (33%). The difference is slim for customer advocacy<strong> </strong>and marketing positions (3%) as both women and men occupy senior jobs. For the People/Finance team, which includes accountants and administrators, the gender gap is reversed, as there are seven female team members and one male.</p> <p>All of this means that while the total number of female employees at Buffer has grown more than 65% in the past year, with 40 women and 46 men now at the company, fewer women in senior roles still translate to an overall gender pay gap.</p> <h2>Confronting a systemic problem</h2> <p>A way to close this gap, and the company\u2019s biggest challenge, is hiring women for senior roles and retaining women in technical positions, said Seiter, who authored Buffer\u2019s most recent <a href=\"https://open.buffer.com/gender-pay-gap-2019/\">analysis</a> of the problem.</p> <p>Women leave the tech industry after two to five years, often due to systemic problems such as gender-based discrimination. In Silicon Valley, 87% of surveyed women heard \u201cdemeaning comments from male colleagues\u201d, and 60% of women in tech \u201creported unwanted sexual advances\u201d, according to the 2016 <a href=\"https://www.elephantinthevalley.com/\">Elephant in the Valley</a> report, based on testimonies from over 200 women who had over 10 years each of experience in the tech industry.</p> <p>Buffer is taking what steps it can. In its job listings, it emphasizes that potential employees do not need every qualification for a job. Women tend to only apply for jobs where they fit 100% of the qualifications. Men typically apply if they fulfill 60% of criteria, according to a Hewlett Packard internal report.</p> <p>\u201cWe have the privilege to dig into the nuances\u201d of what influences gender parity, Seiter said. \u201cWe need to make sure that all people have the same opportunities to advance.\u201d</p>",

The gender pay gap at Buffer is for this reason widest on the engineering team (36%), which is the highest-paid in the company on average, followed by the product team (33%). The difference is slim for customer advocacy and marketing positions (3%) as both women and men occupy senior jobs. For the People/Finance team, which includes accountants and administrators, the gender gap is reversed, as there are seven female team members and one male. All of this means that while the total number of female employees at Buffer has grown more than 65% in the past year, with 40 women and 46 men now at the company, fewer women in senior roles still translate to an overall gender pay gap. Confronting a systemic problem A way to close this gap, and the company\u2019s biggest challenge, is hiring women for senior roles and retaining women in technical positions, said Seiter, who authored Buffer\u2019s most recent analysis of the problem. Women leave the tech industry after two to five years, often due to systemic problems such as gender-based discrimination. In Silicon Valley, 87% of surveyed women heard \u201cdemeaning comments from male colleagues\u201d, and 60% of women in tech \u201creported unwanted sexual advances\u201d, according to the 2016 Elephant in the Valley report, based on testimonies from over 200 women who had over 10 years each of experience in the tech industry. Buffer is taking what steps it can. In its job listings, it emphasizes that potential employees do not need every qualification for a job. Women tend to only apply for jobs where they fit 100% of the qualifications. Men typically apply if they fulfill 60% of criteria, according to a Hewlett Packard internal report. \u201cWe have the privilege to dig into the nuances\u201d of what influences gender parity, Seiter said. \u201cWe need to make sure that all people have the same opportunities to advance.\u201d",

Above all, it asks how the UN\u2019s international health diplomacy, confronted with a potential pandemic where a timely and accurate flow of information is crucial, should interact with one of the world\u2019s most powerful, and controlling, states. Looming above all else is the fact that China is a country whose trajectory under Xi Jinping has been to become more, not less, authoritarian, marked by mass internment camps for Uighurs, a growing internet crackdown and its harsh response to street protests in Hong Kong. There seems little doubt either that China\u2019s bureaucratic culture of control and secrecy, including the local government\u2019s efforts to clamp down on the information emerging about the disease in the first weeks of the epidemic, contributed to its initial spread in December and the first weeks of January.

In particular, the fraught politics of the WHO declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) has once again come under the spotlight in the same way it did during the Ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Some of those most critical have parsed Xi\u2019s meeting with Tedros \u2013 and Xi\u2019s declared hope that the UN body would assess the \u201cepidemic situation in an objective, just, calm and reasonable way\u201d \u2013 as pressure from Beijing to ensure WHO would refrain from designating the epidemic a global health emergency to protect China\u2019s economy. Although that didn\u2019t happen, the WHO\u2019s advice \u2013 contrary to that of many governments \u2013 is that it still \u201cadvises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this event\u201d. And on this front some are pointing to a startling contradiction: how the UN body has praised the extreme internal travel restrictions in China while criticising other countries for implementing their own travel measures. Sources familiar with the politics at the top of the organisation, and the decision over declaring the outbreak a PHEIC, insist that WHO have had to balance very difficult issues. With China\u2019s well-known history of extreme sensitivity to criticism, the argument goes, a conscious decision was made to prioritise diplomacy that would encourage China to be as open as possible in sharing information with international researchers and health bodies even at the risk of drawing inevitable criticism. \u201cChina was very quick to let the WHO know what was happening on 31 December,\u201d said one close observer. \u201cThe organisation\u2019s goal was to get as much information about what was happening in China to inform what the rest of the world would need to do. \u201cIt\u2019s clear there were two options: to keep pressing behind the scenes, or to go public and say at a press conference we didn\u2019t get such and such at this time and for the Chinese to lose face and slam the door.

      "bodyText": "The days and hours leading up to New Zealand\u2019s national commemoration day at Waitangi have often been fraught with tension: M\u0101ori leaders have a moment in the spotlight to call the government to account, and politicians compete to woo them \u2013 while trying to seem as though they are above politics. But the M\u0101ori leaders who gathered in Northland\u2019s Bay of Islands on Wednesday \u2013 where they met prime minister Jacinda Ardern to discuss the most pressing issues \u2013 said the mood at Waitangi had been the most optimistic and positive they could remember, for some in decades of attendance. \u201cThe feeling was better, the engagement was better, the dialogue was better, the content was better, and the outcomes were more productive,\u201d said Haami Piripi, the chair of Te Rarawa, a M\u0101ori iwi, or tribe, as he left a meeting on Wednesday between fellow leaders and Ardern. Waitangi Day commemorates the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, modern New Zealand\u2019s founding document, in 1840. It was intended to serve as an agreement between M\u0101ori leaders at the time and the British crown after settlers colonised New Zealand, but inconsistencies in the document\u2019s translation and breaches of it by successive governments has caused generations of conflict. The days leading up to Waitangi Day on Thursday have been traditionally a time for politicians and M\u0101ori leaders at the treaty grounds, a pristine beachfront spot, to discuss the state of the relationship \u2013 and have often clashed over Indigenous rights. Wednesday was a bright, sunny day, although some of the heat that has fuelled Northland\u2019s drought had fallen away as crowds trickled into the treaty grounds, some setting up tents near the Waitangi marae, or meeting house. This year, several issues loomed over Ardern\u2019s centre-left government: a dispute over what should happen to ancestral land at Ihumat\u0101o, a rift the government is attempting to help resolve; the seizure of M\u0101ori children into state care, which was the subject of a damning report by M\u0101ori leaders this week; and the status of Indigenous claims to natural resources, such as water. There were predictions that could mean a chilly reception for the government, led by Ardern\u2019s Labour party. But leaders who spoke to the Guardian said that had not happened. \u201cEngagement by Labour has been extremely meaningful and has an authenticity about it that buoys me,\u201d Piripi said of Wednesday\u2019s meeting. What New Zealand\u2019s main opposition party, the centre-right National party, had offered M\u0101ori, he said, \u201cwasn\u2019t as sophisticated as what we\u2019re doing now\u201d. The air at Waitangi is always filled with some tension, \u201cas it should be\u201d, said Shane te Pou, a political commentator at Waitangi. But the mood was the most optimistic he could remember, he said, and Ardern and her ministers had presented particularly well at Tuesday\u2019s formal speeches on Waitangi\u2019s upper marae. He singled out Andrew Little, the minister for treaty settlements, for praise; he gave his speech entirely in te reo M\u0101ori, without using notes. Ardern, too, had been warmly welcomed, said te Pou; she was invited to speak on the side of the local people, rather than standing on the side of the marae reserved for guests. \u201cSome people might see it as theatrics but it did set a positive theme for the iwi leaders forum today,\u201d he said of Little\u2019s speech. In contrast, the National party leader, Simon Bridges, was criticised for making a particularly political speech in which he pledged a four-lane highway for the region; lawmakers are expected to eschew overt politics at Waitangi in favour of more subtle promises. But some leaders were waiting to see if Ardern\u2019s government could fulfil its promises, particularly over the removal of M\u0101ori children from their families by the state, which a report by the M\u0101ori commissioning agency, Wh\u0101nau Ora, said on Monday was \u201cinhumane\u201d to Indigenous mothers. Merepeka Raukawa-Tait, the board chair of Wh\u0101nau Ora, who also attended Wednesday\u2019s leaders\u2019 meeting, said Ardern was \u201cpersonable\u201d and sincere in wanting to reduce child poverty. \u201cBut I have over many years heard it all before,\u201d she said. \u201cThe proof will be in walking the talk.\u201d After generations of colonisation, M\u0101ori have fallen behind on almost every health and economic measure. About 65% of children in care are M\u0101ori, but M\u0101ori only make up 16.5% of New Zealand\u2019s population. Raukawa-Tait and others said they had urged the prime minister to allow Indigenous people to design their own solutions. Following the meeting, Ardern said she and the iwi leaders had \u201cagreed a bit of a work programme\u201d. \u201cNone of us want any children to be in harm\u2019s way and all of us want to make the changes required to keep them safe,\u201d she told reporters. She had admitted in her speech on Tuesday that there was still \u201cmahi to do\u201d, using the M\u0101ori word for work. But te Pou said the prime minister had generated goodwill by arriving at Waitangi five or six days in advance, rather than whisking in and out as some other leaders had. Ardern has certainly been more popular at Waitangi than her predecessors; previous prime ministers have had their speaking rights revoked on the marae, or were jostled or showered with mud by protesters. A minister in the former National government, Steven Joyce, was in 2016 struck in the face with a sex toy thrown by a woman calling for Maori sovereignty. As Wednesday\u2019s meeting between leaders and politicians broke up at a hotel near the treaty grounds, the grounds themselves had the air of a market. Marquees had gone up, and M\u0101ori wardens ushered cars into the parking lot with big waves. Some had made what was an annual pilgrimage to Waitangi \u2013 to be with other M\u0101ori, to remember the country\u2019s history and to honour the treaty. Piripi, the iwi leader, said the \u201cferocity of the day\u201d had been diminished in recent years, without the earlier protests and tensions, and he was concerned Waitangi Day had become too festive when there was \u201creally nothing to celebrate\u201d. \u201cYou can buy toffee apples and you can buy candy floss,\u201d he said, referring to the treaty grounds. \u201cWhy would you want to eat toffee apples and candy floss on a day like that?\u201d",

Among the guests who attended on behalf of the president and first lady was Rush Limbaugh, the controversial conservative radio show host who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/03/rush-limbaugh-reveals-advanced-lung-cancer-radio\">announced</a> this week that he is undergoing surgery for advanced lung cancer.</p> \n<p>During his remarks, Trump announced that he would receive the country\u2019s highest civilian honor, the presidential medal of freedom. In an unusual move, Trump paused his speech for Melania Trump to present him with the medal.</p> \n<p>It was one of several surprises Trump had in store for his guests. He bestowed an education scholarship on a young girl whose mother could not afford to send her to a private school. And then, in a made-for-TV moment, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams returned from deployment in Afghanistan to surprise his wife and children in the first lady\u2019s box.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, a handful of Democratic lawmakers chose to skip the affair altogether. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she did not want to \u201clegitimize\u201d the president\u2019s actions.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter much deliberation, I have decided that I will not use my presence at a state ceremony to normalize Trump\u2019s lawless conduct &amp; subversion of the Constitution,\u201d she wrote on<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1224794340272242689?s=21\"> Twitter</a>. \u201cNone of this is normal, and I will not legitimize it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Massachusetts congresswoman Ayanna Pressley said she could not in \u201cgood conscience\u201d attend the speech, when he \u201cincessantly stokes fear in people of color, women, healthcare providers, LGBTQ+ communities, low-income families, and many more\u201d.</p> \n<p>Congressman Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, attended the speech but left halfway through.</p> \n<p>\u201cI just walked out of the #StateOfTheUnion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough.

Trump called the nation\u2019s current president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a \u201csocialist dictator\u201d and \u201cillegitimate ruler\u201d. \u201cSocialism destroys nations,\u201d Trump said to whoops and cheers from Republicans. \u201cBut always remember, freedom unifies the soul.\u201d Guests and no-shows It\u2019s a tradition for the White House and members of Congress to invite guests who reflect their political priorities. Among the guests who attended on behalf of the president and first lady was Rush Limbaugh, the controversial conservative radio show host who announced this week that he is undergoing surgery for advanced lung cancer. During his remarks, Trump announced that he would receive the country\u2019s highest civilian honor, the presidential medal of freedom. In an unusual move, Trump paused his speech for Melania Trump to present him with the medal. It was one of several surprises Trump had in store for his guests. He bestowed an education scholarship on a young girl whose mother could not afford to send her to a private school. And then, in a made-for-TV moment, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams returned from deployment in Afghanistan to surprise his wife and children in the first lady\u2019s box. Meanwhile, a handful of Democratic lawmakers chose to skip the affair altogether. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she did not want to \u201clegitimize\u201d the president\u2019s actions. \u201cAfter much deliberation, I have decided that I will not use my presence at a state ceremony to normalize Trump\u2019s lawless conduct &amp; subversion of the Constitution,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cNone of this is normal, and I will not legitimize it.\u201d The Massachusetts congresswoman Ayanna Pressley said she could not in \u201cgood conscience\u201d attend the speech, when he \u201cincessantly stokes fear in people of color, women, healthcare providers, LGBTQ+ communities, low-income families, and many more\u201d. Congressman Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, attended the speech but left halfway through. \u201cI just walked out of the #StateOfTheUnion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. It\u2019s like watching professional wrestling. It\u2019s all fake.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me tonight after a very divisive State of the Union. Here\u2019s how the night unfolded: Trump\u2019s annual address was bookended by two moments of tension between the president and the House speaker. When he arrived for his speech, Trump appeared to reject a handshake from Nancy Pelosi, and the speaker later tore up her copy of the president\u2019s remarks as he was wrapping up. Trump\u2019s speech was built around some made-for-television moments. Most notably, he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to controversial radio host Rush Limbaugh and reunited a military family attending the event. Trump made it through the speech without mentioning impeachment, marking a rare moment of restraint from the unpredictable president. He is likely waiting until tomorrow, when the Senate is expected to acquit him, to take a victory lap. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar delivered the Democratic responses to the State of the Union, but their remarks were overshadowed by the tension between Trump and Pelosi. The blog will be back tomorrow for live updates and analysis of the Senate\u2019s final vote in the impeachment trial, so tune back in for that. And thank you for following our State of the Union coverage. In her full statement about the State of the Union, Nancy Pelosi said Trump \u201cgave no comfort\u201d to families looking for better healthcare options and was \u201cnot truthful\u201d about his healthcare policies. \u201cNext week, when the President presents his budget, the American people will see the stark reality of his agenda,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cA federal budget should be a statement of our national values, and the President has sadly shown that he does not value the good health of the American people. \u201cDemocrats continue to urge the President to abandon his assault on seniors and families and to join us to deliver real progress in lowering the price of prescription drugs and making the bold investments needed to rebuild America\u2019s infrastructure in a green and modern way.\u201d Echoing her comments to reporters moments ago, Nancy Pelosi said in a tweet that Trump\u2019s State of the Union represented a \u201cmanifesto of mistruths\u201d and should serve as a \u201ccall to action.\u201d Some Republicans have criticized Pelosi for tearing up her copy of the State of the Union, but the House speaker is clearly not backing down. Meanwhile, because this is arguably the most absurdly busy week Washington has seen in an absurdly busy era, more results have been released from last night\u2019s Iowa caucuses. The Iowa Democratic Party has released results from 9% more of the precincts, bringing the total percentage of reported precincts up to 71%. The top-line notes are that Pete Buttigieg still leads, although his advantage over Bernie Sanders has slightly narrowed. Even more consequentially, Joe Biden is facing the risk of not winning any delegates from Iowa. The former vice president needs to remain above 15% to be awarded delegates, and he\u2019s currently flirting with that threshold. Asked whether she would invite Trump to another State of the Union, Nancy Pelosi said she did not think that would be necessary because of the November election. Leaving the Capitol, Nancy Pelosi said she ripped up her copy of the State of the Union because it was a \u201cmanifesto of mistruths.\u201d Other Democrats echoed the House speaker\u2019s assessment of tonight\u2019s speech: But Republicans chastized Pelosi for the bold gesture: Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has issued a statement denouncing Trump\u2019s State of the Union as a \u201cshameful display\u201d: In one fell swoop, Trump delivered a speech worthy of the worst demagogue and turned his constitutional obligation to inform Congress about the state of our union into an episode of reality television. He even awarded our nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, not to the real American hero in the gallery \u2014 one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen\u2014but a conservative media personality who has done as much as Trump himself to divide our nation. It was a shameful display. During the address, Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to controversial radio host Rush Limbaugh, but he also recognized Charles McGee, one of the last living Tuskegee Airmen who was sitting in the chamber. Former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich said he was \u201cdisgusted and insulted\u201d by Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to rip up the State of the Union. Gingrich was House speaker during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, and his wife now serves as the US ambassador to the Vatican. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo appeared to weigh in on Nancy Pelosi ripping up her copy of Trump\u2019s State of the Union by sharing a meme of the character Lisa Simpson crying as she rips up an essay. Vox\u2019s Matthew Yglesias writes that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d response to the State of the Union, which was immediately overshadowed by Nancy Pelosi tearing up her copy of the speech, demonstrates Democrats\u2019 dilemma in the Trump era: Whitmer probably made a smart choice by trying to give an earnest policy speech in her response to the State of the Union address, rather than one addressing the president\u2019s crimes or the blood-soaked demagoguery of the anti-immigrant rhetoric in Trump\u2019s speech Tuesday night. ... The problem is it was so boring that I was tempted not to write about it at all. But as someone who strongly believes that treating Trump as a more-or-less \u2018normal\u2019 Republican politician is the best way to beat him, I have an obligation not to just tune Democrats out when they try. That, though, is easier said than done. Trump is such a larger-than-life personality and so skilled at pushing people\u2019s buttons, that following a speech full of reality show antics (a live medal presentation to Rush Limbaugh!) with an earnest discussion of why his paid family leave plan is grossly inadequate compared to Democrats\u2019 plans for real leave and a child allowance ends up seeming gray and sad. Nancy Pelosi told Fox News that she ripped up her copy of Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech because she couldn\u2019t find \u201cone page with truth on it.\u201d Asked about Nancy Pelosi ripping up the president\u2019s speech, House Democrats seem to be shifting the focus back on to Trump, who appeared to reject the House speaker\u2019s handshake when he arrived to deliver his State of the Union address. After ripping up Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech, Nancy Pelosi shared this photo from earlier in the night, when the president appeared to reject her handshake. But Pelosi\u2019s promise to \u201cnever stop extending the hand of friendship to get the job done\u201d seemed to clash with her very public show of opposition to the president when she tore up his remarks. Congressman Seth Moulton, another former Democratic presidential candidate, said he was among the House Democrats who walked out of the State of the Union. In additional to the several Democratic lawmakers who walked out of Trump\u2019s speech, at least 10 House Democrats did not attend the event in protest. One Democratic senator, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said it was \u201ca mistake\u201d for Democrats to attend the State of the Union at all, comparing the annual speech to a \u201c2020 campaign rally.\u201d Republican congressman Billy Long said he told Nancy Pelosi that she should auction off her copy of the State of the Union, which she ripped up, for charity. Long, an actual auctioneer, noted he is auctioning the tie he had Trump sign tonight to benefit St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. Asked about Nancy Pelosi ripping up Trump\u2019s speech, congressman Al Green, one of the House Democrats who boycotted the State of the Union, blamed the tension on the president for initially rejecting a handshake from the House speaker. The Republican National Commitee has already started circulating the video of Nancy Pelosi tearing up Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech, as some political commentators predicted the clip would soon find its way into a Republican attack ad. The White House has reacted to the clip of Nancy Pelosi tearing up the State of the Union speech, accusing the House speaker of disrespecting the guests Trump invited to the speech. As Twitter erupted over Nancy Pelosi tearing up Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer delivered the Democrats\u2019 English-language response to the speech. \u201cEvery Democrat running for president has a plan to expand health coverage for all Americans,\u201d Whitmer said, taking aim at Trump\u2019s criticisms of the Democratic presidential candidates. \u201cPresident Trump, sadly, has a different plan. He\u2019s asking the courts to rip those life-saving protections away. It\u2019s pretty simple. Democrats are trying to make your health care better. Republicans in Washington are trying to take it away.\u201d But those policy-focused remarks were immediately overshadowed by the tension between Trump and Pelosi, especially considering the annual speech comes one day before the Senate is expected to acquit the president in the impeachment trial. Longtime congressional reporters said Nancy Pelosi tearing up the paper copy of Trump\u2019s speech underscored what an unprecedented State of the Union it was, from the president\u2019s rejection of the speaker\u2019s handshake to Republican cheers of \u201cFour more years!\u201d in the House chamber. Pelosi also ignored the traditional introduction of the president as he walked into the chamber. Asked why she tore up Trump\u2019s speech, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said it was the \u201ccourteous thing to do considering the alternative.\u201d The moment immediately overshadowed the Democratic response being delivered by Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, who is focusing her remarks on healthcare and infrastructure. Right after Trump concluded his speech, House speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to rip up the paper copy of his speech. The State of the Union was bookended by Trump appearing to reject a handshake from the speaker and then Pelosi literally tearing apart his remarks. Trump\u2019s State of the Union ended without a single mention of impeachment, marking a moment of restraint from the unpredictable president. Trump told reporters earlier today that he was \u201cnot bitter\u201d about the impeachment and said his speech would be \u201cextraordinarily low-key,\u201d although the several House Democrats who walked out of the speech would probably disagree with that. It appears Trump is waiting to take a victory lap until tomorrow, when the Senate is expected to acquit him. Trump has now concluded his State of the Union after speaking for an hour and 18 minutes and is exiting the House chamber to compliments from Republican lawmakers. Two Democrats, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar, will soon deliver responses to the speech. In a made-for-television moment, Trump used his State of the Union to reunite a military family separated for seven months by the father\u2019s deployment. \u201cWar places a heavy burden on our Nation\u2019s extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her 2 children -- 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFor the past 7 months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the Middle East.\u201d Trump then informed Amy and her children that Townsend was present tonight, and the woman burst into tears as her husband appeared in the chamber. Fred Guttenberg, the father of a girl who was killed in the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was escorted out of the House chamber after he voiced protest to Trump\u2019s comments about gun rights. \u201cJust as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another Constitutional right that is under siege all across our country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo long as I am president I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\u201d Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, the only two members of \u201cthe Squad\u201d to attend tonight\u2019s State of the Union, have walked out of the House chamber. The pair\u2019s departure come shortly after Trump boasted about the number of conservative judges he has nominated since taking office. \u201cWe have confirmed a record number of 187 new Federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis includes two brilliant new Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d Trump then ad-libbed: \u201cAnd we have many in the pipeline.\u201d Congressman Tim Ryan, a former Democratic presidential candidate who ended his campaign in October, said he walked out of the State of the Union because he has \u201chad enough\u201d: Democrats in the House chamber groaned as Trump lamented the crime committed by undocumented immigrants, a frequent talking point for the president. \u201cTragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.\u201d But data clearly shows undocumented immigrants are much less likely to commit crime than native-born citizens. The Washington Post reported in 2018: A number of studies published in the past several months clearly illustrate the consensus. The first study, published by the libertarian Cato Institute in February, examines criminal conviction data for 2015 provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety. It found that native-born residents were much more likely to be convicted of a crime than immigrants in the country legally or illegally. At least two House Democrats have walked out of Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech as the president has criticized them on everything from prescription drug prices to reproductive rights. Trump interrupted his stream of boasts about the economy and criticisms of Democrats to award the controversial radio host Rush Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \u201cThank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country,\u201d Trump said to Limbaugh, who announced yesterday he has been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. \u201cRush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\u201d Trump then asked the first lady to present Limbaugh with the award, as Democrats in the chamber said \u201cNo!\u201d in response to the announcement. Among many other controversies, Limbaugh once referred to Sandra Fluke, a Georgetown University law student who testified to the House about the need for insurance companies to cover contraceptives, as a \u201cslut\u201d and \u201cprostitute.\u201d As Trump called on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill aimed at lowering prescription drug prices, Democratic lawmakers pushed back by chanting the name of their House-passed bill. \u201cI am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices,\u201d Trump said. \u201cGet a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay.\u201d House Democrats responded by chanting HR 3, their bill aimed at lowering prescription drug prices, which is named in honor of the late Democratic congressman Elijah Cummings. House speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to be trying to fact-check Trump in real time as she sits behind the president in the chamber. Trump took a direct shot at Democratic presidential candidates, like Bernie Sanders, who have called for a single-payer, government-run healthcare system. \u201c[A]s we work to improve Americans\u2019 healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOne hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!\u201d This diatribe prompted some outcry from the Democrats in the chamber: It should also be noted that Trump\u2019s claim of working to protect those with pre-existing conditions is not true: Trump has given a boost to Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as he seeks to reignite his campaign to bring down Venezuela\u2019s authoritarian leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Many suspect Trump is starting to give up on Guaid\u00f3, who with US backing has spent more than a year trying to unseat Maduro, so far without luck. But in his speech tonight Trump reaffirmed US support for Venezuela\u2019s \u201crighteous struggle for freedom\u201d. \u201cThe United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,\u201d Trump said, to loud applause. \u201cMaduro is an illegitimate ruler - a tyrant who brutalises his people. But Maduro\u2019s grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken,\u201d he added. Trump described Guaid\u00f3, 36, as \u201ca very brave man who carries with him the hopes and aspirations of all Venezuelans\u201d and \u201cthe true and legitimate president of Venezuela\u201d. Trump just introduced one of his State of the Union guests Charles McGee, the Tuskegee airman who also tossed the coin at the Super Bowl on Sunday. \u201cAfter more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back to a country still struggling for Civil Rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam,\u201d Trump said of McGee. \u201cOn December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee: Our Nation salutes you.\u201d Another moment of bipartisan applause came when Trump introduced Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who is a guest at the State of the Union tonight. (Read more about him here.) The first moment of a bipartisan standing ovation tonight came when Trump touted efforts to reform the criminal justice system. But Trump pointedly declined to credit Democrats when discussing the recent signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, even though Democratic lawmakers were key to the agreement\u2019s success. House Democrats were also not invited to the White House signing ceremony of the deal last week, even though administration officials have acknowledged the agreement would not have been reached without them. As Trump started delivering his annual address, the White House said secretary of the interior David Bernhardt was acting as the \u201cdesignated survivor\u201d tonight. Because a large number of senior officials gather at the Capitol for the State of the Union, the White House always designates a Cabinet member to remain behind in case disaster strikes. The designated survivor is generally one of the lower-ranking Cabinet members. Last year, then-energy secretary Rick Perry served in the role. Multiple veteran political reporters compared the atmosphere of Trump\u2019s State of the Union to that of his campaign rallies, as Republican lawmakers chanted, \u201cFour more years!\u201d in the House chamber. Although House speaker Nancy Pelosi has reportedly asked her caucus members to remain composed tonight, some Democrats audibly groaned when Trump boasted about reversing the \u201cfailed economic policies\u201d of the Obama administration. But Trump has actually added fewer jobs to the US economy per month than Barack Obama did in his second term: As Trump launched into his speech, which is built around the theme of \u201cthe great American comeback,\u201d Republicans were quick to jump to their feet to applaud the president and chant, \u201cFour more years!\u201d Meanwhile, Democrats were silent on the opposite side of the floor while Trump jumped into an address dominated by claiming credit for the strength of the US economy. Also in the audience is Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, who - with Trump\u2019s backing - has been battling to topple its authoritarian leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro since last year - so far unsuccessfully. Guaid\u00f3 will be hoping for some words of support as he tries to revive his flagging campaign to reinvigorate his crisis-stricken nation. Here is that moment when Trump appeared to reject a handshake from House speaker Nancy Pelosi as he arrived for his State of the Union address: Trump has arrived on Capitol Hill for his State of the Union address and greeted a number of lawmakers and Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts,who has presided over his impeachment trial, as he arrived. But Trump appeared to reject a handshake from House speaker Nancy Pelosi. The California Democrat seemed to extend a hand toward the president but was ignored. First lady Melania Trump has arrived and is seated next to conservative radio-show host Rush Limbaugh, who is a guest of the president tonight. Limbaugh announced yesterday that he has been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer, and Trump reportedly intends to award the controversial \u201cshock jock\u201dwith the presidential medal of freedom. House speaker Nancy Pelosi and vice president Mike Pence have taken their seats behind the president\u2019s podium, as the chamber awaits Trump\u2019s arrival. The Supreme Court justices have arrived to witness the State of the Union, although five of the nine justices are not present tonight. One of the judges present is obviously chief justice John Roberts, who has overseen the impeachment trial in the past few weeks. The House impeachment managers are sitting together at the State of the Union and have been teh center of attention for their fellow Democrats. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has also reportedly warned her caucus members to remain dignified if Trump veers into taunting them for the impeachment trial. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib is wearing a Palestinian thobe to the State of the Union as her form of protesting the State of the Union. Ilhan Omar, another member of the group of progressive congresswomen known as \u201cthe Squad,\u201d is also using her attire to protest the president\u2019s annual speech. The two other members of the Squad, congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, have said they will not attend tonight to protest Trump\u2019s policies and conduct in office. Trump has officially left the White House and is on his way to the Capitol to deliver his third State of the Union address. Nigel Farage, the prominent Brexiteer who has been a vocal supporter of Trump, said he would be attending tonight\u2019s State of the Union. Farage endorsed Trump during the 2016 election and has since interviewed the president on his conservative radio show. Nancy Pelosi has arrived for Trump\u2019s State of the Union tonight. As the House speaker, Pelosi will be seated behind Trump as he addresses the chamber, an awakward dynamic considering this is the same room where the president was impeached in December. Pelosi joined dozens of other women lawmakers in wearing white to the event, in honor of the women\u2019s suffrage movement. The State of the Union will begin in just 30 minutes, but at least 10 House Democrats, including well-known congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, will not be present because they are boycotting the event. The Hill reports: Most of the 10 Democrats \u2014 Reps. Al Green (Texas), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Maxine Waters (Calif.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), Bobby Rush (Ill.), Steve Cohen (Tenn.), Earl Blumenauer (Ore.), Hank Johnson (Ga.) and Frederica Wilson (Fla.) \u2014 have also opted against attending Trump\u2019s past annual addresses to Congress in recent years as an expression of protest against his presidency. Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley, who have been targets of Trump over the last year, both announced Tuesday that they will not be in the House chamber for the address. AOC said in a tweet earlier today that she would not allow her presence at the annual address to \u201cnormalize Trump\u2019s lawless conduct &amp; subversion of the Constitution\u201d: The White House has released some of the excerpts from Trump\u2019s speech tonight, and the bulk of them are dedicated to declaring victory on everything from trade deals to job creation. \u201cThree years ago, we launched the great American comeback,\u201d the president is expected to say. \u201cTonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. \u2026 \u201cIn just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America\u2019s destiny. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back.\u201d Some of the speech clearly seems aimed at his reelection race later this year, pledging to protect the country from \u201csocialism\u201d and deliver the best healthcare options. \u201cA good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on earth,\u201d Trump will say. \u201cWe will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. \u2026 We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare.\u201d Some Democratic presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders have called for replacing the US healthcare system with a government-run, single-payer system, and Trump is clearly eager to contrast himself with the progressive White House hopeful. White House officials have said the theme of Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech will be \u201cthe great American comeback,\u201d with the goal of touting the strength of the US economy and the appointment of conservative judges. The theme is in line with Trump\u2019s reelection slogan to \u201cKeep America Great.\u201d The president has consistently tried to convey his first term as one focused on delivering the campaign promises he made in 2016. But Democrats scoff at that assessment, insisting the US economy has succeeded despite Trump\u2019s efforts and accusing the president of failing to follow through on any of his signature campaign promises. That clash will likely be on vivid display tonight as Trump delivers his speech, followed by two Democratic responses from Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar. Two rising stars on the left -- Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and freshman congresswoman Veronica Escobar -- will deliver the Democratic responses to the State of the Union, one in English and the other in Spanish. Whitmer flipped her state\u2019s governor\u2019s mansion in 2018, and many senior Democrats pointed to her victory as a path forward for the party in the Midwest. Whitmer won her race by 10 points by appealing to more moderate voters with her promise to \u201cfix the damn roads,\u201d and some Democrats believe that sort of pragmatism will be needed to win Michigan in the November election. (Trump narrowly carried the state over Hillary Clinton in 2016.) Escobar is a first-term congresswoman from Texas, and her El Paso district, which was previously represented by former presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, has been at the center of some high-profile fights with the Trump administration. Given her city\u2019s proximity to the US-Mexican border, Escobar has repeatedly clashed with the White House over immigration policies, and she called for stricter gun laws after a shooter spewing white nationalist beliefs killed 22 people at a local Walmart in August. Put together, these two women appeal to crucial elements of the electorate whose votes Democrats will need to flip the White House in November. Good evening, live blog readers! Just one day after the disastrous Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver his annual State of the Union address to Congress as he awaits acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial. The Senate will hold its final vote on the two articles of impeachment at 4pm ET tomorrow, and Trump is virtually guaranteed to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled chamber. However, the vote did not come soon enough for the president to be able to take a victory lap in his annual speech tonight, so it will be hanging over his head as he addresses the American people in the same room where he was impeached by House Democrats less than two months ago. Trump has said he does not intend to lash out against his Democratic foes tonight, but with this president, anything is possible. Some have also wondered if he\u2019ll use the opportunity to mock Democrats for their mishandling of last night\u2019s Iowa caucuses. We\u2019ll find out soon. The speech will begin at 9pm ET, so stay tuned.",

The whole point of forming a Greens political party, for them, was that neither Liberal nor Labor were capable of responding to the ecological crisis that has been increasingly plain since at least the publication of Limits to Growth<em> </em>in 1972.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/04/adam-bandt-pledges-to-push-for-australian-green-new-deal-after-being-elected-greens-leader\">Adam Bandt pledges to push for Australian Green New Deal after being elected Greens leader</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brown, who nearly joined the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party\">Liberal</a> party as a young man, maintained this stance as Greens leader throughout his career, having symbolic meetings with Tasmanian premier Robin Gray in 1989, before deciding to back Labor premier Michael Field into minority government, and meeting with Tony Abbott in 2010, before deciding to back Julia Gillard. But it was not for show: the Greens propped up the minority Liberal government of Kate Carnell in the ACT in the 1990s, and Tony Rundle in Tasmania under then state leader Christine Milne.</p> <p>Although he was not an environmental activist, and once toyed with joining the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party\">Labor</a> party, Richard Di Natale inherited the Brown and Milne philosophy. Following Labor\u2019s defeat in 2019, with leader Anthony Albanese taking the party back to the middle, Di Natale styled the Greens as the \u201creal opposition\u201d. Di Natale was a non-ideological leader who <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/new-greens-leader-wants-to-send-a-message-to-those-with-mainstream-values-41370\">declared</a> at the beginning of his leadership in 2015 that the Greens were the \u201cnatural home of progressive, mainstream Australian voters\u201d, including small-l liberals. After Milne was criticised as being too intransigent in refusing to deal with the Abbott government, Di Natale as Greens leader took a pragmatic approach, doing outcome-driven deals with the Coalition, particularly under Malcolm Turnbull, including on multinational tax avoidance and senate voting reform.</p> <p>The drift to the centre under Di Natale \u2013 more perceived than actual \u2013 upset the left of the Greens, inspired by the rise of outwardly socialist politicians like Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Bernie Sanders in the US, as anti-austerity politics bit overseas. Radicals in NSW, Victoria and Queensland felt their party had become hostage to \u201ctree tories\u201d, or \u201cneoliberals on bikes\u201d. In Brisbane, radical Greens councillor Jonathan Sri told me his camp was very wary of career politicians, \u201cguys in suits talking down to people\u201d.</p> <p>Bandt\u2019s background is not environmental activism but hard left politics \u2013 he quit the ALP to join the socialist \u201cLeft Alliance\u201d as a student at Murdoch University, worked for years as an industrial lawyer at Slater and Gordon, and later did his doctorate on Marx and the law. He will satisfy a hunger in the Greens for a leftwing populism, to respond to the populism of the right. If that means the occasional rhetorical boil-over, so be it. In his first press conference on Tuesday, Bandt made clear he will not be doing deals with the Coalition. He will focus on working with Labor and the crossbench to achieve outcomes, and he has racked up a solid track record from his position in the lower house, brokering the deal that got the Medevac legislation up in the last parliament.</p> <p>Having boosted his vote in Melbourne over four successive elections, and seeded successful campaigns in neighbouring federal and state seats, Bandt is well-placed to restore the Greens\u2019 electoral fortunes in the party\u2019s heartland. He knows what it takes to win over a majority of voters in a lower house campaign, which is what the Greens need to do to grow \u2013 it\u2019s one of the key differences between them and the Democrats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/04/change-is-possible-australia-needs-a-green-new-deal\">Change is possible: Australia needs a Green New Deal | Adam Bandt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the past decade at least, the Greens have done well when Labor makes a meal of climate action \u2013 certainly in 2010, and very arguably in 2019.

Bandt comes from Perth, represents Melbourne and has the left credentials to appeal to the radical anti-capitalists of Sydney and Brisbane. How that sits in the Greens\u2019 spiritual heartland, Tasmania, will be interesting to watch. Bandt is a very different Greens leader to either Bob Brown or Christine Milne, both pure Tasmanian environmental activists motivated by a core philosophy that the Greens were \u201cneither left nor right but out in front\u201d \u2013 a slogan picked up by die Gr\u00fcnen in the 1980s. The whole point of forming a Greens political party, for them, was that neither Liberal nor Labor were capable of responding to the ecological crisis that has been increasingly plain since at least the publication of Limits to Growth in 1972. Brown, who nearly joined the Liberal party as a young man, maintained this stance as Greens leader throughout his career, having symbolic meetings with Tasmanian premier Robin Gray in 1989, before deciding to back Labor premier Michael Field into minority government, and meeting with Tony Abbott in 2010, before deciding to back Julia Gillard. But it was not for show: the Greens propped up the minority Liberal government of Kate Carnell in the ACT in the 1990s, and Tony Rundle in Tasmania under then state leader Christine Milne. Although he was not an environmental activist, and once toyed with joining the Labor party, Richard Di Natale inherited the Brown and Milne philosophy. Following Labor\u2019s defeat in 2019, with leader Anthony Albanese taking the party back to the middle, Di Natale styled the Greens as the \u201creal opposition\u201d. Di Natale was a non-ideological leader who declared at the beginning of his leadership in 2015 that the Greens were the \u201cnatural home of progressive, mainstream Australian voters\u201d, including small-l liberals. After Milne was criticised as being too intransigent in refusing to deal with the Abbott government, Di Natale as Greens leader took a pragmatic approach, doing outcome-driven deals with the Coalition, particularly under Malcolm Turnbull, including on multinational tax avoidance and senate voting reform. The drift to the centre under Di Natale \u2013 more perceived than actual \u2013 upset the left of the Greens, inspired by the rise of outwardly socialist politicians like Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Bernie Sanders in the US, as anti-austerity politics bit overseas. Radicals in NSW, Victoria and Queensland felt their party had become hostage to \u201ctree tories\u201d, or \u201cneoliberals on bikes\u201d. In Brisbane, radical Greens councillor Jonathan Sri told me his camp was very wary of career politicians, \u201cguys in suits talking down to people\u201d. Bandt\u2019s background is not environmental activism but hard left politics \u2013 he quit the ALP to join the socialist \u201cLeft Alliance\u201d as a student at Murdoch University, worked for years as an industrial lawyer at Slater and Gordon, and later did his doctorate on Marx and the law. He will satisfy a hunger in the Greens for a leftwing populism, to respond to the populism of the right. If that means the occasional rhetorical boil-over, so be it. In his first press conference on Tuesday, Bandt made clear he will not be doing deals with the Coalition. He will focus on working with Labor and the crossbench to achieve outcomes, and he has racked up a solid track record from his position in the lower house, brokering the deal that got the Medevac legislation up in the last parliament. Having boosted his vote in Melbourne over four successive elections, and seeded successful campaigns in neighbouring federal and state seats, Bandt is well-placed to restore the Greens\u2019 electoral fortunes in the party\u2019s heartland. He knows what it takes to win over a majority of voters in a lower house campaign, which is what the Greens need to do to grow \u2013 it\u2019s one of the key differences between them and the Democrats. For the past decade at least, the Greens have done well when Labor makes a meal of climate action \u2013 certainly in 2010, and very arguably in 2019. There are signs that Labor is going soft again under leader Albanese, with resources spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon cuddling up to the climate deniers in the Parliamentary Friends of Climate Action and spruiking coal exports, and powerful CFMMEU president Tony Maher, who regards Adani\u2019s Carmichael project to open up the Galilee Basin as just another coal mine, telling Crikey last week his union would \u201cnever come out and oppose a mine that creates jobs\u201d. We hear a lot about opponents of climate action on the right, not so much on the left. As the Greens climate spokesperson over recent years, Bandt has toured coal communities in Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. He will be about building bridges to coal workers, not shouting at them. His proposed \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2013 a term borrowed from the Justice Democrats in the US \u2013 is radical policy with its massive public investment in renewables, job guarantee and universal social services. It is unapologetically socialist \u2013 as NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge tweeted yesterday to One Nation\u2019s Malcolm Roberts \u2013 but it is also the kind of response that is commensurate with the climate emergency now staring us in the face. \u2022 Paddy Manning is the author of Inside the Greens: The True Story of the Party, the Politics and the People",

      "bodyText": "An emboldened Donald Trump bragged about the \u201cgreat American comeback\u201d in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, in a speech resembling an 81-minute re-election rally that prompted the most powerful woman in Congress to rip up her copy of the speech on national television. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said she tore up the address, which he delivered on the eve of the verdict in his impeachment trial, because she couldn\u2019t find \u201cone page with truth on it\u201d. Only the third president to be impeached in US history, Trump addressed a joint chamber of Congress on the eve of his almost certain acquittal by Republican loyalists in the US Senate. Despite the ignominy of that position, he struck an upbeat, at times euphoric, tone. \u201cIn just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America\u2019s destiny,\u201d Trump began, to shouts of \u201cFour more years!\u201d from Republicans in the chamber. \u201cWe are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back!\u201d This is not the first time a president has delivered a State of the Union speech in the midst of impeachment. Bill Clinton was still three weeks away from acquittal for lying in the Monica Lewinsky scandal when he gave his State of the Union in 1999. But Trump also faces an election, now only nine months away. As such it was no surprise that the theme of the speech was the \u201cgreat American comeback\u201d.

Why not?</h2> \n  <p>Iowa uses a complicated and arcane system called a caucus. Basically voters gather in school halls, churches, libraries and other places and divide up into groups to show their support for each candidate. There are two rounds of voting and then the proportion of votes is converted into a number of delegates. The number of delegates nationwide eventually decides who will be the candidate.<br></p> \n  <p>The results should have been known overnight when local party chiefs sent their results back to the Iowa party.</p> \n  <p>But this year a couple of changes had been made to the system which meant it basically collapsed.<br></p> \n  <p>For the first time, the two rounds of voting were set to be announced as well as the final delegate count.<br></p> \n  <p>And to help with this the party gave their local representatives a mobile app to use to report their results. Too many of them seem to have had trouble using the app, so some switched to the phone line, which became overwhelmed. This meant results could not be tallied up by the party in time.</p> \n  <h2>Why is Iowa so important?</h2> \n  <p>Iowa has gone first in the Democratic race for nearly 50 years, and the winner gets an enviable media spotlight and much-needed momentum. Since 2000 every Democrat who has won Iowa went on to win the nomination. But the system is also criticised for giving disproportionate power to a tiny state that is 90% white and largely rural and is unrepresentative of the Democratic party as a whole. This shambles won\u2019t have helped its case. </p> \n  <h2>Do the Republicans have caucuses?</h2> \n  <p>They do and Donald Trump won with 97.1% of the vote. The Republican race this year is expected to be a complete walkover for Trump - as it nearly always is for an incumbent president. <br></p> \n  <h2>How did the candidates react?</h2> \n  <p>The candidates knew that TV channels that had planned hours of election coverage had dead air to fill, and that they had a chance to set the narrative. Sanders, Buttigieg and Warren all made very confident addresses that sounded like victory speeches, although it\u2019s interesting that Joe Biden\u2019s speech sounded much less positive. He sounded more like he was trying to buck his supporters up and move on to the next race.<br></p> \n  <h2>Why is this mess so damaging?</h2> \n  <p>The winner would have preferred to have made their big speech in the full glare of the media spotlight. Now the news agenda moves on to Trump\u2019s state of the union speech tonight and the New Hampshire primary next week.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e396c4a8f08e1332473cd4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-04T13:09:42.436Z\">1.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague Julia Carrie-Wong makes a strong case that this is all a storm in a teacup:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/juliacarriew/status/1224605289703301120\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I get that everyone is enjoying the freak out, but announcing the results tomorrow seems ... fine?</p>\u2014 Julia Carrie Wong (@juliacarriew) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juliacarriew/status/1224605289703301120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 4, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/juliacarriew/status/1224605721217515520\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The app was shitty but the good news is... everyone can stop using the app? <br><br>The app didn\u2019t record and change or lose vote totals.

Instead, even if he does end up being certified as the winner (and he may still), he\u2019ll have missed his big moment as the news agenda rushes on to Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address and next week\u2019s primaries in New Hampshire. Many of his more suspicious supporters \u2013 who accused the Democratic party of rigging the race against him in 2016 \u2013 may see this as no accident. </p> \n  <h2>Joe Biden</h2> \n  <p>Of the big four in the Iowa race, the former vice-president gave the most downbeat speech, suggesting his campaign knows he under-performed in Iowa. If that is confirmed by the final results, and if Sanders wins big in New Hampshire next week, Biden could find supporters and donors losing confidence in him well before what are likely to be strong performances in South Carolina on 29 February and on Super Tuesday on 3 March. His candidacy is based on the idea that he is the most electable candidate \u2013 if that suddenly seems in doubt, he could be seriously hobbled. </p> \n  <h2>Winners</h2> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78a898fdeafb4a9a9d7d6ff14249a61594873988\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78a898fdeafb4a9a9d7d6ff14249a61594873988/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pete Buttigieg campaigning in Des Moines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pete Buttigieg campaigning in Des Moines.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barcroft Media/Barcroft Media via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <h2>Pete Buttigieg</h2> \n  <p>The small-town centrist mayor from nearby Indiana has always hung his hopes on a strong showing in Iowa and his speech last night \u2013 \u201cby all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious\u201d \u2013 and bullish predictions of a win suggest he feels confident he has got what he wanted. If Biden does collapse and Sanders maintains his current strength, Buttigieg could make a case that the centrist Democratic establishment should now swing behind him. </p> \n  <h2>Michael Bloomberg</h2> \n  <p>The billionaire former mayor of New York will be making exactly that argument himself once he enters the race on Super Tuesday. He will be delighted that the ineffable momentum conferred on the winner of Iowa \u2013 a state Bloomberg decided to skip \u2013 will this year be blunted. Early voting in California \u2013 the largest state in the US, which he has been blanketing with advertising \u2013 began <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/californias-early-voting-kickoff-overlaps-iowa-caucuses/story?id=68696024\">yesterday</a>, and Bloomberg will feel vindicated in keeping his focus there. But if the centrist \u201clane\u201d is now shaping up to be a serious fight between Biden, Bloomberg and Buttigieg, that may split the moderate vote and in the end benefit Sanders.</p> \n  <h2>Donald Trump</h2> \n  <p>The president\u2019s Twitter feed has been quiet so far this morning but his campaign manager Brad Parscale was quick to channel his master\u2019s voice with a vivid mixed metaphor: \u201cDemocrats are stewing in a caucus mess of their own creation with the sloppiest train wreck in history.\u201d Parscale went on to sow doubts about \u201cthe fairness of the process\u201d \u2013 encouraging those suspicious Sanders supporters \u2013 and ask: \u201cAnd these are the people who want to run our entire healthcare system?\u201d Of course, no Democratic candidate is suggesting their own party run the US health system, but the Trump campaign has never let the facts get in the way of - well, anything much. Reports of low turnout in the Iowa race - if confirmed - will also be seized upon by Trump, whose strategy depends upon enthusing his base more than the Democrats can excite theirs. </p> \n  <h2>Unclear</h2> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd84b83828fb27d51ca55ca196e247989f4d83ba\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd84b83828fb27d51ca55ca196e247989f4d83ba/1126_214_1355_814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Klobuchar (left) and Elizabeth Warren.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Klobuchar (left) and Elizabeth Warren.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Randall Hill/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <h2>Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar</h2> \n  <p><br>Both senators gave confident speeches last night, but until the results are in it\u2019s unclear exactly how the chips will fall for them.

There have long been complaints that allowing Iowa to go first in the primary race gives too much weight to a small, mostly white, largely rural state that does not represent the demographics of the Democratic party or the US.</p> \n  <p>Perhaps sensing that they needed to seize the moment even if the moment was a bit unclear, leftwing senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and centrist former mayor Pete Buttigieg delivered what sounded like victory speeches, with both Sanders\u2019 and Buttigieg\u2019s campaigns <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/us/politics/iowa-caucuses.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">also claiming</a> that their local representatives had seen partial results that showed their candidate ahead. </p> \n  <p>By contrast Joe Biden - the former vice-president to Barack Obama who is probably still the frontrunner in the national Democratic race, just about - delivered an address that sounded like it was designed to buck up supporters after a disappointing night. \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk out of here with our share of delegates,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what it is yet, but we feel good about where we are. So it\u2019s on to New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and well beyond.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Trump\u2019s campaign revelled in the chaos. \u201cDemocrats are stewing in a caucus mess of their own creation with the sloppiest train wreck in history,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/brad-parscale-trump-social-media-rasputin-campaign-manager\">Brad Parscale</a>, Trump 2020 campaign manager. \u201cIt would be natural for people to doubt the fairness of the process. And these are the people who want to run our entire healthcare system?\u201d</p> \n  <p>So what happened? This was the first year Iowans had to report three tallies in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/03/iowa-caucuses-2020-elections-candidates\">their complex voting system</a>, and a new mobile app was introduced to help them do it. Some local representatives meant to use the app to report the numbers seemed to find it difficult to use, and tried to use a telephone hotline instead, meaning it became too busy. That all seems to have slowed the whole process down and meant accurate overall results cannot yet be tallied.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion,\u201d said Mandy McClure, the Iowa party\u2019s communications director. \u201cThe underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.\u201d</p> \n  <p>By the way, the Republicans also held caucuses in Iowa yesterday.

      "bodyText": "With 71% of precincts reporting, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders appear to lead the pack. Until the complete results are announced, it\u2019s unclear how Iowa\u2019s 41 delegates will be allotted among the winners. The party initially released results from 62% of precincts, before tricking out a few more figures just before late on Tuesday night. Right now, Buttigieg is in the lead with 26.8% of the state delegates, Bernie Sanders has 25.2%, Elizabeth Warren has 18.4% and Joe Biden: has 15.5%. That ordering could change once the remaining precincts report results. Sanders secured the popular vote, with Buttigieg and Warren trailing slightly behind in that metric. It\u2019s unclear when we\u2019ll learn the full results from the Iowa caucuses. The delay is being blamed, in part, on a smartphone app for reporting results that was introduced just weeks before the election. The chairman of the Democratic National Committee has insisted that those who designed the app \u201cprovide absolute transparent accounting of what went wrong\u201d and reassured supporters that the same technology won\u2019t be used in upcoming primaries. After a poor showing in Iowa, the Biden campaign\u2019s message that he\u2019s the most electable candidate has come into question. A reminder as votes are being tallied \u2013 you can track all the results in Iowa, where Pete Buttigieg currently has a narrow lead over Bernie Sanders with 62.27% of precincts reporting, via the Guardian\u2019s live results tracker here ... As the final results in Iowa remain elusive, CNN reports that the Democratic National Committee is taking \u201can increasingly active role\u201d in chasing up data from the locations across the state where caucuses were held. From CNN: The Democratic National Committee is taking an increasingly active role in the process of tracking down the data from the nearly 1,700 caucus sites across Iowa, including checking data sent to the Iowa Democratic Party via their failed app, two sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. A team of roughly a dozen party officials are currently in Iowa working with the state party to report out the results of last night\u2019s caucuses, which were delayed due to widespread reporting issues between the Iowa precincts and the Iowa Democratic Party. The team from the DNC includes staffers tracking online disinformation, we well as data and communications staff, one source said. DNC Chair Tom Perez is not in Iowa, according to a DNC aide, but has been getting updates from the team of the ground. The DNC officials are also chasing down data from individual caucus chairs from precincts across the state, hoping to track down precincts that had not reported their results. A spokeswoman for the Iowa Democratic Party said that the DNC was \u201cchasing precinct results,\u201d something that they described as \u201csomething that happens after every caucus.\u201d After his poor showing in the initial results from Iowa, Joe Biden asked supporters in New Hampshire to \u201crocket\u201d him back to the top. Biden\u2019s campaign has touted his electability. Although Iowa ultimately has few delegates to hand out, the fact that Biden lagged behind Buttigieg, the other leading moderate in the primaries, could undercut his argument that voters view him as a safe bet. The head of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez demanded that Shadow, the company that designed the app that has been blamed for the delay in reporting caucus results, \u201cprovide absolute transparent accounting of what went wrong\u201d. The app used in Iowa will not be used in Nevada, or in any other primaries, Perez said in a statement. \u201cAs frustrating as the last 24 hours have been, let us not lose sight of our ultimate goal: to defeat Donald Trump, to take back our democracy, and to improve the lives of millions by electing Democrats up and down the ballot,\u201d he added. Donald Trump is expected to deliver his State of the Union speech at 9pm ET. The Guardian will have live updates as the president addresses the nation, from the same room where Congress voted to impeach him, on the eve of the final vote in his Senate trial. Tom Steyer, who earned 0.3% of the state delegates in Iowa, per the partial results, won over the only voter in one particular precinct. Judging by the response to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s early lead in some quarters, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the Iowa race was a done deal. However, only 62% of the results have so far been released, which has led to some light-hearted jabs at those jumping to conclusions. Speaking to supporters in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders touted his popular vote lead in Iowa. \u201cWhere we are is at an unprecedented moment in American history,\u201d he said. I\u2019m very proud to tell you that last night in Iowa we received more votes on the first and second round than any other candidate\u201d \u201cFor some reason in Iowa, they\u2019re having a little bit of trouble counting votes,\u201d he added, predicting he\u2019ll win in New Hampshire. It\u2019s unclear when we\u2019ll hear the results from the remaining precincts. One key area to watch is Polk county, which includes populous Des Moines and its suburbs, where nearly half the precincts have not been counted. Once all the precincts have reported results, the ordering of the leading candidates could change. Because Iowa\u2019s 41 pledged delegates are distributed proportionally, as it is Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders would be allocated the same number. According to the AP, which as assigned 24 of the 41 pledged delegates based on the results reported so far, 10 would go to Buttigieg, 10 to Sanders and 4 to Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren says she\u2019s \u2018so proud\u2019 of her performance in Iowa. In a fundraising email to supporters, Joe Biden\u2019s campaign brushed off his poor showing in Iowa. \u201cWe fought hard in Iowa. Now, we\u2019re well-positioned to make our case to the rest of the country,\u201d the email reads. \u201cBut there\u2019s no time to rest. We need to be prepared to take this campaign to New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and beyond. And meanwhile, Trump is attacking me non-stop.\u201d Biden ranked fourth among his competitors, with 62% of precincts responding. Stacey Abrams, who launched a nationwide voting rights campaign last year after narrowly losing a campaign for Georgia governor, has said issues with reporting results in Iowa are just one of the problems plaguing the state\u2019s primary elections. As the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reported the caucus system in Iowa excludes many voters: The physical and legal barriers built into the structure of the caucuses leave out large swaths of the population, whether they are disabled, work long hours, or were once convicted of a crime... Since 2016, advocates have been pushing the Iowa Democratic party to address obstacles like transportation, navigating crowded spaces and seating that people with disabilities face to caucusing. The party has introduced some solutions \u2013 like allowing some groups to hold satellite caucuses in their homes or accessible locales. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it easier for Iowans to request accommodations, get in the room faster, and caucus at a site that\u2019s more convenient to them,\u201d said Mandy McClure, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Democratic party, in a statement. \u201cExpanding participation has been at the heart of all of these changes.\u201d But many advocates say the party\u2019s approach has been abysmal, noting that a staffer handling disability outreach wasn\u2019t hired until January. The chaos in Iowa has been blamed, at least in part on a smartphone app introduced just weeks before the election to report results. The Guardian\u2019s Kari Paul reports: A \u201ccoding issue\u201d caused only partial data to be reported out by the 1,700 caucus sites throughout Iowa. What\u2019s more, many caucuses take place in rural areas of Iowa where cellphone coverage is less reliable, compounding issues, said Dough Schmidt, a professor of computer science at Vanderbilt. \u201cThese things were clearly not taken to account when building the app and the app was clearly not tested in more chaotic environments,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should serve as a cautionary warning that there are some reasons we have done elections on paper for hundreds of years.\u201d Bernie Sanders\u2019 adviser Jeff Weaver has indicated he\u2019s \u2018gratified\u2019 with initial results: Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Pete Buttigieg says the campaign\u2019s website is getting record traffic. Iowans react to delays: \u2018I think it\u2019s a shame\u2019 Some Iowans expressed frustration on Tuesday that the state Democratic party had bungled its moment in the national spotlight after the party delayed releasing the results of the caucuses because of a technical glitch. \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame. Everybody\u2019s got their eye on Iowa to be first and then they got everything all screwed up,\u201d said Joe Pendergrass, 52, as he waited for the bus in the East Village neighborhood of Des Moines. Pendergrass likened the episode to the 2000 Florida election debacle and said it might be a similar case where no one would ever be certain who had won. As the country waited for the Iowa Democratic party to release partial caucus results on Tuesday, Des Moines was cold and quiet. Many of the candidates left in the early hours Tuesday morning to go directly to New Hampshire, which will hold its primary on 11 February. Reporters left for the airport to leave Des Moines, which has been jam-packed the last few days. In RAYGUN, a store that sells tongue-in-cheek goods, some people were stocking up on last-minute souvenirs of their time here. Taking a cigarette break downtown, Scott Day, 28, said he was surprised the party had botched the results. \u201cI think it was actually pretty dumb. They\u2019ve done it for so many years and accurately gotten a result after that,\u201d he said. Eating lunch at a food court, another woman, who declined to give her name, said she wasn\u2019t surprised the new technology Democrats were using had caused a snafu. The entire episode, she said, was \u201ckind of funny\u201d. \u201cIf I was a Democrat it would probably bother me,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re not complete, but results are in from a majority of precincts, and they show our campaign in first place,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg, grinning widely as he addressed supporters in New Hampshire. \u201cThis is what we have been working more than a year to convince our fellow Americans: that a new and better vision can bring about a new and better day. Buttigieg currently hold a narrow lead over Bernie Sanders. Depending on how close the final results are, the Indiana mayor may end up with just one or two more of Iowa\u2019s 41 delegates than his closest competitors. While it could still all change, Pete Buttigieg\u2019s early lead in the Iowa caucuses \u2013 and Joe Biden\u2019s position in fourth \u2013 has come as a surprise to many. Writing on Twitter, the polling expert Dave Wasserman thinks that the result isn\u2019t quite as bad for Biden as it looks. Meanwhile, the potentially historic nature of Buttigieg\u2019s lead hasn\u2019t been lost on some: The irony of Buttigieg\u2019s electoral lead despite being behind in the popular vote has also been highlighted by the Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel: And the New Republic\u2019s Kate Aronoff is finding the result difficult to process entirely Again, these initial results could change once all the totals are tallied up. And ultimately, Iowa awards a total of 41 delegates \u2013 representing only 1% of the national total. Read the Guardian\u2019s full report on the caucus chaos: Although Pete Buttigieg leads the caucus results, Bernie Sanders is leading the popular vote count, at 28,220 over Buttigieg\u2019s 27,030. Elizabeth Warren collected 22,254 votes and Joe Biden has 14,176, with 62% of precincts reporting. In terms of percentages, here\u2019s how the popular vote counts break down: Sanders: 27% Buttigieg: 25% Warren: 21% Biden: 13% Klobuchar: 13% The popular vote represents the raw data not converted into state delegate equivalents. Pete Buttigieg is on top, with a narrow lead over his 2020 competitors, according to the state Democrats, who have released partial results after an extended delay. These results represent 62% of precincts. Here\u2019s a breakdown: Pete Buttigieg: 26.9% of the state delegates Bernie Sanders: 25.1% Elizabeth Warren: 18.3% Joe Biden: 15.6% Amy Klobuchar: 12.6% The results could change after results from the remaining precincts are announced. \u201cA thorough, transparent and independent examination of what happened yesterday will follow,\u201d said the Iowa Democratic chair, Troy Price, after apologizing for the extended delay. In a few minutes, the party will reveal the results from 62% of precincts reporting in the Iowa caucuses. \u201cWe have been working day and night to make sure that these results are accurate,\u201d Price said. Although there have been delays due to \u201ca coding error\u201d in the app the state used to report results, he said \u201cthe raw data is secure\u201d. Price did not respond to repeated questions from the press about when the party will be able to report 100% of the results. State Democrats are expected to announce partial results from Iowa in about 10 minutes. Shadow Inc. the company behind the app that has been blamed for the extended delay in reporting results, has apologized. As 2020 Democrats looking to replace Donald Trump anxiously await the first results out of Iowa, back at the capitol, senators are continuing to weigh whether to remove the president from office. Moments ago, Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine, said she intends to acquit Trump, cutting down Democrats\u2019 wish for a bipartisan impeachment. \u201cI do not believe that the House has met its burden of showing that the president\u2019s conduct, however flawed, warrants the extreme step of immediate removal from office, nor does the record support the assertion by the House managers that the president must not remain in office one moment longer,\u201d Collins said, speaking on the Senate floor. Echoing other moderate Republican senators, Collins said \u201cit was wrong for [Trump] to ask a foreign country to investigate a political rival\u201d but she believes the president\u2019s actions didn\u2019t rise to the threshold of impeachment. Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, is the last remaining hope for Democrats pushing for a bipartisan impeachment. At some point soon, Iowa\u2019s Democratic Party is supposed to release a \u201cmajority\u201d of the caucus results. Bernie Sanders campaign released numbers, at 60% reporting, showing he had a \u201ccomfortable lead.\u201d Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign said they planned to release their own numbers as well. Meanwhile, before a final vote scheduled for Wednesday afternoon on whether to convict Donald Trump, senators began a round of speeches on how they think the third presidential impeachment trial in US history should end. One thing we know about Iowa is that the turnout is on pace with 2016 \u2013 which is a concerning indicator for Democrats hoping opposition to Trump would bring out voters in force. My colleague Maanvi Singh will be taking over the blog, and will be updating you shortly on the initial results from Iowa. Billionaire Mike Bloomberg authorized his presidential campaign to double the amount they are spending on television, according to multiple reports citing anonymous aides to the former New York City mayor. CNN said Bloomberg has already spent more than $300 million on advertising, according to data compiled by Kantar Media/CMAG. An aide told CNN that the campaign will \u201cimmediately increase ad spending in our current markets as well as add new markets, with our total gross ratings points doubling, from 1,200 to 2,400.\u201d These reports emerged as chaos reigns in the rest of the Democratic field, where candidates are waiting to hear who won the Iowa caucus and refocusing their campaigns in New Hampshire. Bloomberg is bypassing both those places to focus on states with more delegates available, specifically those that hold their primaries on March 3 aka Super Tuesday. Joe Biden was heckled at campaign event in New Hampshire today by protestors. After they quieted down, Biden said he and his campaign felt they did well at the Iowa caucuses, the results of which haven\u2019t been announced. \u201cWe think we\u2019re going to come out of there really doing well, but be careful what you say, because it\u2019s not done yet,\u201d Biden said. In New Hampshire, Biden also criticized his 2020 rival Bernie Sanders over Medicare for All, saying the Vermont senator has talked about single-payer health care for \u201c30 years now.\u201d \u201cHasn\u2019t moved it an inch,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going anywhere now,\u201d Biden said of Medicare for All. \u201cThe speaker of the House isn\u2019t for it. Most Democrats in Congress are not for it. So how\u2019s it going to pass? How\u2019s it going to move? How does it get done? You can\u2019t give a speech about it. It actually has to get done.\u201d Two other Democratic representatives have joined the SOTU boycott. Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusetts, issued a statement explaining her decision: The occupant of the White House incessantly stokes fear in people of color, women, healthcare providers, LGBTQ+ communities, low-income families, and many more. He does not embody the principles, the responsibility, the grace, nor the integrity that is required of the President of the United States. The State of the Union is hurting because of the occupant of the White House, who consistently demonstrates contempt for the American people, contempt for Congress, and contempt for our constitution - strong-arming a sham impeachment trial in the Senate. This presidency is not legitimate. On the eve of Senate Republicans covering up transgressions and spreading misinformation, I cannot in good conscience attend a sham State of the Union when I have seen firsthand the damage Donald J. Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies have inflicted on those I love and those I represent. And representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, said she won\u2019t be attending because she doesn\u2019t want to normalize Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. The White House released its list of his 11 guests for tonight\u2019s State of the Union address. The guests include the wife and son of Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake, who was killed while serving his second tour of duty in Iraq; Paul Morrow, a US Army veteran who is opening a new concrete plant in Alabama; and Ivan Simonovis, a former police chief in Caracas, Venezuela. Other guests, which often reflect the issues the president will touch on, include a top Border patrol agent and a mother and her baby who was born at 21 weeks and six days. We also know some Congresspeople intentionally won\u2019t be there. At least five Democratic representatives are boycotting the speech: Al Green, of Texas; Steve Cohen, of Tennessee; Earl Blumenauer, of Oregon; Hank Johnson, of Georgia; and Frederica Wilson, of Florida. One thing we know about Iowa is that the turnout numbers are on pace with 2016 \u2013 which is a concerning indicator for Democrats hoping opposition to Trump would bring out voters in force. CNN senior writer and analyst, Harry Enten, dug deep into the history of Iowa caucus turnout and how it reflects general election trends: Some of the lower Democratic turnout in the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses could be because caucusgoers were overwhelmed by the large number of candidates (though there were plenty in 2008). Some of it could be that Iowa is becoming more Republican. Additionally, impeachment has caused the primary season to not dominate the headlines as it has in past years. But we can look to other indicators to suggest enthusiasm is down for Democrats. Look at the special elections compared to the Democratic baseline, for example. State legislative and congressional special election performance has correlated well with general election success over the last few decades. Oftentimes, that success is tied to advantages in turnout. With all the attention on Iowa and New Hampshire, it is easy to forget that in Washington DC, senators are still talking impeachment. National affairs correspondent, Tom McCarthy, has kept a watchful eye on the hearings and reports: One Republican who had been closely watched as a possible swing vote, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, ultimately voted with her caucus on the witnesses question. She said on Monday evening she would do so again on Wednesday. In a speech on a virtually empty Senate floor, Murkowski called Donald Trump\u2019s conduct \u201cshameful and wrong\u201d but saved her hottest fire for Congress itself. \u201cThe House failed in its responsibilities and the Senate \u2013 the Senate should be ashamed by the rank partisanship that has been on display here,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cSo many in this chamber share my sadness for the present state of our institutions. It\u2019s my hope that we\u2019ve finally found bottom here.\u201d Candidates move on to New Hampshire Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2020 campaign has released its own Iowa caucus results, which show the Vermont senator with \u201ca comfortable lead\u201d with 60% of the vote in. The campaign said their results reflect data sent to it by \u201cprecinct captains around the state.\u201d The Sanders campaign results, which, again, they say reflect 60% of the votes, show: First round Sanders 29.08% Buttigieg 21.63% Warren 19.51% Klobuchar 12.27% Biden 12.04% After realignment Sanders 29.4% Buttigieg 24.87% Warren 20.65% Biden 12.92% Klobuchar 11.18% A representative for Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign said it is also collecting caucus data on its own and plans to release the findings today. We still don\u2019t know the results of the Iowa caucus. While we wait, the candidates are moving on to New Hampshire, where the primary takes place next week. The chair of the Iowa Democratic party (IDP), Troy Price, said the \u201cmajority\u201d of the caucus results would be released by 4pm CT/5pm ET. Price said of calculating the caucus results: \u201cWhile our plan is to release the results as soon as possible today, our ultimate goal is to ensure that the integrity and accuracy of the process continues to be upheld.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating is the highest it\u2019s been in three years, per Gallup. The Jan 16 to 29 poll found Trump has a 49% approval rating. The Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) just held a conference call for the presidential campaigns to update them on the delayed Iowa caucus results. It was heated. Meanwhile, Nevada\u2019s Democratic party has clarified it will not use the same app that caused problems in Iowa for its caucuses later this month. \u201cNV Dems can confidently say that what happened in the Iowa caucus last night will not happen in Nevada on February 22nd,\u201d the party said in a statement. \u201cWe will not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus.\u201d Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) leader, Troy Price, has informed the presidential campaigns that the majority of the Iowa caucus results will be in by 4pm CT/5pm ET. Some are suggesting US journalists should emulate their British counterparts after reports that CNN anchors are being barred from an annual presidential lunch before tonight\u2019s State of the Union. It is traditional for presidents to invite anchors from the major television networks to an off-the-record lunch before the address to better understand where the president is at before his speech. But CNN\u2019s anchors are reportedly being blocked from the lunch. This has drawn comparisons to UK political journalists boycotting a briefing yesterday at Downing Street, the offices of prime minister Boris Johnson. After Johnson\u2019s senior communications adviser tried to exclude reporters from the official briefing, the reporters who were still allowed in refused to attend in solidarity with their counterparts. \u201cIowa is supposed to be the place lots of candidates go to die,\u201d Democratic strategist Jim Messina told the Guardian. \u201cNow, it seems like almost everyone is getting a ticket to ride to New Hampshire. Folks like [Andrew] Yang, [Tom] Steyer and maybe [Amy] Klobuchar all should have and would have had to get out today. Now they all can soldier on.\u201d Guardian senior political reporter, Daniel Strauss, has the latest on the chaos in Iowa. Notably, early entrance polling in Iowa suggested a dip in participation among first-time voters, a troubling sign for Democrats who expected record turnout fueled by a hunger to oust Donald Trump. On Tuesday morning, veteran strategists were still fretting over the Iowa chaos. \u201cIowa is making my home state of Florida look like a model of vote-counting efficiency,\u201d said Steve Schale, executive director of the pro-Biden Unite the Country Super Pac. \u201cThis is a complete and total \u2018shibacle\u2019. It\u2019s hard to have a lot of confidence right now in any result. Democratic hopeful Mike Bloomberg continues to troll Donald Trump. Today, Bloomberg released a new campaign ad tied to tonight\u2019s State of the Union address. As unflattering images of Trump appear on screen, a dramatic voice reads: The real state of the union: a nation divided by an angry, out of control president. A White House beset by lies, chaos and corruption. An administration that has failed the American people. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Next year we can have a leader who brings people together, solves problems and gets results. Mike Bloomberg will get it done. After all those months of campaigning, supporters and volunteers \u2013 some of whom gave up jobs and traveled across the country to back their candidate \u2013 are not happy today. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, quite honestly,\u201d said Musa Jamshed, a precinct captain for Andrew Yang in Iowa City. Jamshed, 23, quit his tech job in San Francisco to campaign in Iowa. Yang had been polling in sixth place in the state, but was backed by thousands of enthusiastic supporters \u2013 the \u201cYang Gang\u201d\u2013 who were hoping to defy expectations. \u201cAfter all the blood, sweat and tears, I just want to know how much we over performed by,\u201d Jamshed said. Yang, a tech entrepreneur, has been critical of the government for failing to make best use of technological advances. \u201cIt might be helpful to have a President and government that understand technology so this sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Yang tweeted on Monday night. \u201c[The ongoing Iowa debacle] does not reassure the Yang Gang, whose primary concern is that the government is decades behind on technology,\u201d Jamshed said. \u201cIt is also disturbing from the perspective of having a fair democratic process.\u201d As the words disaster, chaos and fakakta blare across social media to describe the Iowa caucus, so has a reminder that it\u2019s not the first time those words have been linked to the first-in-the-nation caucus. Mitt Romney was declared the winner for the Republicans in the 2012 Iowa caucus, but two weeks later, the state\u2019s Republican party said a recount of the votes showed the winner was actually Rick Santorum. The incident was followed by a chaotic caucus in Nevada the next month, when Romney was declared the winner before votes for the state\u2019s most populous county had been tallied. Together, the incidents prompted a headline in Politico: \u201cCaucus system under fire.\u201d In 2016, there were frustrations and disappointment about how Democrats in Iowa declared Hillary Clinton the victor, despite a messy, complicated process in a tight race with Bernie Sanders. More bad news for Democrats. Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating is the highest it\u2019s been in three years, per Gallup. The Jan 16 to 29 poll found Trump has a 49% approval rating. The bulk of this is from the 94% of Republicans who approve of his work. He also got a boost from a 42% approval rating among independents, an increase of five points. Democratic approval shrunk from 10% to 7%. Trump also has the highest approval for his handling of the economy (63%) of any president since George W Bush had high approval ratings in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Gallup\u2019s short analysis of its findings: Whether the rise in Trump\u2019s approval rating and the Republican Party\u2019s image is being driven by a backlash against impeachment, the strong economy or other factors may become clearer in the near future. If it is mostly impeachment-based, his approval rating may revert quickly back to pre-impeachment levels, as it did for Clinton. Within two months of his acquittal in February 1999, Clinton\u2019s approval rating returned to where it was before he was impeached, as did the Democratic Party\u2019s advantage in party identification and leaning. If Trump\u2019s higher approval rating is being driven by Americans giving him credit for improvements in the economy, his support may increase over the course of the year, as it did for Ronald Reagan in 1984, Clinton in 1996 and Barack Obama in 2012. All of those recent presidents held office during periods of sustained economic improvement and were re-elected with job approval ratings of better than 50%. The chair of the Iowa Democratic party (IDP), Troy Price, just released a statement outlining how the caucus process collapsed last night. \u201cWe have every indication that our systems were secure and there was not a cyber security intrusion,\u201d Price said. \u201cIn preparation for the caucuses, our systems were tested by independent cybersecurity consultants.\u201d Price said as results came in, the IDP\u2019s accuracy check showed inconsistencies with reports. \u201cThe underlying cause of these inconsistencies was not immediately clear, and required investigation, which took time,\u201d Price said. He said the IDP then used existing back-up measures and entered the data manually. As part of our investigation, we determined with certainty that the underlying data collected via the app was sound. While the app was recording data accurately, it was reporting out only partial data. We have determined that this was due to a coding issue in the reporting system. The issue was identified and fixed. The application\u2019s reporting issue did not impact the ability of precinct chairs to report data accurately. Because of the required paper documentation, we have been able to verify that the data recorded in the app and used to calculate State Delegate Equivalents is valid and accurate. Precinct level results are still being reported to the IDP. While our plan is to release the results as soon as possible today, our ultimate goal is to ensure that the integrity and accuracy of the process continues to be upheld. The New York Times has been talking to \u201cprecinct chairs\u201d - the local volunteers who were meant to send in the results from their area of Iowa last night. They list a catalogue of errors with the app recording and transmitting the results, leading them to try to use the overloaded telephone helpline. Others simply decided not to use the app, according to the NYT. \u201cI have 75-year-old caucus chairs who are sitting here going, \u2018I\u2019m just going to call that in,\u2019\u201d said Sarah Truitt, co-chair of the Clarke County Democrats. \u201cThis was too many new things to learn for a lot of people. Not everybody that goes to the caucus is a 20-year-old college kid.\u201d Trump is clearly keeping a keen eye on proceedings, retweeting posts from stats guru Nate Silver, Fox News journalist Bret Baier, and the Daily Mail US. And a suggestion from NBC News\u2019 Steve Kornacki that this mess could help put an end to Iowa\u2019s position as the first state to vote in the primaries prompted this response from the president: For those just waking up, here\u2019s a quick Q&amp;A. What just happened? The first state to vote for a Democratic candidate was Iowa, on Monday, and the party still hasn\u2019t been able to announce the results. Yikes. Why not? Iowa uses a complicated and arcane system called a caucus. Basically voters gather in school halls, churches, libraries and other places and divide up into groups to show their support for each candidate. There are two rounds of voting and then the proportion of votes is converted into a number of delegates. The number of delegates nationwide eventually decides who will be the candidate. The results should have been known overnight when local party chiefs sent their results back to the Iowa party. But this year a couple of changes had been made to the system which meant it basically collapsed. For the first time, the two rounds of voting were set to be announced as well as the final delegate count. And to help with this the party gave their local representatives a mobile app to use to report their results. Too many of them seem to have had trouble using the app, so some switched to the phone line, which became overwhelmed. This meant results could not be tallied up by the party in time. Why is Iowa so important? Iowa has gone first in the Democratic race for nearly 50 years, and the winner gets an enviable media spotlight and much-needed momentum. Since 2000 every Democrat who has won Iowa went on to win the nomination. But the system is also criticised for giving disproportionate power to a tiny state that is 90% white and largely rural and is unrepresentative of the Democratic party as a whole. This shambles won\u2019t have helped its case. Do the Republicans have caucuses? They do and Donald Trump won with 97.1% of the vote. The Republican race this year is expected to be a complete walkover for Trump - as it nearly always is for an incumbent president. How did the candidates react? The candidates knew that TV channels that had planned hours of election coverage had dead air to fill, and that they had a chance to set the narrative. Sanders, Buttigieg and Warren all made very confident addresses that sounded like victory speeches, although it\u2019s interesting that Joe Biden\u2019s speech sounded much less positive. He sounded more like he was trying to buck his supporters up and move on to the next race. Why is this mess so damaging? The winner would have preferred to have made their big speech in the full glare of the media spotlight. Now the news agenda moves on to Trump\u2019s state of the union speech tonight and the New Hampshire primary next week. My colleague Julia Carrie-Wong makes a strong case that this is all a storm in a teacup: In the absence of actual results, Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign is continuing to try to set the narrative. It released a memo detailing its precinct-level data from Iowa, which according to the Washington Post shows Buttigieg having won 25% support on the second count, \u201cnumbers the campaign believes mean Buttigieg won the night\u201d. Whether or not those figures are borne out by the final results remains to be seen. Donald Trump has given his verdict on the Iowa controversy, which he calls an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d. (HealthCare.gov is the federal government\u2019s health insurance exchange website, introduced as part of Barack Obama\u2019s health reforms which brought millions of people into the health-insurance system. A study in 2014 found it had cost more than $2bn to set up, which is a lot, although it\u2019s not $5bn.) The shambles in Iowa means we\u2019re all talking about voting chaos instead of the winning candidate. So - with the proviso that this may all change once we have some actual results - who can we say are the initial winners and losers from this mess? Losers Bernie Sanders The leftwing senator has been threatening to overtake Joe Biden as the frontrunner in the Democratic race, and victory in Iowa \u2013 which had seemed increasingly likely recently \u2013 would have given that process crucial momentum, allowing him to firmly take the national spotlight in the first race of the year. Instead, even if he does end up being certified as the winner (and he may still), he\u2019ll have missed his big moment as the news agenda rushes on to Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address and next week\u2019s primaries in New Hampshire. Many of his more suspicious supporters \u2013 who accused the Democratic party of rigging the race against him in 2016 \u2013 may see this as no accident. Joe Biden Of the big four in the Iowa race, the former vice-president gave the most downbeat speech, suggesting his campaign knows he under-performed in Iowa. If that is confirmed by the final results, and if Sanders wins big in New Hampshire next week, Biden could find supporters and donors losing confidence in him well before what are likely to be strong performances in South Carolina on 29 February and on Super Tuesday on 3 March. His candidacy is based on the idea that he is the most electable candidate \u2013 if that suddenly seems in doubt, he could be seriously hobbled. Winners Pete Buttigieg The small-town centrist mayor from nearby Indiana has always hung his hopes on a strong showing in Iowa and his speech last night \u2013 \u201cby all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious\u201d \u2013 and bullish predictions of a win suggest he feels confident he has got what he wanted. If Biden does collapse and Sanders maintains his current strength, Buttigieg could make a case that the centrist Democratic establishment should now swing behind him. Michael Bloomberg The billionaire former mayor of New York will be making exactly that argument himself once he enters the race on Super Tuesday. He will be delighted that the ineffable momentum conferred on the winner of Iowa \u2013 a state Bloomberg decided to skip \u2013 will this year be blunted. Early voting in California \u2013 the largest state in the US, which he has been blanketing with advertising \u2013 began yesterday, and Bloomberg will feel vindicated in keeping his focus there. But if the centrist \u201clane\u201d is now shaping up to be a serious fight between Biden, Bloomberg and Buttigieg, that may split the moderate vote and in the end benefit Sanders. Donald Trump The president\u2019s Twitter feed has been quiet so far this morning but his campaign manager Brad Parscale was quick to channel his master\u2019s voice with a vivid mixed metaphor: \u201cDemocrats are stewing in a caucus mess of their own creation with the sloppiest train wreck in history.\u201d Parscale went on to sow doubts about \u201cthe fairness of the process\u201d \u2013 encouraging those suspicious Sanders supporters \u2013 and ask: \u201cAnd these are the people who want to run our entire healthcare system?\u201d Of course, no Democratic candidate is suggesting their own party run the US health system, but the Trump campaign has never let the facts get in the way of - well, anything much. Reports of low turnout in the Iowa race - if confirmed - will also be seized upon by Trump, whose strategy depends upon enthusing his base more than the Democrats can excite theirs. Unclear Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar Both senators gave confident speeches last night, but until the results are in it\u2019s unclear exactly how the chips will fall for them. Klobuchar will need a strong performance to continue to compete against her fellow centrists, but Warren \u2013 who arrived in New Hampshire before dawn saying: \u201cThis is an organization that is built for the long haul\u201d \u2013 probably has more time to fight her liberal rival Sanders even if Iowa turns out to have been disappointing. Hello on the morning after a shambolic start to the Democratic presidential race. Apparently due to problems with a new phone app used to report results, the Iowa Democratic party was not able to tally up who won last night\u2019s caucuses - the first election in the long primary process designed to choose a candidate to take on Donald Trump in November. The local party has promised to release its results on Tuesday, but as the candidates move on to New Hampshire for the next contest on 11 February, and Donald Trump gives his annual State of the Union speech tonight, the significance of the vote in Iowa may end up being blunted. Some will see that as a good thing. There have long been complaints that allowing Iowa to go first in the primary race gives too much weight to a small, mostly white, largely rural state that does not represent the demographics of the Democratic party or the US. Perhaps sensing that they needed to seize the moment even if the moment was a bit unclear, leftwing senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and centrist former mayor Pete Buttigieg delivered what sounded like victory speeches, with both Sanders\u2019 and Buttigieg\u2019s campaigns also claiming that their local representatives had seen partial results that showed their candidate ahead. By contrast Joe Biden - the former vice-president to Barack Obama who is probably still the frontrunner in the national Democratic race, just about - delivered an address that sounded like it was designed to buck up supporters after a disappointing night. \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk out of here with our share of delegates,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what it is yet, but we feel good about where we are. So it\u2019s on to New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and well beyond.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign revelled in the chaos. \u201cDemocrats are stewing in a caucus mess of their own creation with the sloppiest train wreck in history,\u201d said Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager. \u201cIt would be natural for people to doubt the fairness of the process. And these are the people who want to run our entire healthcare system?\u201d So what happened? This was the first year Iowans had to report three tallies in their complex voting system, and a new mobile app was introduced to help them do it. Some local representatives meant to use the app to report the numbers seemed to find it difficult to use, and tried to use a telephone hotline instead, meaning it became too busy. That all seems to have slowed the whole process down and meant accurate overall results cannot yet be tallied. \u201cThis is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion,\u201d said Mandy McClure, the Iowa party\u2019s communications director. \u201cThe underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.\u201d By the way, the Republicans also held caucuses in Iowa yesterday. Trump won with 97.1% of the vote. We\u2019ll have live coverage here today as the Democratic results (hopefully) come through, plus: \u2022 Around 4pm ET: Senators will give speeches on Trump\u2019s impeachment, before they vote tomorrow on whether to convict or acquit him. Acquittal is almost certain. \u2022 9pm ET: Trump delivers his the State of the Union address in the House of Representatives. His theme is expected to be the \u201cGreat American Comeback\u201d. Until then, you can read up on everything that happened last night here:",

      "body": "<p>For nearly two decades, Feti Gjici worked on a project that was so secret he was made to lock the plans away in a safe before leaving his office each evening. He never spoke of it to his friends or family.</p> <p>Gjici was the chief planner of the town of Kuk\u00ebs, in northern Albania, working during the years of the country\u2019s communist regime, led by the Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha. The paranoid and isolationist leader was terrified of impending war and built hundreds of thousands of concrete bunkers to defend his population against the threat of invasion.</p> <p>In Kuk\u00ebs, not far from the border with socialist Yugoslavia, things were taken a step further. Gjici\u2019s task, beginning in the early 1970s and ending only with the collapse of the regime in 1991, was to build an underground replica of Kuk\u00ebs 30 metres below the overground town.</p> <p>The first plans, in the early 1970s, were for a series of bomb shelters. As the 1980s went on, on the orders of army bosses, Gjici added ever more tunnels and rooms to the subterranean project, including space for a printing press, a hospital and a bakery. Then, electricity and water networks were added. There was to be an army command centre, a police point and a courtroom. The idea was that 10,000 people should be able to live self-sufficiently underground for a period of up to six months.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, in a time of war, things might run at reduced capacity, but the idea was to replicate the entire city underground,\u201d recalled Gjici, now 72.</p> <p>In the early 1970s, the communist authorities flooded the entire settlement of Kuk\u00ebs with an artificial lake during the construction of a hydroelectric plant. City planners had to design a brand new town alongside it, and resettled the whole population. Gjici was helping to design the second Kuk\u00ebs above ground when army and secret police bosses approached him. \u201cSince I was doing a good job, they entrusted me with the plans for the underground town,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"341d0ea23e71348282a7937ff0c177ff70fab06b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/341d0ea23e71348282a7937ff0c177ff70fab06b/0_241_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Fierza reservoir and Drin river in Kuk\u00ebs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Fierza reservoir and Drin river in Kuk\u00ebs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westend61 GmbH/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked what he would say if a colleague enquired as to what he was working on, he laughed. \u201cIt was not a culture where people asked you what you were doing.\u201d His wife was vaguely aware he was working on a subterranean project for many years, but she too never demanded details. \u201cShe knew better than to ask questions.\u201d</p> <p>Because the shelter was so secret, Gjici had a team of just 30 construction workers to build it, as each worker had to be thoroughly vetted by the security services for political reliability. \u201cThe fewer people who knew, the better,\u201d he said. This small team was further split into pairs who were sent to work on different parts of the shelter, not realising there was one huge interconnected network.</p> <p>During the 1980s, the authorities carried out regular drills: when the siren sounded, the entire population of Kuk\u00ebs could get underground in seven minutes, through 30 entrances to the network. But it was forbidden to move around once below ground, and it was classified information that the whole network was joined together with tunnels that stretched for miles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"db2d4b9565acaf412926d5de06f1108d5ac07945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db2d4b9565acaf412926d5de06f1108d5ac07945/0_2_1602_961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feti Gjici in one of the tunnels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feti Gjici in one of the tunnels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio \u00c7akshiri</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Construction on the underground network was completed in 1989 and electricity and water were installed. But before each of the areas could be properly equipped for its planned function, the regime fell.</p> <p>These days, descending into the tunnels is not for the faint-hearted. The still spritely Gjici leads the way down a dank, cobwebbed stairway deeper and deeper underground. Access to most of the network of tunnels and rooms is blocked by huge piles of sand and mud.</p> <p>But after 30 years of neglect, the new mayor of Kuk\u00ebs, Safet Gjici, Feti\u2019s cousin, wants to finish what the communists started and complete work on underground Kuk\u00ebs before opening it to the public.</p> <p>In the 1990s he was curious after hearing his cousin\u2019s stories and descended into the abandoned network with some friends. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I couldn\u2019t believe how deep it was,\u201d he said in an interview at the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cWe went some way in but I got terrified and turned back. There were rumours of people who went down there and never came back again.\u201d</p> <p>Later he visited again, this time with his cousin and proper lamps, and he could not believe how big it was. A grandiose vision began to form. Then a few months ago he was elected mayor and he decided it was time to act on it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca18d9acc847aafd53b96a0ed491a5de34fa610a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca18d9acc847aafd53b96a0ed491a5de34fa610a/174_890_3248_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Kuk\u00ebs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Modern Kuk\u00ebs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Walker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe want to turn it into an underground city for locals and tourists,\u201d he said. He admitted his ideas were still vague, but he envisioned restaurants, attractions and shops, and people would be able to travel through the tunnels to exits at the artificial lake and then go pleasure-boating.</p> <p>In March he hopes to finalise a deal for \u20ac2.6m of EU funding to begin renovations. But without much more money than that, his ambitious plans may be just as implausible as those of communist Albania.</p> <p>There are also those who question turning the country\u2019s communist heritage into theme park-style attractions. The vast complex of bunkers built for the elite on the outskirts of the capital, Tirana, has already been turned into a museum. There are plans to open <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/28/the-house-that-hoxha-built-dictators-villa-to-become-public-space-albania\">Hoxha\u2019s house</a>, left exactly as it was when the dictator died in 1985, to the public.</p> <p>\u201cIn the rest of communist Europe, the repressions finished in the 1960s, but here they went on right to the end,\u201d said Enriketa Papa, a historian at the University of Tirana. \u201cPeople were starving and they were still building bunkers. Why do we need museums of bunkers now, when there are no museums to the victims of communism?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aab904911b285a016b5c2f9ceb95c8e2c6e719f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aab904911b285a016b5c2f9ceb95c8e2c6e719f5/0_64_1620_972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the Kuk\u00ebs tunnels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the Kuk\u00ebs tunnels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio \u00c7akshiri</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Safet Gjici was adamant that any underground museum would not gloss over the dark side of the communist years. \u201cIt was an awful time. Half the country were informers and there were limitations on everything. We don\u2019t want to see those times again, not for ourselves and not for anyone else on earth,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His cousin was much more equivocal, reflecting a nostalgia for the Hoxha regime among a part of Albania\u2019s older population, especially those who occupied privileged positions. \u201cI was from a family of farmers in a village, and I was able to study engineering in the capital together with the son-in-law of Hoxha. Back then, there was no discrimination,\u201d he said, glossing over the executions, labour camps and political prisoners.</p> <p>As for the underground town, he dismissed the idea that its construction reflected a paranoid mindset and claimed it was the \u201cabsolute minimum\u201d that any sensible government would provide for its citizens. \u201cNow more than ever we need it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be maintained, to teach younger generations that the risk of war is always there.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For nearly two decades, Feti Gjici worked on a project that was so secret he was made to lock the plans away in a safe before leaving his office each evening. He never spoke of it to his friends or family. Gjici was the chief planner of the town of Kuk\u00ebs, in northern Albania, working during the years of the country\u2019s communist regime, led by the Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha. The paranoid and isolationist leader was terrified of impending war and built hundreds of thousands of concrete bunkers to defend his population against the threat of invasion. In Kuk\u00ebs, not far from the border with socialist Yugoslavia, things were taken a step further. Gjici\u2019s task, beginning in the early 1970s and ending only with the collapse of the regime in 1991, was to build an underground replica of Kuk\u00ebs 30 metres below the overground town. The first plans, in the early 1970s, were for a series of bomb shelters. As the 1980s went on, on the orders of army bosses, Gjici added ever more tunnels and rooms to the subterranean project, including space for a printing press, a hospital and a bakery. Then, electricity and water networks were added. There was to be an army command centre, a police point and a courtroom. The idea was that 10,000 people should be able to live self-sufficiently underground for a period of up to six months. \u201cOf course, in a time of war, things might run at reduced capacity, but the idea was to replicate the entire city underground,\u201d recalled Gjici, now 72. In the early 1970s, the communist authorities flooded the entire settlement of Kuk\u00ebs with an artificial lake during the construction of a hydroelectric plant. City planners had to design a brand new town alongside it, and resettled the whole population. Gjici was helping to design the second Kuk\u00ebs above ground when army and secret police bosses approached him. \u201cSince I was doing a good job, they entrusted me with the plans for the underground town,\u201d he said. Asked what he would say if a colleague enquired as to what he was working on, he laughed. \u201cIt was not a culture where people asked you what you were doing.\u201d His wife was vaguely aware he was working on a subterranean project for many years, but she too never demanded details. \u201cShe knew better than to ask questions.\u201d Because the shelter was so secret, Gjici had a team of just 30 construction workers to build it, as each worker had to be thoroughly vetted by the security services for political reliability. \u201cThe fewer people who knew, the better,\u201d he said. This small team was further split into pairs who were sent to work on different parts of the shelter, not realising there was one huge interconnected network. During the 1980s, the authorities carried out regular drills: when the siren sounded, the entire population of Kuk\u00ebs could get underground in seven minutes, through 30 entrances to the network. But it was forbidden to move around once below ground, and it was classified information that the whole network was joined together with tunnels that stretched for miles. Construction on the underground network was completed in 1989 and electricity and water were installed. But before each of the areas could be properly equipped for its planned function, the regime fell. These days, descending into the tunnels is not for the faint-hearted. The still spritely Gjici leads the way down a dank, cobwebbed stairway deeper and deeper underground. Access to most of the network of tunnels and rooms is blocked by huge piles of sand and mud. But after 30 years of neglect, the new mayor of Kuk\u00ebs, Safet Gjici, Feti\u2019s cousin, wants to finish what the communists started and complete work on underground Kuk\u00ebs before opening it to the public. In the 1990s he was curious after hearing his cousin\u2019s stories and descended into the abandoned network with some friends. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I couldn\u2019t believe how deep it was,\u201d he said in an interview at the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cWe went some way in but I got terrified and turned back. There were rumours of people who went down there and never came back again.\u201d Later he visited again, this time with his cousin and proper lamps, and he could not believe how big it was. A grandiose vision began to form. Then a few months ago he was elected mayor and he decided it was time to act on it. \u201cWe want to turn it into an underground city for locals and tourists,\u201d he said. He admitted his ideas were still vague, but he envisioned restaurants, attractions and shops, and people would be able to travel through the tunnels to exits at the artificial lake and then go pleasure-boating. In March he hopes to finalise a deal for \u20ac2.6m of EU funding to begin renovations. But without much more money than that, his ambitious plans may be just as implausible as those of communist Albania. There are also those who question turning the country\u2019s communist heritage into theme park-style attractions. The vast complex of bunkers built for the elite on the outskirts of the capital, Tirana, has already been turned into a museum. There are plans to open Hoxha\u2019s house, left exactly as it was when the dictator died in 1985, to the public. \u201cIn the rest of communist Europe, the repressions finished in the 1960s, but here they went on right to the end,\u201d said Enriketa Papa, a historian at the University of Tirana. \u201cPeople were starving and they were still building bunkers. Why do we need museums of bunkers now, when there are no museums to the victims of communism?\u201d Safet Gjici was adamant that any underground museum would not gloss over the dark side of the communist years. \u201cIt was an awful time. Half the country were informers and there were limitations on everything. We don\u2019t want to see those times again, not for ourselves and not for anyone else on earth,\u201d he said. His cousin was much more equivocal, reflecting a nostalgia for the Hoxha regime among a part of Albania\u2019s older population, especially those who occupied privileged positions. \u201cI was from a family of farmers in a village, and I was able to study engineering in the capital together with the son-in-law of Hoxha. Back then, there was no discrimination,\u201d he said, glossing over the executions, labour camps and political prisoners. As for the underground town, he dismissed the idea that its construction reflected a paranoid mindset and claimed it was the \u201cabsolute minimum\u201d that any sensible government would provide for its citizens. \u201cNow more than ever we need it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be maintained, to teach younger generations that the risk of war is always there.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address was bookended by two dramatic encounters with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, beginning with the president appearing to reject her handshake and ending with Pelosi dramatically ripping up a copy of his speech. The night got off to an awkward start when Pelosi \u2013 the most senior Democrat in Congress, who initiated the impeachment inquiry into Trump \u2013 extended her hand as the president approached to take his place at the podium. But Trump snubbed her, turning away without accepting it. Pelosi, who was seated along with the vice-president, Mike Pence, behind Trump\u2019s podium in the House chamber, merely smiled and sat down. It was the pair\u2019s first encounter since October, when Democrats had walked out of a meeting with Trump on Syria after he called her a \u201cthird-rate politician\u201d. After the president concluded his 78-minute address, Pelosi ripped up the paper copy of his speech she had in front of her with a pointed flourish. Asked by reporters why she tore up the speech, she responded: \u201cIt was the courteous thing to do, considering the alternative.\u201d Elaborating later, she called the speech a \u201cmanifesto of mistruths\u201d and said Trump\u2019s words \u201cgave no comfort\u201d to families looking for better healthcare options and he was \u201cnot truthful\u201d about his healthcare policies. The White House accused Pelosi of disrespecting some of the people Trump has singled out during his address, including one of the last surviving Tuskegee airmen, the first black military aviators who served in the second world war, and a serving military officer who was reunited with his family in a surprise reality TV-style moment. And Trump\u2019s allies were quick to condemn Pelosi. The Republican National Commitee quickly began circulating the video Pelosi tearing up the speech, as some political commentators predicted the clip would soon find its way into a Republican attack ad. Longtime congressional reporters said Pelosi\u2019s destruction of the speech underscored what an unprecedented State of the Union it was, pointing out Republicans\u2019 campaign-style cheers of \u201cfour more years\u201d as Trump stood before them. The tension between Pelosi and Trump overshadowed Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar, who delivered the official Democratic responses to the State of the Union. Escobar delivered her thoughts in Spanish, addressing the subject that Trump had studiously avoided \u2013 impeachment. \u201cSabemos que el presidente Trump viol\u00f3 su juramento al pedirle a otro pa\u00eds que interfiriera en nuestras elecciones,\u201d she said, which translates as: \u201cWe know that President Trump violated his oath by asking for foreign interference\u201d. The president\u2019s third State of the Union speech fell on the eve of his likely acquittal by Republican loyalists in the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial, a process kickstarted when Pelosi announced the House impeachment inquiry more than four months ago. Trump was impeached in the House in December. In another testy moment on Tuesday night, Pelosi also ignored the traditional introduction of the president as he walked into the chamber. Eschewing the usual language, in which the House speaker says, \u201cMembers of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States\u201d, Pelosi simply introduced Trump by saying: \u201cMembers of Congress, the President of the United States.\u201d The scene on Tuesday night in Washington presented a potentially uncomfortable juxtaposition for Trump, considering the State of the Union is held in the same room where the House voted to impeach him in December. Pelosi had reportedly warned her caucus members to remain dignified if Trump veers into taunting them over the impeachment trial. Several well-known House Democrats, including the congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, opted to boycott the event altogether, citing Trump\u2019s \u201ccontempt for Congress and our constitution\u201d. It wasn\u2019t the first time Pelosi has made waves during Trump\u2019s State of the Union. A clip of her clapping in a sarcastic manner during Trump\u2019s 2019 State of the Union speech went viral, prompting a slew of memes and praise for her world-class skills in the art of the subtle diss. She has won a reputation for being able to get under Trump\u2019s skin in a series of other incidents ranging from spats over policy to using air quotes when talking about Trump\u2019s \u201cmind\u201d to saying that she prays for the president.",

And then we came to understand that people from that vehicle moved to a black Kluger.\u201d</p> <p>Cornelius said the Kluger was tracked by police airwing, and pursued on and off by police for about an hour. He said police would allege that it appeared to be attempting a carjacking just before 10pm, and that was what triggered the final pursuit.</p> <p>It crashed after driving over \u201cstop sticks\u201d set out by police on an on-ramp to the Western Ring Road, which deflated two of the tyres.</p> <p>\u201cI would have to say that the people in that Kluger would have known that they\u2019ve gone over stop-sticks, they would have known that their tyres had deflated, and yet they\u2019ve continued to engage in that dangerous driving,\u201d Cornelius said.</p> <p>Cornelius says the Kluger was travelling about 80km/h at one point, in a 60km/h zone, and was \u201cspeeding away from police\u201d when it hit a truck, which then rolled over another car. No one in the truck or the other car was seriously injured.</p> <p>\u201cI am very fortunate ... that I\u2019m talking to you this morning about the deaths of only two people because there were two other innocent parties involved in that collision,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said it was a \u201cvery high impact scene\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not much left of the front of the Kluger, and as a result of that the occupants of that vehicle were very seriously injured, and that is one of the reasons that we are struggling with identity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Cornelius defended the actions of police, saying that on the assessment of local police commanders, \u201cour members can be confident that they\u2019ve complied with the policy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe key point I would make is that police are not birds on a wire here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not stand by and watch serious, high-end offending, which has a terrible impact on our community, we\u2019re not going to stand by and watch it.</p> <p>\u201cWhere we take the view that it is safe to intervene and to interdict and stop those criminals, we will do so.\u201d</p> <p>Cornelius said he had \u201ca sense that members did everything they could and should have last night to properly manage this situation\u201d, adding, \u201cof course I should also say that we are accountable\u201d.</p>",

Two males died when the black Toyota Kluger they were driving hit a truck while being chased by police on Bell Street, Preston about 10pm. They have yet to be identified, and their families also have not been identified or informed as of Wednesday morning. Their deaths will be investigated as a death in police presence and subject to a mandatory inquest. Between July 1989 and June 2017, 232 people died in police pursuits in Australia. Fifty-two of those people were Indigenous. It comes two and a half years after another fatal police pursuit in Preston resulted in the death of an Indigenous man, whose family are still awaiting a coronial inquest. Police allege the pair were connected to an aggravated burglary that occurred in St Albans earlier on Tuesday night, about 7.30pm, and the alleged theft of a Mitsubishi Triton and a Volkswagen Golf. The assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius said police believed those who died in the pursuit were originally in that stolen Triton, and that is why they were followed. \u201cFollowing that aggravated burglary we were able to follow in particular the Mitsubishi Triton,\u201d Cornelius, who manages the north-west metropolitan region, told reporters. \u201cAnd we followed that to a hotel in Sunshine. And then we came to understand that people from that vehicle moved to a black Kluger.\u201d Cornelius said the Kluger was tracked by police airwing, and pursued on and off by police for about an hour. He said police would allege that it appeared to be attempting a carjacking just before 10pm, and that was what triggered the final pursuit. It crashed after driving over \u201cstop sticks\u201d set out by police on an on-ramp to the Western Ring Road, which deflated two of the tyres. \u201cI would have to say that the people in that Kluger would have known that they\u2019ve gone over stop-sticks, they would have known that their tyres had deflated, and yet they\u2019ve continued to engage in that dangerous driving,\u201d Cornelius said. Cornelius says the Kluger was travelling about 80km/h at one point, in a 60km/h zone, and was \u201cspeeding away from police\u201d when it hit a truck, which then rolled over another car. No one in the truck or the other car was seriously injured. \u201cI am very fortunate ... that I\u2019m talking to you this morning about the deaths of only two people because there were two other innocent parties involved in that collision,\u201d he said. He said it was a \u201cvery high impact scene\u201d. \u201cThere is not much left of the front of the Kluger, and as a result of that the occupants of that vehicle were very seriously injured, and that is one of the reasons that we are struggling with identity,\u201d he said. Cornelius defended the actions of police, saying that on the assessment of local police commanders, \u201cour members can be confident that they\u2019ve complied with the policy\u201d. \u201cThe key point I would make is that police are not birds on a wire here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not stand by and watch serious, high-end offending, which has a terrible impact on our community, we\u2019re not going to stand by and watch it. \u201cWhere we take the view that it is safe to intervene and to interdict and stop those criminals, we will do so.\u201d Cornelius said he had \u201ca sense that members did everything they could and should have last night to properly manage this situation\u201d, adding, \u201cof course I should also say that we are accountable\u201d.",

Australia is one of the richest countries in the world and we also have some of the world\u2019s biggest coal, gas and renewable energy resources. We could have cheap energy, low emissions and low income taxes if we had managed our resources as well as the Saudis. But instead of restricting the supply of our scarce natural resources, we let foreign owned companies plunder them and they pay virtually nothing in tax for the privilege. It\u2019s not too late to do something to fix this situation, but it\u2019s a lot easier to blame \u201claws of supply and demand\u201d or, better still, blame environmentalists, for the consequences of decades of policy failure. \u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute",

The National Audit Office found that NHS provider trusts reported a combined deficit of \u00a3827m and clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) a \u00a3150m deficit in the financial year ending 31 March 2019. It said extra money provided by the government to stabilise the finances of individual NHS bodies had not been fully effective. Trusts in financial difficulty were increasingly relying on short-term loans from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), the auditors said. The loans were in effect being treated as income by trusts who had built up debts totalling \u00a310.9bn in March 2019. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said the NAO reports showed that the NHS was \u201caddicted to unacceptable short-term fixes\u201d to cover longstanding problems. \u201cHospitals have built up loans they\u2019ll never repay, workforce shortages continue and waiting times are getting longer.

It reveals that 97% of local authorities will put council tax up again in April to cope with a growing financial crisis, and the same proportion will raise charges for services such as parking, garden waste disposal and aspects of social care. The latest State of Local Government analysis reveals widespread despair among councils over their financial health after a decade of austerity policies in which spending has been cut in half and the gap between demand and resources has grown. More than a fifth of councils said the cuts to frontline services that they would be forced to make in 2020-21 were of a scale and impact that would be noticeable to the general public.

Designer Stewart Laing\u2019s choice of modern municipal wheelie bins for the old folks\u2019 homes underlines that treating elderly people like rubbish also has contemporary relevance. The curtain-raiser is Rough for Theatre II, a rarely seen piece from the same period as Endgame. Beckett\u2019s reputation as an ominous philosopher and word-player can overshadow his skill at stage pictures, of which this provides another, searingly realised by Jones and Laing. At a big, high, bright window, we see the back of a man who seems about to jump. His name is, in a typically deathly Beckett pun, Croker. On either side, at desks lit by erratic lamps, are Bertrand (Radcliffe) and Morvan (Cumming), apparently supernatural bureaucrats, working through Croker\u2019s life files, assessing testimonies from those who met him. The sense of death angels presiding over the justification of a life suggest a feel-bad rewrite of Frank Capra\u2019s 1946 film It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. Jones\u2019s staging contains shrewd visual echoes (dark suits, shadow) of a writer Beckett admired, Franz Kafka, and vocal allusions (rapid rough-posh banter) to Harold Pinter, who Beckett influenced. This production strongly has the feel of a lost cousin to Pinter\u2019s The Dumb Waiter (1957), where temperamentally contrasting men attend another kind of death and which Pinter wrote at almost exactly the time Beckett worked on the first version of Rough for Theatre II. In both this fascinating curiosity and the more celebrated Endgame, Radcliffe and Cumming achieve the Beckett paradox of exhilarating bleakness. At the Old Vic, London, until 28 March.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has been accused of greenwashing after the UK advertising watchdog banned an ad campaign claiming that the airline has the lowest carbon emissions of any major airline in Europe. The budget airline, which was named last year as one of Europe\u2019s top 10 carbon emitters in an EU report, later ran a TV, press and radio campaign claiming it was \u201cEurope\u2019s lowest fares, lowest emissions airline\u201d. The ads claim that Ryanair has the \u201clowest carbon emissions of any major airline\u201d, based on CO2 emissions per passenger per kilometre flown, because it has the youngest fleet, highest proportion of seats filled on flights and newest, most fuel-efficient engines. However, one of the charts Ryanair presented to the Advertising Standards Authority to back up its claims was dated 2011, which the watchdog said was \u201cof little value as substantiation for a comparison made in 2019\u201d. The ASA added: \u201cIn addition, some well-known airlines did not appear on the chart, so it was not clear whether they had been measured.\u201d The ASA also said that the ads failed to factor in seating density \u2013 the number of seats per plane \u2013 which it considered \u201csignificant information that consumers needed in order to understand the basis of the claim\u201d. The ASA banned the ads ruling that they were misleading because the airline had failed to substantiate its environmental claims. \u201cThe ads must not appear again in their current forms,\u201d the ASA said. \u201cWe told Ryanair to ensure that when making environmental claims they held adequate evidence to substantiate them and to ensure that the basis of those claims were made clear.\u201d The environmental group Transport &amp; Environment accused Ryanair of greenwashing instead of tackling its emissions. The airline ran the low-emissions ad campaign just over five months after it became the first non-coal company to be named in the EU top 10 carbon emitters list. \u201cRyanair should stop greenwashing and start doing something to tackle its sky-high emissions,\u201d said Jo Dardenne, the aviation manager of T&amp;E. Ryanair remained defiant, claiming it had abided by the UK advertising code. \u201cRyanair is both disappointed and surprised that the ASA has issued this ruling given that Ryanair fully complied with advertising regulations, engaging with regulators and providing documentation that fulfilled all the substantiations needed,\u201d said a spokeswoman. The Ryanair boss, Michael O\u2019Leary, has suggested shooting environmentalists and has repeatedly denied that the climate crisis is driven by carbon emissions, which aviation produces in abundance. Last year, Ryanair claimed it was already the greenest airline in terms of carbon emissions per passenger. The company has also pledged to be \u201cplastic free\u201d by 2023 and set up a voluntary carbon offset payment scheme for customers when booking.",
