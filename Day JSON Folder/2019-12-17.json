A mass vaccination campaign has been implemented, with health workers going door to door to carry out immunisations. Experts feel the emergency response is working and they are over the worst of the outbreak.</p> <p>But as funeral homes report running out of children\u2019s coffins and young parents make their way to morgues to retrieve the bodies of their babies, they are questioning how it came to this.</p> <h2>A tragic event with tragic consequences</h2> <p>In one sense it is an easy question to answer. Samoa\u2019s vaccination rate was too low to protect its people when measles arrived, probably brought by a traveller from New Zealand, which has suffered its own measles outbreak over the last year.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that in order to have immunity, there needs to be at least 95% coverage of people who have had two doses of measles-containing vaccine. Four years ago, roughly 85% of one-year-olds in Samoa were vaccinated, in 2017 that dropped to 60%.</p> <p>The rate plummeted sharply after a scandal that rocked Samoa in July 2018, when two Samoan nurses administered MMR vaccines to babies who subsequently died. The problem was not with the vaccine, an investigation determined, but rather its administration, after it emerged that one of the nurses mixed the MMR vaccine powder with expired muscle relaxant anaesthetic instead of water.</p> <p>But the impact on public trust in vaccination was profound.</p> <p>The Samoan government suspended the country\u2019s vaccination programme for 10 months, despite advice from the WHO that the country immediately restart the programme. By 2018, only 31% of infants had been vaccinated.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you pause for 10 months that\u2019s enough time for thousands of kids [without immunity] to accumulate,\u201d said Jose Hagan, regional immunisation specialist for the WHO.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f982317035c7e18343f62e75364a3d11a36f9437\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f982317035c7e18343f62e75364a3d11a36f9437/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurse April Wilson and team leader Luisa Popo preparing vaccinations during a nationwide campaign against measles in the Samoan town of Le\u2019auva\u2019a\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nurse April Wilson and team leader Luisa Popo preparing vaccinations during a nationwide campaign against measles in the Samoan town of Le\u2019auva\u2019a.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allan Stephen/Unicef/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The country had already been a target for anti-vaxxers, but the MMR incident provided fertile ground for their messages to take hold.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to know how much to attribute to the anti-vaxxer messaging,\u201d said Hagan. \u201cThey\u2019ve certainly been extremely active in Samoa, for perplexing reasons.

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives have been accused of ignoring systematic Islamophobia in their ranks after Boris Johnson broke his promise to hold an inquiry specifically into the issue and announced a broad-brush review of how the party handles discrimination complaints instead. The Muslim Council of Britain expressed concern at the move on Tuesday, saying it suspected that broadening the remit was designed to bury the real problem. \u201cThis appointment is at risk of being seen in the same light as the Conservative party\u2019s customary approach to Islamophobia, that of denial, dismissal and deceit,\u201d said its general secretary, Harun Khan. \u201cWe were promised an independent inquiry into Islamophobia specifically. Now we have a review that aims to broaden the scope to examine discrimination more generally. A laudable aim if it were not for the fact that the Conservative party is afflicted with a particular type of bigotry that it refuses to countenance.\u201d The prime minister, who has himself publicly ridiculed Muslim women who wear the burqa, indicated that he would renege on his pledge to hold the more focused inquiry within a fortnight of making the vow live on television as he sought the Conservative leadership this summer. Johnson faced staunch criticism as the plan was quickly watered down and the Tories have opened numerous investigations into allegations of Islamophobic behaviour by party figures in recent months. While he has declined to apologise for the comments he has made in newspaper articles, Johnson has said sorry in more general terms for \u201call the hurt and offence that has been caused\u201d by Islamophobia within the Tory party during the general election campaign. On Tuesday, five days after the vote that handed the party a solid Commons majority, the Conservatives appointed the former equality and human rights commissioner, Prof Swaran Singh, to lead the independent review into the party\u2019s handling of complaints of any form of discrimination and prejudice. The Tories said the review run by Singh, a professor of social and community psychiatry at the University of Warwick, would look at how they could improve their processes, to ensure \u201cany instances are isolated, and that there are robust processes in place to stamp them out as and when they occur\u201d. The party\u2019s chairman, James Cleverly, said it was committed to stamping out \u201cunacceptable abuse\u201d. He added: \u201cThe Conservative party has always worked to act swiftly when allegations have been put to us and there are a wide range of sanctions to challenge and change behaviour. \u201cThe Conservative party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind and it is right to hold an independent review, so we can stamp out unacceptable abuse that is not fit for public life.\u201d The Tories have been heavily criticised by their former chair, Sayeeda Warsi, who has long campaigned against Islamophobia in the party.",

He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t know about you, Mr Speaker elect, but as you survey this house from your eminence, with a characteristic beam that has brought you such deserved popularity, I don\u2019t know what you think but I mean absolutely no disrespect to those who are no longer with us \u2013 but I think this parliament is a vast improvement on its predecessor.</p> \n   <p>And indeed Mr Speaker, I would say it is one of the best parliaments this country has ever produced. with more female members than ever before, with more black and minority ethnic members than ever before, and it is also Mr Speaker \u2013 incarnated in your person \u2013 a vastly more democratic parliament. Because this parliament is not going to waste the time of the nation in deadlock and division and delay. On Friday of this week this parliament is going to put the withdrawal agreement in the popty ping as we say in Wales, and then this new democratic parliament, this people\u2019s parliament, is going to do something.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>During the election campaign, Johnson claimed to have learned that \u201cpopty ping\u201d was the Welsh for microwave, even <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/32LYRFTf8hSR9xknCxYXl7T/seven-welsh-words-that-are-well-worth-knowing\">though this is apparently a myth</a>. Johnson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And Mr Speaker I wonder if you can guess what it is that this parliament is going to do. What is it going to do? I wonder if you can guess what this parliament is going to do once we put the withdrawal agreement back. We are going to get Brexit done and even your parrot, Mr Speaker, would have been able to cite that one by now. </p> \n   <p>And we are going to get on with delivering on the priorities of the British people, transforming the NHS, investing massively in education, in police, uniting and levelling up across the country and across the whole UK. And it is my belief and the belief of most honourable members in this house that we should resist the calls of those who would break up that United Kingdom. And as the parliament of the UK we should politely and respectfully defend that partnership and that union. </p> \n   <p>And I can tell the house that after three and a half years of wrangling and division, we in this government will do whatever we can to reach out across the house to find common ground, to heal the divisions of our country, and to find a new and generous spirit in which we conduct all our political dealings with one another that will last beyond this immediate season of Christmas goodwill.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a628f6b13734a3c0537636f21ab7dca0b11689c1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a628f6b13734a3c0537636f21ab7dca0b11689c1/84_0_3340_2004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking in the Commons this afternoon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking in the Commons this afternoon.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-17T19:14:55.959Z\">at 7.14pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5df90bd18f087e8308e5fd4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-17T17:21:27.041Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Downing Street has announced some new government appointments.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Mike Freer</strong> and <strong>Iain Stewart</strong>, who were both government whips, remain as whips but both get promotions within the whips\u2019 office.

Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies, who are rallying behind the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey as their candidate, argue that agreeing to a second referendum was a mistake (although Long-Bailey herself has yet to express a view on this topic.)</p> \n  <p>The biggest threat to Long-Bailey may come from the candidate attracting most Labour remain supporter, either Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, or Thornberry herself. Both Starmer and Thornberry strongly argued for a second referendum, and said that in such a poll they would back remain.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86e23a8dd5472a154f87e31491e3219cee83396a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86e23a8dd5472a154f87e31491e3219cee83396a/0_34_1322_793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Thornberry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Thornberry.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-17T09:43:00.860Z\">at 9.43am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5df8933d8f08c3972263bb5e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-17T09:06:37.244Z\">9.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer says Johnson's decision to rule out transition extension 'reckless and irresponsible'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On Friday, in a statement in Downing Street after his surprise and overwhelming election victory, <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> offered<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/12/general-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll?page=with:block-5df3aab18f08b5e67004384b#block-5df3aab18f08b5e67004384b\"> an olive branch of sorts to people who voted remain.</a> Addressing specifically those who still wanted to stay in the EU, he said \u201cwe in this one-nation Conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe.\u201d It was hard to know what he meant by that, and this morning many remainers will be concluding \u201cnot much\u201d following the overnight announcement from No 10 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/16/boris-johnson-will-amend-brexit-bill-to-outlaw-extension\">its new version of the withdrawal agreement bill will ban the government from seeking an extension to the Brexit transition.</a> This is a concession to Brexiters and, although it could be argued that the intention is just to intensify pressure for the UK-EU trade deal to be finalised by the end of 2020, it does raise the prospect of the UK falling out of the transition into a no-deal Brexit this time next year if agreement cannot be reached.</p> \n  <p>That is the conclusion of the financial markets.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s news: Jeremy Corbyn apologised to his remaining MPs for Labour\u2019s general election defeat. The party\u2019s leader admitted personal responsibility as he faced the parliamentary Labour party on Tuesday evening. Keir Starmer, indicated he was likely to run for the Labour leadership. The shadow Brexit secretary set out his stall in a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian on Tuesday. Barry Gardiner also declined to rule out standing for the deputy leadership. The Conservative party announced a broad-brush review of discrimination after Boris Johnson broke his promise to hold an inquiry specifically into Tory Islamophobia. The party appointed a former equality and human rights commissioner to lead the review. Downing Street warned businesses to prepare for life outside EU\u2019s customs regime \u201cin all circumstances\u201d. The spokesman also refused to comment on the fall in the pound on Tuesday morning, that followed the ruling out of a Brexit extension. You can see a more detailed summary of the lobby briefing with journalists here. Nicola Sturgeon indicated she would not drop her calls for a second Scottish independence referendum. After receiving short shrift from the prime minister, the SNP leader said the vast majority of Scotland had backed either pro-EU or pro-independence parties. She also called for cross-party support for the move. Boris Johnson delivered his first speech to the Commons since the general election. Boris Johnson told MPs he thought this parliament a \u201cvast improvement on its predecessor\u201d. And, if you\u2019d like to read yet more, Zoe Williams and Heather Stewart have tonight\u2019s main story: Keir Starmer has set out his pitch for the Labour leadership with a call for his party not to lurch to the right as a result of last week\u2019s devastating election result, my colleagues Zoe Williams and Heather Stewart write. While the leadership race has not yet formally been launched, the shadow Brexit secretary confirmed to the Guardian that, as widely expected in Westminster, he was \u201cseriously considering\u201d running to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. In a wide-ranging interview, Starmer said Labour did not do enough to tackle the Conservatives\u2019 central election pledge to \u2018get Brexit done\u2019 nor sufficiently deal with antisemitism, and urged his party to return to being a \u201cbroad church\u201d. He insisted Labour could win the next general election; but only if it sticks to its values. There\u2019s no hiding from it. It is a devastating result, but it\u2019s important not to oversteer. The case for a bold and radical Labour government is as strong now as it was last Thursday. We need to anchor ourselves in that. I want trust to be restored in the Labour party as a progressive force for good: and that means we have to win. But there\u2019s no victory without values. There are conflicting reports about whether or not parliamentarians have been calling on Corbyn to quit immediately at this evening\u2019s meeting. The Labour MP, Lloyd Russell-Moyle has said explicitly that there has been no such clamour. But BBC Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt has this: And here\u2019s a little more detail from the meeting: The prime minister has spoken to his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, who congratulated him on his general election win this evening. A No 10 spokeswoman has said: They agreed to continue to work closely together as Commonwealth partners on issues such as girls\u2019 education, climate change and trade. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves said she told the meeting the party must radically change and get a leader \u201cthat actually wants to win\u201d. If we want to change the lives of the people we came into politics to serve, then we\u2019ve got to win power and that\u2019s not been possible two times under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. We need radical change, we need a party and a leader the country can trust, we need economic policies that add up and we need somebody that actually wants to win because they know that it\u2019s only through power that we can change the lives of people. Jess Phillips, viewed as a possible leadership candidate by some, has played down the ferocity of the PLP meeting, though she said it was largely critical of Corbyn. It was no worse than it always is. It\u2019s just people saying what they think. There are a couple of people being supportive. She said she read a text from Melanie Onn, the former Labour MP who lost her Great Grimsby seat to the Tories, about \u201chow she had been let down by the leadership and the frontbench and that nobody had bothered with Grimsby\u201d. Phillips said: There are lots and lots of complaints about how nobody has called any of the people who lost. However, her Labour colleague Dame Margaret Hodge said Corbyn faced a hostile reaction. She told reporters that \u201con the whole, it was fury, despair, miserable and I just felt that the top table had corporate amnesia\u201d. They talked about vetting new members and everybody laughed. There\u2019s fury that he didn\u2019t go to visit the right constituencies ... there was fury over the level of organisation. Lloyd Russell-Moyle said Labour MPs\u2019 criticism of Corbyn centred on his leadership, his Brexit position and his manifesto for lacking an \u201coverarching narrative\u201d. Not one person said go right now. They all recognise that he has apologised and that he wants to go as soon as possible, and that the duty was to save the party and do it in an orderly way. People were emotional, very emotional. Here\u2019s a little more on Creagh\u2019s comments about Jeremy Corbyn: She told Channel 4 News she had confronted him in Westminster because, in her view, he\u2019d \u201cenabled a hard Brexit\u201d and \u201cfive years of austerity\u201d. Creagh blamed Corbyn for Labour\u2019s losses, adding: \u201cThis was Jeremy\u2019s manifesto [...] Jeremy\u2019s NEC [Labour\u2019s governing body].\u201d She added that the views she\u2019d heard expressed about his policies on the doorsteps could not be broadcast pre-watershed. And she said: In Jeremy, we have a man without honour and without shame. Another Labour MP on his way out of the meeting says Corbyn\u2019s leadership came up time and time again in the meeting. He said Margaret Beckett, who was acting leader after John Smith died, made a particularly noteworthy contribution, saying the leadership should not be worried about protecting its legacy when thinking about a new leader; what mattered was who would be best placed to win, she told the meeting. The MP said several colleagues also said antisemitism had been a problem, and had to be addressed. He acknowledged that some MPs spoke out in support of Corbyn. But, referring to MPs like Claudia Webbe (see 7.15pm), he said people just elected in safe seats were not best placed to understand the party\u2019s problems. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. \u201cWell cheerful,\u201d says an MP, ironically, commenting on the mood at PLP on the way out - but then she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s no better or worse than it always is.\u201d Earlier one member of the PLP was complaining about the leader\u2019s office not being in touch with MPs who lost their seats. See 6.53pm.Channel 4 News has had an interview with Mary Creagh, who has been making the same complaint. Creagh lost her seat last week. Another MP mutters \u201cmadness, pure madness\u201d as he walks past journalists after leaving the PLP meeting. On the way out one long-serving MP tells journalists that the meeting consisted of \u201cdreary contributions from the leadership and absolutely no acknowledgment of what went wrong\u201d. More from Paul Waugh Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s comments about being sorry and taking responsibility for Labour\u2019s defeat are significant because, when he spoke at his election count in the early hours of Friday morning, and when he gave a TV interview later in the day, he expressed little contrition over what had happened. But in an open letter in the Sunday Mirror at the weekend he did say he was sorry about the result. However, in a separate article for the Observer, he did not use the word \u201csorry\u201d or \u201capologise\u201d, and just said he regretted what had happened. These are from my colleague Kate Proctor. I didn\u2019t see the Labour peer Stewart Wood go in for the PLP meeting (it\u2019s for peers as well as MPs), but here are his thoughts, in an article for HuffPost, on what Labour needs to do to recover. Wood worked as an adviser to Gordon Brown when he was PM, and then as an adviser to Ed Miliband. The door opens as a peer leaves the room. While it\u2019s open we can hear a woman (I did not recognise her voice) say: Our leadership have not got in touch with many of the MPs ... We have heard quite a few complaints in recent days that Corbyn\u2019s office has not been in touch with MPs who lost their seats. When she finished she got a round of applause. More from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh, who is ahead of everyone else when it comes to getting updates from inside the room. In some non-Labour news, the Conservatives have announced their long-promised review into discrimination in the party. As expected, it does not focus just on Islamophobia, even though during the leadership contest Boris Johnson appeared to sign up to the idea of an Islamophobia-specific inquiry when Sajid Javid bounced him and other candidates into agreeing to the proposal during a TV debate. Here is an extract from the Conservative party news release. The Conservative party have today announced the appointment of Prof Swaran Singh to lead the independent review into improving party handling of complaints of all forms of discrimination and prejudice, including Islamophobia. This independent review will look at how we can improve our processes \u2013 to make sure that any instances are isolated, and that there are robust processes in place to stamp them out as and when they occur. Until 2019, Professor Singh was a commissioner of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. He is currently the professor of social and community psychiatry at the University of Warwick. Good use of the word \u201csmattering\u201d here from Paul Waugh ... There was some applause for Lavery, but it was relatively short and half-hearted. From my colleague Kate Proctor She\u2019s right. It is Ian Lavery speaking. I am on a bench on the other side of the corridor (colleagues are nearer the door), but even from here I can tell it\u2019s Lavery. But I can\u2019t make out what he\u2019s saying. That seems a good excuse, while we wait, to flag up this recording of Neil Kinnock telling a PLP meeting in 2016 why he thought Jeremy Corbyn should go. This story contains the text of what he said, plus audio. From the Telegraph\u2019s Harry Yorke earlier Another, rather muffled, round of applause ... From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh (who has a source inside, I presume, rather than excellent hearing) Journalists in the corridor are whispering in the hope of being able to hear better. But we can\u2019t hear what is being said inside. The doors are quite thick, and the doorkeeper is being quite strict about not letting reporters stand too close to them. Now a burst of laughter from inside ... One of the Commons doorkeepers has just come past asking journalists to stand \u201caway from the door\u201d. The meeting has started. From the corridor we cannot hear what is being said, but we can hear applause. We\u2019ve had two bursts of applause so far. I\u2019m outside committee room 14 in the House of Commons, where the PLP (parliamentary Labour party) is holding its first meeting since the general election. The meeting is due to start, and it seems to be standing room only inside. Jeremy Corbyn has already gone in. Outside there are around two dozen journalists. Here is the substance of what Boris Johnson told MPs earlier. It was only a very short speech, but it was his first as prime minister to the House of Commons, and he used it to deliver a message about his agenda. He told MPs: I don\u2019t know about you, Mr Speaker elect, but as you survey this house from your eminence, with a characteristic beam that has brought you such deserved popularity, I don\u2019t know what you think but I mean absolutely no disrespect to those who are no longer with us \u2013 but I think this parliament is a vast improvement on its predecessor. And indeed Mr Speaker, I would say it is one of the best parliaments this country has ever produced. with more female members than ever before, with more black and minority ethnic members than ever before, and it is also Mr Speaker \u2013 incarnated in your person \u2013 a vastly more democratic parliament. Because this parliament is not going to waste the time of the nation in deadlock and division and delay. On Friday of this week this parliament is going to put the withdrawal agreement in the popty ping as we say in Wales, and then this new democratic parliament, this people\u2019s parliament, is going to do something. During the election campaign, Johnson claimed to have learned that \u201cpopty ping\u201d was the Welsh for microwave, even though this is apparently a myth. Johnson went on: And Mr Speaker I wonder if you can guess what it is that this parliament is going to do. What is it going to do? I wonder if you can guess what this parliament is going to do once we put the withdrawal agreement back. We are going to get Brexit done and even your parrot, Mr Speaker, would have been able to cite that one by now. And we are going to get on with delivering on the priorities of the British people, transforming the NHS, investing massively in education, in police, uniting and levelling up across the country and across the whole UK. And it is my belief and the belief of most honourable members in this house that we should resist the calls of those who would break up that United Kingdom. And as the parliament of the UK we should politely and respectfully defend that partnership and that union. And I can tell the house that after three and a half years of wrangling and division, we in this government will do whatever we can to reach out across the house to find common ground, to heal the divisions of our country, and to find a new and generous spirit in which we conduct all our political dealings with one another that will last beyond this immediate season of Christmas goodwill. Downing Street has announced some new government appointments. Mike Freer and Iain Stewart, who were both government whips, remain as whips but both get promotions within the whips\u2019 office. Freer moves up to Comptroller HM Household, and Stewart moves up to Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury. Nusrat Ghani becomes a full junior transport minister. Previously she had a paid job as a whip which she combined with an unpaid job as transport minister. Now she gets a salary for her transport post. (There is a legal limit to how many paid ministers a PM can have in government.) Douglas Ross becomes an unpaid Scotland Office minister, combining that with being an unpaid whip. Maria Caulfield becomes a government whip. On the subject of the Tories and anti-elitism, the polling company YouGov has published some research today looking at which groups voted for which parties. It suggests that, at least on the basis of where their support comes from, the Conservatives can now claim to be more of a working class party than a middle class party. It says: The Conservatives comfortably outperformed Labour across all social grades, further evidence that class is no longer a key indicator of how people vote. In fact, the Conservatives actually did better amongst C2DE voters (48%) than they did amongst ABC1 voters (43%). Labour performed the same amongst both social grade groups (33%). Lord Ashcroft published some separate polling on Friday that came to much the same conclusion. For much of the 20th century Labour was the party of the working class and the Conservatives were the party of the middle class. In recent years, class stopped being the main determinant of voting behaviour (age and education are now the key factors), but even in 2017 Labour was still doing better, proportionally, among working class voters than among middle class voters. The fact that it is the Conservatives who are now doing better, proportionally, with this demographic potentially has huge implications, and it helps to explain why Boris Johnson has been so keen to argue that he is no longer leading \u201cthe Tory party of the old days\u201d and that instead it\u2019s a \u201ctotally different party\u201d. A Downing Street source has confirmed that Boris Johnson and his ministers will not be attending the Davos World Economic Forum this year. The source implied that this was more to do with the government wanting to focus on getting Brexit done, than it wanting to burnish its populist credentials by snubbing the annual gather for the global financial elite, although one suspects No 10 would not mind too much if the move were reported that way. In the Commons MPs are now swearing the oath of allegiance, one by one. Before the process started, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, told them they would be unable to speak or vote in debates until they were sworn in - and that they could not get paid either. MPs take the oath in order of seniority. The whole process may not finish until Thursday. Here is the full text of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s statement to the Scottish parliament earlier. And here are the main points she made. Sturgeon said that, particularly in the light of the election result, taking Scotland out of the EU against its will was \u201ccompletely and utterly unsustainable\u201d. The election was comprehensively won in Scotland by the SNP ... In fact, the Conservatives have now lost 17 consecutive Westminster elections in Scotland \u2013 stretching back to 1959. But in spite of that, we face a majority Tory government implementing a manifesto that Scotland rejected. Furthermore, 74% of votes in Scotland were cast for parties that either supported remaining in the EU or were in favour of a second EU referendum. 90% of seats were won by pro EU or pro EU referendum parties. But regardless, we are set to be dragged out of the EU against our will. Such a democratic deficit is not just undesirable, it is also completely and utterly unsustainable. She said later this week she would publish an argument as to why the Scottish government should have the right to call an independence referendum. It is essential therefore that a future outside of Europe and governed by an increasingly right wing Conservative government is not foisted upon Scotland. Instead, we must have the right to consider the alternative of independence. That is why, later this week, in line with repeated election mandates \u2013 reinforced once again on Thursday \u2013 I will publish the detailed democratic case for a transfer of power from Westminster to this parliament to allow for an independence referendum that is beyond legal challenge. This parliament will also vote on the final stage of the referendums (Scotland) bill which puts in place the framework for a future referendum. She said she hoped there would be cross-party support for this proposal. A new, Brexit focused Tory government presents risks that few would have predicted at the dawn of devolution. So I hope in the coming days and weeks we will see a similar coming together around the idea of Scotland\u2019s right to choose a better future. She said the delay in the UK budget caused problems for the Scottish government. This parliament is required to deliver a budget before the start of the next financial year, and Scotland\u2019s local authorities would expect to set their budgets in late February or early March. At this point, the UK government has not confirmed when it will produce its own budget \u2013 and with it the block grant adjustments for Scotland \u2013 but it may not be until March. While contingency planning and alternative options have been under consideration for some time, meeting this timetable will require parties to work together. From ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has told Euronews\u2019 Darren McCaffrey that the EU will do \u201cthe maximum\u201d to ensure that the UK and the EU can conclude their future partnership negotiation by the end of next year. In the Commons the sitting has been suspended. Later MPs will return to start swearing in. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says he is pleased to congratulate Lindsay Hoyle on behalf of the expanded SNP group in the Commons. And Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, says that if Britain had a proportional representation system, his group would be the third largest, with 70 MPs. He says he hopes Hoyle will bear this in mind. Corbyn congratulates new MPs. He says all MPs represent a community. That is a strength of the Commons. He says a majority of Labour MPs are now women. And 20 of the 26 new Labour MPs are women, he says. He says he hopes the Speaker will continue to take the mental health of MPs seriously. He finishes by urging Lindsay Hoyle to stand firm against abuses by the executive. In doing so, he will be standing up not just for MPs, but for the people they represent. Democracy is not a given. It is something we have to defend and extend. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He joins Johnson in recalling the London Bridge terror attack. He says MPs should remember what David Merritt said about his son Jack, who was killed on that day. He congratulates Johnson on winning the election. And he pays tribute to Labour MPs who lost their seats, particularly Dennis Skinner. Corbyn says Johnson will be judged by whether he keeps his promises. And he says Labour will hold the government to account. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He is opening a short session allowing party leaders to congratulate Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Johnson says this parliament \u201cis a vast improvement on its predecessor\u201d. In fact, it is one of the best this country has produced. It has more female MPs than ever before and more BAME MPs than ever before. And it is more democratic, he says. He says this parliament is going to pass the withdrawal bill. And he invites the Speaker to guess what parliament will do: it will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, he says. He says even Hoyle\u2019s parrot (Hoyle has a menagerie of pets, mostly named after parliamentarians) would have guessed that. He says the government will do whatever it can to reach out across the House, to find common ground and to heal the divisions facing this country. MPs have passed the motion by acclamation. Sir Lindsay Hoyle is taking the chair. There is now a mini-debate on the motion to approve Sir Lindsay Hoyle as Speaker. Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy is proposing the motion. She says new MPs will find out out how friendly and supportive he can be. Joking about his taste for Yorkshire tea, she tells an anecdote about how Hoyle (a proud Lancastrian) once said there were only two good things about Yorkshire; its tea, and the M62 leading out of it. She says in the Speaker\u2019s chair (he was deputy Speaker before his promotion) Hoyle has always been fair and unpartisan. In the Commons MPs have just been to the Lords chamber and back to hear a royal commission instruct them to elect a Speaker. Sir Peter Bottomley, the father of the Commons, is chairing proceedings and he proposes the election of Sir Lindsay Hoyle as Speaker. (Or re-election - Hoyle was first elected at the end of the last parliament.) Hoyle says he has served two days as Speaker. It made his election a lot easier, he says. (He represents what was a relatively marginal seat.) He says it will be a privilege to serve as Speaker. He promises to be fair. In his speech at dawn on Friday Boris Johnson said he hoped that Steve Bray, the anti-Brexit campaign best known for his costume and for shouting \u201cStop Brexit\u201d loudly outside the Houses of Parliament on a regular basis, would finally call it a day. Johnson told a Tory audience. And I say respectfully to our stentorian friend in the blue, twelve-star hat: \u2018That\u2019s it, time to put a sock in the megaphone, and give everybody some peace.\u2019 Bray doesn\u2019t seem to be taking much notice. He is outside parliament today, and he\u2019s been shouting too. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar Experts from the Centre for European Reform thinktank have been giving interviews today about the government\u2019s decision to rule out an extension to the Brexit transition period. Sam Lowe, a trade specialist at the CER, described it as \u201cdomestic virtue signalling\u201d. And Charles Grant, the CER\u2019s director, said that if Boris Johnson refuses to be bound by EU regulations, getting a trade deal will become much more complicated. From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves Back in London MPs are in the Commons chamber for the election of Speaker. The chamber is more or less packed, although at the back row on the opposition benches there are empty seats. Sturgeon says this is a watershed moment for Scotland. Later this week she will take the next steps to secure Scotland\u2019s right to choose its future, she says. Sturgeon has now finished. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is making a statement to the Scottish parliament. She says the SNP comprehensively won the election. The Conservatives have successfully lost 17 elections in Scotland, she says, going back to 1959. She says that 90% of seats in Scotland were won by pro-EU or pro-referendum parties. She says this situation is \u201cnot just undesirable\u201d but \u201ccompletely and utterly unsustainable\u201d. She says she is pressing ahead with her call for the right to hold a second referendum. Referring to Scottish Labour, she says there are some signs that people opposed to a second independence referendum are changing their minds. But she says she accepts that favouring a second referendum is not the same as favouring independence. And she says that she accepts some SNP voters do not back independence. The Copeland MP Trudy Harrison has been appointed Boris Johnson\u2019s parliamentary private secretary, the BBC\u2019s Richard Moss reports. Mairead McGuinness, first vice-president of the European parliament and an MEP for Ireland\u2019s Fine Gael party, told the World at One that EU insiders were \u201ccautious\u201d about whether it would be possible to negotiate the UK-EU future partnership by the end of next year, as Boris Johnson wants. Asked if this timescale was realistic, she said: All things are possible, but we are all a bit cautious about whether it can effectively be completed within an 11-month period ... From the European Union side we know it is a long stretch to complete everything in 11 months, and I think all negotiators involved in trade will say that. It really then comes down to what the United Kingdom wants to achieve in that period of time, and that we don\u2019t know entirely yet because the negotiations have not begun. She also said that including provisions in the withdrawal agreement bill to rule out an extension to the Brexit transition amounted to going back on the withdrawal agreement Boris Johnson negotiated with the EU, because that did include provisions for a possible extension, but she implied she did not see this as a problem. An estimated 800,000 EU citizens in the UK have yet to apply to remain in the country after Brexit, new Home Office figures suggest. And around 900,000 EU citizens who have already applied to stay will have to apply again because they have been granted temporary leave to remain, known as \u201cpre-settled status\u201d. This is granted to applicants who have been in the country for fewer than five years or those whom Home Office deems not to have sufficient evidence of being in the country for five years or more. Today\u2019s Home Office figures (pdf) show 2.6m applications for settled status have been made so far, but the government estimates there are around 3.4 million EU citizens in the UK. The Home Office minister Brandon Lewis said: EU citizens have made an enormous contribution to the UK and we want them to stay. 2.6 million applications to the EU settlement scheme have already been submitted and I encourage people to keep applying. EU citizens have until at least 31 December 2020 to apply to remain in the country post-Brexit. The Home Office said in its statement it had completed the process on 2.2m applications, leaving a backlog of 400,000 applications. It also said it had granted status to 305,600 EU citizens in November, showing how efficiently it can deal with straightforward applications. Of concern to lawyers and academics monitoring the process will be the high proportion granted pre-settled status. Of the 2.2m applications already concluded, 41% (around 900,000) were granted this status. Barristers, including the immigration specialist Colin Yeo, have raised concerns that some EU citizens may be entitled to settled status but accept pre-settled status for convenience even though it limits their rights. These are from Darren McCaffrey from Euronews. He is quoting Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP, co-leader of the Greens-European Free Alliance and a member of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group. Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to make it illegal for the government to extend the Brexit transition period beyond 11 months has been described as \u201cstrange\u201d by Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. And here are some more lines from the No 10 lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that, as well as ruling out an extension to the Brexit transition, the government was also ruling out having a transition after December 2020 to allow time for new UK-EU trading arrangements agreed in the future partnership deal to be implemented. When asked if this could happen, the spokesman replied: I don\u2019t believe that is the case. The prime minister is absolutely clear that the implementation period is not going to be extended. The spokesman said businesses should prepare for the fact that the UK will be leaving the customs union and the single market. He said: In all circumstances we are leaving the single market and customs union, which means we are leaving the EU regime which is associated with that. Businesses will need to prepare for life outside the EU\u2019s customs regime in all circumstances. The spokesman refused to comment on the fall in the pound this morning, in the light of the announcement about an extension to the transition being ruled out (see 9.06am), saying No 10 did not comment on currency fluctuations on principle. The spokesman said some new non-cabinet government appointments would be announced this afternoon. These are appointments to fill gaps created by MPs leaving parliament. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said Johnson had a conversation this morning with Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European commission. The spokesman said: The president congratulated the prime minister on his success in the election and they agreed to work together with great energy to agree a future partnership by December 2020. Asked if Von der Leyen expressed any doubts about whether it would be possible to conclude the UK-EU trade deal by the end of next year, the spokesman said both sides had agreed in the political declaration that they should reach an agreement on the future partnership by the end of of next year. Von der Leyen has tweeted about the call, but in her tweet she did not say anything about wrapping up the talks by the end of next year. A survey of LabourList readers has Rebecca Long-Bailey very narrowly ahead of Sir Keir Starmer as the favourite candidate for next Labour leader. Angela Rayner, who is now not expected to run, is in third place. Almost 20,000 people took part, but this is a self-selecting survey of readers who may not be party members and who may not have a vote in the contest, and so it would be unwise to read too much into its findings. Polling companies find it hard to poll members of a particular political party, but YouGov has carried out polls of Labour members and its research in 2016 provided a reasonably good guide to the outcome of that year\u2019s leadership contest. In July this year YouGov did survey more than 1,000 Labour members and ask them who would make a good leader. Starmer, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry came out top. Here are the figures. I\u2019m off to the No 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 12.30pm. At least two bookmakers have sent out press releases today about the odds they are offering on the next Labour leader, with Rebecca Long-Bailey the favourite, followed by Lisa Nandy and then Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. Starmer\u2019s opponents, as well as criticising his stance on Brexit, have been arguing that the next leader should be a woman, as well as an MP from outside London. But Jenny Chapman, who worked for Starmer in the shadow Brexit team and who lost her Darlington seat in the election, has been giving interviews today saying saying gender and regional background should be not factors in the contest. She made this argument in an article for the Daily Mirror and she told the Today programme: I spent the last couple of months talking to folks on the doorstep in Darlington and getting very clear messages back, as you can imagine. What people are saying is that they want a leader that they feel could be the prime minister. It was about, \u2018do I trust this person with my mortgage, with the future, with my children, with my pension?\u2019 And I think that Keir has the qualities that they\u2019re looking for. Nobody on doorsteps of Darlington said the next leader has to have ovaries or a northern accent, and I think that\u2019s such a patronising attitude to think that presenting someone who speaks the northern accent means you\u2019re going to win support in the north. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has been on BBC News this morning. There were two interesting lines in his interview. Gardiner hinted that Labour would vote against the withdrawal agreement bill if the government holds a second reading vote on Friday. He said that the decision to remove provisions protecting workers\u2019 rights from the bill (see 9.37am) would make it even less attractive than the original version of the bill, that Labour opposed in October. He said: The withdrawal agreement, if it is now countenancing the rights and protections which the previous agreement, which did get a majority in parliament contained within it, the protection for workers\u2019 rights and the protections for the environment, given that [Boris Johnson] is now taking that out, is something that is less attractive to us as a party than even the one before. Gardiner did not rule out standing for the Labour deputy leadership. Asked if he would be a candidate, as some reports have suggested, he replied: I have not made any decision on that at all ... It is speculation. In an interview for the Today programme this morning Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s main rival in the 2015 leadership contest, said that the party\u2019s Brexit policy was a problem at the election. He explained: We\u2019ve always been a coalition between traditional supporting working class communities and let\u2019s say a university-educated liberal left. Labour has not been speaking to both sides of that coalition for some time. And, actually, with the position taken on Brexit at the recent election, it was almost as if they were thwarting the views of people who had been our traditional supporters. Labour has got to speak to both sides of that coalition. Burnham refused to say which candidate he would be backing in the forthcoming leadership contest. He also said that voters in the north should be \u201cwary\u201d of accepting Boris Johnson\u2019s promises, saying that the PM could not simply offer infrastructure improvements that were \u201cdecades away\u201d to keep his new northern voters on side. He said: The north definitely does need new infrastructure. The rail chaos \u2013 that we see this morning even, with more cancellations across the north \u2013 is due to Victorian infrastructure more than anything. But they can\u2019t say that they are doing everything to the north by simply promising infrastructure in the distant future. They have got to deal with the here and now. More than 140,000 EU citizens applied last month to live and work in the UK after Brexit, PAA Media reports. The Home Office said it received 142,300 applications for the EU settlement scheme in November, compared with more than half a million submitted in the previous month. This takes the total number received by the end of November to almost 2.6 million (2,592,800). Overall, the number of applications finalised in that time was more than 2.2 million (2,230,900), according to the Home Office figures (pdf). Of these, 59% were granted permanent leave to remain in the country, called settled status, and 41% were granted pre-settled status \u2013 which means they have temporary leave to remain and would need to apply again for permanent permission at a later date. Sky News has just broadcast some footage of Boris Johnson addressing cabinet for the first time. He told his ministers: The voters of this country have changed this government and our party for the better, and we must repay their trust now by working flat out to change our country for the better. And we should have absolutely no embarrassment about saying we are a people\u2019s government, this is a people\u2019s cabinet, and we are going to be working on delivering the priorities of the British people. And that\u2019s what they want us to do. And we must recognise that people lent us their votes at this election. It was a quite extraordinary, it was a seismic election, but we need to repay their trust and work 24 hours a day, work flat out, to deliver. Of course, the first 100 days were very busy - 140 days, or whatever it was; you may remember it was a very frenetic time \u2013 but you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet, folks. We are going to have to work even harder, because people have a high level of expectation, and we must deliver for them. At this point, treating the cabinet like a bit like a primary school class, Johnson asked his colleagues how many new hospitals they were going to build. Forty, they chanted back at him. (No one was brave enough to point out that it would be more accurate to say just six.) Johnson also asked them to tell him how many new nurses they would hire, and new police officers they would recruit. Then he went on: But there is a huge, huge agenda of delivering social justice, of addressing every problem from social care to homelessness, to levelling up and uniting across our country, with better infrastructure, better education and technology. That\u2019s what we want to do. We are Conservatives; we believe in extending opportunity across the whole of the United Kingdom, and that is what we are going to devote ourselves to. Johnson ended his opening statement by referring to today\u2019s employment figures (see 9.53am), joking about taking the risk of \u201csounding more North Korean than normal\u201d. The economy continued to be robust, he said, but the government would take steps to strengthen it. \u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothing yet\u201d was a Ronald Reagan catchphrase, and Johnson may have been quoting him deliberately. Reagan drew the political map of American by winning the support of blue-collar workers who had previously voted for the other party (\u201cReagan Democrats\u201d) and, although seen as a leader with a poor grasp of detail, he exuded can-do optimism, which people seemed to like. The government has repeatedly said that it does not intend to lower standards on workers\u2019 rights, consumer rights or environmental protection after Brexit. (See 9.37am.) The EU will also wants to ensure that it does not get undercut by the UK in the future, but a key issue in the UK-EU trade talks will be what rules are agreed to ensure this happens. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Liam Fox, the former Conservative international trade secretary, admitted that the EU would start by pushing for \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d - an agreement that, when the EU tightens standards, the UK would follow suit. But Fox argued that, internationally, this sort of approach was going out of fashion. He explained: There\u2019s a wider debate here, and this discussion is part of it. At the WTO meeting in Buenos Aires there was quite a debate about how do we take forward global trade. Is it by aligning all our regulations? That\u2019s what the EU would call harmonisation, a very legalistic model. Or do we go for outcome-based equivalence? In other words, we agree what the standards and outcomes should look like, but we can find our own way, in our own laws and regulations, to get there. That\u2019s the wider debate. The EU very much favours that very legalistic model. The rest of the world favours a more flexible model. Fox was also asked if he thought the NHS would be at risk from a trade deal with the US. He said there was no chance of this whatsoever and that this was a \u201cred herring\u201d that had been dismissed as such by the voters. He said it was now the \u201cnorm\u201d to insert \u201cexemption clauses\u201d into trade deals to protect the running of public services. He went on: That is the norm now, and we have always said that the Government will retain its right to regulate public services in the national interest. That\u2019s what we said in the election. That\u2019s what we will do. What the Labour Party said about the NHS was a lie then, and it\u2019s irrelevant now. During his round of interviews this morning Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, also insisted that the government would protect employment rights when the UK left the EU. He said a bill to this effect would be in the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday. This is from the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom. UK unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 44 years in the three months to October, as the number of unemployed women hit a record low, PA Media reports. However, the reduction in unemployment came as wage growth stalled over the period and the number of job vacancies also shrank. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits decreased by 13,000 to 1.28 million for the quarter, the Office for National Statistics said. It meant the rate of unemployment stayed flat at 3.8%, surpassing analyst expectations, which had forecast an increase to a 3.9% rate of unemployment. This was largely driven by a decrease in the unemployment rate for women, which fell to a record low of 3.5% for the period. Meanwhile, the number of people in work increased by 24,000 to 32.8 million for the quarter, while the proportion of people in employment stayed flat at 76.2%. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has been giving interviews this morning (although not to the Today programme, which is still subject to a No 10 ministerial boycott). As my colleague Kate Proctor reports, on BBC Breakfast Gove refused to explicitly rule out a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition - although he repeatedly insisted that this was not something people needed to worry about anyway, because both sides were committed to reaching a deal before the end of next year. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has said that it was a mistake for Jeremy Corbyn not to say what side he would take in the second referendum Labour was planning to hold on Brexit. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, recorded during the Labour conference in September and broadcast in Kuenssberg\u2019s documentary, The Brexit Storm Continues, going out tonight, Thornberry said: I think Jeremy is trying to find a compromise but if he goes into an election saying \u2018I don\u2019t have a view\u2019 on the single biggest decision that we have to make \u2013 I think \u2013 what worries me is that every single interview he does will all be about Brexit. Asked if Labour could win if Corbyn adopted that position, Thornberry said: Well, I think it makes it more difficult and that\u2019s why I\u2019m really pushing this because I want Jeremy in No 10. Thornberry also said she wanted Labour to be more overtly pro-remain. At the time Corbyn was refusing to say which side he would back in a second referendum. During the election campaign he refined his position, saying he was taking a deliberate decision in advance to stay neutral. Thornberry is likely to stand for the Labour leadership and Brexit is likely to be a key issue in that context. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies, who are rallying behind the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey as their candidate, argue that agreeing to a second referendum was a mistake (although Long-Bailey herself has yet to express a view on this topic.) The biggest threat to Long-Bailey may come from the candidate attracting most Labour remain supporter, either Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, or Thornberry herself. Both Starmer and Thornberry strongly argued for a second referendum, and said that in such a poll they would back remain. On Friday, in a statement in Downing Street after his surprise and overwhelming election victory, Boris Johnson offered an olive branch of sorts to people who voted remain. Addressing specifically those who still wanted to stay in the EU, he said \u201cwe in this one-nation Conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe.\u201d It was hard to know what he meant by that, and this morning many remainers will be concluding \u201cnot much\u201d following the overnight announcement from No 10 that its new version of the withdrawal agreement bill will ban the government from seeking an extension to the Brexit transition. This is a concession to Brexiters and, although it could be argued that the intention is just to intensify pressure for the UK-EU trade deal to be finalised by the end of 2020, it does raise the prospect of the UK falling out of the transition into a no-deal Brexit this time next year if agreement cannot be reached. That is the conclusion of the financial markets. The pound has been falling this morning, wiping out all the gains it made after the election result was announced. This is from the BBC\u2019s economics editor Faisal Islam. My colleague Graeme Wearden has full coverage on his business live blog. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has condemned the government\u2019s move, saying that it is \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d and will put jobs at risk. The government wants to hold a vote on the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill on Friday. Starmer\u2019s comment implies that Labour will vote against it, but the party\u2019s election defeat has opened an intense debate about its Brexit position and others in the party will be arguing that the party should not vote against the bill at second reading. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs a political cabinet, followed by a normal cabinet meeting. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 2pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is due to address the Scottish parliament about the consequences of the election. 2.30pm: The Commons assembles for the first time since the election. MPs will re-elect Sir Lindsay Hoyle as Speaker, and then the swearing-in of MPs starts. 6pm: Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the parliamentary Labour party. The shadow cabinet is also due to meet at some point this morning. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. We plan to publish a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from Villa Park. Enjoy it, and thanks for your company and good humour tonight. See you again soon! Conor Hourihane speaks: \u201cNot easy at the start, they\u2019re a young team and would have been bang up for it. But we weathered the storm and our qualify came out in the end. It was probably a lose-lose so we had to be professional and get over the line. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even asking me, it\u2019s mine [on the first goal]! Kodjia actually said to me he didn\u2019t get a touch.\u201d That\u2019s just the two for Kodjia then, it seems! \u201cMy reaction to this result can be summarised by the first three letters in Doha, followed by an exclamation mark,\u201d says Peter Oh. That second half was mainly a non-event really, though Liverpool kept at it really well. They clearly have some superb players and we will hear a *lot* more of Harvey Elliott, for one. In the end it was a case of the more practised team having what it took to win, and win well. No shame for anyone in how that turned out \u2013 except for the sport of football itself, of course, and the fact we had to witness this in the last eight of a supposedly major tournament. There we go \u2013 Villa are in the semi-finals! With the game\u2019s last action Wesley gets his goal! It\u2019s well taken, running round the ball when sent away on the left of the box, and he\u2019ll be delighted with that. He hasn\u2019t deserved the stick he has taken. 90+1 min: We will only see two minutes of added time. 88 min: \u201cJust to put this in perspective, imagine playing for your school sixth form football team and coming up against these boys,\u201d writes John Davis. \u201cJesus. Probably don\u2019t spend as much time in the Miners\u2019 Arms as we did, though.\u201d Nah, Ipswich School first XI of 1999/2000 would have taken them. 87 min: Trezeguet fluffs a header from a fine cross by his fellow Egyptian, Elmohamady, when he should hit the target. 86 min: Elliott is involved again, teeing up Gallacher for a blast that Nyland bats away. The keeper then clutches Kane\u2019s header on the follow-up. Liverpool are still going and do deserve a goal here, at least. 84 min: Elliott has been really impressive and picks out his team-mate \u2013 didn\u2019t quite see who it was \u2013 again with a wonderfully lofted pass, only for the ball to end up turned into the side netting. We will be seeing a lot more of him; he has looked at ease here. 82 min: The ball finally goes dead and Liverpool can bring on their substitute, James Norris. 79 min: Nope, Hoever\u2019s night is done and DUSTED. There\u2019ll be a replacement on for him soon. 78 min: Lansbury gets an invitation to shoot and accepts it, seeing Kelleher fist his drive away. The keeper has made a number of impressive saves. Hoever is receiving treatment for cramp \u2013 which *sucks*, we\u2019ll all agree \u2013 while Hause replaces Chester. Leighton Clarkson replaces Christie-davies for Liverpool. 75 min: Almost an early assist for Wesley there, but he slides one across goal and just past Trezeguet. That would have helped his confidence. 73 min: Now Kane gets a mite of space and drags one wide from 25 yards. Two-or-perhaps-three-goal hero Kodjia is then replaced by Wesley, who hasn\u2019t scored in nine and could do with one of his own. 71 min: Kelleher makes another good stop, repelling Trezeguet from an angle after the wide man gets around the back. 70 min: A lull after those few relatively action-packed minutes. 67 min: More lovely play from Elliott, who weights his passes so well, sees him float a ball to the back post, where Kane can\u2019t get much power on his header but still forces a useful save from Nyland. 65 min: Liverpool replace Longstaff with Jack Bearne. 64 min: As I write though, it\u2019s nearly five as Trezeguet nudges a long ball beyond Kelleher but can\u2019t get enough on it and a defender shepherds it away from the vacant goal. More Villa possession follows \u2013 and ends with Trezeguet jabbing just over from 12 yards after good work from Kodjia. 63 min: Villa are showing a bit more intent now but, look, this isn\u2019t ending 8-0 and nor is it finishing 4-4. Which leaves us at a bit of a loss. 60 min: Kodjia draws a one-handed stop from Kelleher but is flagged offside so would have been denied a third \u2013 or fourth \u2013 anyway. 57 min: That was a rare bit of action. But Villa get a flag kick of their own now, Kelleher pawing it away before Trezeguet drills well wide from the edge of the area. 55 min: Liverpool win a corner now and work it quickly ... and force a brilliant save from Nyland! It\u2019s half-cleared and drilled back into the six-yard box, where Kane deflects towards goal and watches the keeper somehow make a fine reaction stop! 53 min: Still slow going, although Liverpool did try one skirmish in the Villa box before it was snuffed out. 50 min: Literally nothing has happened here since half-time. I don\u2019t think Villa will go for the rout unless it\u2019s presented to them. 48 min: It\u2019s Dortmund 3-2 Leipzig in the Bundesliga. Dortmund were 2-0 up, pegged back to 2-2, and now Jadon Sancho has scored. Obviously my attention is 100% on this one though. But it\u2019s happening alright, so on we go. The teams are back out for a second half that, let\u2019s be frank, nobody would miss if it didn\u2019t happen. Seems as if Kodjia *did* get a touch on that Hourihane free-kick so, on his first start of the season, he might just have a hat-trick ... And I should have linked to this earlier ... but it\u2019s a superb interview from last year by your friend and mine Ben Fisher with that man Herbie Kane: \u201cWill a Klopp half-time Skype chat have the necessary impact without the hugs?\u201d muses Ian Copestake. It is of course Neil Critchley managing Liverpool today. Meanwhile in Doha ... Yes, this has been very strange. Liverpool\u2019s youngsters started superbly, were caught by two deeply unfortunate sucker punches, but rallied well before conceding nicely-taken third and fourth goals to Kodjia. They\u2019ve played nice stuff and threatened several times, but look very porous when a distinctly patchy Villa do go forward and they\u2019ve paid for that. Now to avoid an absolute tanning. Villa\u2019s best-worked of the bunch, Elmohamady sliding across a precise centre and Kodjia applying a clinical finish. This deeply weird game now stands at 4-0 to Villa. 43 min: Roger Wallace wants you to keep reading in the second half \u2013 \u201cThis scoreline is incredibly harsh on Liverpool\u2019s youngsters, obviously, and you wouldn\u2019t put money on it, but I\u2019m still not completely convinced this is over and something wild doesn\u2019t happen. In any case Liverpool\u2019s academy team should take a bow, because for the most part as a team they\u2019ve been seriously good.\u201d 41 min: Christie-Davies is booked for a heavy tackle on Lansbury. Pretty much the first meaty challenge of the game! I\u2019m sitting right behind Ed, the wag that he is. 40 min: Fuel for the They Don\u2019t Coach Defending Anymore brigade, this. But really this is just a consequence of the fact that, in \u201cmen\u2019s football\u201d, mistakes pay ... and you don\u2019t learn that until it\u2019s happened to you. That\u2019s the game, that. Villa win a 50/50 in midfield and Jota releases Kodjia, who races through and finishes coolly. Very harsh lesson, this, for Liverpool\u2019s youngsters. 36 min: Kane crosses deep towards Hoever but there\u2019s no \u201cDyson\u201d with death for Nyland! He jumps up and collects assuredly. 34 min: No doubt about it, Liverpool continue to be much the better-footballing of these two sides. 32 min: Better from Villa now as a good move gives Hourihane the chance to fizz a ball across goal ... with nobody rushing in to convert. 31 min: Longstaff tries to turn in the box after more creativity from Elliott but he\u2019s snuffed out by Villa\u2019s defence. 28 min: Kodjia dallies on the right of the box with at least two men to square to, causing a few waved arms of frustration. 26 min: Elliott, who looks a luscious prospect already, scoops a wonderfully imaginative pass to Christie-Davies and, on the turn, he volleys \u2013 only to see Nyland tip over! Liverpool are still attacking really well. 25 min: Hoever hoovers \u2013 yes! \u2013 up well as Jota looks to make ground by the left corner flag. 24 min: Kelleher sweeps up well again as Lansbury looks to spring Kodjia away down the inside-right channel. 22 min: Some good possession by Liverpool now. They\u2019ll be properly miffed that Villa have attacked twice and scored twice through efforts that were, on *at least* one of those occasions, intended as crosses. 20 min: Liverpool spring back upfield and force a couple of corners. This is tremendously harsh on them but tonight is all about learning and I guess it\u2019s men against .. errm ... Boyes. And that is soft too. Villa look relieved by the opener and sweep upfield again, working the ball right to the overlapping Elmohamady. His cross flicks off Boyes and loops high into the sky before dropping beyond a helpless Kelleher and into the corner. Ah, it\u2019s soft. Hourihane whips it in low, Kodjia is among those jumping in front of Kelleher and the keeper loses sight of it, diving too late and watching the ball skid past him and into the corner. That\u2019ll settle Villa, who had been unimpressive. 14 min: Now a very dangerous free-kick for Liverpool on the right of the box but about 17 yards from the byline. Hourihane takes aim and ... 13 min: Perhaps there is something in the fact that many of these Liverpol players have worked together for some time, while this is a Villa side thrown together of first-teamers and fringe men. Villa look like strangers. But even then, a lot of Liverpool\u2019s side have been out on loan or joined fairly recently. Kelleher punches a wide free-kick clear in Villa\u2019s first real sortie. 10 min: Close for Liverpool \u2013 twice! Elliott weaves inside and then belts in a left-footer that Nyland, the Villa keeper, bats wide with a flailing hand! It is all Liverpool ... and they almost score again when the corner isn\u2019t cleared and Kane ends up one-on-one with Nyland, who saves again with a leg! Stat. 8 min: Half a sight for Liverpool as Kane receives the ball on the left of the box after some really sloppy Villa defending but flashes his effort only. Villa aren\u2019t really here yet. 6 min: Elliott, stationed on the right, links with Hoever and wins a corner. Liverpool don\u2019t make anything of it but they have definitely started the better here. 4 min: Kelleher, the Liverpool keeper, gets to a loose backpass ahead of Kodjia. Overall it\u2019s been a confident and lively start from Liverpool, who get Elliott on the ball around the box but the attack comes to nothing. 2 min: Liverpool are patiently building from the back, in the modern way. Liverpool and in white and kicking, in your mind\u2019s eye, from left to right. Ok, the teams are on the pitch and we start soon! Fair\u2019s fair though \u2013 I\u2019m looking forward in particular to seeing Harvey Elliott, the exciting attacking whizz who is only 16 and debuted for his old club Fulham at 15. He\u2019s well worth a look and so, among others, is the very highly-rated defender Ki-Jana Hoever. The Haven writes: \u201cWhy the negativity about this tie? We constantly hear about the lack of chances for young players amongst Premier League teams and yet here we have a plethora of young players getting their chance. Also, Liverpool as representatives of England in a world level tournament should be celebrated as such. Less of your browbeating whingeing please!\u201d They should have taken the kids to Doha. This is great, and topical \u2013 when Mark Hughes played for Bayern and Wales on the same day: And so\u2019s this! As Sean Coffey points out: Liverpool\u2019s squad has seven more appearances in the Eredivisie than in the Premier League \u2013 centre-back Sepp Van den Berg has played 22 times for his previous club, Zwolle. He only turns 18 on Friday! \u201cStrange times indeed,\u201d mourns Ian Copestake. \u201cMan Utd were accused of killing the FA Cup by withdrawing from it in 1999 to do the Club Championship thing and boost an England World Cup bid (that Germany won, the bid that is). This time everyone involved is doing the killing in a spirit of agreement and understanding. It is really impressive to see.\u201d Rich\u2019s latest work of genius alludes to the fact that Herbie Kane played 49 times on loan for Donny last season. You do the mathS. Villa haven\u2019t exactly gone full tilt, with the likes of McGinn, Grealish and Wesley all kept in reserve. But this is Liverpool\u2019s youngest-ever team! Aston Villa: Nyland; Elmohamady, Chester, Konsa, Taylor; Lansbury, Douglas Luiz; Jota, Hourihane, Trezeguet; Kodjia. Subs: Kalinic, Guilbert, Hause, McGinn, El Ghazi, Grealish, Wesley. Liverpool: Kelleher; Hoever, Van den Berg, Boyes, Gallacher; Kane, Chirivella, Christie-Davies; Elliott, Longstaff, Hill. Subs: Winterbottom, Clayton, Norris, Clarkson, Dixon-Bonner, Bearne, Stewart. Reaction to this in a few minutes ... Welcome to Aston Villa v A Liverpool XI, brought to you by Everything That Is Bad About Modern Football. Not that you shouldn\u2019t stick around, though, as I do expect this should have some entertainment value. There\u2019s nothing much to lose for Liverpool\u2019s youngsters and fringe players, unless they particularly had their hearts set on a December mini-break benchwarming in Doha, so they\u2019re bound to Play Without Fear; as well as that, you\u2019ll almost certainly get to see a few stars of the future, because some of these kids are absolutely going places, whether at Liverpool or somewhere else.

      "body": "<p>On a night when Liverpool\u2019s next generation hoped to show their readiness for regular action at this level, Aston Villa\u2019s 30-year-old striker Jonathan Kodjia seized his chance to make a similar claim by playing a major part in Conor Hourihane\u2019s opening goal before scoring two himself. That haul, along with an own goal by Morgan Boyes, earned a place in the Carabao Cup semi-final for Villa and taught Liverpool\u2019s youngsters a lesson about the merciless reality of senior football. Wesley rammed the point home by making it 5-0 in stoppage time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/dec/17/aston-villa-v-liverpool-carabao-cup-quarter-final-live\">Aston Villa v Liverpool: Carabao Cup quarter-final \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The scoreline made this seem like a caning but Liverpool were not exactly outclassed so much as defused with mature efficiency and some rotten luck. There were moments, particularly when 16-year-old Harvey Elliott went dribbling, when it seemed like the upstart visitors might just cause a shock. Villa\u2019s goalkeeper, Orjan Nyland, had to make some fine saves.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, Villa made themselves comfortable long before full time and Dean Smith could take satisfaction in seeing Wesley score after being sprung from the bench. The striker\u2019s first goal in 10 matches was the perfect response to the challenge laid down by Kodjia. Thus Villa\u2019s strikers got a timely confidence boost in advance of three Premier League matches with relegation rivals over what promises to be a fraught festive period.</p> <p>Most of Liverpool\u2019s youngsters could take heart from their performances, too. Even the goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher impressed despite being beaten by two soft goals early on.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of the performance,\u201d said Neil Critchley, the Liverpool Under-23 coach who acted as manager for the occasion. \u201cFor large parts of the game we were well in it. I don\u2019t think we did too many things wrong.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>J\u00fcrgen Klopp, watching from Qatar, relayed a similar message, letting the youngsters know at the break they were on the right track despite trailing 4-0. \u201cWe had some information at half-time from the manager,\u201d Critchley said. \u201cHe basically said to keep playing the way we were playing, keep being brave and to keep doing what we were doing.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the youngsters will fly out to Qatar on Wednesday morning to join the first team at the Club World Cup.</p> <p>Rarely in Liverpool\u2019s modern history could they be described as an unknown quantity but their lineup contained several players who might have been asked for ID at the entrance, not so much to check their ages as to establish who they were. Their ages, having said that, were also remarkable as this was the club\u2019s youngest starting lineup, with a few of the players barely old enough to buy a scratch card let alone to compete as equals against Premier League opponents.</p> <p>Villa made 10 alterations to the side who started Saturday\u2019s defeat at Sheffield United but still fielded a side consisting mostly of senior internationals.</p> <p>Smith joked he had to do \u201cFBI detective work\u201d before the game to get an idea of how Liverpool would play, yet for the first 10 minutes it looked like his team might get caught cold.</p> <p>Nyland had to make two fine saves early on. First he turned away a shot by Elliott, then denied Herbie Kane from close range after a clever chipped pass by Isaac Christie-Davies.</p> <p>But soon Liverpool\u2019s novices were shown how unforgiving top-level football can be. First, Hourihane opened the scoring direct from a free-kick wide on the right.

      "bodyText": "On a night when Liverpool\u2019s next generation hoped to show their readiness for regular action at this level, Aston Villa\u2019s 30-year-old striker Jonathan Kodjia seized his chance to make a similar claim by playing a major part in Conor Hourihane\u2019s opening goal before scoring two himself. That haul, along with an own goal by Morgan Boyes, earned a place in the Carabao Cup semi-final for Villa and taught Liverpool\u2019s youngsters a lesson about the merciless reality of senior football. Wesley rammed the point home by making it 5-0 in stoppage time. The scoreline made this seem like a caning but Liverpool were not exactly outclassed so much as defused with mature efficiency and some rotten luck. There were moments, particularly when 16-year-old Harvey Elliott went dribbling, when it seemed like the upstart visitors might just cause a shock. Villa\u2019s goalkeeper, Orjan Nyland, had to make some fine saves. Ultimately, though, Villa made themselves comfortable long before full time and Dean Smith could take satisfaction in seeing Wesley score after being sprung from the bench. The striker\u2019s first goal in 10 matches was the perfect response to the challenge laid down by Kodjia. Thus Villa\u2019s strikers got a timely confidence boost in advance of three Premier League matches with relegation rivals over what promises to be a fraught festive period. Most of Liverpool\u2019s youngsters could take heart from their performances, too. Even the goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher impressed despite being beaten by two soft goals early on. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of the performance,\u201d said Neil Critchley, the Liverpool Under-23 coach who acted as manager for the occasion. \u201cFor large parts of the game we were well in it. I don\u2019t think we did too many things wrong.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp, watching from Qatar, relayed a similar message, letting the youngsters know at the break they were on the right track despite trailing 4-0. \u201cWe had some information at half-time from the manager,\u201d Critchley said. \u201cHe basically said to keep playing the way we were playing, keep being brave and to keep doing what we were doing.\u201d Some of the youngsters will fly out to Qatar on Wednesday morning to join the first team at the Club World Cup. Rarely in Liverpool\u2019s modern history could they be described as an unknown quantity but their lineup contained several players who might have been asked for ID at the entrance, not so much to check their ages as to establish who they were. Their ages, having said that, were also remarkable as this was the club\u2019s youngest starting lineup, with a few of the players barely old enough to buy a scratch card let alone to compete as equals against Premier League opponents. Villa made 10 alterations to the side who started Saturday\u2019s defeat at Sheffield United but still fielded a side consisting mostly of senior internationals. Smith joked he had to do \u201cFBI detective work\u201d before the game to get an idea of how Liverpool would play, yet for the first 10 minutes it looked like his team might get caught cold. Nyland had to make two fine saves early on. First he turned away a shot by Elliott, then denied Herbie Kane from close range after a clever chipped pass by Isaac Christie-Davies. But soon Liverpool\u2019s novices were shown how unforgiving top-level football can be. First, Hourihane opened the scoring direct from a free-kick wide on the right. He curled the ball into the net with his left foot past his compatriot Kelleher, who seemed to be distracted by Kodjia\u2019s attempt to get a touch on the ball as it approached. Kelleher\u2019s luck worsened three minutes later, when a cross from the right by Ahmed Elmohamady took a huge deflection off Boyes and looped into the net. Liverpool enjoyed no such fortune a few minutes later when Ki-Jana Hoever\u2019s shot from the edge of the area took a nick off a defender and flew wide. By now Villa were engaged in wily game-management but their opponents occasionally rattled them. Elliot was a delightful pest with his wriggly dribbles and cute touches. In the 26th minute he scooted down the right before dinking a lovely pass between two defenders to Christie-Davies, who met it on the volley 10 yards out. Nyland batted away the shot. Villa scored a third in the 37th minute when Jota pounced on a hefty touch by Sepp van den Berg and slipped a pass through to Kodjia, whose finish did no harm to his cause of trying to take the place of Wesley in Villa\u2019s starting lineup. He gave that prospect an even bigger boost just before the break, when he flicked the ball into the net from six yards after neat work by Jota and Elmohamady. Villa saw no need to overexert themselves in the second half but Liverpool\u2019s players yearned for a goal to show for their effort. Kane almost got one in the 55th minute but Nyland denied him with a superb reflex save. Then Kelleher had some joy at the other end, tipping away a low shot by Kodjia. Kelleher later denied Mohamed Trezeguet and Henri Lansbury. B ut he could not stop Wesley from adding a late fifth. Smith pointed out that Liverpool were not the only ones fielding young men trying to forge a career in difficult circumstances: \u201cWesley is a 23-year-old player in a foreign country in one of the toughest leagues in the world,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSome of the criticism can be too harsh at times.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden is a \u201chealthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male \u2026 fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency\u201d, the former vice-president\u2019s doctor said in records released by his campaign on Tuesday. Biden \u201cdoes not use any tobacco products, does not drink alcohol at all, and he works out at least five days per week\u201d, Dr Kevin C O\u2019Connor added. Should he win the White House in 2020, Biden would be the oldest president elected for the first time, surpassing Donald Trump. The current occupant of the Oval Office was 70 at the time of his inauguration in January 2017. Biden has a healthy lead in national polls of the Democratic presidential field. But Trump, with the nickname \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d, has led the way in questioning Biden\u2019s fitness for the rigors of an election and occupancy of the most powerful political position on earth. Biden\u2019s stumbles and stutters on the debate stage and campaign trail have been relentlessly parsed. In return, he has emphasized his fitness by recounting stories of facing down bullies, challenging hecklers and reporters to athletic contests and, at least early in his campaign, offering Trump a physical fight. Trump\u2019s own health has been the subject of relentless speculation, not least around the release of ebullient descriptions of his health by his personal doctor, Harold Bornstein \u2013 later revealed to have been written by Trump himself \u2013 and White House physician Ronny Jackson. After an unscheduled visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland last month, Trump, now 73, addressed and denied speculation he had a heart attack. O\u2019Connor, director of executive medicine at GW Medical Faculty Associates, was Biden\u2019s doctor when he was vice-president to Barack Obama. In the three-page summary released on Tuesday, he said the former VP was being treated for \u201cnon-valvular atrial fibrillation (A-Fib), hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux and seasonal allergies\u201d. He also detailed the surgery Biden underwent in 1988 for a cerebral aneurysm, which revealed another. Both were repaired, the records said, and Biden \u201chas never had any recurrences\u201d. Biden\u2019s hospitalisation, O\u2019Connor wrote, \u201cwas complicated by deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism\u201d. Biden has also had prostate surgery, though he has not had prostate cancer, and had his gall bladder removed in 2003. He has been treated for \u201cvarious sports medicine and orthopaedic injuries\u201d. Dr O\u2019Connor also said Biden has had several non-melanoma skin cancers removed, is nearly 6ft, weighs 178lbs, has a blood pressure of 128/84 and a cholesterol reading of 126. Biden\u2019s closest competitors for the Democratic nomination include the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who is 78 and recently had a heart attack, and the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who is 70. Earlier this month, Warren released a letter from her doctor which described her as \u201cvery healthy\u201d. Sanders has promised to release records by the end of the year.",

So when there is such a reaction I take it very seriously and I apologise to any reader who is angered or upset by the piece.\u201d He said the article \u201creflects an argument about the origins and utility of the notion of Islamophobia, as opposed to anti-Muslim bigotry\u201d, adding that he would be publishing a number of opposing views. Last month, the newspaper was forced by the press regulator IPSO to issue a correction after it could not substantiate claims made in an article about alleged bullying of Jewish MP Louise Ellman, then with Labour, in Liverpool by a party activist. The regulator concluded the Jewish Chronicle \u201chad not been able to demonstrate that it had taken care over the accuracy of the article\u201d on certain points, and its conduct during the subsequent investigation had been \u201cunacceptable\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 18 December. Top stories First Nations people fear becoming Australia\u2019s first climate refugees as global heating threatens their survival. Alice Springs had 55 days above 40C in the year to July 2019, while central Australian outstations are running out of water and poor-quality housing in town camps cannot be cooled effectively. Indigenous leaders fear extreme heat will cause an influx of internal refugees. \u201cCentral Australian Aboriginal people are very resilient,\u201d says Josie Douglas, manager of policy and research at the Central Land Council. \u201cBut there are limits. Without action to stop climate change, people will be forced to leave their country and leave behind much of what makes them Aboriginal.\u201d Meanwhile, December heat records are expected to be broken across Australia from Wednesday, as a heatwave moves across South Australia to Victoria and New South Wales. Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for last week\u2019s disastrous UK election results in his first meeting with Labour MPs since losing the election, saying \u201cI am very sorry for the result, for which I take responsibility\u201d. Many Corbyn-sceptic MPs were incensed that the leader had not said sorry for the loss of 60 MPs across the north, Midlands, Scotland and Wales, although he had previously said he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d and was \u201cvery sad\u201d. There was particular anger among losing candidates that they had had no direct communication \u2013 neither an apology nor a note of thanks \u2013 from the leadership after losing their seats. Meanwhile, the pound has given up the gains made since the general election after Boris Johnson said he would write Britain\u2019s exit from the EU next year into law without an extension in the transition period. Donald Trump has sent a six-page letter to House speaker Nancy Pelosi condemning the impeachment inquiry, calling it an \u201cunprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power\u201d. The letter reads much like Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, complete with exclamation points and accusations of Democrats \u201cdeclaring open war on American Democracy\u201d. The US president goes on to claim he has done nothing wrong in regards to his actions toward Ukraine, predicting Democrats will suffer electoral losses next year as a result of the inquiry. It came after Mitch McConnell rebuffed a Democratic request to call new impeachment witnesses and dismissed the process as a \u201csloppy \u2026 fishing expedition\u201d. Australia Australians are less split on partisan lines than Americans on whether they accept the need to act on climate change, and are far more likely regardless of party allegiance to be willing to pay a carbon tax to cut fossil fuel use, according to a new study. Researchers found 78% of Australians supported reducing fossil fuel use and 64% raising taxes to help do that. Climate change has reduced Australian farms\u2019 average annual profitability by 22% in two decades \u2013 or around $18,600 per farm \u2013 a report from the agriculture department says. Acting prime minister Michael McCormack defied a Senate order to produce documents relating to the government\u2019s troubled regional grants program, despite early advice from the department suggesting information should be released. The world Pope Francis has announced sweeping changes to the way the Roman Catholic church deals with cases of sexual abuse of children, abolishing the rule of pontifical secrecy that previously covered them. Rainwater in some parts of the US contains high enough levels of potentially toxic substances to possibly affect human health and may, if found in drinking water, be high enough in some cases to trigger regulatory action. Charlize Theron has spoken in detail about her experience of sexual harassment at the start of her acting career, saying she found it frustrating that she \u201cdidn\u2019t do all of those things that we so want to believe we\u2019ll do in those situations\u201d. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan\u2019s former military leader, has been sentenced to death for high treason and subverting the country\u2019s constitution. The first woman to be elected mayor of Colombia\u2019s capital city has married her partner in a private civil ceremony before taking office.

      "body": "<p>The deckchairs had been well and truly rearranged on the Tory benches. Too many MPs and not nearly enough seats. A few old-timers looked visibly displeased that some young upstarts had nicked their usual places. Desmond Swayne had been shunted right to the very back \u2013 well out of sight of the TV cameras without which he doesn\u2019t know he exists \u2013 and resorted to vaulting over a 6ft barricade to make sure he could leave at the same time as his friends \u2013 an activity that almost left the Tory MP with a broken back. Boris Johnson wasn\u2019t too bothered. With a majority of 80 he can afford a little collateral damage.</p> <p>There were no such problems on the Labour benches where everyone pretty much had two spaces to themselves. Harriet Harman briefly commandeered Dennis Skinner\u2019s old place. The Beast of Camberwell. Maybe not. Emily Thornberry kept turning round, as if still unable to believe that so many old comrades would not be returning. Or perhaps she was just hustling for a good libel lawyer.</p> <p>All the other Labour MPs appeared to be at different stages of grief. Some were angry, others in denial. Most were just depressed. None had yet reached acceptance. That may take years.</p> <p>The only cheers that greeted the arrival of Jeremy Corbyn came from the Tory benches: after all, he\u2019d done more to guarantee a Conservative victory than any cabinet minister. No Labour MP could even bring themselves to look him in the eye. Corbyn appeared physically and mentally crushed: his movements reduced to robotic jerks, his speech a listless monotone. A man with severe PTSD being pushed into going through the motions so that others can fight over his legacy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/woman-likely-to-lead-labour-jostling-to-succeed-jeremy-corbyn-begins\">The race is on \u2026 and the next Labour leader is likely to be a woman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a brief interlude for some Black Rod ceremonials, Lindsay Hoyle allowed himself to be re-elected as Speaker. For the occasion, his old friend and constituency neighbour, Lisa Nandy, to proposed him. She needed no second invitation to use the opportunity as a can\u2019t-even-be-bothered-to-disguise leadership bid. The north of England had been left behind for too long. Things had to change. \u201cWe can feel the ground crumbling,\u201d she said. And the old guard couldn\u2019t be buried under the rumble soon enough. Corbyn choked. He could feel the build-up of dust in his throat already. None of Nandy\u2019s main rivals for the leadership: Rebecca Long-Bailey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/keir-starmer-labour-leadership-pitch-radical-government\">Keir Starmer</a> and Angela Rayner, were in the chamber to hear her. They were on manoeuvres elsewhere in Westminster.</p> <p>Hoyle was dragged \u2013 not in the slightest bit reluctantly \u2013 to the Speaker\u2019s chair by Nandy and Tory Nigel Evans. There was a poignancy here. Less than two months ago, it had been Caroline Flint who had done the honours. Now she was just a distant voice, struggling to be heard in the Labour echo chamber. Not waving but drowning. Soon the waters would close over her and the only trace of her existence inside Westminster would be a few ripples on the surface.</p> <p>Huge roars greeted Boris Johnson as he rose to welcome the new Speaker. Mostly from his own frontbench as they tried to outcompete one another in their displays of loyalty. They have all read the runes. They know that Dominic Cummings is hellbent on massively reducing the numbers of ministers attending cabinet and are desperate not to be the ones in line for a cull.</p> <p>At the first cabinet meeting, Boris had openly taunted his ministers by getting them to repeat his own lies on camera. A lie shared is a lie not just halved but twisted into truth. \u201cHow many hospitals are we going to build?\u201d he bellowed. \u201c40,\u201d they all yelled back, knowing they were lying through their teeth. Well, all but needy Matt Hancock, who squeaked \u201c41\u201d. Or maybe even 42. Toadying is Matt\u2019s Meaning of Life.</p> <p>The prime minister tried not to look too Smuggy McSmugFace as he delivered his speechlet. But even then he couldn\u2019t prevent the odd, entitled smirk from crossing his face.

      "bodyText": "The deckchairs had been well and truly rearranged on the Tory benches. Too many MPs and not nearly enough seats. A few old-timers looked visibly displeased that some young upstarts had nicked their usual places. Desmond Swayne had been shunted right to the very back \u2013 well out of sight of the TV cameras without which he doesn\u2019t know he exists \u2013 and resorted to vaulting over a 6ft barricade to make sure he could leave at the same time as his friends \u2013 an activity that almost left the Tory MP with a broken back. Boris Johnson wasn\u2019t too bothered. With a majority of 80 he can afford a little collateral damage. There were no such problems on the Labour benches where everyone pretty much had two spaces to themselves. Harriet Harman briefly commandeered Dennis Skinner\u2019s old place. The Beast of Camberwell. Maybe not. Emily Thornberry kept turning round, as if still unable to believe that so many old comrades would not be returning. Or perhaps she was just hustling for a good libel lawyer. All the other Labour MPs appeared to be at different stages of grief. Some were angry, others in denial. Most were just depressed. None had yet reached acceptance. That may take years. The only cheers that greeted the arrival of Jeremy Corbyn came from the Tory benches: after all, he\u2019d done more to guarantee a Conservative victory than any cabinet minister. No Labour MP could even bring themselves to look him in the eye. Corbyn appeared physically and mentally crushed: his movements reduced to robotic jerks, his speech a listless monotone. A man with severe PTSD being pushed into going through the motions so that others can fight over his legacy. After a brief interlude for some Black Rod ceremonials, Lindsay Hoyle allowed himself to be re-elected as Speaker. For the occasion, his old friend and constituency neighbour, Lisa Nandy, to proposed him. She needed no second invitation to use the opportunity as a can\u2019t-even-be-bothered-to-disguise leadership bid. The north of England had been left behind for too long. Things had to change. \u201cWe can feel the ground crumbling,\u201d she said. And the old guard couldn\u2019t be buried under the rumble soon enough. Corbyn choked. He could feel the build-up of dust in his throat already. None of Nandy\u2019s main rivals for the leadership: Rebecca Long-Bailey, Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, were in the chamber to hear her. They were on manoeuvres elsewhere in Westminster. Hoyle was dragged \u2013 not in the slightest bit reluctantly \u2013 to the Speaker\u2019s chair by Nandy and Tory Nigel Evans. There was a poignancy here. Less than two months ago, it had been Caroline Flint who had done the honours. Now she was just a distant voice, struggling to be heard in the Labour echo chamber. Not waving but drowning. Soon the waters would close over her and the only trace of her existence inside Westminster would be a few ripples on the surface. Huge roars greeted Boris Johnson as he rose to welcome the new Speaker. Mostly from his own frontbench as they tried to outcompete one another in their displays of loyalty. They have all read the runes. They know that Dominic Cummings is hellbent on massively reducing the numbers of ministers attending cabinet and are desperate not to be the ones in line for a cull. At the first cabinet meeting, Boris had openly taunted his ministers by getting them to repeat his own lies on camera. A lie shared is a lie not just halved but twisted into truth. \u201cHow many hospitals are we going to build?\u201d he bellowed. \u201c40,\u201d they all yelled back, knowing they were lying through their teeth. Well, all but needy Matt Hancock, who squeaked \u201c41\u201d. Or maybe even 42. Toadying is Matt\u2019s Meaning of Life. The prime minister tried not to look too Smuggy McSmugFace as he delivered his speechlet. But even then he couldn\u2019t prevent the odd, entitled smirk from crossing his face. Appearing like a man who actually intends to deliver on his promises is going to be a lot harder than managing the Conservative party for someone who doesn\u2019t have a generous bone in his body. His whole life has been an act of thoughtless self-indulgence and self-promotion. Caring about others is a totally alien mindset.

      "bodyText": "The foreign secretary Dominic Raab has appealed directly to the American woman who drove the car that killed the motorcyclist Harry Dunn to return to the UK to face justice. Speaking after his second meeting with the 17-year-old\u2019s bereaved family, Raab said: \u201cI appeal to Anne Sacoolas herself to do the right thing. If there is a charging decision from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), I urge her to come back to the United Kingdom and cooperate with the criminal justice process.\u201d Raab also said he would complete a change to the rules surrounding diplomatic immunity for staff that work at RAF Croughton, the airbase where Sacoolas\u2019s husband worked. She has admitted she was driving on the wrong side of the road after only a few weeks in the UK when she collided with Dunn\u2019s motorbike in August, fatally injuring him. Soon after the crash, the Donald Trump administration flew Sacoolas and her family back to the US claiming diplomatic immunity. News of her flight abroad was kept from the Dunn family for as long as 10 days. Raab met Dunn\u2019s family at the Foreign Office on Tuesday. The family are waiting to see if the CPS will bring some form of dangerous driving charge against Sacoolas. The Dunn family say they cannot start the grieving process until she has faced justice. Relations between the family and Raab have been deteriorating over recent months as Dunn\u2019s lawyers applied for judicial review over the Foreign Office\u2019s decision-making process. The family are also seeking to start a legal action in the US against Sacoolas . The Dunn family said Tuesday\u2019s meeting with Raab had been much warmer and more helpful than their previous encounter, with the family spokesman Radd Seiger even claiming it was \u201cthe best day of the campaign so far\u201d. In a statement the foreign secretary said he appreciated the family\u2019s pain and welcomed the chance to address their concerns. He added: \u201cWe are united in our determination to get justice for Harry. The government will do everything it can. I also reaffirmed my commitment to conclude the review of the arrangements at RAF Croughton by the end of the year to ensure they cannot be used in this way again .\u201d In a marked change in tone, Seiger described the meeting with Raab as a \u201cwarm, constructive and positive dialogue\u201d, but trained his criticism on the delays in a charging decision by the CPS.

Seiger said \u201cThe US has never ever turned down an extradition request from the UK and there is no good why this should be turned down.\u201d He reported that Raab had told them that he had spoken forcefully to the US secretary of state Mike Pompeo on the issue of extradition on the sidelines of the recent Nato meeting in London. Sacoolas\u2019s husband was an intelligence officer, and Pompeo, as a former head of the CIA, may be under pressure not to see her extradited or set some precedent about claims for diplomatic immunity. But Seiger vowed \u201cThis campaign is not going to stop until Ann Sacoolas is back in this country facing justice.\u201d",

Surburban rail services were also hit, with some lines only running during morning and evening rush hour periods.

      "bodyText": "Police fired teargas and charged at demonstrators in central Paris as hundreds of thousands of protesters across the country staged a show of force against the government\u2019s controversial pension reform plans. The violence erupted at Place de la Nation, one of Paris\u2019s biggest squares, as riot police attempted to disperse protesters. Police said they had charged after coming under a hail of paving stones and missiles. There were 27 arrests by late afternoon. French authorities said there were 615,000 protesters on the streets across France on Tuesday, compared with 806,000 on 5 December, the first major day of action against the controversial reforms. The unions suggested the final figure was likely to be nearer to 1 million people. As a prelude to the day of action, employees at France\u2019s electricity grid operator, RTE, deliberately cut supplies to tens of thousands of homes in the south-west of the country on Monday evening. As many as 50,000 homes in the Gironde area were reportedly briefly left in the dark. Afterwards, staff reportedly cut off about 37,000 properties in Lyon. The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, who will meet union leaders on Wednesday, told the national assembly on Tuesday the government would not cave in on the controversial pension reforms, which he said were aimed at introducing a \u201cuniversal\u201d system. \u201cMy determination, and that of the government and that of the entire majority, is total,\u201d Philippe said. On the other side, the unions were equally determined. Philippe Martinez, the general secretary of the powerful and hardline CGT union, told journalists. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing so much bullshit \u2026 ever since Emmanuel Macron arrived he\u2019s done nothing except to divide our citizens. It\u2019s scandalous.\u201d In the rally that marched through Paris, a group of protesters brandished a large poster of Macron dressed in regal robes and wig. \u201cRestoration of the French monarchy,\u201d it read. Tuesday was the 13th day of transport strikes in France that have have severely disrupted rail, metro, tram and air services. The walkouts are part of a continuing battle by workers across all sectors, but particularly those working in public transport, against the government\u2019s proposed pension reforms. Macron pledged to shake up the country\u2019s complex pension system in his 2017 election campaign and has spent almost two years consulting union and business leaders in an unsuccessful attempt to reach a compromise. In 1995 an attempt by the ex-president Jacques Chirac and his prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, to reform pensions led to three weeks of crippling strikes and the government ended up backing down. On Tuesday, half of Paris\u2019s metro lines were closed and all except two lines with driverless lines were severely disrupted. Surburban rail services were also hit, with some lines only running during morning and evening rush hour periods. Protesters blockaded bus depots until they were dispersed by police. Many schools in the city were closed or cancelled classes either because teachers were on strike or because they could not reach work. Only 25% of high-speed TGV services and 5% of intercity trains were running across the country. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the rail operator SNCF said 50% to 60% of trains would run this weekend, the start of the Christmas holidays. Thousands of protesters flanked by riot police and gendarmes gathered to march between Place de la R\u00e9publique and Place de la Nation, two of the capital\u2019s main squares. France\u2019s biggest trade union, the moderate CFDT, officially joined the protests for the first time after formally rejecting the pension reforms announced by Philippe last Wednesday. Protesters also gathered in Lyon. In Paris, parking was suspended along the route of the demonstration and many shops, banks, restaurants, caf\u00e9s and businesses shut. The Eiffel Tower was closed. \u00c9lisabeth Borne, the minister for ecological transition, said the deliberate electricity cuts were \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cThey are against the principles of public service and have nothing to do with the constitutionally guaranteed right to strike. Fortunately, these acts are carried out by a small minority,\u201d she said. Francis Casanova, a CGT delegate at RTE, said the government should \u201ctake this as a first warning\u201d and threatened \u201cmore massive cuts\u201d. \u201c\u201dWe consider it\u2019s not spite, but a way for RTE staff to show that if there\u2019s electricity in this country it\u2019s because they go to work every day,\u201d Casanova added. He said the CGT was taking \u201cthis action ... because there\u2019s no question of taking an unprecedented step backwards on pensions\u201d. Macron wants to introduce a \u201cuniversal\u201d pension system based on points, in place of the more than 40 different pension schemes currently operating in France. Ministers argue the new system will be fairer overall, especially for women on low pensions who take time out of work to have and raise children. Workers say the government wants to make them work longer for less and the reforms will take away hard-won rights, particularly for those in demanding jobs who enjoy special privileges, including early retirement on full pensions. On Monday, hundreds of hospital doctors threatened to resign in a separate funding row. The controversy was further muddied by the resignation of Macron\u2019s pensions chief, Jean-Paul Delevoye, who was forced to stand down after he was accused of failing to declare more than \u20ac120,000 from private sector appointments while earning a government salary. Paris\u2019s fire brigade said accidents involving bicycles, motorcycles and scooters in Paris have soared by 40% as residents take to alternative means of transport. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 December 2019. It had said that workers in precarious jobs enjoyed special privileges, but in fact it is workers with demanding jobs.",

An independent review of the company published on Tuesday found Persimmon had a \u201csystemic nationwide failure\u201d to install fire-stopping cavity barriers. Persimmon has been at the centre of political and public anger over the poor quality of its homes and the vast bonus paid to its former boss Jeff Fairburn The review, which the company commissioned following a deluge of customer complaints, said the failure to meet minimum building standards was \u201ca manifestation of poor culture\u201d at the firm. The report by Stephanie Barwise, QC of law firm Atkin Chambers, who also represents victims of the Grenfell fire disaster, urged the firm\u2019s directors to \u201creconsider Persimmon\u2019s purpose and ambition\u201d. \u201cPersimmon has a nationwide problem of missing and/or incorrectly installed cavity barriers in its timber-frame properties\u201d, the review said. The report added that while the firm had reacted quickly when this problem had been identified, it had only inspected the eaves of properties, and not assessed whether the same problem was occurring in party walls and around windows and doors. The failure to install cavity barriers in timber-frame buildings poses a significant fire risk, and has been reported as a key reason for the rapid spread of fire in a block of flats in Worcester Park, south London. Persimmon has now undertaken more than 16,000 inspections to check cavity barriers have been correctly installed. The company said it would take all reasonable action to identify and remediate every house that has been affected. The review found a \u201cculture of non-observance\u201d to safety checks, and said staff treated them as a \u201cmere box-ticking exercise ... stemming from a belief that any single stage is not important, as another check or inspection will follow later\u201d. \u201cThere is a need for a fundamental change in Persimmon\u2019s culture to ensure that quality of build and customer service are central to its approach to business and its corporate identity,\u201d the report said. \u201cPersimmon\u2019s culture must change: many of Persimmon\u2019s employees, customers and stakeholders wish Persimmon to change, and in a changing regulatory environment, Persimmon cannot afford the stigma of a corporate culture which results in poor workmanship and a potentially unsafe product.\u201d The report concluded Persimmon \u201chas traditionally been more a land assembler and seller of houses rather than a housebuilder\u201d, and said the company\u2019s former leaders were motivated by bonuses that \u201cwere widely perceived as excessive\u201d. Fairburn had been in line for a \u00a3110m bonus in 2018 before it was scaled back to \u00a375m amid political and public outrage. The wider management team had been set to collect about \u00a3500m worth of bonus shares.

The Barwise review said Persimmon should make sure its bonus and pay policies are \u201cconsistent with its purpose and strategy, and the culture it is seeking to foster\u201d. Persimmon\u2019s chairman Roger Devlin said the company was now \u201cprioritising the customer over the pure profit motive\u201d. \u201cThe review clearly shows that the surest route to improved customer satisfaction is through the delivery of consistent build quality and service and we acknowledge that we still have work to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we focus hard on the changes that we are making, I would like to take this opportunity to apologise once again to those Persimmon customers who have been affected in the past.\u201d Persimmon\u2019s latest annual profit topped \u00a31bn, the biggest ever made by a UK housebuilder, and a large chunk of that was related to the taxpayer-funded help-to-buy scheme.

I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird recently \u2013 now that it has been adapted for theatre and will soon arrive in London\u2019s West End \u2013 and realised how much my perspective on the book has changed. Yes, lawyer Atticus Finch chooses to defend an innocent black man in the highly racist environment of the Jim Crow US south. But he also tells his children to remain neutral in the face of bigotry, making sure they empathise with racists by trying to \u201ccrawl around in someone else\u2019s skin\u201d. If you see the play you will find that the scriptwriter, Aaron Sorkin, has zoned in on how problematic an assertion that was. There is a more mainstream understanding now \u2013 though oppressed minorities have always known it \u2013 that attempting to remain \u201cneutral\u201d in the face of abuses is rarely a neutral act. The world of sport, it seems, has not got the memo. Arsenal are the latest football club to fall foul of a reality in which globalisation means access to lucrative new markets, but also access to new problems such as international human rights. Earlier this week, the Arsenal midfielder Mesut \u00d6zil echoed highly legitimate claims from multiple groups at the United Nations on the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China. A group of 23 nations, including the US, Canada, Japan and the UK, cited as credible reports of mass detention and numbers of other human rights violations and abuses in the region. The Human Rights Council and Committee on the Elimination of Racism agreed. In other words, allegations about the treatment of Uighur Muslims are hard to dismiss \u2013 as China as attempted to do \u2013 as \u201cfake news\u201d. In 2017 Fifa and its members \u2013 including the Football Association \u2013 publicly stated its adherence to global human rights standards. So you might think that individual players would find themselves on relatively safe territory here. But no. Arsenal quickly hung their player out to dry for his tweet, attempting a dodgy claim at neutrality. \u201cThe content published is \u00d6zil\u2019s personal opinion,\u201d the club said in a statement. \u201cAs a football club, Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics.\u201d Never mind that, by issuing a statement claiming not to comment on human rights abuses, Arsenal are quite obviously involving themselves in politics \u2013 the wrong side of politics. It\u2019s easy to see why. The broadcast rights for the Premier League in China alone are worth \u00a3560m a year. Opportunities from Chinese investors are enormous \u2013 as Manchester City, Manchester United, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth have already discovered. And the entire Premier League is reportedly anxious about the Chinese state broadcaster scrapping coverage of the Arsenal match last weekend after \u00d6zil\u2019s comments. \u00d6zil will have known that he would take a personal hit to his 4 million Chinese social media fans too, some of whom are reportedly burning his shirts. But he spoke out anyway. The greatest sports icons always take a stand when they see an injustice. Born in the 1980s, I know about the 1968 Mexico City Olympics not because of the performances per se, but because medallists Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists in a black power salute. When I think of Muhammad Ali as \u201cthe greatest\u201d, it\u2019s because of his defiance, refusing conscription to Vietnam in a move that was devastating for his career but in hindsight quite clearly on the right side of history. When I talked to Sorkin about why he had felt the need to update the character of Finch, he cited the NFL star Colin Kaepernick, who refused to stand during the US national anthem in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. \u00d6zil may not be in their league. His affection for Turkey\u2019s authoritarian president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2013 who was best man at \u00d6zil\u2019s recent wedding \u2013 is inconvenient to say the least.

Why else would Arsenal be relaxed about one of its players violating its \u201cno politics\u201d policy in the UK \u2013 as its fallback H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn did with a #FuckBoris tweet to his 1.8 million followers on election day \u2013 while panicking over a far less subjective missive from \u00d6zil?

Apparently this is meant to reassure voters and show Brussels that Britain means business. In reality it proves that the Tories learned nothing from the article 50 negotiations or have forgotten that the ticking clock favours the bigger, better prepared side in trade talks. Without an extended transition, the UK will have to choose between quick and total capitulation to EU demands as the price for low-friction trade or being shut out of the single market.</p> <p>Johnson can play these reckless games confident that Brexit will slide down the news agenda once legal separation is complete at the end of January. His election mandate is as much an instruction to Westminster to stop banging on about Brexit as a demand that the task itself be complete. Labour is currently feeling too jilted by leave voters to dare raising its already dampened pro-European voice.</p> <p>One variable in this equation is the cohort of Tory MPs who have just been elected in those former Labour heartlands. They will be ultra-loyal to Johnson for now, owing their seats to his campaign. But over time, they will feel a tension between their constituents\u2019 interests and a Brexit model conceived by the older breed of southern, pinstriped Conservative Eurosceptics. Workington Tories may be pro-Brexit, but that does not mean they are acolytes of the ideology that scorns state intervention as an affront to liberty and treats worker protections as shackles on the spirit of buccaneering enterprise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/17/rightwing-strongman-boris-johnson-india-us-brazil-truth\">Another rightwing strongman has won \u2013 but there is hope for a different future | Priyamvada Gopal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson is not wedded to that creed but he has built a career flattering audiences that are.

In reality it proves that the Tories learned nothing from the article 50 negotiations or have forgotten that the ticking clock favours the bigger, better prepared side in trade talks. Without an extended transition, the UK will have to choose between quick and total capitulation to EU demands as the price for low-friction trade or being shut out of the single market. Johnson can play these reckless games confident that Brexit will slide down the news agenda once legal separation is complete at the end of January. His election mandate is as much an instruction to Westminster to stop banging on about Brexit as a demand that the task itself be complete. Labour is currently feeling too jilted by leave voters to dare raising its already dampened pro-European voice. One variable in this equation is the cohort of Tory MPs who have just been elected in those former Labour heartlands. They will be ultra-loyal to Johnson for now, owing their seats to his campaign. But over time, they will feel a tension between their constituents\u2019 interests and a Brexit model conceived by the older breed of southern, pinstriped Conservative Eurosceptics. Workington Tories may be pro-Brexit, but that does not mean they are acolytes of the ideology that scorns state intervention as an affront to liberty and treats worker protections as shackles on the spirit of buccaneering enterprise. Johnson is not wedded to that creed but he has built a career flattering audiences that are. His only core belief is entitlement to power, which gives him political agility but not empathy. He grasps the strategic value of adapting Conservatism to a new electoral base, but will feel no moral urgency about the task. If it comes down to a choice between serving the traditional Tory base that brought him this far and cultivating the new electoral terrain that opened up for him last week, which would he prefer? His supporters say no such dilemma exists; that \u201cBoris\u201d possesses the unique political gift of cakeism (having it and eating it); that Brexit will be done in a way that unites Workington and Wokingham under one Tory banner. Is that possible? Can Johnson pull it off? The precedents are mixed. The electoral record warns against underestimating him. The record of everything between those victories warns against trusting him. Promises will be broken. The unknown quantities are how many, how soon and how long he will get away with it. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

The housing charity\u2019s figure, which is likely to understate the true level of homelessness because it does not count people who are sofa-surfing or living in sheds or tents, is 3,600 higher than in 2018, and up 23,000 since 2017. London continues to be the centre of homelessness, accounting for 170,000 of the total England figure. One in every 52 people in the capital are homeless, with the borough of Newham, where one in 24 are homeless, being worst hit. Some of the other highest rates of homelessness were in Birmingham (where one in 66 residents are homeless), Manchester (one in 102), Brighton (one in 75) and Luton (one in 46), reflecting the growth of the problem outside the capital. While the homelessness growth figures for London have remained relatively stable in the past two years (up 4%), the problem has exploded in north-west England (up 117%), the West Midlands (up 64%) and the East Midlands (up 50%). Polly Neate, Shelter\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAs well as those facing serious ill health or even death sleeping rough on our streets this winter, there are thousands of families trapped in grotty emergency B&amp;Bs, with no space for children to sit and eat, let alone play. This is the grim truth our new government must confront and do something radical to change.\u201d Across Britain, at least 135,000 children will be homeless and living in temporary accommodation on Christmas Day \u2013 the highest number for 12 years, Shelter estimated. Charities say rising homelessness is being driven by a lack of affordable housing and the failure of housing benefit \u2013 which has been frozen since 2016 \u2013 to keep pace with spiralling private rents. Private tenants on benefits face an average \u00a3113 a month shortfall between their local housing allowance and their rent. The Shelter figures comprised people in temporary accommodation, rough sleepers, people accepted by councils as homeless who have yet to be allocated a home, single people in hostels not counted as formally homeless, and families living in homes arranged by social services under the Children\u2019s Act. Previous years\u2019 estimates have included Wales and Scotland. These showed a Great Britain total of 307,000 homeless in 2017 and 320,000 in 2018. Wales and Scotland were excluded in 2019 because of changes in the way they collect homelessness data. Boris Johnson placed tackling homelessness on his \u201chuge agenda of delivering social justice\u201d in remarks to his cabinet on Tuesday.

It\u2019s going to deal with multiple areas, not just a free trade agreement. It has also got to deal with security, data, fishing; there are multiple sectors which will require detailed negotiations.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe EU hasn\u2019t missed a deadline yet.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to make it illegal for the government to extend the Brexit transition period beyond 11 months has been described as \u201cstrange\u201d by Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, as Brussels prepares to limit the scope of the coming negotiations. Simon Coveney said it amounted to the \u201cUK deciding to tie itself in terms of options\u201d, while the director general for trade in the European commission, Sabine Weyand, said the ambition of any deal would need to be pared back. When the UK leaves the EU on 31 January, difficult and complex negotiations over the future relationship will begin. The country will remain in the single market and customs union until 31 December 2020, with an extension of the arrangement permitted for up to two years if it is both found necessary and agreed before 1 July. The government has said, however, it will legislate to prevent such an extension. While the move does not prevent the prime minister from changing the law again at a later stage to allow for extra time, government sources suggested the symbolic legislation will focus minds in Brussels. According to a leaked diplomatic note obtained by the Guardian, the commission and member states have concluded that the UK\u2019s \u201cnegotiation commitment doesn\u2019t afford much space for broader ambitions\u201d beyond a \u201cbasic free trade agreement\u201d. The commission is working on a \u201cbasic package with a basic free trade agreement for goods linked to conditions of level playing field, governance, external and internal security and fisheries\u201d, according to the document. Coveney said the history of the Brexit negotiations over the last three years suggested the UK did not prosper when false deadlines were drawn. \u201cNobody is forcing the UK to apply for an extended transition period but they have the option to do it if they want to up until the middle of next summer, and what Boris Johnson is doing is essentially ruling out an option that was put into the withdrawal agreement for Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know that the negotiations post a British exit from the EU is going to be very complicated. It\u2019s going to deal with multiple areas, not just a free trade agreement. It has also got to deal with security, data, fishing; there are multiple sectors which will require detailed negotiations. \u201cThe EU hasn\u2019t missed a deadline yet. It has been the UK that has missed deadlines in the past. I just think if we\u2019ve learned anything from the first round of Brexit negotiations \u2026 [it] is that we shouldn\u2019t be closing off options.\u201d Speaking at an event organised by the European Policy Centre thinktank in Brussels, Weyand, who was the EU\u2019s deputy chief negotiator, echoed comments made by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who warned last week that 11 months would be insufficient to negotiate a comprehensive deal. Weyand, who is now the lead official in the commission\u2019s trade department, said areas such as trade in goods and access to UK waters for European fishing fleets would be prioritised, as would other areas of law where there was no international fallback position. \u201cI think, given all the signals we are getting, and now these signals are translated into law, that we are well advised to take seriously that the UK doesn\u2019t intend to go for an extension of the transition, and we need to be prepared for that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that means in the negotiations we have to look at those issues where failure to reach an agreement by end 2020 would lead to a cliff-edge situation.\u201d The European commission\u2019s executive vice-president, Valdis Dombrovskis, who holds the economy brief within the EU executive, also emphasised that time would be limited. \u201cIt will be, indeed, rather problematic to hold negotiations and reach agreement on a comprehensive trade deal,\u201d he said, adding that the \u201cvery rigid timeframe\u201d meant \u201ccertain things will be out of reach\u201d. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he would do his best to find agreement on a deal by the end of next year, as he arrived in Strasbourg to brief MEPs on the latest developments. \u201cWe will do the maximum,\u201d Barnier told reporters. Asked to comment on Johnson\u2019s refusal to extend the talks if needed, he added: \u201cI have no comment to make on that. It is the British choice to choose the procedure it wants.\u201d Theresa May had asked for the transition period \u2013 also known as the implementation period \u2013 to allow the UK to prepare for a newly negotiated relationship with the EU. She had sought a two-year period but received 21 months with an option to extend. The proposed sequence of the talks could lead to permanent solutions on key areas, such as data-sharing, transport, and arrangements for the services sector, being left open until after 2020. After Johnson had a phone call with Von der Leyen on Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesman said the leaders had \u201cagreed to work together with great energy to agree a future partnership by December 2020\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s public broadcaster has inadvertently carried an interview with the exiled Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont after hackers hijacked its online news channel and substituted its content for that of Russia\u2019s state-backed RT network. The hack, which happened last Thursday, meant Spanish TV\u2019s +24 channel showed RT\u2019s interview between Puigdemont and the former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa. In the interview \u2013 one of RT\u2019s series Conversation with Correa \u2013 Puigdemont again insisted \u201cthere\u2019s no solution to the Catalan problem that doesn\u2019t involve independence\u201d. RT\u2019s boss, Margarita Simonyan, appeared to revel in the embarrassment the incident had caused but said the network was not responsible. \u201cHackers got into the Spanish +24 channel and switched their transmission for ours,\u201d she said. \u201cWe ended up having an interview with Puigdemont, the main Catalan independence leader. Our transmission lasted the whole evening. We don\u2019t know who did it but it was beautiful.\u201d According to the Asturian paper El Comercio, which was the first to report the incident, sources at Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola confirmed a hack had taken place. The broadcaster confirmed that an investigation was under way to determine what had happened but said it was too early to draw any conclusions. Two years ago, the Spanish government said that many of the false claims on social media about the political crisis in Catalonia appeared to have come from Russian territory. \u201cIt is important that we know that there are certain entities, which may be public or private, that try to interfere in national politics, that try to affect and create unstable situations in Europe,\u201d Spain\u2019s then-defence minister, Mar\u00eda Dolores de Cospedal, told a meeting of EU foreign and defence ministers at the time. Puigdemont, who was sacked by the Spanish government two years ago after organising the illegal Catalan independence referendum, fled to Belgium to avoid arrest. Spain\u2019s supreme court reissued the international arrest warrant for the former regional president after nine Catalan pro-independence leaders were jailed in October over their roles in the failed attempt to secede from Spain. On Monday, a court in Brussels announced that Puigdemont\u2019s next extradition hearing would take place on 3 February, once the European court of justice has ruled on whether he should be granted immunity after being elected as an MEP.",

In particular, how cults of self-optimisation and identity have left us lost and apathetic. Several reviews used the term nihilistic when discussing the book, referring to both the content and how it made them feel.</p> <p>But when <a href=\"https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/culture/books/2019/10/19/the-cultural-insights-jia-tolentino/15714036008958\">speaking to her earlier this year,</a> Tolentino offered a warmer take. She admitted she found feelings of insignificance \u201creally galvanising\u201d for her writing, adding: \u201cIf we\u2019re here for just a blink of the eye, and in general if nothing matters, it feels like [it\u2019s] carte blanche to wild the fuck out. To try a lot of things, try your best to do something because the odds are so good that none of it means anything that perversely it makes me feel free to try.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t see purposelessness as a poison seeping into our lives to turn us into the nihilistic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AEMiz6rcxc\">baddies from the Big Lebowski</a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AEMiz6rcxc\">.</a></em> Rather she argued it had the potential to define and soothe a pained generation: \u201cI think it\u2019s the millennial condition. It\u2019s this kind of ecstatic, fundamentally ironic but also incredibly sincere, unhinged quality.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B4QYzSjHs8y/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m usually wary of epiphanies, lightbulb moments and sweeping realisations that reorder lives. But walking home one evening earlier this year, my existence shifted with a single passing thought. I was chronically stressed at work, overwhelmed by expectations, grasping for a sense of achievement or greater purpose and tip-toeing towards full-on exhaustion. Then it hit me: \u201cWho cares? One day I\u2019ll be dead and no one will remember me anyway.\u201d I can\u2019t explain the crashing sense of relief. It was as if my body dumped its cortisol stores allowing my lungs to fully inflate for the first time in months. Standing on the side of the road I looked at the sky and thought: \u201cI\u2019m just a chunk of meat hurtling through space on a rock. Pointless, futile, meaningless.\u201d It was one of the most comforting revelations of my life. I\u2019d discovered nihilism. Nihilism has existed in one form or another for hundreds of years, but is usually associated with Friedrich Nietzsche, the 19th century German philosopher (and pessimist of choice for high school kids with undercuts) who proposed that existence is meaningless, moral codes worthless, and God is dead. This decade it\u2019s had a cultural comeback. Visiting the central tenets it\u2019s easy to see why. Nietzsche\u2019s argument that \u201cEvery belief, every considering something true, is necessarily false because there is simply no true world\u201d feels chillingly relevant as we stumble through a \u201cpost-truth\u201d reality. While Nietzsche (and the goths you grew up with) make it all sound like a bummer, Generation Y\u2019s and Z\u2019s take on things is more upbeat and absurd. Modern nihilism has been honed through memes and Twitter jokes. It manifests as teenagers eating Tide pods, fans begging celebrities to run them down with their cars, and a lot of weird TV shows. Turns out the descent into nothingness can be pretty funny. Are we witnessing a new, sunnier, generation of nihilists emerge? If meaning and purpose are overrated illusions, then so is any sense that you are special or destined for greater things. It\u2019s a balm for a group burning out over exceptionalism, economic downturns, performative excellence, housing crises and living your best life on Instagram. In her collection of essays Trick Mirror: reflections on self-delusion, New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino grapples with the culture and conditions of a post-global financial crisis America. In particular, how cults of self-optimisation and identity have left us lost and apathetic. Several reviews used the term nihilistic when discussing the book, referring to both the content and how it made them feel. But when speaking to her earlier this year, Tolentino offered a warmer take. She admitted she found feelings of insignificance \u201creally galvanising\u201d for her writing, adding: \u201cIf we\u2019re here for just a blink of the eye, and in general if nothing matters, it feels like [it\u2019s] carte blanche to wild the fuck out. To try a lot of things, try your best to do something because the odds are so good that none of it means anything that perversely it makes me feel free to try.\u201d She didn\u2019t see purposelessness as a poison seeping into our lives to turn us into the nihilistic baddies from the Big Lebowski. Rather she argued it had the potential to define and soothe a pained generation: \u201cI think it\u2019s the millennial condition. It\u2019s this kind of ecstatic, fundamentally ironic but also incredibly sincere, unhinged quality.\u201d Last year, on opposite sides of the world, two high schoolers presented TEDx talks about nihilism. Elias Skjoldborg, a junior at Hanwood Union high school in Vermont, took the stage to deliver his case for optimistic nihilism. It was aptly subtitled \u201cOr how to be a happy emo\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The acting prime minister, Michael McCormack, defied a Senate order to produce documents relating to the government\u2019s troubled regional grants program, despite early advice from the department suggesting information should be released. The regional jobs and investment packages program was subject to a scathing federal audit released on Melbourne Cup day which found ministers knocked back almost 30% of recommended projects and supported 17% of those not recommended. Labor has been attempting to access documents underpinning the government\u2019s decision-making process, but the government has refused to comply with a Senate order to produce the information. Email correspondence released under freedom of information laws also shows the minister\u2019s office scrambled to find a reason not to provide the documents to the Senate. According to an email sent from Donna Wieland, the general manager of regional programs in the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development, the department proposed to \u201cpackage up the requested information into two lots\u201d. \u201cThe first pack will be documents that are not particularly sensitive that can be released. We should be able to meet the deadline for those. \u201dThe second pack will be documents that the minister may wish to consider \u2018public immunity interest\u2019 reasons for non-disclosure.\u201d Wieland tells the minister\u2019s office that claiming \u201cadvice to government\u201d is not a grounds to deny the information, but suggests that \u201cdamage to commercial interests and unreasonable invasion of privacy are\u201d. She warns that it will likely be a \u201ccomplex task\u201d to claim these grounds. The correspondence, released following an FOI request by the Labor party, also shows that advice was provided to the department by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, which stressed that the minister would need to identify the \u201cspecific harm of disclosure\u201d of defying the request. Wieland also canvasses the idea of claiming \u201ccabinet deliberations\u201d as a grounds for refusing the release of documents, saying it could be \u201cfurther explored\u201d. However, despite initially suggesting one tranche of documents be released, following discussions between the infrastructure department, the minister\u2019s office and the prime minister\u2019s department, no documents were tabled. Labor\u2019s shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, accused McCormack of \u201ctreating the people of Australia with absolute contempt\u201d. \u201cSenior officials in his department and own staff were originally comfortable releasing some documents but then worked with the prime minister\u2019s department to not release a single page.\u201d King seized on correspondence suggesting that McCormack used a template letter supplied by the prime minister\u2019s department to claim release of information was an \u201cunreasonable invasion of privacy\u201d. \u201cHowever, the program guidelines clearly state that confidential information relating to applications may be provided to parliament,\u201d she said. \u201cMichael McCormack must stop acting like the rules don\u2019t apply to him and start being honest with the Australian people.\u201d According to the guidelines for the regional jobs and investment packages scheme, applicants were advised that information could be released to members of parliament or parliamentary committees. McCormack has defended the regional grants program, saying ministers overruled departmental advice based on what was \u201cbest\u201d for regional Australia. On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for McCormack said the government had co-operated with the audit, \u201cwhich did not find any evidence of electorate bias in application assessments by the ministerial panel or of any contravention of commonwealth grant rules and guidelines\u201d. \u201cThe Government determined that documents relating to the 13 November Senate order could, if publicly released, damage commercial interests and risk reputational damage to companies involved in open tender processes, while the potential release of private information submitted during program applications would create an unreasonable invasion of privacy.\u201d",

In a report released on Wednesday, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences has found that since 2000 changes in climate have reduced the revenue of Australian cropping farms by a total of $1.1bn a year. The report notes that average temperatures increased by about 1C since 1950 and compares Australia\u2019s climate over the period 2000 to 2019 with the period from 1950 to 1999 by holding other variables, including farm output and commodity prices, constant. Abares, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s science and economics research division, has developed a statistical model called Farmpredict using data from 40,000 farm observations to simulate differences in more than 50 physical and financial farm variables. Since 2000, climate change has had a negative effect on the profitability of broadacre farms in Australia. Only Northern Territory farms improved profitability, up 8.7%, with massive cuts to profit in Victoria (\u201337.1%), Western Australia (-25.8%) and New South Wales (-25.5%) attributed to climate change. Cropping farms were the worst hit, with revenue down 8% or around $82,000 a farm, and a 35% reduction in profits, or $70,900 for a typical cropping farm. Report co-author David Galeano said adaptation to climate variability \u201cis certainly helping\u201d \u2013 and without it farms would have experienced a 26% reduction in profit, and cropping farms\u2019 profits would be down 49%. Sheep farms experienced an 18.2% reduction in average annual profit, or $6,100 per farm. Beef farms were \u201cless affected overall\u201d with a reduction in average profits of 5%, although some areas \u2013 including south-western Queensland \u2013 were more affected than others. Climate conditions have \u201calso contributed to increased risk in terms of more variable cash income and profitability, particularly for cropping farms\u201d, the report says. Climate change increased downside risk, with the chance of \u201cvery low\u201d profits \u2013 below 2% \u2013 more than doubling since 2000. The Abares report says that the current drought across much of eastern Australia \u201chas demonstrated the dramatic effects that climate variability can have on farm businesses and households\u201d. It says that drought-affected NSW recorded \u201clarge falls in profit in 2018\u201319\u201d but less drought-affected regions, including Western Australia, increased profits due to high commodity prices for grain and livestock. Abares warns that drought policy faces \u201can almost unavoidable dilemma: that providing relief to farm businesses and households in times of drought risks slowing industry structural adjustment and innovation\u201d. \u201cIn some cases, well-intentioned policies can also disadvantage farmers who have been better prepared \u2013 or luckier \u2013 than farmers who are provided assistance and relief, diluting management incentives and raising difficult equity issues.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It recommends that in addition to supporting farm households experiencing hardship, drought policy should \u201cpromote resilience and improved productivity\u201d. Climate change is making drought worse in Australia, although senior government figures including the Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, tend to emphasise that Australia\u2019s climate has always been characterised by intermittent drought and flood. The centrepiece of the Coalition\u2019s drought policy is a $5bn drought future fund that will make annual payments of $100m to improve resilience. In November the government announced an extra $1.5bn for drought relief, consisting of a $1bn concessional loan package for farmers and small businesses affected by the drought and $500m for \u201cdirect investment into communities\u201d. Modelling the effect of drought, the Abares report says a cropping farm will see profit decrease from around $230,000 in a typical year to a loss of $125,000 in a dry year. For an Australian beef farm, profit falls from $60,000 in a typical year to a loss of $5,000 in a dry year.",

Once the credit is spent, they have to top it up again, or go without electricity. Klerk says that happened a lot in the last quarter of 2018.</p> \n<p>In Alice Springs, 420 of 570 households with prepaid electricity meters had at least one self-disconnection, which lasted, on average, 7.5 hours. Of the 570 Alice Springs meters, 285 are in town camp dwellings.</p> \n<p>In effect, more than half the town campers ran out of money to pay for electricity.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen the power goes off, it is bad for our health, the food gets spoiled, we can\u2019t wash our clothes and we can\u2019t wash our kids,\u201d Shirleen Campbell told the rally.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn summer, when our houses are hot or when we don\u2019t have electricity, our people look for comfort in air-conditioned public places. We are not always welcome in these places and sometimes there are problems. We are thankful for places like the library and the pool.\u201d</p> \n<p>Klerk says low-income residents shouldn\u2019t have to go broke trying to keep their houses cool. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable that people\u2019s houses are making them sick, and something really needs to be done about it. It shouldn\u2019t all be passed on to the consumer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40de764a5f132704d5a5f3e70949cb2c3a529257\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40de764a5f132704d5a5f3e70949cb2c3a529257/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Cocking from the Arid Lands Environment Centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Cocking from the Arid Lands Environment Centre in the dry bed of the Todd River at Alice Springs.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the case of people having to spend more money to keep the houses at a temperature that delivers health outcomes, then we have to rethink the levels of income support that are available to people, particularly in these regions where it\u2019s so hot.\u201d</p> \n<p>Predictions by the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress for the health impacts of heat are dire. In its submission to the NT government\u2019s climate change policy discussion paper, it outlined some of them: \u201cIncreased sickness and mortality due to heat stress, increased food insecurity and malnutrition, increased risk from infectious disease, poorer mental health and an increased potential for social conflict.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018The antidote to despair is action\u2019</h2> \n<p>The Pintupi-Luritja artist Irene Nangala was among the first to return to her home country at Kintore in the western desert, near the border with Western Australia, in the early 1980s.</p> \n<p>Until then, Pintupi people had been living a long way from home at the mission at Papunya, and they were homesick.</p> \n<p>Nangala helped set up the Kintore school. It was a \u201cwindbreak school\u201d at first, she says: just a tarp to keep the sun and the rain water out.</p> \n<p>\u201cThen we got a few teachers. It was hard work. We\u2019ve got a proper good school now, proper shop. Nice clinic and aged care, child care.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nangala says she doesn\u2019t have an air-conditioner. On hot days the family puts blankets on the windows. Other elders whose aircon units break down have to wait for a repairer to come from Alice Springs, more than 10 hours\u2019 drive away.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hot in Kintore.

      "bodyText": "Josie Douglas sits on a verandah overlooking a ridge of red rocks and earth, scrubby with saltbush and spinifex near the centre of Alice Springs. It\u2019s late afternoon and only 31C \u2013 a reprieve from a run of days in the high 30s and 40s. But Douglas knows that from now on it will only get hotter. Last summer was the hottest on record, and the driest in 27 years in central Australia. Five per cent of the town\u2019s street trees died. A heat monitoring study showed that on some unshaded streets the surface temperature was between 61C and 68C. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep going on the way we\u2019re going,\u201d says Douglas, who is manager of policy and research at the Central Land Council. \u201cCentral Australian Aboriginal people are very resilient. They have evolved to cope with the harsh and variable desert climate, but there are limits. \u201cWithout action to stop climate change, people will be forced to leave their country and leave behind much of what makes them Aboriginal. Climate change is a clear and present threat to the survival of our people and their culture.\u201d Across central Australia, people are bracing themselves for another scorching summer of drought. At least nine remote communities and outstations are running out of water. A further 12 have reported poor quality drinking water as aquifers run low and the remaining supply is saline. Temperature records have already been broken. In the year to July 2019, Alice Springs had 129 days over 35C, and 55 days over 40C. It wasn\u2019t meant to be like this \u2013 at least, not yet. The national science agency, the CSIRO, predictedthat these temperatures would not arrive until 2030. As the Northern Territory\u2019s environment minister, Eva Lawler, said last September: \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything, the NT will become unliveable.\u201d The problem is where to start. In Alice Springs opinion is divided among local politicians about the impact climate change is having on life in the desert. Sitting on the grassy lawn outside the council, Jimmy Cocking of the Arid Lands Environment Centre talks openly about climate refugees: those who have already come into town, and those who will have to come in the near future. \u201cWe\u2019re going to end up with a whole bunch of internally displaced people within the Northern Territory in remote Australia, if we\u2019re not planning for that,\u201d he says. \u201cIf regional centres like Alice Springs and others aren\u2019t planning to be able to deal with the influx of climate refugees internally within our region, we\u2019re going to be left flatfooted and unable to deal with any of the challenges and social consequences that will come from that.\u201d Cocking is on the town council and has sought to pass motions to declare a climate emergency. But the mayor, Damien Ryan, is reluctant to sound the climate alarm. \u201cIn local government speak, when you have an emergency, you close it down,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cI have not had any of the people who talk about an emergency say what is the next step. So you declare an emergency, what do you do then the next day? That\u2019s never been made clear to me.\u201d At its October meeting, the council did not agree on the word \u201cemergency\u201d but voted unanimously to say there was an \u201cescalating urgency for climate action\u201d. Douglas and the CLC say Aboriginal communities are doing what they can. \u201cPeople are already mitigating climate change through traditional burning and they are investing their income from land use agreements to install solar power, plant bush tucker gardens in communities and operate swimming pools, but all that counts for little in the face of the lack of climate leadership from the government,\u201d she says. \u2018You see people hosing their brick houses\u2019 The NT government says it has allocated $15m to \u201crevitalising\u201d the Alice Springs city centre. Some of those funds will go towards shade and landscaping to help cool the streets, and to public water stations. Ryan says the council is encouraging local schools to plant more trees. The Territory government says it has a climate change response strategy and is working with other governments and the Bureau of Meteorology to \u201cdevelop national guidelines for the development of a warning system for extreme heat events\u201d. In the meantime, Douglas says, people are living in houses that are \u201cunbearable\u201d. \u201cDuring our summers you can sometimes see people in communities hosing the outside of their Besser brick walls with garden hoses to keep cool despite the water shortages \u2013 that\u2019s how desperate they are.\u201d About 3ookm north-west of Alice Springs is Yuendumu, the largest remote community in central Australia. Its 900 or so residents are facing summer without a reliable supply of adequate drinking water. The NT government has stopped building new housing because there isn\u2019t enough water in the dwindling aquifer to accommodate more people. Yuendumu is not alone. The Central Land Council\u2019s chief executive, Joe Martin-Jard, says that at every regional meeting, water security is top of the agenda. \u201cBetween Alice Springs and Mount Isa, there\u2019s probably only one major community with a decent water supply,\u201d Martin-Jard says. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting the rain we used to, to recharge the aquifers. So as water is drawn out of the aquifers it becomes more saline and less potable [drinkable]. \u201cIt\u2019s a really horrible dilemma.\u201d The NT\u2019s Power and Water Corporation, which is responsible for essential services in 72 remote communities and outstations, says most communities in the arid region are \u201cfaced with some level of water stress\u201d and emergency planning is under way, but there are \u201crarely any simple solutions\u201d. \u201cThe difficult reality is that many communities originally developed historically in locations where there was never any secure, reliable, high quality water resources in close proximity,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAs those communities have grown \u2026 and expectations of improved levels of service have appropriately increased, the challenges also continue to increase.\u201d Power and Water says more drilling programs are planned but \u201cfinding new water sources is very challenging and often these drilling programs have moderate prospects for success\u201d. \u201cWithout large or extended rainfall \u2026 the water security risks will progressively increase in some centres, with an increased likelihood that source supply capacity at some could fail.\u201d At least 12 communities have reported poor quality drinking water. At Laramba, Willowra and Wilora, nitrates and uranium are at levels exceeding health guidelines. NT Power and Water says it is \u201cinvestigating alternative technology options\u201d. It has already installed treatment plants at Kintore, Ali Curung and Yuelamu to reduce high levels of nitrates, uranium and fluoride. \u2018Air conditioning is essential in the desert\u2019 In Alice Springs\u2019 18 town camps, where people from out bush often end up, houses are commonly built from Besser bricks \u2013 hollow concrete blocks which are cheap, but which trap the heat. There\u2019s a lack of tree cover or other kinds of shade. Houses bake in the sun and, while the majority have solar panels, they often have only an evaporative air conditioning unit, known locally as a \u201cswampy\u201d, to cool the house. A \u201cswampy\u201d uses a lot of water and can struggle on hot days, especially when there are a lot of people sharing a house, which is common in town camps with big families and fluctuating populations. \u201cAir conditioning is an essential item in the desert, not a luxury,\u201d the CLC\u2019s Josie Douglas says, \u201cbut it does not come standard.\u201d When remote community and town camp tenants are offered housing, there is \u201ca hole where the aircon unit should be and they are told to buy it themselves\u201d. \u201cMany can only afford to \u2018close the gap\u2019 with a piece of wood, or run expensive reverse-cycle aircon very sparingly,\u201d she says. \u201cSome places don\u2019t have enough water to use a cheaper swampy.\u201d Houses that don\u2019t cool down overnight create big health and social problems. \u201cPeople resort to sleeping outside, or cramming everybody into the coolest room of the house, with all the well-known consequences for the spread of diseases that whitefellas only know from medical textbooks. \u201cIt\u2019s also common for people to sleep in shifts, with young people roaming the streets at night where they get into trouble, and sleeping during the day when they should be at school.\u201d This is at odds with the NT government\u2019s view of the quality of town camp and remote community housing. A government spokesperson tells Guardian Australia that homes are designed with weather conditions and regional climate in mind, and they include external shading, natural ventilation and insulation. \u201cInvestment into housing in town camps has included the installation of louvres, sunscreens, verandas and insulation,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe Department of Housing and Community Development has also upgraded some key community infrastructure including improved shading and the installation of fans.\u201d Douglas is calling on the government to \u201cstop building concrete hotboxes\u201d. \u201cMore than a decade ago, the government and the CLC were partners [in research] that came up with really solid recommendations about how to make desert houses more energy-efficient and communities more resilient. \u201cSome measures, such as making sure houses are built with the right orientation \u2026 and have passive cooling and a white roof, cost almost nothing. We would like to know how many of these expensive research findings have been implemented in our region.\u201d Shirleen Campbell is a Warlpiri and Arrernte woman who grew up at Hoppy\u2019s Camp, or Lhenpe Artnwe. She told the Alice Springs climate rally in October that town campers were very worried about climate change. \u201cThis is our place,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it gets too hot, if we suffer through endless droughts or we spoil our water, then we don\u2019t have another place to go. \u201cWe want houses that are right for this place and right for our people. We want to invest in renewable energy, like solar.\u201d Campbell is a co-coordinator of the women\u2019s family safety group at Tangentyere council, which delivers services to and advocates on behalf of town camp residents. \u201cMost of all we want people to treat this place as a legacy to be handed down to our children and grandchildren. It is not a speculative commodity and it is not something to be sold or exported. \u201cWe have been here for a long time and want to look after this place for those that come after.\u201d Keeping cool in the library There are few public places in Alice Springs to cool off. The Yeperenye shopping centre has security guards at the doors and, according to Douglas and Campbell, Aboriginal people are regularly moved on. The library is a popular, free cool space. There\u2019s a widescreen TV rigged up with headphones, showing movies. Westerns are popular, as are replays of AFL grand finals. The Saltbush room down the hall is a haven for older folk, while little mobs of kids hang out among the young adult stacks or cluster around the phone-charging station. \u201cWe found there\u2019s a gap in after-school care services from about 2.30 to 4.30, the hottest time of the day,\u201d says the head librarian, Clare Fisher. \u201cThe kids can come to the library, cool off, have fruit and sandwiches.\u201d \u201cLibraries are for connection and relaxation as well as knowledge. We make everyone welcome \u2013 but we explain how to use the library and how to behave as well. We very much believe in come and be who you are.\u201d Thirsty and dying animals culled In January footage of dead and dying horses in a dry creek bed at Ltyentye Apurte, 80km south-east of Alice Springs, flashed around the world. The Ltyentye Apurte rangers had the unenviable task of dragging more than 100 dead horses from the creek bed and disposing of their bodies. In June the CLC conducted an emergency cull of more than 1,400 feral horses, donkeys, camels and cattle from a waterhole near Lajamanu. The animals were thirsty and dying, congregating around the last remaining springs and water sites. The CLC has eradicated 6,279 feral animals in preparation for summer. Traditional owners don\u2019t usually support animal culls, the CLC says, but there were no alternatives, with so many animals dying or in poor condition. Feral animals damage community infrastructure and housing. Thirsty camels, for example, will attack air conditioning units because they smell water, and lay waste to water tanks, bores, fences, pipes and taps. How hot is too hot? Heat, health and housing hotboxes In town, Tangentyere council wants to measure exactly how well houses are functioning. Tangentyere\u2019s social policy and research manager, Michael Klerk, is in discussions with the CSIRO to install temperature data loggers in people\u2019s houses, to build a case for improvements that are taken for granted elsewhere: solar power, insulation, better air conditioning, wide awnings, more shade. \u201cLast summer \u2013 which was a very hot summer, soon to be repeated \u2013 a lot of anecdotal feedback was that people\u2019s evaporative air conditioners weren\u2019t cooling the houses sufficiently,\u201d Klerk says. \u201cThis probably reflects the reality that evaporative air conditioners are not good at cooling houses when the external temperatures are in the mid-40s. \u201cYou might drop the temperature of a house to mid-30s, but that\u2019s not an optimal internal ambient temperature for comfort or for health.\u201d Most people living in town camps and remote communities, and some in suburban public housing, have pre-paid electricity meters. Residents are issued a power card, which they top up with their welfare payments or income. Once the credit is spent, they have to top it up again, or go without electricity. Klerk says that happened a lot in the last quarter of 2018. In Alice Springs, 420 of 570 households with prepaid electricity meters had at least one self-disconnection, which lasted, on average, 7.5 hours. Of the 570 Alice Springs meters, 285 are in town camp dwellings. In effect, more than half the town campers ran out of money to pay for electricity. \u201cWhen the power goes off, it is bad for our health, the food gets spoiled, we can\u2019t wash our clothes and we can\u2019t wash our kids,\u201d Shirleen Campbell told the rally. \u201cIn summer, when our houses are hot or when we don\u2019t have electricity, our people look for comfort in air-conditioned public places. We are not always welcome in these places and sometimes there are problems. We are thankful for places like the library and the pool.\u201d Klerk says low-income residents shouldn\u2019t have to go broke trying to keep their houses cool. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable that people\u2019s houses are making them sick, and something really needs to be done about it. It shouldn\u2019t all be passed on to the consumer. \u201cIf it\u2019s the case of people having to spend more money to keep the houses at a temperature that delivers health outcomes, then we have to rethink the levels of income support that are available to people, particularly in these regions where it\u2019s so hot.\u201d Predictions by the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress for the health impacts of heat are dire. In its submission to the NT government\u2019s climate change policy discussion paper, it outlined some of them: \u201cIncreased sickness and mortality due to heat stress, increased food insecurity and malnutrition, increased risk from infectious disease, poorer mental health and an increased potential for social conflict.\u201d \u2018The antidote to despair is action\u2019 The Pintupi-Luritja artist Irene Nangala was among the first to return to her home country at Kintore in the western desert, near the border with Western Australia, in the early 1980s. Until then, Pintupi people had been living a long way from home at the mission at Papunya, and they were homesick. Nangala helped set up the Kintore school. It was a \u201cwindbreak school\u201d at first, she says: just a tarp to keep the sun and the rain water out. \u201cThen we got a few teachers. It was hard work. We\u2019ve got a proper good school now, proper shop. Nice clinic and aged care, child care.\u201d Nangala says she doesn\u2019t have an air-conditioner. On hot days the family puts blankets on the windows. Other elders whose aircon units break down have to wait for a repairer to come from Alice Springs, more than 10 hours\u2019 drive away. \u201cIt\u2019s really hot in Kintore. We can\u2019t go and sit outside. We have to go at night to sit down with the families.\u201d Nevertheless, Nangala says she does not want to leave. \u201cWe built up Kintore,\u2019 she says. \u201cPeople are really enjoying going back to their grandfather\u2019s land. That\u2019s the right thing to do. And it\u2019s good for them to go back, the old people, good for the heart and the spirit. \u201cWhen they went first, they cried, they missed that place for a long time.\u201d Nangala says people don\u2019t want to come into town, where life might be worse. \u201cClimate change is true,\u201d Nangala says. \u201cThey [politicians] got the map and weather things, they should see the temperature what is happening around Australia, it\u2019s so hot.\u201d Jimmy Cocking says: \u201cWe are walking blindly into the new climate reality. We\u2019ve moved beyond hope, and we can\u2019t be running on hope alone. \u201cThe only thing that is going to get us over the line is action. And the antidote to despair is action. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of things that we need to be looking to change so that we aren\u2019t going to be putting people\u2019s lives at risk.\u201d",

That film brought him to Hollywood\u2019s attention, and landed him the role of the bleach-blond villain in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/24/the-girl-in-the-spiders-web-review-claire-foy\">The Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web</a>, although nothing he has done so far can compare to the level of exposure he will receive for Dracula. \u201cOh my lord, this is completely different!\u201d he says, throwing his hands in the air. The show offers a lot of Bang for your buck: its three 90-minute episodes will be screened on BBC One on consecutive nights beginning on New Year\u2019s Day before being made available internationally on Netflix. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I\u2019m terrified. It feels like a big exam. The script is so strong; it\u2019s like a well-fitted glove. It\u2019s only when you wake in the middle of the night that you go: \u2018<em>Fuuuuck</em>. Is this really gonna fly?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Far from blocking out the character\u2019s long screen history, Bang embraced it by watching all the previous Draculas: \u201cI wanted to see if there were any good ideas I could steal.\u201d He makes special mention of Klaus Kinski in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/01/werner-herzog-im-not-a-pundit-dont-push-me-into-that-corner\">Werner Herzog</a>\u2019s 1979 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/31/nosferatu-the-vampyre-review\">Nosferatu the Vampyre</a>. \u201cIt was the loneliness of that character that got to me. Imagine what it\u2019s like: it\u2019s a Tuesday evening, 1718, mid-November, you haven\u2019t had any company in your castle for 200 years. There\u2019s a sadness that I really liked.\u201d All this talk of Dracula\u2019s interior life would count for nought if it couldn\u2019t be felt in the fibre of Bang\u2019s performance. He plays those poignant notes delicately in the first episode when he asks Jonathan Harker (John Heffernan) to describe the sunrise that would kill him were he to stand directly in its glow. \u201cI had to think of him as real, not as an icon. I needed to find bits and bobs I could relate to. He might have really weird needs but they are needs all the same, just like the ones I have for sleep or food or sex.\u201d</p> <p>Accompanying my sneak preview of the first two parts was a lengthy list stipulating the various twists and shocks that must not be divulged. Perhaps the biggest surprise, though, is Bang himself, even to those who saw him in The Square. That film subjected him to all manner of humiliations; in one scene, he had a tug-of-war with Elisabeth Moss over a used condom that he refused to surrender to her after sex. \u201cNobody left that set with any kind of dignity,\u201d he laughs. Dracula, on the other hand, finds him dripping in gravitas, sweeping through his scenes with carnivorous elegance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"19618d3f1f6d7586f9dcfbbe39d89cc50ecb2c49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19618d3f1f6d7586f9dcfbbe39d89cc50ecb2c49/77_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisabeth Moss and Claes Bang in The Square.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Nobody left that set with any dignity\u2019 \u2026 Elisabeth Moss and Claes Bang in The Square.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s imposing but he also has this twinkle, and he can set pulses racing in both sexes,\u201d says Gatiss. \u201cIt\u2019s real charm: it feels dangerous and therefore terribly attractive, which is what you want from a sexy Dracula. We always knew we didn\u2019t want him to be a monolithic presence. I like to say he had to be a fully rounded <em>inhuman</em> being. And we discovered when we were shooting that some of Claes\u2019s most chilling bits are when he seems the most reasonable. He\u2019s like a torturer who will very calmly say, \u2018I\u2019m going to have to take your legs off, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s honestly for the best.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This is also, it should be said, a very witty performance. \u201cSometimes I was, like, \u2018Are we sure we want <em>five</em> jokes in this scene?\u2019\u201d Bang says. \u201cBut the point is that Dracula has to amuse himself because no one else is going to do it. Without that pleasure, what\u2019s the point of him getting out of bed \u2013 out of his coffin \u2013 every day? He\u2019s insatiable, not only for blood, but for \u2026\u201d He grasps at the air with both hands to illustrate his point. \u201cThat kind of, \u2018Grrr, I just want to get at everything! Woah! What\u2019s this, a nunnery? Cool!\u2019 He\u2019s very easily engaged. And I find that quite sympathetic. I don\u2019t think he feeds off people only to kill them.\u201d The rapaciousness extends to gender. \u201cOh, he\u2019s got broad tastes,\u201d Bang smiles. \u201cI like that about him. He\u2019s not in any way prejudiced. Race, age, sexuality, anything goes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10aecf8d83492bf3970151d9de19f100c9669510\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10aecf8d83492bf3970151d9de19f100c9669510/0_0_4285_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claes Bang and Dolly Wells in Dracula.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Count your blessings \u2026 Claes Bang with Dolly Wells in Dracula.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Hartswood Films/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The role represents quite a turnaround for an actor who, only a few years ago, was starting to suspect he\u2019d been left behind by the entertainment industry. \u201cI never heard from those people who were turning out all these amazing series that won awards across the world. I did a bit in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/feb/07/borgen-box-set-review\">Borgen</a>. But they never seemed to ask for my services. I used to think there\u2019d been a party and the whole business was there and maybe I got really drunk. I thought, \u2018Perhaps I did something that no one has ever forgiven me for. Did I try to sleep with the wives of the big bosses in Danish film and television? Why am I not ever hearing anything? What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAll those glorious years for Danish television and I spent them going, \u2018Hello! I\u2019m over here!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Being relatively unknown can only help with a role like Dracula, which relies on an enigmatic eroticism. \u201cWe wanted to \u2018do a Benedict\u2019,\u201d Gatiss tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s a similar situation: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/26/benedict-cumberbatch-inside-story-hamlet-sherlock-school-actor\">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> was known before Sherlock but he wasn\u2019t a star. Claes is the same. He doesn\u2019t bring any baggage but he has a sense of otherness.\u201d Even with a few high-profile roles to his credit, there is still plenty about him that people don\u2019t know. I was surprised, for instance, to stumble on his <a href=\"http://www.kulturkongen.dk/vis_musik.asp?code=b2f9f5de53634cd58827c08ded80e37f\">2010 album Dislocated</a>, an exercise in 1980s-influenced electronic pop that he recorded under the name This Is Not America (after the David Bowie track) to get around one Danish broadcaster\u2019s policy of not giving airplay to songs by actors. There\u2019s even a promo video showing Bang performing in a wig and makeup. \u201cMy wife and I filmed that one Saturday afternoon,\u201d he says, coming over a touch bashful. The music itself is very Pet Shop Boys, Bang\u2019s vocals a bit Psychedelic Furs. \u201cI sit down and go, \u2018Right, this one won\u2019t sound like the 1980s\u2019 and then 10 minutes later I\u2019m back in the 80s again.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bs1-R2Csx4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9Bs1-R2Csx4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Claes Bang performing as the one-man band This Is Not America</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Bang was already on his way to becoming a sex symbol after The Square, and Dracula, which contains countless smouldering closeups as well as a nude scene in which he is clad in nothing but a thin film of goo, will do little to stem such attention. I raise the subject light-heartedly, but for the first time in our conversation he looks faintly downcast. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can really work with,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI try not to think about it because then you become an idea of yourself. It\u2019s important to stay fluid. Otherwise it might box you in.\u201d Then he perks up, and his formerly enthusiastic self returns as suddenly as it had vanished. \u201cOn the other hand, that\u2019s fine! It is. It\u2019s all right!\u201d Phew. For a moment there, it looked as if Bang was going out with a whimper.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07rxf89\">Dracula is on BBC One</a> at 9pm on 1-3 January.</p></li> </ul>",

He\u2019s like a torturer who will very calmly say, \u2018I\u2019m going to have to take your legs off, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s honestly for the best.\u2019\u201d This is also, it should be said, a very witty performance. \u201cSometimes I was, like, \u2018Are we sure we want five jokes in this scene?\u2019\u201d Bang says. \u201cBut the point is that Dracula has to amuse himself because no one else is going to do it. Without that pleasure, what\u2019s the point of him getting out of bed \u2013 out of his coffin \u2013 every day? He\u2019s insatiable, not only for blood, but for \u2026\u201d He grasps at the air with both hands to illustrate his point. \u201cThat kind of, \u2018Grrr, I just want to get at everything! Woah! What\u2019s this, a nunnery? Cool!\u2019 He\u2019s very easily engaged. And I find that quite sympathetic. I don\u2019t think he feeds off people only to kill them.\u201d The rapaciousness extends to gender. \u201cOh, he\u2019s got broad tastes,\u201d Bang smiles. \u201cI like that about him. He\u2019s not in any way prejudiced. Race, age, sexuality, anything goes.\u201d The role represents quite a turnaround for an actor who, only a few years ago, was starting to suspect he\u2019d been left behind by the entertainment industry. \u201cI never heard from those people who were turning out all these amazing series that won awards across the world. I did a bit in Borgen. But they never seemed to ask for my services. I used to think there\u2019d been a party and the whole business was there and maybe I got really drunk. I thought, \u2018Perhaps I did something that no one has ever forgiven me for. Did I try to sleep with the wives of the big bosses in Danish film and television? Why am I not ever hearing anything? What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAll those glorious years for Danish television and I spent them going, \u2018Hello! I\u2019m over here!\u2019\u201d Being relatively unknown can only help with a role like Dracula, which relies on an enigmatic eroticism. \u201cWe wanted to \u2018do a Benedict\u2019,\u201d Gatiss tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s a similar situation: Benedict Cumberbatch was known before Sherlock but he wasn\u2019t a star. Claes is the same. He doesn\u2019t bring any baggage but he has a sense of otherness.\u201d Even with a few high-profile roles to his credit, there is still plenty about him that people don\u2019t know. I was surprised, for instance, to stumble on his 2010 album Dislocated, an exercise in 1980s-influenced electronic pop that he recorded under the name This Is Not America (after the David Bowie track) to get around one Danish broadcaster\u2019s policy of not giving airplay to songs by actors. There\u2019s even a promo video showing Bang performing in a wig and makeup. \u201cMy wife and I filmed that one Saturday afternoon,\u201d he says, coming over a touch bashful. The music itself is very Pet Shop Boys, Bang\u2019s vocals a bit Psychedelic Furs. \u201cI sit down and go, \u2018Right, this one won\u2019t sound like the 1980s\u2019 and then 10 minutes later I\u2019m back in the 80s again.\u201d Bang was already on his way to becoming a sex symbol after The Square, and Dracula, which contains countless smouldering closeups as well as a nude scene in which he is clad in nothing but a thin film of goo, will do little to stem such attention. I raise the subject light-heartedly, but for the first time in our conversation he looks faintly downcast. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can really work with,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI try not to think about it because then you become an idea of yourself. It\u2019s important to stay fluid. Otherwise it might box you in.\u201d Then he perks up, and his formerly enthusiastic self returns as suddenly as it had vanished. \u201cOn the other hand, that\u2019s fine! It is. It\u2019s all right!\u201d Phew. For a moment there, it looked as if Bang was going out with a whimper. Dracula is on BBC One at 9pm on 1-3 January.",

Ron died peacefully on Tuesday morning, having been diagnosed with motor neurone disease earlier this year.\u201d</p> <p>Steve White, the acting police commissioner since September 2019, said: \u201cIn my 30 years of policing, I have never known of someone so universally liked and respected as Ron was by officers, staff, politicians and officials.

Hogg, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in August, had called for the law banning assisted dying to be scrapped for the terminally ill. The former rugby player struggled to walk and had breathing difficulties within a month of his diagnosis. Hogg was elected to the role of police, crime and victims\u2019 commissioner in 2012 and was re-elected in 2016 with 63% of the votes cast. He had previously served as deputy chief constable of Cleveland police. In a statement, his office said: \u201cIt is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Ron Hogg, police, crime and victims\u2019 commissioner for County Durham and Darlington. Ron died peacefully on Tuesday morning, having been diagnosed with motor neurone disease earlier this year.\u201d Steve White, the acting police commissioner since September 2019, said: \u201cIn my 30 years of policing, I have never known of someone so universally liked and respected as Ron was by officers, staff, politicians and officials. He will be greatly missed and leaves a lasting legacy.\u201d Jo Farrell, Durham\u2019s chief constable, offered condolences to Hogg\u2019s family and colleagues, adding: \u201cRon was a radical thinker, an inspiring leader and a lifelong public servant who wasn\u2019t afraid to tackle head on some of the most difficult issues facing society.\u201d Under Hogg, the Durham force was rated outstanding four times by the police inspectorate and pioneered innovative schemes to tackle reoffending and keep people out of prison. Hogg wanted resources concentrated not on cannabis users but dealers, and called for radical changes to the drugs laws. Motor neurone disease is an incurable condition that leads to muscle wasting and death. In September, despite needing help to breathe, Hogg gave an interview to the Guardian in which he said he wanted the right to end his suffering at a time chosen by him and his family. \u201cThirty years as a cop, 30 years playing rugby, now I find it difficult to walk across the room,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got limited use of my right arm. I\u2019ve lost three stone in body weight, I\u2019ve lost five inches off my chest \u2026 simple things become so so difficult.\u201d He said the diagnosis was \u201clike walking into a brick wall\u201d and hestarted thinking about assisted dying shortly after being diagnosed on 23 August. \u201cIt\u2019s about your quality of life, your ability to enjoy life.

      "bodyText": "Beales, the department store chain, has put itself on the market after warning it faced \u201cexceptionally challenging times\u201d. The loss-making retailer said it had appointed the advisory firm KPMG to help assess \u201cstrategic and financing options\u201d including a sale of the whole company or its subsidiaries in a bid to fund its moves towards a \u201csustainable business model\u201d. In October 2018, Beales, which has 22 outlets across the UK, completed a management buyout led by the chief executive, Anthony Brown. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Beales said it needed funds to support a new strategy, which included a rejig of its product ranges, cost-saving efforts and acquiring stores similar to an outlet in Fareham that opened in October in a former Marks &amp; Spencer branch. The appointment of KPMG, which is known for its expertise on insolvency and restructuring, is likely to raise fears that the retailer is facing a crash crunch. Beale Ltd, the Bournemouth-based group\u2019s parent company, said it was facing \u201cexceptionally challenging times\u201d in accounts for the year to the end of March filed at Companies House in October. Pretax losses for the group more than doubled to \u00a33.2m in the year to March from \u00a31.5m a year before as sales remained steady at \u00a348.3m. The business had net current debts of \u00a315.8m. It said in those accounts that trading had been hampered by an industry-wide downturn in sales of women\u2019s fashion and the heatwave in summer 2018. Beale Ltd said its working capital had been funded by Wells Fargo, with which the department store has a \u00a317.3m facility in place until May 2021, and that the company also had credit arrangements in place with major suppliers. But department stores are under pressure from rising costs, particularly business rates, and increasing competition as the brands they have specialised in are now going direct to shoppers either online or via their own stores. Sports Direct\u2019s House of Fraser chain has closed seven of its 59 sites since buying it out of administration last year, and it is expected to close more in 2020. Debenhams is poised to close more than 20 stores in January, and a number of local department store groups including Scotland\u2019s Watt Brothers have fallen into administration.",

We already know, though, that Morgan listens to Classic FM while doing her red boxes, greatly enjoys the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan productions by a company in her former constituency of Loughborough, and that her department tweeted congratulations to Phoebe Waller-Bridge for winning an Emmy for Fleabag.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a1ba95c8bf0895dd8e6f56dea28a7154ebb80527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1ba95c8bf0895dd8e6f56dea28a7154ebb80527/0_0_1758_2198/800.jpg\" alt=\"Everything is tactical \u2026 Boris Johnson\u2019s advisor Dominic Cummings.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everything is tactical \u2026 Boris Johnson\u2019s advisor Dominic Cummings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, this time, the bigger question is not what we can expect from the secretary, but what may be in store for her department. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief advisor, Dominic Cummings, is essentially a more feral version of Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It. For Cummings, everything is tactical \u2013 and Morgan\u2019s continuation feels like a two-part move.</p> <p>In the short term, it avoids a new culture secretary being heavily probed about the future of the BBC, which is the most urgent DCMS responsibility. (Although she wouldn\u2019t have been at risk from Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, as Cummings has apparently banned ministers from appearing on it.) We already know that Morgan is \u201copen-minded\u201d on this. However, as a peer can\u2019t speak in the Commons, having to delegate a junior minister to answer questions there, it is probably too radical even for a Cummings-Johnson administration to attempt to reform the BBC \u2013 and take other major cultural decisions \u2013 through a secretary who can\u2019t be challenged by MPs.</p> <p>Therefore, the strong expectation is that Morgan, who said she left politics to have a \u201cnormal family life\u201d, is putting that wish on hold only until a promised bigger reshuffle on 1 February, the day after the UK is expected to leave the EU. Westminster expectation is that this will re-allocate not just ministerial incumbents but the departments themselves.</p> <p>In the light of this, it seems striking that the 2019 Conservative manifesto had no separate chapter or even a paragraph dedicated to culture, as has generally been the case. Ideas for an \u201carts premium\u201d and \u201ccultural capital programme\u201d (both explained below) appeared in the Education and Environment sections respectively. Spun at the time as the consequence of a deliberately slimmed-down manifesto, it now seems a possible harbinger of a division of the brief across other departments. So Morgan may be the last culture secretary, at least in the current form.</p> <p>But even if the DCMS goes away, the issues facing it will not. Here are the priority emails in the inboxes of whoever gets the political responsibility for them in the next few months.</p> <p><strong>Cultural imports<br></strong>The<strong> </strong>most immediately tricky responsibility is the question of visa and immigration arrangements, after Brexit, for the numerous artists, orchestras and theatre companies that currently travel easily through waiver and reciprocation schemes.</p> <p>The 11-month transition period after 31 January, in which protocols will likely remain unchanged, gives a little leeway. But with concert halls and opera houses planning many years ahead, firm answers will be needed soon about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/18/baroque-orchestra-eu-britain-brexit-immigration-free-movement\">how to get an orchestra in to the UK from 2021</a>.

Having recently resigned as both an MP and the cabinet member for Digital Culture Media and Sport, Nicky Morgan was given a peerage to continue, after yesterday\u2019s mini-reshuffle, her ministerial role from the Lords. Traditionally, when a new cultural overlord is appointed, there is a media ritual of probing what, in the field of arts, they might know or like.

But with the Conservatives holding only six of 59 seats in Scotland, and the DUP estranged from its former Tory allies over Brexit, the Johnson government has only a technical mandate in half of the UK, while separatist rhetoric is rising. In these circumstances, a celebration of the union seems certain to be subject to sarcasm and protest, and even potentially terrorism. Broadcasting The biggest issues in television, radio and digital are the form and funding of the BBC, and whether Channel 4, which few voters may even realise is still owned by the state, should be privatised. Channel 4\u2019s unique status \u2013 funded by advertising revenue, but owned by the state \u2013 is still defensible.

      "bodyText": "Tough and tender marked the acting style of Nicky Henson, who has died after a long illness aged 74. Energetic and ebullient were other critical adjectives flying around a career of more than five decades in revue, musicals, with the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and on television (Fawlty Towers and EastEnders) and in films by Roy Boulting (There\u2019s A Girl in My Soup, 1970), Mike Leigh (Vera Drake, 2004) and George Clooney (Syriana, 2005). The range and variety of his work was astonishing, and seems even more so after taking into account the cancer and serial medical procedures he endured over the last 20 years of his life. But he was like Bobby Vee\u2019s rubber ball that came bouncing back all the time. It was the director Frank Dunlop who really unleashed his talent when he founded the Young Vic in 1970 and picked Henson as a cornerstone actor \u2013 alongside Jim Dale, Denise Coffey and Gary Bond \u2013 in a project revitalising classics for a new audience. Between 1970 and 1973, Henson played in Moli\u00e8re, Goldsmith, Shakespeare and Stoppard, scoring particularly as Pozzo in Waiting for Godot, Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet and Jimmy Porter in Look Back in Anger. He was also the sado-masochistic housemaid Solange in Jean Genet\u2019s The Maids. Now ready for take-off, in 1973-74 alone he played in Peter Handke\u2019s enigmatic A Ride Across Lake Constance at the Hampstead theatre and the Mayfair with Alan Howard, Nicola Pagett and Gayle Hunnicutt; Laertes, Bottom (never was bully Bottom bullier) and Petruchio at the Open Air theatre, Regent\u2019s Park; and Buttons to Twiggy\u2019s Cinderella at the London Casino (now the Prince Edward). And on television he starred as a rumbustious Balzac in a three-part study of the novelist\u2019s love life \u2013 Prometheus: The Life of Balzac (1975) \u2013 with a top cast including Helen Ryan, Rosemary McHale and Elizabeth Spriggs. Born in London, Nicky was the son of the music hall star and producer Leslie Henson and his third wife, Billie Collins. He was educated at St Bede\u2019s prep school, Eastbourne, and Charterhouse, Godalming, Surrey, before training as a stage manager at Rada. Also a musician, he formed, and played guitar in, a pop group called the Wombats and wrote songs for Cliff Richard and the Shadows. He made his West End debut in a revue, All Square (1963), at the Vaudeville, with Beryl Reid, Naunton Wayne and Julian Holloway, after Beyond the Fringe had changed the face of the genre. Before joining the Young Vic he was modestly established in West End musical theatre. He played Mordred in Lerner and Loewe\u2019s Camelot at Drury Lane (1964), with Laurence Harvey and Elizabeth Larner; joined other young hopefuls Francesca Annis and Bill Kenwright in Wolf Mankowitz and John Barry\u2019s Passion Flower Hotel at the Prince of Wales (1965); supported Harry Secombe, Thora Hird and Russ Conway in London Laughs at the Palladium (1966); and spent 18 months in the Martin Starkie/Nevill Coghill musical version of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales (1968) at the Phoenix with Jessie Evans and Wilfrid Brambell. Henson\u2019s big number was I Have a Noble Cock (\u201che crows at break of day\u201d). His early films included the low-budget cult movie Witchfinder General (1968), a graphic tale of torture and persecution in the civil war, starring Vincent Price and Ian Ogilvy, the latter becoming a lifelong friend; There\u2019s A Girl in My Soup, starring Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn (Henson was Goldie\u2019s rock musician boyfriend); and The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones (1976), Henson succeeding Albert Finney as the athletic lothario in the superior 1963 Tony Richardson version, though Henson\u2019s fellow actors included Joan Collins, Terry-Thomas, and Trevor Howard. After the Young Vic and a 1977 tour \u2013 and season at the Savoy \u2013 with Shaw\u2019s Man and Superman for the RSC, co-starring Richard Pasco and Susan Hampshire, Henson joined Peter Hall\u2019s National on the South Bank from 1978 to 1980, playing in Chekhov, Edward Bond (The Woman), Middleton and Rowley\u2019s A Fair Quarrel and two Restoration classics directed by Peter Wood, The Double Dealer and The Provok\u2019d Wife. Somehow he squeezed in a reunion with Dunlop for a West End season in the Ben Travers farce Rookery Nook, at Her Majesty\u2019s (1979). This was a play first produced by his father with Tom Walls in the Aldwych farce series in 1926. His second great farce triumph came in Michael Frayn\u2019s Noises Off (1982) as the ageing juvenile lead Roger Templemain, who can only articulate semi-sensibly while spouting the lines \u201cin character\u201d as the hapless Gary Lejeune. He returned to the RSC for the 1985-86 seasons and gave two fantastic performances as Touchstone in As You Like It, a role usually immune to comic invention but here transformed into a music hall chameleon; and as the frenetic Frank Ford in The Merry Wives of Windsor, searching a palpably uninhabited laundry basket for his cuckolder and adopting a ludicrous disguise as a moustachioed little Hitler in a yellow bicycle plastic mac. In the second series of Fawlty Towers (1979), Henson had played Mr Johnson, a fruity medallion man Basil suspects of smuggling a woman into his room. He had. But all the proprietor\u2019s attempts to prove it failed. Finally confronted by Basil the next day, Mr Johnson was able to produce his (newly arrived) mother. In the subsequent decade, his TV work embraced several mini-series: The Happy Apple (1983), scripted by Keith Waterhouse from a Jack Pulman stage play set in a failing advertisement agency; Thin Air (1988), in which a radio reporter uncovers local corruption; and Kingsley Amis\u2019s The Green Man (1990), Finney leading a cast including Henson, Linda Marlowe, Josie Lawrence and Michael Grandage. In the 1990s, he appeared as Vershinin in Frank McGuinness\u2019s version of Three Sisters with the Cusack sisters and their father Cyril at the Royal Court; in Ronald Harwood\u2019s Reflected Glory with Finney at the Vaudeville; and on a bill of Frayn playlets and sketches, Alarms and Excursions, at the Gielgud.

She can mix it too \u2013 witness her appearance on C4\u2019s 18-30 debate. Rayner is the potential Labour leader the Tories most fear. Let\u2019s hope Labour gets it right at this critical time.<br><strong>Adrian Quinn</strong><br><em>Chepstow, Monmouthshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 At last, the perfect opportunity has arisen for the Labour party to resurrect itself. It can present a new image that will be truly transformational, demonstrating that it understands that real democracy requires gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment at its centre. It should adapt the Kurdish model of \u201cco-chairs\u201d, a man and a woman heading every decision-making body. <br><strong>Margaret Owen </strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The paramount question that should be asked of any candidate for the Labour leadership is whether they support proportional representation. As far as I am aware, none of those being touted as potential leaders has ever voiced support. Labour, perhaps even more than the Tories, is institutionally and historically wedded to the idea that under first-past-the-post it is possible to win a decent majority with less than 40% of the vote.</p> <p>Essentially, the political spectrum in England involves two great camps \u2013 the conservative centre-right and the social-liberal centre-left. The problem for the latter is that while its opponents organise around one political party, the Tories, it is fragmented between Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens. This fragmentation is further compounded in Scotland and Wales. The injustice of the FPTP system is especially acute in Scotland where an overwhelmingly centre-left and heavily anti-Brexit majority is ignored by a dominant English nationalist hegemony.</p> <p>It is possible, with the loss of its heartlands and the breakdown of personal identification through class, that Labour is now unable to win a majority on its own. A commitment to PR by a new leader would immediately bring hope to the anti-Tory majority.<br><strong>Brian Wilson</strong><br><em>Glossop, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have nothing against Rebecca Long-Bailey as a person but politically she is a charisma vacuum with a voice that sends you to sleep.

She can mix it too \u2013 witness her appearance on C4\u2019s 18-30 debate. Rayner is the potential Labour leader the Tories most fear. Let\u2019s hope Labour gets it right at this critical time. Adrian Quinn Chepstow, Monmouthshire \u2022 At last, the perfect opportunity has arisen for the Labour party to resurrect itself. It can present a new image that will be truly transformational, demonstrating that it understands that real democracy requires gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment at its centre. It should adapt the Kurdish model of \u201cco-chairs\u201d, a man and a woman heading every decision-making body. Margaret Owen London \u2022 The paramount question that should be asked of any candidate for the Labour leadership is whether they support proportional representation. As far as I am aware, none of those being touted as potential leaders has ever voiced support. Labour, perhaps even more than the Tories, is institutionally and historically wedded to the idea that under first-past-the-post it is possible to win a decent majority with less than 40% of the vote. Essentially, the political spectrum in England involves two great camps \u2013 the conservative centre-right and the social-liberal centre-left. The problem for the latter is that while its opponents organise around one political party, the Tories, it is fragmented between Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens. This fragmentation is further compounded in Scotland and Wales. The injustice of the FPTP system is especially acute in Scotland where an overwhelmingly centre-left and heavily anti-Brexit majority is ignored by a dominant English nationalist hegemony. It is possible, with the loss of its heartlands and the breakdown of personal identification through class, that Labour is now unable to win a majority on its own. A commitment to PR by a new leader would immediately bring hope to the anti-Tory majority. Brian Wilson Glossop, Derbyshire \u2022 I have nothing against Rebecca Long-Bailey as a person but politically she is a charisma vacuum with a voice that sends you to sleep. Labour needs a passionate, charismatic personality \u2013 Jess Phillips is my choice \u2013 if it is to stand a chance of gaining power.

The world\u2019s livestock systems differ too significantly for them to be generalised, and doing so hinders the countries that are practising sustainable farming methods and which have an ambition to do even more.</p> <p>Compared with the mass-scale intensive systems in the US or Brazil, our livestock systems are unrecognisable. British farmers do not clear rainforest to make way for beef production. Our meat does not come from the ashes of the Amazon. We value our carbon sinks.</p> <p>Grazing cattle is the most sustainable way to use the 65% of UK farmland that is unsuitable for growing any other crop. It is hugely beneficial for the soil, helps lock up carbon, and is the best way to turn inedible grass into highly nutritious protein for a growing population to enjoy.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, British farmers have an ambition to become net zero by 2040. We want to lead the way in climate-friendly meat and dairy and pave the way for others to follow. This needs to be recognised.<br><strong>Stuart Roberts</strong><br><em>Vice-president, NFU </em></p> <p>\u2022 Damian Carrington is correct that people in wealthy countries need to eat less meat. But to make targets for reductions in meat consumption is to put the cart before the horse. Excessive meat production is a symptom, not a cause, of the problem. Once we start to eliminate the use of fossil fuels, economic forces will reduce livestock numbers to sustainable levels because there will be increased demand for land for biomass, and because artificial fertilisers will almost certainly be in short supply.</p> <p>Until that happens there is a danger that focusing on meat and livestock will be a futile distraction from the task at hand which is to put an end to the use of fossil fuels. <br><strong>Simon Fairlie</strong><br><em>The Land magazine</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "It is too simplistic to say that cutting livestock numbers everywhere is the most efficient way of reducing emissions, as your article suggests (Governments urged to set deadlines for cutting livestock production, 12 December). The world\u2019s livestock systems differ too significantly for them to be generalised, and doing so hinders the countries that are practising sustainable farming methods and which have an ambition to do even more. Compared with the mass-scale intensive systems in the US or Brazil, our livestock systems are unrecognisable. British farmers do not clear rainforest to make way for beef production. Our meat does not come from the ashes of the Amazon. We value our carbon sinks. Grazing cattle is the most sustainable way to use the 65% of UK farmland that is unsuitable for growing any other crop. It is hugely beneficial for the soil, helps lock up carbon, and is the best way to turn inedible grass into highly nutritious protein for a growing population to enjoy. What\u2019s more, British farmers have an ambition to become net zero by 2040. We want to lead the way in climate-friendly meat and dairy and pave the way for others to follow. This needs to be recognised. Stuart Roberts Vice-president, NFU \u2022 Damian Carrington is correct that people in wealthy countries need to eat less meat. But to make targets for reductions in meat consumption is to put the cart before the horse. Excessive meat production is a symptom, not a cause, of the problem. Once we start to eliminate the use of fossil fuels, economic forces will reduce livestock numbers to sustainable levels because there will be increased demand for land for biomass, and because artificial fertilisers will almost certainly be in short supply. Until that happens there is a danger that focusing on meat and livestock will be a futile distraction from the task at hand which is to put an end to the use of fossil fuels.

A number of prominent SNP women, including MSP Joan McAlpine and the MP and anti-Brexit campaigner Joanna Cherry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/14/snp-women-close-to-quitting-gender-recognition-proposals-trans-rights-scotland\">launched a \u201cwomen\u2019s pledge\u201d</a> at an event that ran alongside the party\u2019s conference in October, calling for cis women to have the right to discuss such policies.</p> <p>But more detailed notes in the consultation document emphasise that rights established for cis women in the Equality Act would not be affected by the proposed reforms, in particular the exemptions that make it possible to exclude transgender women from, for example, a rape counselling service, a domestic violence shelter or jobs that involve intimate health and personal care being provided to cis women.</p> <p>Somerville urged those responding to the consultation to \u201cbe respectful and listen to others\u201d and insisted that she maintained \u201can open-door policy to all those who wish to discuss our proposals\u201d.</p> <p>But the group For Women Scotland, one of a number of grassroots activist groups formed to channel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/01/activists-in-scotland-disagree-about-transgender-legislation\">concern about the reforms</a>, said Somerville had not met them despite their requests. The group is planning a series of public meetings to discuss responses to the consultation.</p> <p>Others expressed concerns that the emollient language in the consultation would not be matched by significant policy explanation. The policy analyst collective Murray Blackburn Mackenzie, which has published critical assessments of transgender reform, welcomed the further consultation, saying: \u201cWe now need a transparent process, in which substantial questions about law, evidence and analysis receive substantial answers.\u201d<strong><br></strong></p>",

That first consultation, which ran for four months in 2018, faced criticism that it relied too heavily on government-funded women\u2019s and equality organisations and did not canvas the views of ordinary women. The re-opening of the consultation, and the re-drafting of the bill to leave out more controversial suggestions such as the recognition of non-binary people, is thought to reflect a significant rift within the Scottish government over the issue. A number of prominent SNP women, including MSP Joan McAlpine and the MP and anti-Brexit campaigner Joanna Cherry, launched a \u201cwomen\u2019s pledge\u201d at an event that ran alongside the party\u2019s conference in October, calling for cis women to have the right to discuss such policies. But more detailed notes in the consultation document emphasise that rights established for cis women in the Equality Act would not be affected by the proposed reforms, in particular the exemptions that make it possible to exclude transgender women from, for example, a rape counselling service, a domestic violence shelter or jobs that involve intimate health and personal care being provided to cis women. Somerville urged those responding to the consultation to \u201cbe respectful and listen to others\u201d and insisted that she maintained \u201can open-door policy to all those who wish to discuss our proposals\u201d. But the group For Women Scotland, one of a number of grassroots activist groups formed to channel concern about the reforms, said Somerville had not met them despite their requests. The group is planning a series of public meetings to discuss responses to the consultation. Others expressed concerns that the emollient language in the consultation would not be matched by significant policy explanation. The policy analyst collective Murray Blackburn Mackenzie, which has published critical assessments of transgender reform, welcomed the further consultation, saying: \u201cWe now need a transparent process, in which substantial questions about law, evidence and analysis receive substantial answers.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>CARLO, LA</strong></h2> <p>You have to feel desperately sorry for Arsenal fans. Their beloved club has been slowly drifting into their greatest period of thundering irrelevance since the 1960s, when the team became such a mid-table non-event that at one point they got rid of their famous white sleeves and nobody noticed they were playing in plain red shirts for two years. Eventually they snapped out of their collective trance, got their gamefaces on (as well as the old classic kit) and by 1971 were champions of England again. Point being, the light at the end of the tunnel is always closer than you think, although as Arsenal won only one more trophy in the subsequent 16 years, and that an FA Cup against a Manchester United team who only turned up for the final at 4.41pm, it\u2019s probably best not to pull too hard on the threads of this particular historical parallel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/17/mikel-arteta-arsenal-talks-manchester-city-pep-guardiola-travel-carabao-cup-oxford\">Arteta in Arsenal talks but will travel with Manchester City, says Guardiola</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But right now the drift goes on. As things stand, they haven\u2019t made a successful managerial appointment since 1996, and could really do with putting an end to that sequence. The hope is to get their former midfielder Mikel Arteta <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/17/mikel-arteta-arsenal-talks-manchester-city-pep-guardiola-travel-carabao-cup-oxford\">in place</a>. Arteta has been learning the ropes and tasted plenty of success as Pep Guardiola\u2019s No 2, and is perhaps the Premier League No 2 most hotly tipped to make the step up since the days when Brian Kidd sat alongside Lord Ferg at Manchester United. Admittedly Kidd\u2019s career as a No 1 didn\u2019t quite pan out as expected, but you can\u2019t rewrite history, there <em>was</em> a similar buzz around him at the time. And hey, if Arteta\u2019s Arsenal were to go the same way as Brian\u2019s Blackeye Rovers, 100 consecutive years has been a pretty good run.</p> <p>There\u2019s been no news, though, as Arsenal continue to faff about. However, there\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/17/carlo-ancelotti-agrees-deal-with-everton-to-take-over-as-manager\">no such dithering at Everton</a>, who are desperate to regain their status as the sort of big club whose breaking managerial news isn\u2019t bumped down to the third paragraph of a lame Fiver story during the winding-down period before Christmas. Their no-nonsense appointment of Carlo Ancelotti \u2013 to be ratified once he gets assurances over January transfers \u2013 may help the Toffees regain their former lustre. He is into the habit of winning trophies pretty much everywhere he goes, after all. Milan, Chelsea, PSG, Real Madrid, Bayern \u2026 in fact the only time it didn\u2019t go to plan was at Napoli, when for once he didn\u2019t possess one of the strongest squads in the league, and where they still pine for the glory days of 1987.

But right now the drift goes on. As things stand, they haven\u2019t made a successful managerial appointment since 1996, and could really do with putting an end to that sequence. The hope is to get their former midfielder Mikel Arteta in place. Arteta has been learning the ropes and tasted plenty of success as Pep Guardiola\u2019s No 2, and is perhaps the Premier League No 2 most hotly tipped to make the step up since the days when Brian Kidd sat alongside Lord Ferg at Manchester United. Admittedly Kidd\u2019s career as a No 1 didn\u2019t quite pan out as expected, but you can\u2019t rewrite history, there was a similar buzz around him at the time. And hey, if Arteta\u2019s Arsenal were to go the same way as Brian\u2019s Blackeye Rovers, 100 consecutive years has been a pretty good run. There\u2019s been no news, though, as Arsenal continue to faff about. However, there\u2019s been no such dithering at Everton, who are desperate to regain their status as the sort of big club whose breaking managerial news isn\u2019t bumped down to the third paragraph of a lame Fiver story during the winding-down period before Christmas. Their no-nonsense appointment of Carlo Ancelotti \u2013 to be ratified once he gets assurances over January transfers \u2013 may help the Toffees regain their former lustre. He is into the habit of winning trophies pretty much everywhere he goes, after all. Milan, Chelsea, PSG, Real Madrid, Bayern \u2026 in fact the only time it didn\u2019t go to plan was at Napoli, when for once he didn\u2019t possess one of the strongest squads in the league, and where they still pine for the glory days of 1987. Erm. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Nick Ames at 8pm GMT for red-hot coverage of Aston Villa 3-0 Liverpool U-12s. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cStrikers like me, depending on crosses and passes and playing with the offside line, are punished extremely by VAR \u2026 it\u2019s such bullsh!t. Then we have to buy a bunch of Messis who run off with the ball from the middle of the pitch to score the goals. Maybe this is the revenge from the referees sitting in that basement for busting their balls for 20 years on the pitch\u201d \u2013 Stuttgart\u2019s Mario G\u00f3mez, who has had six goals chalked off this season, is not a fan of VAR, or dribbly little skill-gnomes for that matter.

FIVER LETTER \u201cOnce again, Nicky Tanner disappoints me (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs). When naming his fantasy football team, surely he should have taken the chance to make a wry reference to one of the great own goals of all time? Or maybe it\u2019s still to early to risk reigniting the wrath of Bruce Grobbelaar\u201d \u2013 Tim Woods. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Serie A suits are dealing with another mighty mess after signing off on this artwork for its anti-racism campaign. They really did. In a big day for managerial desk-clearing, Kilmarnock have ushered boss Angelo Alessio through the door marked Do One only six months after he replaced Steve Clarke, while Graham Coughlan has said his goodbyes from Bristol Rovers, fourth in League One, and is expected to join Mansfield, 18th in League Two. Schalke keeper Alexander Nubel has been banned for four matches after Harald Schumachering Frankfurt\u2019s Mijat Gacinovic about 10 feet into the air on Sunday. Mason Greenwood might just have played his way into a regular starting role for Manchester United. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult now to put a team out there without having Mason in my mind,\u201d cooed Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. Mr Roy is thrilled that Crystal Palace managed to battle back in the big M23 set-to with Brighton. \u201cThe way the game panned out, I think I\u2019ve got to be very satisfied, to be honest it feels even like half a victory,\u201d he tooted after his side picked up a third of three points in a Fiver-predicted 1-1 draw. And Big Paper has won the Football Supporters\u2019 Association\u2019s newspaper of the year award for the seventh time in a row. STILL WANT MORE?

      "body": "<p>Ivanka Trump has ended 2019 in the most Ivanka way possible: conducting a pretend interview with a friendly journalist at a conference that she was not fit to attend.</p> <p>Over the weekend, the first daughter rounded off a year of tirelessly promoting herself with an appearance at the Doha Forum, which is one of those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/27/davos-2019-the-yawning-gap-between-rhetoric-and-reality\" title=\"\">Davos-like conferences</a> where the rich and powerful get together to hobnob and release huge amounts of hot air into the atmosphere. All in the name of solving the world\u2019s most complex problems, of course.</p> <p>As usual, Ivanka was one of the least qualified people in the room \u2013 but also one of the most shameless. While government officials such as Turkey\u2019s foreign minister and Rwanda\u2019s president fielded hard-hitting questions from journalists, Ivanka was interviewed by Morgan Ortagus, a US state department spokeswoman and former Fox News contributor. In other words, Ivanka basically sat down for an interview with her own PR person.</p> <p>As you can imagine, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/ivanka-trump-answered-questions-from-her-own-spokesperson\" title=\"\">the questions were brutal</a>. Ortagus delivered sycophantic prompts such as: \u201cYou were able to put women\u2019s prosperity into the national security strategy. That was so important to me that you did that and I\u2019d love for you to explain that.\u201d Obligingly, Ivanka waxed lyrical about how wonderful she is, while Ortagus oohed and aahed.</p> <p>Ivanka\u2019s extraordinarily softball interview raised some eyebrows. \u201cEven Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t get interviewed by [the Kremlin press secretary] Dmitri Peskov,\u201d complained one Russian journalist. Poor Ivanka was immediately dismissed as \u201cNepotism Barbie\u201d by the Twitterati, which was rather below the belt; Barbie\u2019s daddy never gave her a high-ranking job in the government.</p> <p>But that is enough snark. Whatever you think of Ivanka, she has achieved an astonishing amount this year. As her father announced recently to the Economic Club of New York, she single-handedly \u201ccreated 14m jobs\u201d \u2013 which is truly remarkable when you consider that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/trump-claims-ivanka-created-14m-jobs-the-entire-economy-only-added-6m\" title=\"\">the entire </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/trump-claims-ivanka-created-14m-jobs-the-entire-economy-only-added-6m\" title=\"\">US economy has </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/trump-claims-ivanka-created-14m-jobs-the-entire-economy-only-added-6m\" title=\"\">added only 6m jobs under Trump</a>.</p> <p>Of course, Ivanka has done more than anyone to empower women. In February, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/16/hypocrisy-without-borders-ivanka-trump-trip-africa-ethiopia-ivory-coast\" title=\"\">she launched the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/16/hypocrisy-without-borders-ivanka-trump-trip-africa-ethiopia-ivory-coast\" title=\"\">initiative</a> to help 50 million female entrepreneurs globally. This would be great, were it not for the fact that her daddy\u2019s government has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/11/fears-grow-trump-threat-us-foreign-aid-putting-live-at-risk\" title=\"\">enormous cuts to foreign aid</a> and reinstated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/23/trump-abortion-gag-rule-international-ngo-funding\" title=\"\">the \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d</a> that means international NGOs are barred from US government health funding if they perform or promote abortions. <a href=\"https://politicsofpoverty.oxfamamerica.org/2017/05/trumps-budget-is-an-attack-on-women-around-the-world/\" title=\"\">As Oxfam has noted</a>, Ivanka\u2019s initiatives \u201cwon\u2019t even come close to making up for the damage done\u201d by the Trump administration.</p> <p>The inspiring thing about Ivanka is that reality never gets in her way. She is blessed with the opposite of imposter syndrome. She is a motivational quote in high heels \u2013 there is nothing Ivanka thinks she can\u2019t do. To be fair, there is little she hasn\u2019t done. This year alone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/30/ivanka-trump-g20-leaders-video-alexandria-ocasio-cortez\" title=\"\">she </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/30/ivanka-trump-g20-leaders-video-alexandria-ocasio-cortez\" title=\"\">rubbed shoulders with world leaders </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/30/ivanka-trump-g20-leaders-video-alexandria-ocasio-cortez\" title=\"\">at the G</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/30/ivanka-trump-g20-leaders-video-alexandria-ocasio-cortez\" title=\"\">20</a>; sashayed into North Korea with her papa and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/30/ivanka-trump-says-stepping-into-north-korea-surreal\" title=\"\">declared the experience \u201csurreal\u201d</a>; patronised women on a grand tour of Africa; and bought <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/ivanka-trump-dog-white-winter-daughter-gift-twitter-1450493\" title=\"\">the world\u2019s whitest dog</a>.</p> <p>It is easy to laugh at her. But if 2019 has taught us anything, it is that the Trump family is having the last laugh. They have weaponised exhaustion. From day one of Donald\u2019s presidency, they have eschewed established norms and acted shamelessly. Meanwhile, the rest of us have grown too tired to remain outraged. We have become used to Ivanka placing herself on the world stage. But beware: the woman is a wolf in chic clothing.</p> <h2>More bad news for the PC army</h2> <p>Sticking with the Trumps, sad news from the muddy trenches of Manhattan, where I have spent the better part of a decade fighting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/23/trump-war-on-christmas-happy-holidays-businesses\" title=\"\">the war on Christmas</a>. It has been a bloody battle and there have been times when my comrades in the PC army have come tantalisingly close to victory. Alas, our enemy triumphed. We must finally admit defeat: the war on Christmas has been lost. The Trumps and their allies have won. And by God are they smug about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1206043662855102464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jeanine Pirro: &quot;[Trump family has] done wonderful things for this country.

Of all the stealth battles that have been fought, the war on Christmas was truly the stealthiest. No one but the devout viewers of Fox knew it was happening. Indeed, according to a study by Fairleigh Dickinson University, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/us/war-on-christmas-controversy.html\" title=\"\">watching Fox increased the likelihood someone would believe in the festive conflict by between 5% and 10%</a>. It is almost as if the whole thing was a delusion dreamed up by the right.</p> <p>But worry not, my friends: all is not lost. The war may be over, but there are plenty more battles to fight. I don\u2019t know about you, but I am going to spend the non-denominational holidays recharging my environmentally friendly batteries. And then I am off to fight in the war against men.</p> <p><em>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Ivanka Trump has ended 2019 in the most Ivanka way possible: conducting a pretend interview with a friendly journalist at a conference that she was not fit to attend. Over the weekend, the first daughter rounded off a year of tirelessly promoting herself with an appearance at the Doha Forum, which is one of those Davos-like conferences where the rich and powerful get together to hobnob and release huge amounts of hot air into the atmosphere. All in the name of solving the world\u2019s most complex problems, of course. As usual, Ivanka was one of the least qualified people in the room \u2013 but also one of the most shameless. While government officials such as Turkey\u2019s foreign minister and Rwanda\u2019s president fielded hard-hitting questions from journalists, Ivanka was interviewed by Morgan Ortagus, a US state department spokeswoman and former Fox News contributor. In other words, Ivanka basically sat down for an interview with her own PR person. As you can imagine, the questions were brutal. Ortagus delivered sycophantic prompts such as: \u201cYou were able to put women\u2019s prosperity into the national security strategy. That was so important to me that you did that and I\u2019d love for you to explain that.\u201d Obligingly, Ivanka waxed lyrical about how wonderful she is, while Ortagus oohed and aahed. Ivanka\u2019s extraordinarily softball interview raised some eyebrows. \u201cEven Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t get interviewed by [the Kremlin press secretary] Dmitri Peskov,\u201d complained one Russian journalist. Poor Ivanka was immediately dismissed as \u201cNepotism Barbie\u201d by the Twitterati, which was rather below the belt; Barbie\u2019s daddy never gave her a high-ranking job in the government. But that is enough snark. Whatever you think of Ivanka, she has achieved an astonishing amount this year. As her father announced recently to the Economic Club of New York, she single-handedly \u201ccreated 14m jobs\u201d \u2013 which is truly remarkable when you consider that the entire US economy has added only 6m jobs under Trump. Of course, Ivanka has done more than anyone to empower women. In February, she launched the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity initiative to help 50 million female entrepreneurs globally. This would be great, were it not for the fact that her daddy\u2019s government has made enormous cuts to foreign aid and reinstated the \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d that means international NGOs are barred from US government health funding if they perform or promote abortions. As Oxfam has noted, Ivanka\u2019s initiatives \u201cwon\u2019t even come close to making up for the damage done\u201d by the Trump administration. The inspiring thing about Ivanka is that reality never gets in her way. She is blessed with the opposite of imposter syndrome. She is a motivational quote in high heels \u2013 there is nothing Ivanka thinks she can\u2019t do. To be fair, there is little she hasn\u2019t done. This year alone, she rubbed shoulders with world leaders at the G20; sashayed into North Korea with her papa and declared the experience \u201csurreal\u201d; patronised women on a grand tour of Africa; and bought the world\u2019s whitest dog. It is easy to laugh at her. But if 2019 has taught us anything, it is that the Trump family is having the last laugh. They have weaponised exhaustion. From day one of Donald\u2019s presidency, they have eschewed established norms and acted shamelessly. Meanwhile, the rest of us have grown too tired to remain outraged. We have become used to Ivanka placing herself on the world stage. But beware: the woman is a wolf in chic clothing. More bad news for the PC army Sticking with the Trumps, sad news from the muddy trenches of Manhattan, where I have spent the better part of a decade fighting the war on Christmas. It has been a bloody battle and there have been times when my comrades in the PC army have come tantalisingly close to victory. Alas, our enemy triumphed. We must finally admit defeat: the war on Christmas has been lost. The Trumps and their allies have won. And by God are they smug about it. \u201cWe now don\u2019t have the political correctness we used to,\u201d crowed the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro during a recent interview with Eric Trump (the blond one who looks perpetually confused) and his wife, Lara. \u201cPeople are actually saying: \u2018Merry Christmas.\u2019\u201d Lara joyously concurred. \u201cYou can say Merry Christmas again!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that so nice, Jeanine?\u201d Eric agreed that it was just so nice, Jeanine. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d he enthused, as best his seventh-grade vocabulary would allow. \u201cIt is nice to say Merry Christmas again \u2026 This is what the American dream is all about \u2026 We can sit there with a Santa Claus and with beautiful trees and eat ice-cream.\u201d Activities that, of course, were outlawed under Obama. If you weren\u2019t a footsoldier in the war, you could be forgiven for not knowing the conflict even existed. Of all the stealth battles that have been fought, the war on Christmas was truly the stealthiest. No one but the devout viewers of Fox knew it was happening. Indeed, according to a study by Fairleigh Dickinson University, watching Fox increased the likelihood someone would believe in the festive conflict by between 5% and 10%. It is almost as if the whole thing was a delusion dreamed up by the right. But worry not, my friends: all is not lost. The war may be over, but there are plenty more battles to fight. I don\u2019t know about you, but I am going to spend the non-denominational holidays recharging my environmentally friendly batteries. And then I am off to fight in the war against men.

      "bodyText": "A woman is slowly recovering after suffering a fractured spine when she was crushed by a sofa that fell from the roof of a building. Edita Butkeviciute, 30, is expected to be in hospital for the next three months after she suffered injuries to her spine, legs and lungs following the incident in Aberdeen city centre on 7 December. Doctors were initially unsure if she would walk again. Butkeviciute had to have two operations and is slowly recovering and doing well, her boyfriend, Daniel Ferreira, said. \u201cShe is recovering well and doing well. She\u2019s strong,\u201d Ferreira said. He described the incident as a \u201cmassive shock\u201d and said he gripped with fear when he got a phone call from his partner, who was being seen by first responders. \u201cI was on the phone to her. I was just afraid and really scared.\u201d Butkeviciute was quickly taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary by the Scottish ambulance service. \u201cWhen she first got to the hospital, they had to see if she was going to walk again. She had two surgeries,\u201d Ferreira said. A spokesperson for Police Scotland confirmed two men aged 31 and 26 had been charged. \u201cA report has been submitted to the procurator fiscal.\u201d Butkeviciute told the BBC she was lucky to be alive. \u201cI remember just waking up, I screamed really loud for help and started feeling cold. I couldn\u2019t move,\u201d she said from her hospital bed. She added: \u201cWhen I woke up the second time I saw the sofa just in front of me \u2013 a burgundy, three-seater leather sofa.\u201d She told the public broadcaster: \u201cIt\u2019s like little simple stuff I cannot do now \u2013 I will be in here for three months until I fully recover. Thankfully I am not paralysed. \u201cThe doctor said: \u2018You are so lucky.\u2019 I am very lucky, I will still be able to live my life as normal. I am alive.\u201d The couple have been together for over 10 years and live together. Her boyfriend Ferreira said he would be making regular visits to the hospital to see her. \u201cI\u2019m going to be here until she is able to to come back home. I\u2019ll come home every day, regardless of my shift schedule. If I\u2019m working in the morning, I\u2019ll come in the evening and if I\u2019m working in the evening, I\u2019ll come in the morning,\u201d Ferreira said. He added he didn\u2019t mind spending Christmas at the hospital. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m next to her I\u2019m happy.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A rape survivor who fled Afghanistan was allegedly blinded in one eye by her husband, following Home Office delays to bring her to safety in the UK.</p> <p>The woman, an asylum seeker who cannot be named for legal reasons, fled her home country with her three young children after being subjected to a series of rapes, not by her husband.</p> <p>She feared she could be murdered if family members discovered what had happened to her and was particularly fearful of her husband\u2019s reaction if he found out.</p> <p>The woman has a sister in the UK who is a British citizen. She and her children managed to reach France and then applied for family reunion in the UK with her sister under regulations known as Dublin III.</p> <p>The Home Office refused a request from France to take charge of the woman\u2019s asylum claim in April. Following legal proceedings by the woman\u2019s solicitor in July 2019, the Home Office agreed to reconsider the case, only to refuse it again in September.</p> <p>The woman told her solicitor that her husband followed her to France and she believed her life could be at risk from him.</p> <p>On 15 October, her solicitor wrote to the Home Office warning against delays to bring the woman and her children to the UK. \u201cIt is a potentially extremely serious domestic situation which must be speedily resolved,\u201d the solicitor wrote.</p> <p>She received no response from the Home Office to her letter, nor to a follow-up email emphasising the danger the woman was in.</p> <p>On 3 November, the woman says she was violently attacked by her husband. He beat her and stabbed her with a knife through her right eye. She was rushed to Lille Central hospital for treatment for her injuries.</p> <p>Her solicitor wrote to the Home Office on 6 November informing them of the attack, but still received no response. On 12 November, she issued urgent legal proceedings and obtained an a court order instructing the Home Office to expedite bringing the woman and her children to the UK.</p> <p>On 28 November, the Home Office agreed to bring the woman and her children to the UK. However, they are still in France.</p> <p>The French media reported the alleged attack on the woman by her husband and said he had tried to take out her other eye but she managed to push him away. He was arrested and taken into police custody.</p> <p>The woman\u2019s sister has been going back and forth between the UK and France to look after her.</p> <p>She told the Guardian: \u201dMy sister is 10 years younger than me. In many ways I feel more like her mother than her sister. I can\u2019t bear the thought of her suffering. Both of us are crying all the time. I\u2019m appealing to the Home Office to bring her to the UK as soon as possible so that I can look after her and the children here.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, the woman said of her ordeal: \u201cIt is extremely shameful to have had this experience. My sister is my closest friend and the only person I rely on to get through the day. I urgently want to be admitted to the UK so I can feel safe and be supported by my sister to recover from the traumas I have experienced.\u201d</p> <p>Jane Ryan of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, who is representing the woman, said: \u201cThe Home Office has blood on its hands. [The Home secretary] Priti Patel talks big talk about protecting victims of gender-based violence. But when confronted with my client\u2019s pleas for protection and help she was ignored. Even now the Home Office has not told us what they\u2019re doing to facilitate this family\u2019s admission to the UK. We want them to urgently rectify the gross failures in this case.\u201d</p> <p>The charity Safe Passage has been providing support to the woman in France. Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of Safe Passage, said: \u201cThe Home Office failed this woman with tragic consequences. Officials systematically fail to comply with legal time limits, leaving individuals in extreme vulnerability.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A rape survivor who fled Afghanistan was allegedly blinded in one eye by her husband, following Home Office delays to bring her to safety in the UK. The woman, an asylum seeker who cannot be named for legal reasons, fled her home country with her three young children after being subjected to a series of rapes, not by her husband. She feared she could be murdered if family members discovered what had happened to her and was particularly fearful of her husband\u2019s reaction if he found out. The woman has a sister in the UK who is a British citizen. She and her children managed to reach France and then applied for family reunion in the UK with her sister under regulations known as Dublin III. The Home Office refused a request from France to take charge of the woman\u2019s asylum claim in April. Following legal proceedings by the woman\u2019s solicitor in July 2019, the Home Office agreed to reconsider the case, only to refuse it again in September. The woman told her solicitor that her husband followed her to France and she believed her life could be at risk from him. On 15 October, her solicitor wrote to the Home Office warning against delays to bring the woman and her children to the UK. \u201cIt is a potentially extremely serious domestic situation which must be speedily resolved,\u201d the solicitor wrote. She received no response from the Home Office to her letter, nor to a follow-up email emphasising the danger the woman was in. On 3 November, the woman says she was violently attacked by her husband. He beat her and stabbed her with a knife through her right eye. She was rushed to Lille Central hospital for treatment for her injuries. Her solicitor wrote to the Home Office on 6 November informing them of the attack, but still received no response. On 12 November, she issued urgent legal proceedings and obtained an a court order instructing the Home Office to expedite bringing the woman and her children to the UK. On 28 November, the Home Office agreed to bring the woman and her children to the UK. However, they are still in France. The French media reported the alleged attack on the woman by her husband and said he had tried to take out her other eye but she managed to push him away. He was arrested and taken into police custody. The woman\u2019s sister has been going back and forth between the UK and France to look after her. She told the Guardian: \u201dMy sister is 10 years younger than me. In many ways I feel more like her mother than her sister. I can\u2019t bear the thought of her suffering. Both of us are crying all the time. I\u2019m appealing to the Home Office to bring her to the UK as soon as possible so that I can look after her and the children here.\u201d In a statement, the woman said of her ordeal: \u201cIt is extremely shameful to have had this experience. My sister is my closest friend and the only person I rely on to get through the day. I urgently want to be admitted to the UK so I can feel safe and be supported by my sister to recover from the traumas I have experienced.\u201d Jane Ryan of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, who is representing the woman, said: \u201cThe Home Office has blood on its hands. [The Home secretary] Priti Patel talks big talk about protecting victims of gender-based violence. But when confronted with my client\u2019s pleas for protection and help she was ignored. Even now the Home Office has not told us what they\u2019re doing to facilitate this family\u2019s admission to the UK. We want them to urgently rectify the gross failures in this case.\u201d The charity Safe Passage has been providing support to the woman in France. Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of Safe Passage, said: \u201cThe Home Office failed this woman with tragic consequences. Officials systematically fail to comply with legal time limits, leaving individuals in extreme vulnerability.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The energy regulator has warned the operators of the UK\u2019s electricity networks that it will cut investor returns in a push to keep a cap on household electricity bills. Ofgem says the networks will provide lower company returns in the next price control period, from 2023, and it will push them to invest more in building a carbon neutral energy system. The regulator\u2019s drive to force networks to deliver more while making less comes after it admitted companies had been allowed to make \u201cunjustified\u201d returns for their owners to the detriment of household bills. Cathryn Scott, the acting head of networks at Ofgem, said the regulator\u2019s \u201cstable and predictable regulatory regime\u201d would allow companies to attract the investment they needed to \u201cgo further in decarbonising the system whilst saving consumers money by keeping returns as low as possible\u201d. Scott is filling the position on an interim basis after the previous head of networks, Jonathan Brearley, was promoted to become Ofgem\u2019s chief executive from February next year. The regulator is under pressure to prove that it can fully support the UK\u2019s 2050 climate targets after Britain\u2019s biggest business group, the CBI, said the regulator was failing to prioritise the climate emergency and should be given new statutory duties by the government. The CBI said Ofgem must place the climate crisis at its core to ensure that it did not unintentionally undermine the UK\u2019s green agenda. The calls have been echoed by major energy companies, green groups and the Committee on Climate Change. Ofgem says it will overhaul its regulatory approach to enable companies to meet new sources of demand on local grids, such as electric vehicles, and help energy users to manage their demand. It will also help companies to invest in anticipation of rising demand on the grid for car charging, even while this demand is uncertain. Earlier this year Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, accused Ofgem of hindering the rollout of electric vehicles by refusing to allow the company to invest an extra \u00a342m in upgrading its networks in anticipation of an electric boom. He told the Guardian there was a \u201ccolossal disconnect\u201d between the government\u2019s policy of accelerating the uptake of electric vehicles and the regulator\u2019s policy on supporting investment in charging. Ofgem said electricity networks would be \u201ccrucial\u201d to help the UK to meet its climate targets as the energy system increasingly relies on renewables \u201cto generate the electricity to power the country, our vehicles and potentially heat our homes too\u201d. The regulator said it planned to impose \u201ctough scrutiny\u201d of energy firms\u2019 plans. Ofgem made the warning just days after Labour\u2019s plans to take energy networks back into public control were dashed by the Conservatives\u2019 election victory. Earlier this week the regulator of the water industry \u2013 which was also included in Labour\u2019s wide-ranging nationalisation agenda \u2013 handed water companies the toughest price controls since privatisation. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 December 2019.

Persimmon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/06/persimmon-housebuilder-launches-review-drive-rebuild-image\">commissioned the review in April</a> and took other steps to rebuild its tarnished reputation. Its last annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/26/help-to-buy-persimmon-profits-scheme-builders\">profit topped \u00a31bn</a>, the biggest ever made by a UK housebuilder, and a big chunk of it was related to the taxpayer-funded help-to-buy scheme.</p> <p>The report said Persimmon\u2019s issue with \u201cmissing or improperly fitted cavity barriers is a systemic nationwide problem, which is a manifestation of poor culture coupled with the lack of a group build process\u201d.</p> <p>The barriers are designed to stop fire spreading. Persimmon said it had checked 16,000 homes and fixed the majority of those affected, and is inspecting more than 500 homes a week. Two-fifths of the houses it builds every year are timber frame.</p> <p>Persimmon said it was taking the issue very seriously and had taken \u201cextensive action,\u201d after discovering failings at various stages in the installation of cavity barriers at some properties. There has been inadequate supervision by the company and the approved building control inspector, NHBC, it said. Persimmon appointed fire engineering firm Arup in November to assess any further steps it should take.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3555c38d7d4e4e6ad69b6697be34fb057bffbf87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3555c38d7d4e4e6ad69b6697be34fb057bffbf87/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A construction worker lays bricks at a Persimmon residential property construction site in Cranfield.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A construction worker lays bricks at a Persimmon residential property construction site in Cranfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df8e7788f08c3972263bf15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-17T14:35:51.283Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over here, the FTSE 100 is trading some 16 points lower at 7,502.51, a 0.22% fall.

      "bodyText": "Time for our closing summary. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones dipped at the open as shares in Boeing fell more than 2%. The Dow fell 14 points to 28,221.75. The S&amp;P 500 edged up 4 points, or 0.12%, to 3,195.40 while the Nasdaq gained 15 points, or 0.17%, to 8,829.47. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 14 points, or 0.19% at 7,505.15 as the \u2018Boris bounce\u2019 fizzled out. Housebuilders and banks are among the biggest fallers, along with Unilever, which warned of weaker-than-expected sales growth today. European stock markets are also mostly trading lower. The pound has tumbled 1.3% to $1.3160 \u2013 back towards levels seen before Thursday\u2019s general election. The government is preparing to pass legislation that could cause a cliff-edge Brexit at the end of next year. Britain\u2019s factories suffered their worst slump in activity since the financial crisis a decade ago. The latest UK labour market data are a bit of a mixed bag: unemployment is down and employment is up, but wage growth has slowed and job vacancies have fallen. Good-bye \u2013 we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. An independent report has slammed the \u201cpoor culture\u201d at Persimmon, one of the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilders, which has come under heavy criticism for its shoddy workmanship and paying a \u00a375m bonus to its former chief executive last year. In particular, the report highlighted the firm\u2019s failure to install properly cavity barriers at its timber-framed houses, a key fire safety measure. The review, led by Stephanie Barwise QC of law firm Atkin Chambers, called on the company to reconsider its purpose and ambition, and to fundamentally change its culture. Persimmon commissioned the review in April and took other steps to rebuild its tarnished reputation. Its last annual profit topped \u00a31bn, the biggest ever made by a UK housebuilder, and a big chunk of it was related to the taxpayer-funded help-to-buy scheme. The report said Persimmon\u2019s issue with \u201cmissing or improperly fitted cavity barriers is a systemic nationwide problem, which is a manifestation of poor culture coupled with the lack of a group build process\u201d. The barriers are designed to stop fire spreading. Persimmon said it had checked 16,000 homes and fixed the majority of those affected, and is inspecting more than 500 homes a week. Two-fifths of the houses it builds every year are timber frame. Persimmon said it was taking the issue very seriously and had taken \u201cextensive action,\u201d after discovering failings at various stages in the installation of cavity barriers at some properties. There has been inadequate supervision by the company and the approved building control inspector, NHBC, it said. Persimmon appointed fire engineering firm Arup in November to assess any further steps it should take. Over here, the FTSE 100 is trading some 16 points lower at 7,502.51, a 0.22% fall. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 0.57% and France\u2019s CAC is down 0.25% while Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has bucked the negative trend with a 0.7% rise. The opening bell has rung on Wall Street. Stocks are largely flat, as expected, staying close to yesterday\u2019s record closing levels. Dow Jones down 8.39 points, or 0.03%, at 28,227.50 S&amp;P 500 up 3.65 points, or 0.1%, at 3,195.1 Nasdaq up 15.49 points, or 0.18%, at 8,827.72 The pound is still trading down 1.4% against the dollar, at $1.3147 \u2013 signalling that the \u2018Boris Bounce\u2019 is over. Investors are back to worrying that Britain will fail to agree a new trade deal with the EU by the end of next year. Looking ahead to the Wall Street open, stocks are expected to open close to yesterday\u2019s record closing levels. Boeing, however, is set for its worst open since August after the US aircraft maker decided to halt production of its grounded 737 Max plane. Back to the US, which has released more data, this time on industrial production. Output from manufacturers, miners and utilities rose 1.1% in November, which was better than expected, and a strong bounceback from October\u2019s decline of 0.9%. Manufacturing alone also posted 1.1% growth, following a 0.7% drop in October. Sadly, another UK retailer has gone into administration, just a week before Christmas. The online and pop-up bookseller The Book People appointed administrators at PricewaterhouseCoopers, putting almost 400 jobs at risk. At least, there will be no immediate job losses, according to the administrators, who also promised that Christmas orders already placed by customers will be fulfilled. PwC are now looking for a buyer of the business. My colleague Sarah Butler writes: The business makes 70% of its sales online, delivered from its warehouse in Bangor, Wales, and is thought to have suffered from heavy competition from Amazon. It also sells direct to schools and businesses, with pop-up shops in workplaces. It recently launched the Big Book Boost programme, which aimed to donate more than a million books to schools by 2022. Toby Underwood, joint administrator and a partner at PwC, said The Book People would continue to trade and no immediate redundancies were envisaged as a rapid sale of the business was explored. He also said that the US needed to reduce its trade gap with Europe to get its global trade deficit down, and that it must find ways to sell more goods to the EU. The US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has given an interview to Fox Business Network. He said that a trade between the US and the UK is a priority for Washington and negotiations will be launched soon. For sure, the UK is a priority. As soon as they get their objectives agreed to, we\u2019ll start talking. The US housing market is benefiting from low mortgage rates, and is propping up the wider economy. Construction of single-family houses \u2013 the largest share of the housing market \u2013 rose 2.4% to 938,000 units, the highest level since January. The number of multi-family homes started jumped 4.9% to 427,000. US housing starts rose more than expected last month, and permits for future home construction jumped to a 12 1/2 year high, according to data just released by the US Commerce Department. The figures painted a rosy picture of the American housing market. The number of houses started rose 3.2% to 1.365m last month, with single-family construction reaching a 10-month high. Building permits increased 1.4% to 1.482m in November, the highest level since May 2007. Here is more reaction to the poor factory numbers from the CBI. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, says: There is little in the December industrial trends survey to inspire hopes that the new year will bring better times for the UK manufacturing sector after what looks to have been a very difficult fourth quarter. However, the hope for manufacturers is that reduced uncertainties following the decisive General Election result and the UK now leaving the EU with Boris Johnson\u2019s deal on 31 January will encourage businesses to invest more and lift consumer willingness to buy big-ticket items. However, significant Brexit uncertainties remain which, along with a challenging global environment may limit the upside for investment in 2020. Consumers may also face less favourable fundamentals due to a softer labour market and reduced earnings growth. Time for a quick recap. The pound has suffered a sharp tumble as the government prepares to pass legislation that could cause a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d Brexit at the end of next year. Sterling has slumped by nearly 1.5 cents today to below $1.32, back towards levels seen before Thursday\u2019s general election. The Boris Bounce in the stock market has also fizzled out. Share in banks and housebuilders are among the big fallers today, with Lloyds down 5%. Britain\u2019s factories have suffered their worst slump in activity since the financial crisis a decade ago. Orders also took a worrying tumble, suggesting manufacturing\u2019s recession isn\u2019t over. The latest UK labour market statistics are a mixed bag. Unemployment is down (good) and employment is up (also good), but wage growth has slowed (bad) and vacancies are down too (worrying). The CBI\u2019s director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, has issued a statement pledging to help Boris Johnson secure a new trade deal with the EU by the end of next year. She says: \u201cBusiness has had enough of uncertainty and shares the Prime Minister\u2019s ambition for a fast EU trade deal. With only a year to go, we are committed to working with the Government to secure an ambitious deal that supports all sectors of the economy. Every step in the negotiations will have an impact on jobs, firms and communities. \u201cSpeed and ambition can go hand in hand if the right approach is taken. There\u2019s no time to lose, with a top priority being to build a best-in-class trade architecture, with business round the table, enabling EU trade talks to begin early in the new year. Firms stand ready to bring the evidence needed from factories and boardrooms across the UK to enable a good trade deal to be agreed as quickly as possible.\u201d In the past, the CBI - which opposed Brexit in 2016 - has sounded more critical about the issue. Last month, MPs attacked it for not applying for funds to help businesses with their no-deal preparations. The CBI also resisted commenting on whether it thinks achieving a trade deal by December 2020 is achievable. Former Trade secretary Liam Fox has said today that it\u2019s possible.... Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says he pound was hit by a double whammy of bad news this morning. First and foremost, it was reports that the UK government will block the EU transition extension beyond 2020, raising concerns that this could potentially result in a hard Brexit. Then, the latest wages data came in below expectations while unemployment claims grew more than anticipated. As a result, the GBP/USD further extended its post-election losses to hit a low so far of 1.3156. But at the time of writing, the cable was coming off its worst levels as the buyers attempted to defend a key short-term support level around 1.3180. And here\u2019s the result: Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s UK jobs report: Today\u2019s dire UK factory data haven\u2019t helped the pound - it\u2019s still wallowing around $1.32, down a cent this morning. Deutsche Bank has warned its clients that the pound is likely to weaken in 2020, as renewed Brexit uncertainty threaten to drag the economy into a recession. UK manufacturers are crying out for some economic certainty, says Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s deputy chief economist. Here\u2019s her take on this morning\u2019s worrying factory data: \u201cWith manufacturers reporting that output is declining at a pace not seen since the financial crisis, alongside another month of softer order books, it is crucially important to rebuild business confidence in this sector. \u201cAfter three years of gridlock, the Prime Minister now has a clear mandate to govern. Businesses across the UK will want him to break the cycle of uncertainty. Firms will be looking for reassurance of the new Government\u2019s commitment to getting the UK economy fighting fit as it prepares to exit the EU.\u201d The slump in UK factory output this autumn is due to Brexit worries, and weakness in the global economy, says Tom Crotty of chemicals giant INEO. \u201cThese disappointing figures are reflective of the widespread weakness in the global manufacturing sector and the impact of continued Brexit uncertainty in the run-up to the General Election. \u201cFollowing the General Election, manufacturers will be eager to see the Prime Minister break the cycle of Brexit uncertainty as a priority. There is also a fresh opportunity for the sector to work with the government to solve long-term challenges such as raising productivity, addressing skills shortages, improving sustainability and tackling climate change.\u201d NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s factory sector has suffered its worth quarter since the financial crisis, as Brexit uncertainty hurts the sector. The CBI has reported that output volumes fell in the three months to December, at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, with output expanding in only six out of 17 sub-sectors. The headline fall in output was primarily driven by the motor vehicles sub-sector -- probably because several carmakers held shutdowns in November in case Britain had crashed out of the EU at the end of October. Factory bosses also reported that order books were weaker than normal, a worrying sign for prospects in 2020. The CBI says: Manufacturing activity worsened in December, finishing off what has been a generally difficult year for the sector following the stockpiling boost in Q1 2019. Output volumes in the three months to December fell at their quickest rate since the financial crisis. Export order books worsened noticeably, while total order books remained similarly weak to November, and both remain considerably weaker than their respective long-run averages. Meanwhile, stocks of finished goods rose further above \u201cadequate\u201d levels. Looking ahead, manufacturers expect output to fall at a slower pace. UK businesses need to pay attention to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy, and keep preparing for a no-deal crisis at the end of next year. So says Paul Hardy, Brexit director at global law firm DLA Piper: \u201cCementing the end of the transition in legislation is a game-changer. It shows this is not a negotiating tactic. Businesses must now expect a limited trade deal in goods with the EU on 1 January 2021, but not in services; or the possibility of no deal at all. They should keep their no-deal Brexit planning warm: it may well come in useful in a year.\u201d Shares in UK-focused companies are sliding further into the red, wiping out some of the gains recorded on Friday. Banks are in the front-line, on fears that a new cliff-edge Brexit crisis will weaken the economy in 2020. That\u2019s driven Royal Bank of Scotland down by 4% -- a blow to the government, which still owns a majority stake. Property companies, which are also vulnerable to economic worries, are also among the top fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning. British Land, which owns Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield and built the Cheesegrater in London, is down 3.5%. Sterling\u2019s slump today is a timely reminder that Brexit is far from over, despite Boris Johnson\u2019s election claims that he would get it \u201cdone\u201d and move onto other issues. Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, has warned that sterling will remain highly volatile over the next few months, with a crucial deadline falling in the summer. \u201cThe pound\u2019s latest slide is symptomatic of the fact that Brexit is a way off being \u201cdone\u201d, and will remain important for sterling over the coming months. \u201cDespite the Prime Minister\u2019s new-found majority spurring a relief rally, gains were always likely to be capped as investors turned their attention to phase two of the talks. The deadline for extending the UK\u2019s transition period beyond the end of next year comes on 1 July. The risk of the UK reverting to trading with the EU on WTO terms could still drive larger GBP moves, particularly given the latest noises coming out of Downing Street. \u201cWe expect a trading range between 1.30 and 1.40 until June.\u201d Back in the markets, sterling is still being pummelled by Brexit fears. The pound is still down more than 1% against the dollar, below $1.32, as investor worry that Britain will fail to agree a new trade deal with the EU by the end of next year. The recent \u2018Boris Bounce\u2019 is well and truly over, as the government hardens its commitment to ending the withdrawal period at the end of December. Remember, the pound hit $1.35 as the election results rolled in during the early hours of Friday morning. Michael Gove, who has been closely involved with no-deal Brexit planning, has defended the plan to make it illegal to request an extension to EU alignment beyond 2020. He told BBC Breakfast that the government is fully committed to delivering Brexit on time. We are going to leave the European Union on 31 January because of the withdrawal agreement. And then the political declaration, which goes alongside the withdrawal agreement, commits both sides to making sure that the follow-up conversations are concluded by the end of 2020.\u201d And he denied that the December 2020 deadline could slip: \u201cNo. We are going to make sure we get this deal done in time.\u201d There\u2019s a real gender split in today\u2019s unemployment report. The number of employed men jumped by 54,000 on the quarter to 17.31m, while the number of employed women fell by 30,000 to 15.49m. That reverses a recent trend, which has seen more women entering the labour market (partly due to pension changes). If you include bonuses, UK pay growth also took a hit last month. Total pay only rise by 3.2% per year in the August-October period, down from 3.7% a month ago, today\u2019s labour market report shows. That\u2019s partly because some workers received bigger bonuses in October 2018 than this year. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has stuck at its lowest level in 45 years, but wage growth has slowed. The jobless rate was 3.8% in the three months to October, the Office for National Statistics says, matching last month\u2019s reading. The ONS explains: For August to October 2019, an estimated 1.28 million people were unemployed. This is 93,000 fewer than a year earlier and 673,000 fewer than five years earlier. But average earnings only rose by 3.5% per annum during the quarter, down from 3.6% a month ago. That means real wage growth (accounting for inflation) have dropped -- a blow to families in the run-up to Christmas. The ONS also reports that the employment rate has hit a new all-time high, at 76.2%, up from 75.8% a year ago. Kit Juckes, foreign exchange analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, says Johnson\u2019s tough line on the post-Brexit trade talks has caught the markets by surprise. The news that UK PM Johnson plans to rule out (legally) any extension to the transition period after the UK leaves the EU has given sterling a kicking this morning. Those who thought that a big majority would free the PM to take a patient approach to negotiate the best possible deal, have been caught by surprise. And that\u2019s most UK economists and strategists. Ho hum. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized listed companies is also suffering a bout of Brexit blues. The FTSE 250, seen as a barometer of the UK economy,has shed 1.25% or 272 points to 21582. Financial stocks such as Virgin Money (-4%) are among the fallers, along with housebuilder Crest Nicholson (-5%). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: In essence all of the big gainers of the past few days are giving back some of their gains as the reality check of the possibility of a no deal Brexit, while still over a year away, has tempered some of the enthusiasm from last Thursday\u2019s election result. The FTSE 100, though, is flat this morning as multinational companies are getting a boost from the weak pound (it makes their overseas earnings more valuable). Some City investors had thought that Boris Johnson would \u2018pivot\u2019 to the centre ground now he has a solid majority in parliament. The plan for a new cliff-edge Brexit deadline in a year\u2019s time has dashed those hopes. Neil Wilson of Markets.com writes: Sterling tripped over its heels as Boris Johnson is looking to legislate for Britain to leave the EU fully in Dec 2020 with or without a trade deal. That means no possible way to extend the transition period. I must confess to believing he wouldn\u2019t need to be so drastic, that a large majority offered the flexibility yet strength a government craves in deal making. This sets up another cliff-edge and could create yet more months of uncertainty for investors just when we thought all was squared away. Faisal Islam of the BBC says there\u2019s a growing chance that Britain will be trading on WTO terms with the EU in just over year: Brexit isn\u2019t the only thing hurting the stock market today. Boeing\u2019s decision overnight to suspend production of its troubled 737 MAX jet is a blow to hundreds of suppliers. UK engineering firm Senior, which makes various parts for Boeing including airframes, has fallen by 8% this morning. That make it the worst-performing of the biggest 350 companies in London. Industrial group Melrose, which also counts Boeing as a major customer, are down 1%. French aircraft parts maker Safran has shed 3%. Airlines are also under pressure, on fears that they\u2019ll face longer delays before the 737 Max enters service. International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, has lost 2.3%. The pound is also suffering further losses against the euro, now down over one eurocent at \u20ac1.183 as traders anticipate a cliff-edge Brexit crisis next year. That\u2019s a hefty fall, which sends sterling back towards last week\u2019s levels before the election result. The realities of a majority Boris Johnson government have begun to dawn on the pound, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. The newly minted Prime Minister and his team are working on amending the withdrawal agreement to make sure that the so-called transition period must end on December 31st 2020, seeking to \u2018legally prohibit government agreeing to any extension\u2019. With the threat of a no-deal Brexit re-emerging the other side of the election sterling\u2019s extremely festive December was, if not cut short, then certainly a bit scrooged following these reports. The selloff is gathering pace! Sterling is now down more than a cent against the US dollar at $1.322. Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to outlaw extending the Brexit withdrawal period beyond December 2020 risks a new no-deal split with the EU, warns Bloomberg. They point out that previous trade deals have taken rather longer than 11 months. The U.K. prime minister wants to deliver his election promise to ratify a new free-trade agreement with the bloc before the bridging period maintaining the status quo runs out on Dec. 31, 2020. EU leaders have warned it\u2019s highly unlikely that negotiators will be able to complete the kind of deal Johnson wants, which he\u2019s modeled on Canada\u2019s agreement with the EU, in the 11 months between Brexit day Jan. 31 and the December deadline. The EU-Canada deal took seven years to finalize. Shares in some UK-focused companies are sliding in early trading, as Brexit fears make an unwelcome reappearance on trading floors. Housebuilders are among the top fallers, with Barratt Development losing 3.4% and Taylor Wimpey down 2%. Banks are also under pressure, with Lloyds down 4% and Royal Bank of Scotland dropping by 3%. Traders are getting a dose of Brexit reality, says Kyle Rodda of IG, recognising that the trade deal negotiations between London and Brussels will be tough next year. There was a small hiccup this morning in the markets, that might be described as a bit of a reality check. Stocks and futures markets had their wings clipped by news that UK PM Boris Johnson is planning to pass legislation that would legally block the Brexit transition period from extending beyond December 2020. The pound has now lost much of its post-election surge, having briefly spiked over $1.35 in the early hours of Friday morning. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After two days of strong gains, the City is subdued this morning as investors ponder how the next phase of Brexit will play out. The pound is coming under pressure, dropping by over half a cent against the US dollar back to $1.326. It\u2019s also sliding back against the euro to below \u20ac1.19, just a couple of days after hitting three-year highs. Relief that Britain should exit in an orderly manner from the EU in a month\u2019s time has been replaced by a new fear -- a rock-hard Brexit from December 2020 when the transition period ends. Overnight, it\u2019s emerged that the government plans to tie its own hands with an amendment ruling out extending that transition beyond the end of 2020. Minister insist that they will have agreed the future relationship with Europe by then; many experts are less confident, suggesting it could take years. Boris Johnson\u2019s cunning plan is to force the EU to offer a good deal, but it\u2019s likely to create a lot more uncertainty next year -- which is bad for sterling. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains: The British pound [GBP] took a hit in Asia and is under pressure again in early London trading on news that the govt plans to create a Dec 2020 cliff-edge. he plan, first reported by ITV overnight is that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill \u201cwill legally prohibit the government agreeing to any extension\u201d according to a senior government official. The idea is that it will force the EU to offer a better deal with the prospect of WTO-exit looking at the end of next year. In practice it would erode all the positives of a large Tory majority and bring us back to previous position of GBP uncertainty rising rather than falling next year. If passed, it would mean further GBP downside. Shares are also expected to dip this morning in London, following a two-day \u2018Boris Bounce\u2019 . Global factors also pushed shares up around the globe, boosting the FTSE 100 index by over \u00a340bn on Monday, as my colleague Larry Elliott explains: The stock market has been boosted by a combination of factors \u2013 the prospect of an end to Brexit uncertainty, the removal of the threat of re-nationalisation following Labour\u2019s defeat, and hopes that the interim trade deal between the US and China signals a rolling back of protectionism. London\u2019s strong performance was part of a global trend that saw all three of Wall Street\u2019s major share price indices lifted to record highs amid optimism of stronger, faster growth. Chinese share prices hit a six-week high and oil prices also rallied. Also coming up today The latest UK unemployment report is expected to show that wage growth in Britain has slowed. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, are expected to have risen by just 3.4% in the last quarter, down from 3.6%. So with the jobless rate tipped to rise to 3.9% from 3.8%, we may see signs that the labour market has cooled. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK unemployment report. Jobless rate expected to rise to 3.9% from 3.8% 11am GMT: CBI\u2019s survey of UK industrial trends. Orders index expected to rise to -25, from -26",

A faulty door-locking system in Whirlpool\u2019s Hotpoint and Indesit branded machines creates a fire risk as a result of overheating, the company said. The machines involved were on sale for more than five years (between 2014 and 2018) with up to 519,000 washing machines believed to be affected \u2013 about 20% of the total number sold.

The estate agents, which handled most property sales in Wokingham and other parts of Berkshire, conspired to keep commissions at rates understood to be above 1.8% on each house sale, and even set up a penalty system for agents who broke their rules. The Competition and Markets Authority broke up the cartel after one of the agents, Romans in Wokingham, in south-west England, blew the whistle on the longstanding local practice. A similar cartel was uncovered in Somerset two years ago, and the latest case will raise fears about the broader scale of price-fixing by estate agents across the UK. The price-fixing in Berkshire carried on undetected for more than seven years before Romans revealed it to the competition authorities. The CMA said four agencies \u2013 Michael Hardy, Prospect, Richard Worth and Romans \u2013 conspired to set minimum commission rates for the sale of residential properties in Wokingham, Winnersh, Crowthorne, Bracknell and Warfield.

      "body": "<p>Objectively speaking, the worst thing about the festive season is the cringing bonhomie of an all-office Secret Santa. There\u2019s the expense, of course, but also the sense that you are contributing to the amount of tat in our already overflowing world. Plus it\u2019s a statistical inevitability that you will draw either the name of your office <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/feb/25/the-joy-of-pettiness-why-everyone-needs-an-office-nemesis\" title=\"\">nemesis</a> or someone you have never heard of before.</p> <p>I am not alone in hating Secret Santa. According to a poll from Instantprint, nearly half of office workers hate Secret Santa. They say it\u2019s because they are afraid of offending colleagues, but that is entirely besides the point. The whole purpose of Secret Santa is that it allows us Brits to do what we do best: being passive-aggressive to co-workers, under the guise of having a lark.</p> <p>Generally speaking, Secret Santa gifts fall into two categories: junk you don\u2019t need and jokes that aren\u2019t funny. On the latter: Chris Vaughan, a 50-year-old patent attorney from Leeds, was once given a toupee (he is bald). \u201cI guess if people feel able to give me a toupee, I can\u2019t be the worst person in the world,\u201d he says hopefully.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit jarring,\u201d remembers Matt Hallam, 25, a Manchester-based editor and self-described \u201ctoken office gay\u201d, of a recent gift: an enormous aubergine and a pot of Vaseline. He took it in good spirits \u2013 the gifter was a friend.</p> <p>Then there are the truly awful gifts. Chloe (not her real name), 30, from Essex, was given a sexually suggestive present when she worked in publishing. \u201cI never found out who it was from, but my senior manager went on to sexually harass me that night \u2013 so I\u2019m guessing it was him.\u201d</p> <p>NGO worker Lindis Sloan, 46, from Norway, still shudders at the time her co-worker gave a bottle of wine to a recovering alcoholic. \u201cHe got the bottle, looked at it and didn\u2019t say much,\u201d she recalls. (No one knew about his alcoholism.) A few weeks later, Sloan\u2019s boss noticed that all the bottles of booze in the office had been emptied and refilled with water. \u201cThe wine had triggered a relapse into complete alcoholism,\u201d Sloan sighs. \u201cHe was off work sick for six months.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been a size eight in my life,\u201d says 39-year-old Lucy Pope, a trainee teacher from Manchester. So it was surprising when a colleague gave her a pair of Kylie Minogue-branded knickers, in that size. \u201cShe said: \u2018If they\u2019re too small for you, you can exchange them for a bigger size,\u2019\u201d Pope remembers. \u201cI said: \u2018These are perfect, thank you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Louise, a 29-year-old HR worker from Liverpool, will never forget the Secret Santa her first boss gave her: a laminated map of her route to work, so she would stop being late. \u201cI was so upset,\u201d Louise says. \u201cHe got drunk later and kept waving it at me at the party, too.\u201d The gift had the opposite effect. \u201cI was late for work a lot after that, and then I quit.\u201d</p> <p>Petty legends, the lot of you. And on the final burning question: is it OK to give to your in-laws something you were given for Secret Santa? Absolutely, resoundingly, yes.</p>",

Plus it\u2019s a statistical inevitability that you will draw either the name of your office nemesis or someone you have never heard of before. I am not alone in hating Secret Santa. According to a poll from Instantprint, nearly half of office workers hate Secret Santa. They say it\u2019s because they are afraid of offending colleagues, but that is entirely besides the point. The whole purpose of Secret Santa is that it allows us Brits to do what we do best: being passive-aggressive to co-workers, under the guise of having a lark. Generally speaking, Secret Santa gifts fall into two categories: junk you don\u2019t need and jokes that aren\u2019t funny. On the latter: Chris Vaughan, a 50-year-old patent attorney from Leeds, was once given a toupee (he is bald). \u201cI guess if people feel able to give me a toupee, I can\u2019t be the worst person in the world,\u201d he says hopefully. \u201cIt was a bit jarring,\u201d remembers Matt Hallam, 25, a Manchester-based editor and self-described \u201ctoken office gay\u201d, of a recent gift: an enormous aubergine and a pot of Vaseline. He took it in good spirits \u2013 the gifter was a friend. Then there are the truly awful gifts. Chloe (not her real name), 30, from Essex, was given a sexually suggestive present when she worked in publishing. \u201cI never found out who it was from, but my senior manager went on to sexually harass me that night \u2013 so I\u2019m guessing it was him.\u201d NGO worker Lindis Sloan, 46, from Norway, still shudders at the time her co-worker gave a bottle of wine to a recovering alcoholic. \u201cHe got the bottle, looked at it and didn\u2019t say much,\u201d she recalls. (No one knew about his alcoholism.) A few weeks later, Sloan\u2019s boss noticed that all the bottles of booze in the office had been emptied and refilled with water. \u201cThe wine had triggered a relapse into complete alcoholism,\u201d Sloan sighs. \u201cHe was off work sick for six months.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been a size eight in my life,\u201d says 39-year-old Lucy Pope, a trainee teacher from Manchester. So it was surprising when a colleague gave her a pair of Kylie Minogue-branded knickers, in that size. \u201cShe said: \u2018If they\u2019re too small for you, you can exchange them for a bigger size,\u2019\u201d Pope remembers. \u201cI said: \u2018These are perfect, thank you.\u2019\u201d Louise, a 29-year-old HR worker from Liverpool, will never forget the Secret Santa her first boss gave her: a laminated map of her route to work, so she would stop being late. \u201cI was so upset,\u201d Louise says. \u201cHe got drunk later and kept waving it at me at the party, too.\u201d The gift had the opposite effect. \u201cI was late for work a lot after that, and then I quit.\u201d Petty legends, the lot of you. And on the final burning question: is it OK to give to your in-laws something you were given for Secret Santa? Absolutely, resoundingly, yes.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove has declined to rule out the possibility of a no-deal Brexit as he was challenged over the government\u2019s decision to make it illegal to request an extension to EU alignment beyond 2020. In its first major announcement since securing a majority in the general election, the government said it would enshrine in law a ban on extending the transition period on a Brexit deal with the EU. This is being seen as an attempt to push the European Union to give Boris Johnson a comprehensive free trade deal in less than 11 months by presenting the bloc with a new cliff-edge. The extension ban will be written into the withdrawal agreement bill, which is due to have its second reading in the Commons on Friday. However, questions have been raised over what happens if an agreement is not struck with the EU by the end of 2020. Gove\u2019s comments came as the prime minister told colleagues at the first cabinet meeting since the Tory landslide election result that they must work \u201c24 hours a day\u201d to create a \u201cpeople\u2019s government\u201d. Johnson said to ministers gathered around the cabinet table in Downing Street that they must work to repay voters who lent them their support at the ballot box. \u201cThe first 100 days were very busy.

During this time it will not have any voting rights. The transition period comes to an end on 31 December 2020.

      "body": "<p><strong>I\u2019ve volunteered to cook Christmas dinner, but I\u2019ve only ever made one roast before</strong><strong>. Help, please! </strong><br><em><strong>Ellen, Darlington, County Durham</strong></em></p> <p>\u201cAll the TV chefs tell us to stay calm,\u201d says Heath Ball, landlord of award-winning pub <a href=\"http://www.theredlionandsun.com/\" title=\"\">The Red Lion &amp; Sun</a> in Highgate, north London, \u201cbut the reality is, Ellen will be feeling like an England rugby fullback with the entire South Africa pack bearing down on her, so a bit of panic is kind of inevitable.\u201d</p> <p>Not that that\u2019s necessarily a bad thing, Ball adds, because it keeps you on your toes. Even though this is, in essence, only a glorified roast dinner, it\u2019s by far the most important one of the year. \u201cSo take it easy on Christmas Eve, and don\u2019t dive into the champagne too early on Christmas morning. There\u2019ll be plenty of time for that once the food\u2019s on the table. In fact, once your job is done, I\u2019d rather hope people will start to bring the drinks to you.\u201d</p> <p>Get organised, too, says James Rix, chef/owner of <a href=\"http://foxandhounds-hunsdon.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Fox &amp; Hounds in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/oct/20/ofm-awards-2019-best-sunday-lunch-runners-up\" title=\"\">a perennial runner-up in Observer Food Monthly\u2019s best Sunday lunch award</a>. \u201cFirst things first, make a to-do list, starting with the time you want to serve and working back from there. There\u2019s a reason many chefs write lists: it gives you control. I still do one for the next day every night after service, and then rewrite it the next morning.\u201d</p> <p>And don\u2019t overcomplicate things, adds Rix, who in a former life was head chef at Alastair Little in Soho. \u201cDon\u2019t be daft and try to make 20 vegetable sides. Stick to the traditional basics \u2013 roast potatoes, roast carrots and parsnips, sprouts, cabbage. No one will judge you for it.\u201d Both Rix and Ball say you\u2019d be surprised quite how much you can get done the day before: parboil the spuds for roasting, prep the root veg, blanch and refresh any green veg \u2013 all you have to do to those on the day is dunk them in boiling water at the last minute, to heat through, though being a la-di-da chef type, Rix sautees his greens in excessive amounts of butter afterwards.</p> <p>Rix\u2019s main tip, though, is: \u201cDon\u2019t buy a whole turkey; it\u2019ll take up the whole oven, and even experienced cooks find it hard to get the breast and legs to cook evenly.\u201d Instead, get a crown or a boned and rolled breast and, if brown meat\u2019s your thing, a stuffed leg or two, too. \u201cYou\u2019ll save yourself a world of pain, and it takes an hour and a half to cook, rather than four or more.\u201d The joint will then happily rest for an hour, giving you plenty of time to finish the veg and gravy. (Speaking of gravy, Rix says there\u2019s no sin in buying it in, provided it\u2019s decent quality \u2013 \u201cMarks &amp; Sparks do a particularly good chicken one,\u201d he says, \u201cthough there are other brands out there. Deglaze the roasting tin with white wine, as usual, stir in the gravy and you\u2019re in business.\u201d)</p> <p>Stosie Madi, who rules the roasts at <a href=\"https://www.parkersarms.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Parker\u2019s Arms</a> in Newton-in-Bowland, near Clitheroe, Lancashire, meanwhile, says novice roast dinner cook Ellen should abandon the troublesome turkey entirely and make something a lot more manageable instead. \u201cSlow-roast beef is very forgiving,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause the oven does all the work for you.\u201d Opt for a topside or brisket joint with a good layer of fat tied on. \u201cAny butcher will sort that for you; if they\u2019re any cop, they\u2019ll also give you advice on how to cook it.\u201d</p> <p>The trick, Madi says, is in the marinade and the browning.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve volunteered to cook Christmas dinner, but I\u2019ve only ever made one roast before. Help, please! Ellen, Darlington, County Durham \u201cAll the TV chefs tell us to stay calm,\u201d says Heath Ball, landlord of award-winning pub The Red Lion &amp; Sun in Highgate, north London, \u201cbut the reality is, Ellen will be feeling like an England rugby fullback with the entire South Africa pack bearing down on her, so a bit of panic is kind of inevitable.\u201d Not that that\u2019s necessarily a bad thing, Ball adds, because it keeps you on your toes. Even though this is, in essence, only a glorified roast dinner, it\u2019s by far the most important one of the year. \u201cSo take it easy on Christmas Eve, and don\u2019t dive into the champagne too early on Christmas morning. There\u2019ll be plenty of time for that once the food\u2019s on the table. In fact, once your job is done, I\u2019d rather hope people will start to bring the drinks to you.\u201d Get organised, too, says James Rix, chef/owner of The Fox &amp; Hounds in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, a perennial runner-up in Observer Food Monthly\u2019s best Sunday lunch award. \u201cFirst things first, make a to-do list, starting with the time you want to serve and working back from there. There\u2019s a reason many chefs write lists: it gives you control. I still do one for the next day every night after service, and then rewrite it the next morning.\u201d And don\u2019t overcomplicate things, adds Rix, who in a former life was head chef at Alastair Little in Soho. \u201cDon\u2019t be daft and try to make 20 vegetable sides. Stick to the traditional basics \u2013 roast potatoes, roast carrots and parsnips, sprouts, cabbage. No one will judge you for it.\u201d Both Rix and Ball say you\u2019d be surprised quite how much you can get done the day before: parboil the spuds for roasting, prep the root veg, blanch and refresh any green veg \u2013 all you have to do to those on the day is dunk them in boiling water at the last minute, to heat through, though being a la-di-da chef type, Rix sautees his greens in excessive amounts of butter afterwards. Rix\u2019s main tip, though, is: \u201cDon\u2019t buy a whole turkey; it\u2019ll take up the whole oven, and even experienced cooks find it hard to get the breast and legs to cook evenly.\u201d Instead, get a crown or a boned and rolled breast and, if brown meat\u2019s your thing, a stuffed leg or two, too. \u201cYou\u2019ll save yourself a world of pain, and it takes an hour and a half to cook, rather than four or more.\u201d The joint will then happily rest for an hour, giving you plenty of time to finish the veg and gravy. (Speaking of gravy, Rix says there\u2019s no sin in buying it in, provided it\u2019s decent quality \u2013 \u201cMarks &amp; Sparks do a particularly good chicken one,\u201d he says, \u201cthough there are other brands out there. Deglaze the roasting tin with white wine, as usual, stir in the gravy and you\u2019re in business.\u201d) Stosie Madi, who rules the roasts at The Parker\u2019s Arms in Newton-in-Bowland, near Clitheroe, Lancashire, meanwhile, says novice roast dinner cook Ellen should abandon the troublesome turkey entirely and make something a lot more manageable instead. \u201cSlow-roast beef is very forgiving,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause the oven does all the work for you.\u201d Opt for a topside or brisket joint with a good layer of fat tied on. \u201cAny butcher will sort that for you; if they\u2019re any cop, they\u2019ll also give you advice on how to cook it.\u201d The trick, Madi says, is in the marinade and the browning. Get those right, and you\u2019ll be in for a relatively stress-free day, secure in the knowledge that there\u2019s nothing going awry inside that oven. \u201cLeave the joint overnight in a dry marinade of flavours you like: garlic, thyme, parsley, bay, peppercorns are especially good with beef. And don\u2019t add any salt until you\u2019re about to roast it.\u201d In the morning, brown it all over in butter and oil (the oil stops the butter burning). \u201cDon\u2019t be shy: this is where a lot of the flavour comes from.\u201d Pop it in a thick-based pot, ring with your veg of choice \u2013 shallots or red onions, carrots and a little celery are classic good companions \u2013 add stock and/or red wine or stout to cover by half, and cook in the middle of a 160C (140C fan)/ gas 2\u00bd oven for three to four hours, until it\u2019s fork tender, then move to the top of the oven, where it\u2019s hotter, to crisp up the fat. \u201cSo long as there\u2019s always enough stock to keep the beef moist, you can\u2019t go wrong.\u201d The bonus, of course, is that this guarantees you bucketloads of that all-important gravy, too. \u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?

This is where it begins to get really interesting. But perhaps you could be more specific with your questions. OK, then. Size? So, extremes are good \u2013 very tall or very short, 6ft 5in plus or less than 5ft. Nothing in the middle please. Hair? Yes! Lots! Especially if it is very red. Or very white. Or possibly both. Cool. What else is there? Teeth? The fewer the better, and any that you do have should certainly not be straight ones, please. Gotcha. But why does this sound like the world\u2019s weirdest recruitment drive? Because it\u2019s the world\u2019s weirdest recruitment drive. Interested? How much? Around 300 dollars a day. US? NZ. That is roughly \u00a3150. Plus, you will get a lunch. New Zealand \u2026 hang on, I know this, isn\u2019t that where Middle-earth is? Was, is, will be again. Like Peter Jackson\u2019s blockbuster series, the new Amazon TV series based on JRR Tolkein\u2019s fantasy novels begins production there next year. And they are after extras? Correct. A couple of agencies in Auckland \u2013 make that Orc-land \u2013 are recruiting. One asks for missing teeth and \u201cwonderful noses\u201d; the other \u201chairy hairy people of all ages and ethnicities\u201d as well as \u201cstocky mean-looking bikers\u201d. Isn\u2019t it discriminatory, average-ist? Boring-ist, more like. Time to redress the balance, reject the norm and celebrate the different. OK, how many do they need? Dunno yet; Jackson used about 20,000. And the TV series is expected to be one of the most expensive TV shows ever made. The rights alone cost \u00a3187m. What\u2019s the population of New Zealand? A little under 5 million people, many of whom are of average height, have unremarkable noses and full sets of pearly gnashers. They may have to look further afield. You in? [Checking in mirror] In! Plus, lunch is included, don\u2019t forget. And Middle-earth is a long way from Brexit. Do say: \u201cIs that the dental-implant clinic? Yes, I\u2019d like to cancel my appointment.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201c\u00a3187m for Peter Jackson\u2019s leftovers? Are you having a laugh?\u201d",

For instance, the family of Zac Cox, a British worker who died when he fell from a gantry, struggled for many months to extract information on the circumstances of his death.

Dismantling Qatar\u2019s exploitative labour market \u2013 with its echoes of slavery, which was only abolished there in the 1950s \u2013 could have huge repercussions not just for Qatar\u2019s rapidly evolving society but for Gulf economies as a whole. Thawadi claimed that some of the criticism levelled at Qatar since it won the right to stage the World Cup a decade ago had been \u201cill-informed, cynical or even vicious\u201d. This week Qatar is hosting Liverpool FC among other clubs in the Club World Cup, a tournament seen as a chance to test newly built infrastructure including a 37-station metro system, match scheduling and the overall fan experience. October\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Doha were marked by rows and rows of empty seats and complaints from athletes about a lack of atmosphere. Thawadi said lessons have been learned and with 1.5 million fans due to visit for the World Cup, lack of enthusiasm would not be an issue. \u201cFootball and the World Cup can break down stereotypes. The passion for this game like no other creates a bond and bridges gaps,\u201d he said. World Cup organisers have repeatedly warned fans that they will have to be respectful of Qatar\u2019s local laws and customs, including a ban on homosexuality. Thawadi, a football fan who admires Liverpool and what he called its \u201cleftwing fanbase\u201d, said meetings with community groups such as Spirit of Shankly and Kop Outs, an LGBT supporters\u2019 club, had averted an embarrassing boycott of this week\u2019s event. Nevertheless, he said LGBT fans would be welcome only if they refrained from \u201cpublic displays of affection\u201d. He said alcohol would be on sale in specified fan zones and in hotels but not on street corners. \u201cAlcohol is not part of our culture but hospitality is.\u201d A \u201csin tax\u201d has raised the price of beer to \u00a310 a pint, an issue Thawadi said needed addressing. But he regarded such matters as a two-way street. \u201cLet us try to understand each other as human beings,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a conservative culture, not a closed culture.\u201d Houtan Homayounpour, the Doha chief for ILO, a UN employment rights agency that has been working on reforms with the Qatar government since 2017, said progress was being made but there were \u201cmany more milestones to pass\u201d. Homayounpour cited the heat-related death toll among migrant workers, a lack of autopsies and delays in payment of wages as areas of concern. The flow of information to the families of dead and injured workers has been mixed. For instance, the family of Zac Cox, a British worker who died when he fell from a gantry, struggled for many months to extract information on the circumstances of his death. Only after relentless pressure did Thawadi\u2019s committee set up a British judge-led inquiry. Thawadi said he was committed to implementing the inquiry\u2019s findings. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Zac\u2019s death to go without us learning or contributing to the welfare of other people,\u201d he said. Thawadi, 41, a former law student at Sheffield University, said the labour reforms were intended not just to help Qatar survive the current glare of publicity. \u201cNone of the work we have done is to satisfy the spotlight or the critics,\u201d he said. \u201cOur nation\u2019s commitment is that these will be sustainable changes. Yes, some people have criticised the pace, but you need to build the foundations before you live in a house.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 December 2019. The original suggested that Hassan al-Thawadi said the labour market reforms would be implemented in January. It is actually the International Labour Organisation that has said it expects the changes to take place next month.",

      "bodyText": "Russian agents have been accused of worldwide hacking operations, but someone at the Kremlin has apparently forgotten to inform Vladimir Putin of the importance of cyber-security. Putin, 67, appears to have the obsolete Microsoft Windows XP operating system installed on computers in his office at the Kremlin and at his official Novo-Ogaryovo residence near Moscow, according to images released by his press service. Both computers have the Kremlin towers set as their desktop backgrounds. Microsoft stopped releasing regular security updates for Windows XP and Office 2003 in April 2014. However, it appears that Russian government regulations have prevented Putin from updating to the more recent Microsoft 10. The US tech firm warns on its website that computers running Windows XP are \u201cvulnerable to security risks and viruses\u201d. Windows XP, released in 2001, was the last Microsoft operating system given the green light for use on official Russian government computers, the Open Media website reported, citing defence ministry documents. The more recent Windows 10 is only approved for devices that do not contain state secrets \u2013 something that would not seem to apply to Putin\u2019s computers. Open Media \u2013 an opposition-friendly, independent Russian news website \u2013 reported that Mikhail Klimaryov, the head of Russia\u2019s independent Internet Protection Society, had confirmed that Putin\u2019s computers were running Windows XP in the photographs. Moscow is gradually phasing out Microsoft and Google on government computers in favour of Russia\u2019s Astra Linux operating system software and domestic browsers such as Yandex. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, did not comment when asked why Putin continues to use an antiquated Microsoft operating system. It\u2019s unclear how great a threat Putin\u2019s use of Windows XP poses to Kremlin cyber security: the ex-KGB officer is said to be an irregular user of the internet, which he has previously called a \u201cCIA project\u201d. The predecessor of the internet was the Arpanet, which was founded by the US Department of Defense. Russia is increasingly seeking to establish control over internet technology.

      "bodyText": "The actor Sheila Mercier, who has died aged 100, was best known for playing Annie Sugden, head of the original focal family in the long-running ITV soap opera set in the Yorkshire Dales, Emmerdale Farm (latterly Emmerdale), from 1972 to 1994. She was totally convincing as the pragmatic, no-nonsense farmer\u2019s widow, grounding the series with a credible rural matriarch at its core. Annie was at the centre of the very first episode, burying her late husband, Jacob, and coming to terms with having to rebuild the farm\u2019s fortunes while managing the strained relationship between her sons, Jack (Andrew Burt, later Clive Hornby) and Joe (Frazer Hines). Over the years Annie lost her daughter (to a brain haemorrhage), her twin grandchildren (killed at a level crossing), and was involved in one of the show\u2019s most sensational storylines when a plane fell out of the sky, killing her new husband, Leonard Kempinski (Bernard Archard), and leaving her in a coma. She eventually recovered but, bereaved, moved to Spain: in reality, Mercier had decided to leave the series after 22 happy years. She briefly returned to the soap to marry another iconic character, Amos Brearly (Ronald Magill), and to bury both of her sons: Joe in 1995 and Jack in 2009. The latter was dictated by the real life death of Hornby, and Mercier came out of retirement in order to pay tribute to her co-star, a testament to the bond she had formed with her fellow actors both on and off-screen \u2013 Hines once described her as being like a real mother to her fictional family. Annie was tough and level-headed but not without a sense of humour, with Mercier\u2019s naturalistic acting giving the series ballast, despite her theatrical background and an upbringing that could not have been more different from that of her TV alter ego. She was born in Hull, East Yorkshire, to Herbert Rix of the family shipbuilding company JR Rix &amp; Sons, and his wife, Fanny (nee Nicholson), an amateur actor and singer.

They concern abuse of power, in Trump\u2019s attempts to have Ukraine investigate his political rivals, and obstruction of Congress, in his refusal to allow key aides to testify in impeachment hearings. Despite extensive evidence laid out in those House committee hearings, the president denies any wrongdoing. The articles are expected to be approved, virtually on party lines, setting up a trial in the Senate in January which Republican senators, nominally impartial jurors, have said will be swift and run in close cooperation with the White House and will ultimately acquit the president. Democrats have cried foul. Only two presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999. Both survived Senate trials. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974, before he could be impeached. Brenda Wineapple, author of The Impeachers, about the Johnson trial, signed the open letter, as did Rick Perlstein, author of Nixonland, and Sidney Blumenthal, a former Clinton aide and author of The Clinton Wars and so far three volumes of a five-volume life of Abraham Lincoln. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s numerous and flagrant abuses of power are precisely what the framers had in mind as grounds for impeaching and removing a president,\u201d the historians wrote. \u201cAmong those most hurtful to the constitution have been his attempts to coerce the country of Ukraine, under attack from Russia, an adversary power to the United States, by withholding essential military assistance in exchange for the fabrication and legitimisation of false information in order to advance his own re-election. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s lawless obstruction of the House of Representatives, which is rightly seeking documents and witness testimony in pursuit of its constitutionally mandated oversight role, has demonstrated brazen contempt for representative government. \u201cSo have his attempts to justify that obstruction on the grounds that the executive enjoys absolute immunity, a fictitious doctrine that, if tolerated, would turn the president into an elected monarch above the law.\u201d Among other signatories who cited revolutionary authorities including George Mason and Alexander Hamilton were Ron Chernow, Pulitzer prize-winning author of biographies of Hamilton, George Washington and Ulysses S Grant; Eric Foner, the author of seminal works on slavery; David Blight, author of a Pulitzer prize-winning life of Frederick Douglass; and Erica Armstrong Dunbar, author of Never Caught: The Washingtons\u2019 Relentless Pursuit of their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge and She Came to Slay, a new biography of Harriet Tubman. The University of Liverpool historian Amanda Foreman, author of A World on Fire, a history of Britain and the American civil war, also signed the letter. So did Ken Burns, the documentary maker whose work on the civil war, the west, jazz, baseball, country music and Vietnam, among other subjects, has made him a pillar of US public life. \u201cCollectively,\u201d the historians wrote, \u201cthe president\u2019s offences, including his dereliction in protecting the integrity of the 2020 election from Russian disinformation and renewed interference, arouse once again the framers\u2019 most profound fears that powerful members of government would become, in Hamilton\u2019s words, \u2018the mercenary instruments of foreign corruption\u2019.\u201d The letter was co-ordinated by Project Democracy, an advocacy group which last month released a similar letter signed by more than 500 law professors. \u201cIt is our considered judgment,\u201d the historians wrote, \u201cthat if President Trump\u2019s misconduct does not rise to the level of impeachment, then virtually nothing does.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This is a tale of two cities. In Birmingham, a screening of Blue Story, a gritty depiction of a fond boyhood friendship between two young black British men tragically sundered by gang-related postcode wars, sparked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/25/kneejerk-decision-to-stop-showing-blue-story-slammed-by-academics\">a mass brawl in the cinema foyer</a>, unacceptably making girls queuing for a singalong to Frozen 2 run away in fear.</p> <p>In London in October last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/01/royal-opera-house-siegfried-review-keith-warner-ring-cycle\">a production of Siegfried</a>, an opera about a tooled-up psychopath, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/16/lawyer-repeatedly-punched-royal-opera-house-seat-dispute-court\">similarly provoked fisticuffs</a>. But which one got withdrawn from view? Was it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/08/rapman-the-london-film-maker-who-gatecrashed-hollywood-in-style\">Rapman\u2019s directorial debut about Britain in crisis</a> with a grime soundtrack for an audience of ordinary millennials and Gen Zedsters, or the Victorian opera promoting knife crime set in a ludicrous fairyland by an antisemitic megalomaniac, and served up for a demographic of hedge fund lawyers and couturiers to the royal family? Oh, have a guess. </p> <p>It\u2019s not far down the motorway from the Star City multiplex in Nechells to the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, but in social terms there is an unbridgeable chasm between the two. It\u2019s one rule for ordinary Britons and another for opera-going stiffs. Such is the madness of broken Britain in 2019.</p> <p>Oh come off it, you say. Wagner\u2019s Siegfried, the third in his 15-hour cycle Der Ring des Niebelungen, isn\u2019t about knife crime. You can\u2019t use that to explain why Oxford-educated Matthew Feargrieve, 43, was convicted earlier this week for punching D\u00fcsseldorf-born fashion designer Ulrich Engler, 56, during a performance. City of London magistrates heard that Feargrieve had taken exception to Engler climbing into the front row and into a seat occupied by his partner Catherine Chandler\u2019s tweed coat. Engler told the court he placed the coat in Ms Chandler\u2019s lap after ascertaining she had not paid for the seat, while Feargrieve said that the couturier hurled the garment to the floor. Unless it was a particularly horrible coat, that sounds out of character for Engler, whose motto on <a href=\"http://ulrichengler.com/\">his website</a> is \u201cElegance is unchanging and timeless\u201d and who has designed dresses for the Countess of Derby.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5askXpPvUeA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5askXpPvUeA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But the fact is that Siegfried does promote knife crime. It opens with a character called Mime forging a sword at an anvil in his underground lair, to make it sharp enough for the eponymous hero to slay a dragon and steal its golden hoard. Later in Act One, Siegfried actually sings a song to his sword, namely <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xrbqMBA8L8\">Notung! Notung! Neidliches Schwert!</a> (What kind of freak names his sword? That\u2019s right: a Wagnerian one.)</p> <p>According to Engler\u2019s testimony, when he was assaulted the conductor had already begun and the opera was about 10 minutes into its six-hour running time. No one in court, not even the beguilingly named Judge Zani, thought to listen to their Karajan recording of Siegfried to get a sense of the mood in the posh seats that afternoon. But I have. And the music is so febrile from the get-go, with Mime beating out a metallic tattoo at about 120 beats per minute, that it astounds me that the brawl only embroiled two people. Everybody\u2019s nerves must have been a-jangle even before Siegfried entered like a proto-football hooligan with his demented preverbal chant: \u201cHoiho! Hoiho! Hau \u2019ein! Hau \u2019ein!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had never seen someone looking with so much anger and terror at me,\u201d Engler said of the attack. \u201cWhile Mr Feargrieve was hitting me, he said: \u2018How dare you talk to my wife like this?\u2019 The only three things I said to this woman was, would you mind if I sat next to you again, have you paid for the seat, and that I was sorry.\u201d Another case of Wagner-related madness?

      "bodyText": "This is a tale of two cities. In Birmingham, a screening of Blue Story, a gritty depiction of a fond boyhood friendship between two young black British men tragically sundered by gang-related postcode wars, sparked a mass brawl in the cinema foyer, unacceptably making girls queuing for a singalong to Frozen 2 run away in fear. In London in October last year, a production of Siegfried, an opera about a tooled-up psychopath, similarly provoked fisticuffs. But which one got withdrawn from view? Was it Rapman\u2019s directorial debut about Britain in crisis with a grime soundtrack for an audience of ordinary millennials and Gen Zedsters, or the Victorian opera promoting knife crime set in a ludicrous fairyland by an antisemitic megalomaniac, and served up for a demographic of hedge fund lawyers and couturiers to the royal family? Oh, have a guess. It\u2019s not far down the motorway from the Star City multiplex in Nechells to the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, but in social terms there is an unbridgeable chasm between the two. It\u2019s one rule for ordinary Britons and another for opera-going stiffs. Such is the madness of broken Britain in 2019. Oh come off it, you say. Wagner\u2019s Siegfried, the third in his 15-hour cycle Der Ring des Niebelungen, isn\u2019t about knife crime. You can\u2019t use that to explain why Oxford-educated Matthew Feargrieve, 43, was convicted earlier this week for punching D\u00fcsseldorf-born fashion designer Ulrich Engler, 56, during a performance. City of London magistrates heard that Feargrieve had taken exception to Engler climbing into the front row and into a seat occupied by his partner Catherine Chandler\u2019s tweed coat. Engler told the court he placed the coat in Ms Chandler\u2019s lap after ascertaining she had not paid for the seat, while Feargrieve said that the couturier hurled the garment to the floor. Unless it was a particularly horrible coat, that sounds out of character for Engler, whose motto on his website is \u201cElegance is unchanging and timeless\u201d and who has designed dresses for the Countess of Derby. But the fact is that Siegfried does promote knife crime. It opens with a character called Mime forging a sword at an anvil in his underground lair, to make it sharp enough for the eponymous hero to slay a dragon and steal its golden hoard. Later in Act One, Siegfried actually sings a song to his sword, namely Notung! Notung! Neidliches Schwert! (What kind of freak names his sword? That\u2019s right: a Wagnerian one.) According to Engler\u2019s testimony, when he was assaulted the conductor had already begun and the opera was about 10 minutes into its six-hour running time. No one in court, not even the beguilingly named Judge Zani, thought to listen to their Karajan recording of Siegfried to get a sense of the mood in the posh seats that afternoon. But I have. And the music is so febrile from the get-go, with Mime beating out a metallic tattoo at about 120 beats per minute, that it astounds me that the brawl only embroiled two people. Everybody\u2019s nerves must have been a-jangle even before Siegfried entered like a proto-football hooligan with his demented preverbal chant: \u201cHoiho! Hoiho! Hau \u2019ein! Hau \u2019ein!\u201d \u201cI had never seen someone looking with so much anger and terror at me,\u201d Engler said of the attack. \u201cWhile Mr Feargrieve was hitting me, he said: \u2018How dare you talk to my wife like this?\u2019 The only three things I said to this woman was, would you mind if I sat next to you again, have you paid for the seat, and that I was sorry.\u201d Another case of Wagner-related madness? If so, it\u2019s amazing the courts aren\u2019t teeming with them. I\u2019m not trying to exonerate Mr Feargrieve for the crime for which he was convicted on Monday and will be sentenced in January. Indeed, if the testimony of former physiotherapist Elaine McMaster, who was in the Covent Garden audience that afternoon is right \u2013 namely that Feargrieve and Chandler were swaying side to side to the music, and that Chandler was flicking her hair and being noisy \u2013 then hanging is too good for them. \u201cPeople don\u2019t behave like that in their local cinema, let alone in the Royal Opera House,\u201d McMaster said sensibly. What I am saying is that Covent Garden should immediately commission an opera called The Coat about the night in question, to explore how classical music rather than video games causes mindless violence. Possibly with a score by Harrison Birtwistle so unlistenable you\u2019d climb over your own granny to get out of the auditorium. That said, what\u2019s important to note is that fights at the opera are wrong, not least because they encourage headline writers to reference old Marx brothers movies they\u2019ve probably never seen. As Roger Scruton argues in the The Ring of Truth: The Wisdom of Wagner\u2019s Ring of the Nibelung, the takeaway from those many hours of Wagner is that, in the bleak Viking world of the Ring, despite its cast of crazily violent hammer-throwing and skull-smashing gods, is the reality of love and compassion made manifest by Br\u00fcnnhilde\u2019s sacrifice to her nutty spouse, Siegfried. Strangely, that is very similar to the message of Blue Story, though the machete-wielding toughs who injured police officers at Star City and terrified the Frozen 2 demographic clearly failed to appreciate it.

Given that the nut roast has been relegated to the foods of Christmas past, I applaud the cooks at M&amp;S who bravely brought it back in 2019, updated with a merriness of flavour and texture. This is herby, rich and sausage-y with notes of chestnut, spice and a naughty smattering of cranberry stuffing in the centre, plus a vegan gravy so good I swear I heard angels singing as it slipped down. It does look like a big, fat brown log, but who cares? I\u2019d be prepared to take out my contact lenses just to eat it all over again.

      "bodyText": "Mains Reviewed by Meera Sodha Not long ago, anyone who wanted a plant-based Christmas dinner got little support from supermarkets. With almost everyone opting for turkey, the best you could hope for was a nut roast for one and some boiled sprouts. This year, you can\u2019t move for options \u2013 which vary from meat substitutes to real vegetables, delightfully transformed. Wherever you sit on that spectrum (personally, I prefer food from a real plant, rather than an industrial one), what is not in doubt is that, at Christmas, everything needs a little more sparkle. That sparkle can come in many forms \u2013 a dish could really look the part, be made with special ingredients, such as truffle, or using a fancy technique to elevate it from the everyday \u2013 but, above all, it needs to taste great and as if it were made with love. Morrisons layered vegetable tarts, \u00a34 for two Puff-pastry-wrapped, barely seasoned and barely identifiable stodge that, according to the packaging, is a puree of spinach, squash and chestnuts. The mixture is perched on a layer of thick, jammy beetroot chutney so sweet that it would make a jelly baby rethink their purpose in life. Barely edible. \u2605 Tesco Finest butternut, mushroom and chestnut wreath, \u00a34.50 (serves two) Oven-cooked butternut squash and mushrooms tucked neatly into a filo pastry wreath. Flavour-wise, it took me straight back to the school canteen and food that was neither awful nor wonderful, but somewhere in the middle. There is not much in the way of festive flavour here \u2013 no stuffing, for example, to elevate it to something special enough for Christmas. Call me Scrooge, but this is the sort of food that forms the forgettable layers in the great sandwich of life. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Finest carrot tarte tartins, \u00a310 for four This is a clever idea \u2013 a bullet-proof tarte tartin for the home cook \u2013 that falls flat. It looks pretty enough, but it is just chunky boiled carrots layered over some quite vinegar-laden onions \u2013 which are not, as the packaging suggests, \u201ccaramelised\u201d. The flavours are unbalanced, there is too much acid and, overall, it is one-dimensional. \u2605\u2605 Waitrose root en croute, \u00a35.99 for two These are pretty, golden-brown latticed pies that can sit solo, but will also play nicely alongside some Christmas trimmings. The pastry is crisp and inside is a rich and wonderful creamy, cheesy spinach sauce, which gives way to sweet paprika and dill carrots. I can spot the vegetables! There is plenty of flavour and good times to be had here. Sing it loud: root en croute! \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 M&amp;S Plant Kitchen festive roast with cranberry and chestnut stuffing and a vegan gravy, \u00a312 (serves 4); in store from 20 December Glory be! What a delicious thing this was over and over again: my husband and I could not stop eating it. Given that the nut roast has been relegated to the foods of Christmas past, I applaud the cooks at M&amp;S who bravely brought it back in 2019, updated with a merriness of flavour and texture. This is herby, rich and sausage-y with notes of chestnut, spice and a naughty smattering of cranberry stuffing in the centre, plus a vegan gravy so good I swear I heard angels singing as it slipped down. It does look like a big, fat brown log, but who cares? I\u2019d be prepared to take out my contact lenses just to eat it all over again.

Underneath the sweet onions was another layer of gloopy, sweet cranberry sauce and the odd (sweet) vegetable \u2013 parsnip, carrot or beetroot. Overall this is confused: pudding masquerading as a main. \u2605 Co-op festive roasting joints, \u00a35 (serves two) The glowing fake bacon, artfully wrapped around the side of what looks like a circular slab of half-digested stomach contents (sorry) was enough to kill my festive spirit, but I took a hit and ate some. The \u201cbacon\u201d tasted like flabby, spammy Frazzles and the insides were an oily smoked mixture of sweet rice and herbs. I managed only a couple of bites. It is the vegan Grinch roast that stole Christmas. \u2606 Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference no beef wellington, \u00a37 (serves two) This parcel-shaped pastry, to its credit, looks like something you would want to bring to table. It suggests to the vegans that they are loved and cared-for members of the family. Until, as in a good thriller, a knife appears and things start to go wrong. When cut, the insides are like the sludgy brown bottom of the Thames, gushing out on to the plate, encouraging the central \u201cno-beef sausage\u201d to lurch forward. Despite all the drama, it tastes quite nice \u2013 like smoky mushroom pate wrapped in pastry. I would not complain if I were served it \u2013 but I might hope for something better next year. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Desserts Reviewed by Anna Jones There is a lightness to a vegan dessert that I really appreciate.

So even if I have the choice, I will often plump for the vegan pudding in a restaurant, because it will be the thing on the menu that pops out. That said, you want a certain level of indulgence \u2013 creaminess without a cloying texture; a jelly that has the right level of wobble. And texture is crucial; a topping of demerara sugar or pumpkin-seed brittle, say, scattered over a ginger cake. Asda Extra Special raspberry torte, \u00a34 (serves six) This is lovely in appearance, with a good dusting of cocoa. But for something billed as extra-special, it really could have tasted more chocolatey. It has a nut base, which adds a nice bit of texture, but it is just not indulgent enough. \u2605\u2605 Iceland No Moo chocolate snow flakes, \u00a32 for two These are pretty small \u2013 halfway between a chocolate and a cake. The hard chocolate exterior gives way to a very liquid caramel filling that is much too sweet. \u2605\u2605 M&amp;S chocolate and cherry dessert, \u00a310 (serves six) The only way to serve this, it appears, is to spoon it out of its plastic container like a mousse, which is a pity, since it looks like a layered cake. The cherry topping is reminiscent of a pie filling, not too sweet, with pieces of fruit. The chocolate ganache beneath is a tiny bit grainy, but with a lovely strong chocolate flavour. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Finest chocolate ganache and brownie bites, \u00a34 for six These look quite sweet and Christmassy, with gold dusting on the top, and they are not too big, which is always good because it means you can have a bite of something else, too. You get a big chocolate hit at the beginning, and a cleaner, fresher flavour \u2013 because they are dairy-free \u2013 at the end. They have a slight tiffin vibe, with dates for sweetness and pumpkin seeds for bite. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Waitrose elderflower, raspberry and blackcurrant jelly, \u00a34 (serves 6) This looked so beautiful when it first came out of its tub and would have been marked higher if it hadn\u2019t collapsed almost instantly. The jelly has a good, soft consistency, which is hard for vegan jellies. Nice sharpness from the fruit, although I would prefer more elderflower. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Sainsbury\u2019s raspberry and clementine snowflake jelly, \u00a34 (serves four) This is pretty amazing-looking \u2013 a fancy gold star that holds its shape beautifully. I can imagine people being impressed with this one. But it all tastes a bit too much like orange squash \u2013 or the middle layer of a packet jelly trifle. \u2605\u2605 Party food Reviewed by Miguel Barclay Party food has to look appetising. You don\u2019t want to feel embarrassed handing out platters. Co-op Asian style sharing selection, \u00a32.25 for 11 pieces It looks tasty. I like the stars on the vegetable twists, and the filo candles with their festive red tips. It tastes fresh and fragrant with lemongrass; nothing greasy and, crucially, no soggy pastry. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Co-op Indian style sharing selection, \u00a32.25 for 10 pieces These are golden brown and crunchy. The curried jackfruit in the samosas is intense. Delicious. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco sticky chilli cauliflower bites, \u00a32 (serves four) Reheating tempura batter in the oven doesn\u2019t really work, especially since you are putting the sauce on it, which makes the pastry bland and soggy. Depressing. \u2605 Tesco Plant Chef pigless blankets, \u00a32 for 10 These take an age to golden-up, but they are worth the wait. The pastry is flaky and the filling (pea protein and roasted mushroom) is better than the real deal. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Finest Thai inspired butternut squash, coconut and lime spring rolls, \u00a34 for eight The prettiest of the lot, and the flavour is excellent, too: the taste is like Thai green curry, with a powerful lemongrass flavour. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Asda Extra Special rainbow vegetable filo tarts, \u00a32.50 for nine I like the fact that the veggies are on show here, and not enclosed in pastry \u2013 it is refreshing for them not to be beige. Flavour-wise, the gooey filling contrasts nicely with the crispy filo. More lemongrass, though \u2013 definitely the ingredient of the moment. \u2605\u2605\u2605 M&amp;S Collection mushroom steamed buns, \u00a314 for 24 These look interesting and mysterious and, as long as you don\u2019t taste them, they will be a talking point. But the pastry tastes like doughy, cheap white breadcrumbs you have smashed into a ball. And if you closed your eyes, you wouldn\u2019t even know there was a filling in there. \u2605 M&amp;S Plant Kitchen no pork pigs in duvets, \u00a35 for 12 The pastry is doughy, and while the sausage looks decent, it doesn\u2019t taste like one. It is made with seasoned mushroom and soy, but tastes a bit like cheese. It is definitely savoury, though \u2013 almost too savoury \u2013 and it gets better with every bite. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Iceland no duck Chinese selection, \u00a33 for 12 pieces The sweet plum gyoza with jackfruit taste vaguely authentic, although the tartness of the plum is a bit overpowering. Otherwise, they are a bit bland. I don\u2019t like the hoisin pastry cones, which taste like stale, stodgy curry wrapped in soggy pastry. If they sold the Sichuan filo crackers separately, though, I might buy them \u2013 but they don\u2019t redeem the whole pack. \u2605\u2605 Iceland No Bull Burger Sliders, \u00a34 for eight This is fun finger food. The sliders look great and taste great, as if fresh off the barbecue. I like the fact that they come with mustard, and that the burger is a very close replica of a beef burger. To the untrained palate, they taste like beef. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Iceland no duck hoisin spring rolls, \u00a32 for 10 Very run-of-the-mill spring rolls, the kind you get at an all-you-can-eat buffet. The pastry is a bit tough and thick, most likely to compensate for skimping on the filling. \u2605\u2605 Aldi vegan cauliflower bites, \u00a31.99 for 10 They have an offputting watery consistency, a bit like curdled milk. And the flavour is unidentifiable. Asian? Indian? Tex Mex? British? No good. \u2605 Waitrose Christmas vegan mini beet wellingtons, \u00a37 for nine There is no food with red crumbs on the outside except for red velvet cake, so the white puff pastry dotted with red here is immediately unappetising. Also, they look difficult to eat. Taste-wise I don\u2019t like them. They are so sweet that they are almost like a dessert \u2013 but not a wellington. \u2605 Waitrose vegan Moroccan mushroom and chickpea pittas, \u00a36 for 12 They are so cute! They certainly look one of the most interesting offerings. They taste nice, too, with a bit of Moroccan tagine vibe. But that is only in the first mouthful. After that, they get drier and drier, and in the end it is just thick pitta. \u2605\u2605 Waitrose Christmas vegan mushroom and chestnut pat\u00e9, \u00a32.50 This looks good, with a lovely glossy finish from the red onion and balsamic chutney on top, but the bottom layer is so bland that caramelised onion is all you get by way of flavour. This neither tastes like, nor does the job of, a pat\u00e9. It is a condiment, not a snack. \u2605\u2605 Miguel Barclay\u2019s Meat Free One Pound Meals is published by Headline on 26 December.

Temperatures are forecast to peak in Victoria and South Australia on Friday, with Oodnadatta and Port Augusta to reach 48C (118F), and peak in NSW on Saturday. NSW has been placed under a total fire ban from midnight on Tuesday to midnight on Saturday as firefighters battle to contain more than 100 fires burning around the state, including the 400,000-hectare (990,000-acre) Gospers Mountain megafire in Wollemi national park in the Blue Mountains.

Penrith is forecast to reach 44C on Thursday and 45C on Saturday, while the eastern suburbs of Sydney will reach 39C on Thursday and 35C on Saturday. Extreme fire danger is forecast for greater Sydney, the Illawarra and the southern ranges on Thursday. Tibooburra, a small town in the far north-west of NSW, has been above 40C since Monday and is expected to remain above that temperature until Christmas Day. \u201cThis is blowing [December records] out of the water,\u201d said Rob Taggart, senior forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology in Sydney.

Melbourne is forecast to reach 39C on Wednesday and 41C on Friday, when Mildura is forecast to experience its hottest ever December day of 47C. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hot all the way through,\u201d said Christie Johnson, duty forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology in Victoria.",

      "body": "<p>The year 2012 had been a long and difficult one. One of three, in fact. It had been three years since my mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer and, ever since, I, my dad and older brother had been living in the hospital-filled limbo so familiar to families of cancer patients \u2013 life dictated by chemo cycles, the endless bedside waiting, the guilty mental preparation for the inevitable.</p> <p>Christmas in the Kalia household had always been a major occasion, though, and something to look forward to. Even though we are Hindus \u2013 our roots are in India \u2013 we had embraced the festival\u2019s feasting and gift-giving. My mum would usually invite her two siblings and their ever-expanding families for turkey with all the trimmings, a meal she would spend days preparing while my kitchen-inept dad would look on in awe, faithfully laying the table and clearing dishes. That table would hold at least 15 others, all laughing and stuffing themselves \u2013 the usual disagreements that characterised family gatherings strangely absent. Since she had fallen ill, though, Christmas had morphed from a day of celebration of our big immigrant family\u2019s resilient togetherness to a day fearful of absence. Which Christmas would be Mum\u2019s last, I would wonder, and how could I make that one count more than the others?</p> <p>Her last Christmas was December 2012. The cancer had gone into remission in 2011, only to come back nine months later \u2013 and this time much worse, requiring major surgery that would keep her in hospital over the Christmas period. I was struggling to come to terms with the news, having just moved out of home to university, where I should have been drinking myself into new friendships, but instead was only thinking about whether she would make it to the end of the year. I was spending my life on trains, coming home every weekend to make the most of the time we had together.</p> <p>December came, and with it the usual stresses of Christmas parties and present-buying. I, for a reason I will never understand, decided to get my mum a copy of Raymond Carver\u2019s What We Talk About When We Talk About Love \u2013 an emotionally punishing read at the best of times, never mind after five-hour surgery. It was obvious that we wouldn\u2019t be hosting on Christmas Day this year. Instead, I awoke that morning with fizzing butterflies in my stomach \u2013 not the usual excitement, but a rising dread for the day to come, one that I knew I would have to grit my teeth to get through. We went straight to the hospital, where through a tangle of tubes and beneath a wheezing oxygen mask my mum lay, uncomfortable, but happy to see us.</p> <p>I gave her her present \u2013 immediately realising it was a useless choice \u2013 and then the three of us sat beside her for what felt like hours. There were no decorations in the intensive care ward, no Christmas music, just other families quietly keeping vigil and the heroic staff working through their routines. This was just another day; the tantalising magic of Christmas had disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you all looking so sad for?\u201d my mum asked us. She was adamant that we had some semblance of a Christmas Day, so my brother and I were sent off to our auntie\u2019s for a sombre meal, avoiding talk of our mum lest it ruin the charade of turkey, gravy and torn tissue paper hats. My dad wouldn\u2019t leave her side, though, and stayed until the nurses sent him home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0735609ed8977603f76c633be6577480ec5699c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0735609ed8977603f76c633be6577480ec5699c0/0_15_453_566/400.jpg\" alt=\"Ammar with his mother.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ammar with his mother in around 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Ammar Kalia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was heart-crushing stuff. \u201cIs this what all Christmases will be like now?\u201d I remember thinking. Yet, as we were leaving my auntie\u2019s to face a night alone in a house that was feeling increasingly cold and empty, my phone rang. It was my best friend, Keerut, whom I have known since I was four, when we bonded in the playground over a shared love of Michael Jackson and Linkin Park. He invited us all over to his family\u2019s place for a second Christmas meal, as they were eating late.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Your best friends will be there for you unreservedly and unconditionally. That was something I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d had</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That call was the faintest glimmer of hope in that bitterly cold day. I told my brother, and we set off in the car, arriving 30 minutes later to a warm house, places set for us and glasses thrust into our hands. Again, we didn\u2019t speak much of my mum \u2013 we all knew her absence was the reason for us being there \u2013 but, instead, we got drunk and played games and were force-fed another Christmas dinner. I can\u2019t remember what we ate or what games we played, but I remember laughing until I cried and feeling relieved that was something I could still do; that it was possible to feel some happiness even in the most brutally sad times. We stayed over and when we woke up the next day, for a moment it felt as if things were OK again.</p> <p>I realised that in the more than 20 years Keerut and I had been friends, I had taken that friendship for granted. In Indian culture, there is a huge emphasis placed on the importance of family, the assumption that blood is a bond that will never be broken. But as any human being will tell you, friendships can also be for life. Your best friends will be there for you unreservedly and unconditionally, and that was something I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d had all along.</p> <p>That was the last Christmas I spent with Mum but it was also the beginning of a new tradition. This year will be the seventh Christmas without her, and no doubt it will be a day full of the sadness, dread and possible happiness that anyone bereaved will experience, but it will also be another year when we have Christmas lunch with my auntie and then head to Keerut\u2019s for the evening. It may be a difficult time of year, but that makes it all the more important to acknowledge the support \u2013 the friends \u2013 that I do have and whom I would like to thank for bringing some excitement back to my life. Theirs is a presence I will not forget, just as I will remember my mum.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Students in Delhi have condemned their \u201cbarbaric\u201d treatment at the hands of police who stormed a peaceful protest against the new citizenship bill over the weekend, injuring dozens. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, students who were caught up in Sunday\u2019s protest at Delhi\u2019s predominately Muslim Jamia Millia Islamia University \u2013 which turned violent after police descended on the campus firing teargas and rubber bullets and beating demonstrators with batons \u2013 said it had turned into a \u201cbattlefield\u201d. Mohammad Mustafa, who is studying for an MBA, alleged he was \u201cbeaten mercilessly and I fell unconscious\u201d. He said he was taken to a police station. \u201cThey made us sit on the cold floor. I was not given any treatment although I felt like I was going to die.\u201d The students at JMI had gathered to protest against the citizenship act, which was passed by parliament last week, which they say is discriminatory against Muslims. Under the legislation, tens of thousands of Hindu, Christian, Jain, Buddhist and Sikh migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan will be allowed to claim Indian citizenship. The same will not apply for Muslims as the act\u2019s backers say they do not face oppression in those countries. The law sparked protests first in India\u2019s north-eastern states last week. These have since spread across the country and gathered particular momentum at university campuses. Violent protests against the citizenship law broke out in the east Delhi district of Seelampur on Tuesday afternoon. The police have been accused of responding with disproportionate force, particularly in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in the state of Uttar Pradesh, where the police used teargas and water cannon against demonstrators. At Tuesday\u2019s press conference, activist Fawaj Shaheen alleged that \u201cthe right hand of an AMU student was amputated after he was hit by a teargas shell\u201d. \u201cThe 15 December is a black day in the history of this country,\u201d human rights activist Farah Naqvi told the news conference. \u201cIt is as if Indian citizens are rising to save the Indian constitution from the Indian state and the state policy.\u201d The students at the conference described how many of those attacked by police had not even been demonstrating. Video footage from inside a library stormed by riot police shows students who were quietly studying fleeing for cover and hiding under desks as the police descended, wielding their batons. Another video, which has gone viral in India, shows a group of five women forming a protective shield around a male student who the police had violently dragged out of his house and began beating in the street. Speaking to Indian media after the attack, the student, identified as Shaheen, said: \u201cThe policemen were not distinguishing between girls and boys. They were slamming everyone and smashing everything in front of them.\u201d On Tuesday the police confirmed they had arrested 10 people in connection with the violence at JMI but said none of them were students. They have also denied multiple reports that at least two protesters were shot by police in the riots. Speaking to media outside Alshifa hospital, Hisham Siddiqui, a doctorate student, described how he was inside a mosque on the university campus when more than a dozen police burst in. His arm and head was heavily bandaged, and he was taken out of hospital in a wheelchair. \u201cThey smashed the glass doors and entered inside,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cOur faith is strong; we will continue fighting.\u201d More than 400 students and alumni of 19 universities across the US, including Harvard, Yale, Columbia and Stanford, wrote a letter of support to students at JMI and AMU and condemned the \u201cbrutal police violence\u201d against them. Protests continued on Tuesday across India. At Punjab University, Harman Deep, the leader of the student society, addressed hundreds of protesters, saying that the new citizenship act was \u201can attack on our Muslim community\u201d. He condemned the actions of the police against JMI students, adding: \u201cThis shameful act by Delhi police shows the moral death and decay of current police enforcement.\u201d He said the violence showed the \u201ctrue characteristics\u201d of India\u2019s Hindu-led government. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, accused the opposition Congress party of stirring up fear about the new legislation, and denied that it discriminates against India\u2019s 200 million Muslims. \u201cThe Congress is spreading lies, creating an atmosphere of fear for Muslims over the citizenship act,\u201d he said. \u201cI give my assurances no citizen in the country will be affected by the law.\u201d Writer Arundhati Roy was among those expressing their dismay at the new legislation and said that India faced the \u201cbiggest challenge since independence\u201d.

No one is above the law, but the president is the law, so where\u2019s the problem?</p> <p>D.

Not perfect, but pretty darn good.</p> <p>D. Quite problematic, but it didn\u2019t happen.</p> <p>E. Still better than his conversations with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson and Justin Trudeau.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>4. In withholding $400</strong><strong>m</strong><strong> in military aid to Ukraine appropriated by Congress, President Trump was:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A. Transparently trying to force the newly elected president of a fledgling democracy to participate in a corrupt act.</p> <p>B.

The former Wales and Lions attack was banned from the game for 18 months, with nine suspended, on Monday. An independent Welsh Rugby Union disciplinary panel found he had made 363 bets covering 1,163 rugby matches over a four-year period, including some on Wales. Two of the bets were on Wales players to score. Howley, 49, who can suspension has been backdated to the day he was sent home from Wales\u2019s World Cup campaign in Japan when the WRU launched an investigation into his betting activity, has said sorry to those affected by his gambling. \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to apologise to all those close to me and everyone this has affected, especially the rugby community, close colleagues and above all my family,\u201d Howley said. \u201cI am an extremely private man, and unfortunately it was this that kept me silent as I battled my demons following my sister\u2019s tragic death. \u201cThe last few months have been immensely tough, and continued help will allow me to find the right path back to rugby which has always been my true passion.

A woman in a headscarf fronting a folky rock group shouldn\u2019t feel transgressive, yet it does \u2013 30 years into her career, she still follows her own truths, wherever they lead. When she caustically delivers the lines: \u201cYou have no right to want anything from me / Why don\u2019t you take it out on somebody else?\u201d from tonight\u2019s opener, the John Grant song Queen of Denmark, the cheers rise several notches. O\u2019Connor whispers her thanks.</p> <p>Her first UK performance since 2015 has a dual purpose: to reassure herself that people still want to see her \u2013 she had worried that nobody would come \u2013 and to gear up for a busy 2020. A new album is imminent and will be accompanied by a lengthy tour. A feathery track from it features as tonight\u2019s last song. The stage has always seemed a refuge for her: a place where she\u2019s free to offload about love, faith and betrayal by people in power.</p> <p>And when she\u2019s on form, as tonight, she\u2019s radiant. The more broken the song, the more strength she siphons from it; the heavy-hearted Reason with Me uses a junkie analogy to portray her obsession with a man, and she gains more power with each verse, finishing with a wild cry. I Am Stretched on Your Grave, sung a cappella under purple spotlights, is almost too mournful to stand, but as it slowly unfurls, O\u2019Connor\u2019s voice grows steelier until she\u2019s fairly blasting the words. She vowed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/17/sinead-o-conor-cease-singing-nothing-compares-2u-live\">several years ago</a> never to sing Nothing Compares 2 U again because she no longer \u201cemotionally identified\u201d with her biggest hit, but here it is, still stupendous.</p> <p>There are lighter moments, such as the dance-cum-twirl she busts out during the skiffle-shuffle 4th and Vine, and her brisk introduction to Black Boys on Mopeds: \u201cI think you might like this.\u201d She\u2019s right: the first line, \u201cMargaret Thatcher on TV\u201d, induces jeers from a reminiscing 90% of the audience who are over 40. Mainly, though, performance is a serious business for this outstanding singer. She speaks infrequently \u2013 perhaps because she gives so much of herself in her lyrics \u2013 and focuses on finding solace in the music.</p>",

In a tweet at the time, she declared: \u201cI never wanna spend time with white people again (if that\u2019s what non-muslims are called). Not for one moment, for any reason. They are disgusting.\u201d Apologising later, she said she had been \u201cangry and unwell\u201d \u2013 but no matter how many bridges she burns during periods of illness, she still has an extraordinary rapport with her fans, who cheer lustily as her backing band arrive, and then O\u2019Connor herself, in hijab and full-length dress. A woman in a headscarf fronting a folky rock group shouldn\u2019t feel transgressive, yet it does \u2013 30 years into her career, she still follows her own truths, wherever they lead. When she caustically delivers the lines: \u201cYou have no right to want anything from me / Why don\u2019t you take it out on somebody else?\u201d from tonight\u2019s opener, the John Grant song Queen of Denmark, the cheers rise several notches. O\u2019Connor whispers her thanks. Her first UK performance since 2015 has a dual purpose: to reassure herself that people still want to see her \u2013 she had worried that nobody would come \u2013 and to gear up for a busy 2020. A new album is imminent and will be accompanied by a lengthy tour. A feathery track from it features as tonight\u2019s last song. The stage has always seemed a refuge for her: a place where she\u2019s free to offload about love, faith and betrayal by people in power. And when she\u2019s on form, as tonight, she\u2019s radiant. The more broken the song, the more strength she siphons from it; the heavy-hearted Reason with Me uses a junkie analogy to portray her obsession with a man, and she gains more power with each verse, finishing with a wild cry. I Am Stretched on Your Grave, sung a cappella under purple spotlights, is almost too mournful to stand, but as it slowly unfurls, O\u2019Connor\u2019s voice grows steelier until she\u2019s fairly blasting the words. She vowed several years ago never to sing Nothing Compares 2 U again because she no longer \u201cemotionally identified\u201d with her biggest hit, but here it is, still stupendous. There are lighter moments, such as the dance-cum-twirl she busts out during the skiffle-shuffle 4th and Vine, and her brisk introduction to Black Boys on Mopeds: \u201cI think you might like this.\u201d She\u2019s right: the first line, \u201cMargaret Thatcher on TV\u201d, induces jeers from a reminiscing 90% of the audience who are over 40. Mainly, though, performance is a serious business for this outstanding singer. She speaks infrequently \u2013 perhaps because she gives so much of herself in her lyrics \u2013 and focuses on finding solace in the music.",

What we said: This uncompromising, unashamedly political work of artistic intent is 2019\u2019s most interesting blockbuster game by a distance. Read the full review 19 Baba is You The cleverest puzzle game of the year is this series of lo-fi mazes, in which blocks containing nouns, conjunctions and verbs can be rearranged to remix the rules of each conundrum. Ingenious and mind-bending. What we said: From a simple premise, Teikari spins dozens of ingenious challenges \u2026 an invitation to play the role of a chaotic god, rewriting the rules of the universe. Read the full review 18 The Outer Worlds Waking early on a ship bound for the furthest human colony in the galaxy is the intriguing start point for Obsidian\u2019s epic and amusing role-playing adventure. With beautiful worlds and interesting characters, this treatise on unencumbered space capitalism is a joy. What we said: The Outer Worlds is vital proof that mid-sized indie teams can take on the big guns at their own game, and leave them looking a little foolish. Read the full review 17 Sayonara Wild Hearts Described as a pop album video game, this joyous adventure sends you scorching through a brash, electric neon landscape, collecting hearts and dodging obstacles to a synth-drenched soundtrack. What we said: Embellishes its ideas in step with its fizzing tracks, which sustain second and third listens as you try to beat your score. Stylish, memorable game-making. Read the full review 16 Horace An overlooked treasure, Horace is both an innovative and brilliant genre-bending platform-adventure game and an unexpectedly moving story about a robot butler, stuffed with references to the pop-cultural obsessions of its British creators. It spirals outwards from deceptively humble beginnings into a sprawling and singularly strange experience. 15 Fire Emblem: Three Houses The grand tactical role-playing adventure returns, this time pitting three regal households against each other in a quest to rule the land. Players swap between battlefields and academy classrooms in a mix of war and romantic entanglements. What we said: By turns grandiose and silly, but always engrossing, this bubbling school soap opera is a game to spend a summer with.

Inspired by the novels of HG Wells and Jules Verne, this is a singular sci-fi role-playing game, filled with weird characters fighting it out to survive in a galactic Victorian empire. What we said: Depending on what you want from it, Sunless Skies is a merciless odyssey of oddball sci-fi survival, or a fantasy novel trilogy\u2019s worth of wild, written ideas. Read the full review 13 Observation On a space station floating in the ether, something has gone very wrong \u2013 and you watch it unfold not from the perspective of the astronauts, but as the station\u2019s AI.

In short, because of boredom and their reliance on calorie restriction \u2013 which always fails, as it requires a level of sacrifice that is difficult to maintain in the long term. Many diets ultimately result in weight plateau \u2013 or gain \u2013 but the physical and mental effects can be severe. The metabolism slows downs in response to calorie restriction and the weight rebound often causes depression and overeating. We also know that a reduced microbiome diversity in the gut often caused by a restrictive diet is related to depression and mood changes. So how can we collectively tackle the diet epidemic? By tackling the root causes \u2013 false information, better education and reducing junk food and snacking. As Christmas and the New Year approach \u2013 times of glutton and then restriction respectively \u2013 it is important to maintain greater mindfulness about the importance of the quality of food consumed during this period, as well as the importance of meal timing and leaving gaps between meals, and how these things can impact the health of your gut microbes. Tim will be leading a masterclass in January about making healthier nutritional choices. Book tickets here.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s food production system needs substantial change to become sustainable, according to participants in a recent roundtable discussion held at the Guardian\u2019s offices in London. Attendees included executives from Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest supermarket and the event\u2019s sponsor, food and drink producer Nestl\u00e9, along with multinational farmer G\u2019s, and food sustainability campaigners.</p> <p>But all the participants agreed on the need for change. In 2018 the UK produced just 53% of the food that it needed to feed itself, according to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/food-statistics-pocketbook/food-statistics-in-your-pocket-global-and-uk-supply\">government statistics</a>. Agriculture, forestry and fishing generated <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsatmosphericemissionsgreenhousegasemissionsbyeconomicsectorandgasunitedkingdom\">8.5% of UK greenhouse gas emissions</a>, according to the Office for National Statistics. And NHS Digital reports that in England, <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/statistics-on-obesity-physical-activity-and-diet/statistics-on-obesity-physical-activity-and-diet-england-2019\">29% of adults and 20% of children in their final year of primary school are obese</a>, with twice as many obese children in the most deprived areas than the least.</p> <p>One option that would tackle all three problems would be for Britain to produce less meat, more sustainably. Rob Percival, head of food policy for the Soil Association, said that half of the crops grown in the UK are used to feed animals rather than people. <a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/iddri-report-ten-years-for-agroecology-in-europe/\">Research</a> by the association\u2019s French partner IDDRI suggests that raising fewer cows and sheep on grass, along with far fewer chickens and pigs fed on food waste, could cut food imports, allow pesticides to be phased out and make significant cuts in emissions.</p> <p>\u201cYou can square the circle,\u201d said Percival.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s food production system needs substantial change to become sustainable, according to participants in a recent roundtable discussion held at the Guardian\u2019s offices in London. Attendees included executives from Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest supermarket and the event\u2019s sponsor, food and drink producer Nestl\u00e9, along with multinational farmer G\u2019s, and food sustainability campaigners. But all the participants agreed on the need for change. In 2018 the UK produced just 53% of the food that it needed to feed itself, according to government statistics. Agriculture, forestry and fishing generated 8.5% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Office for National Statistics. And NHS Digital reports that in England, 29% of adults and 20% of children in their final year of primary school are obese, with twice as many obese children in the most deprived areas than the least. One option that would tackle all three problems would be for Britain to produce less meat, more sustainably. Rob Percival, head of food policy for the Soil Association, said that half of the crops grown in the UK are used to feed animals rather than people. Research by the association\u2019s French partner IDDRI suggests that raising fewer cows and sheep on grass, along with far fewer chickens and pigs fed on food waste, could cut food imports, allow pesticides to be phased out and make significant cuts in emissions. \u201cYou can square the circle,\u201d said Percival. As an example of how substituting meat can help, Tess Kelly, sustainability projects officer for Quorn said that the company\u2019s meat-free mycoprotein mince uses 95% less land and generates 90% less greenhouse gas emissions than beef mince.

She was also one of Wisden\u2019s five cricketers of the year in 2014, but was dropped two years later, after England lost against Australia in the World T20 semi-final, a victim of the new \u201cno excuses\u201d professional culture. Despite temporary despair, she has moved seamlessly into coaching and media appearances.</p> <p><strong>Suzie Bates (New Zealand) </strong>Another magnificent captain, this time for New Zealand, who stepped down in 2018 after nearly seven years in the job. An incredible athlete \u2013 she also represented New Zealand at the Beijing Olympics on the basketball court \u2013 her work ethic has shone nearly as much as her run-getting and her more than handy medium pace. She is New Zealand\u2019s leading run scorer in one-day internationals and fifth on the all-time list.</p> <p><strong>Meg Lanning (Australia) </strong>Another collector of records. In 2011 she became the youngest male or female Australian to score an ODI century; in 2012 she smashed the record for the fastest ODI century by an Australian and in 2014, aged 21, she was handed the captaincy. She was, inevitably, Australia\u2019s youngest. Under her leadership, Australia have won the T20 World Cup twice and have just broken the record for consecutive wins in ODIs \u2013 18 \u2013 surpassing the achievements of Belinda Clark\u2019s great team.</p> <p><strong>Ellyse Perry (Australia) </strong>A woman who does it all \u2013 opens the bowling, fields like a gazelle and scores effortless runs in the middle order. An integral cog in Australia\u2019s ODI and T20 World Cup wins this decade, she has been called the \u201cgreatest female cricketer we\u2019re ever going to see\u201d by Charlotte Edwards. Certainly she reigns supreme as the best female cricketer currently on the planet. Football\u2019s loss (she was playing for the Matildas at 16) has been cricket\u2019s joy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4da1539c6f49947847c8e5077bf2d668489df50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4da1539c6f49947847c8e5077bf2d668489df50/0_57_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellyse Perry, here in action in the Women\u2019s Big Bash League in Australia, has been an integral cog in Australia\u2019s ODI and T20 World Cup wins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ellyse Perry, here in action in the Women\u2019s Big Bash League in Australia, has been an integral cog in Australia\u2019s ODI and T20 World Cup wins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Barbour/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Mithali Raj (India)</strong> Near impossible to choose between Raj and her teammate with the big-match temperament Harmanpreet Kaur, who made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/20/australia-india-womens-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the innings of the 2017 World Cup</a>. In the end, Raj \u2013 the leading ODI scorer with nearly 7,000 at more than 50 \u2013 gets the vote for her longevity, steely temperament and silky stroke play.</p> <p><strong>Stafanie Taylor (West Indies)</strong> West Indies\u2019 leading ODI run-scorer has been a trailblazer for her country from the day she scored a 49-ball 90 in her first T20 international as a teenager. She led West Indies to triumph at the 2016 T20 World Cup \u2013 finishing as leading scorer and player of the tournament. She sits pretty in the International Cricket Council rankings, second in both the batting and all-rounder categories.</p> <p><strong>Sarah Taylor (England) </strong>Widely feted as the best wicketkeeper in the game, the swift-gloved Taylor announced her retirement in the summer after struggling with anxiety issues for most of her career. No woman has come near to her 232 dismissals across all formats and she is also second on England\u2019s list of all\u2011time run-scorers. England will miss her dearly.</p> <p><strong>Dane van Niekerk (South Africa) </strong>A leg-spinner with a tweak to die for, and a biffing top-order hitter, Van Niekerk\u2019s considerable bowling skills are backed up by calm leadership after she took over the South African captaincy in 2016.

      "bodyText": "In the last decade, women\u2019s cricket has undergone a metamorphosis, unfolding its wings into unexpected corners, enthusing some of the most sceptical hearts and making marketing managers wide-eyed with its potential. In 2010 the world\u2019s leading female cricketers were largely amateur; now Australia, England, India and New Zealand have fully professional national teams, with others on the way. With professionalism has come coaches and time, and with time has come huge improvements \u2013 particularly in the realms of fitness, fielding and sixes hit. The limited\u2011overs game has come to dominate and the rewards have grown substantially \u2013 the winners of the Twenty20 World Cup next year will take home $1m. The 2017 World Cup final at Lord\u2019s, a gamechanger for women\u2019s cricket, was the year\u2019s most-watched game of cricket on UK television. So here, with a glass full in celebration, is The Spin\u2019s women\u2019s ODI team of the decade \u2026 Charlotte Edwards (England) England\u2019s greatest batter of the modern era, a run-compiler of the highest order, her career spanned 20 years.

And yet, when we do step out of our comfort zones, push our boundaries, take a risk and try something new, more often than not, don\u2019t we find it rewarding? Exhilarating, even? And doesn\u2019t that \u201cfirst\u201d often live on in your mind in that special folder saved for memorable achievements?</p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s oh-so-easy to sink into the comforting safety of practical routines and well-trod paths \u2013 but is that what you really want? A life compiled of identical days? Of course not. So consider this your rallying cry to break free from the familiarity of everyday life and experience a new first. Not sure where to start? Here are some suggestions ...</p> <p><strong>Size doesn\u2019t matter<br></strong>Not all firsts have to be big, bucket list, life-defining endeavours like swimming with dolphins or scaling Everest. Because, quite frankly, dolphins are hard to come by here and Everest is already dangerously overcrowded with snaking lines of wannabe explorers.</p> <p>Take the pressure off by starting small. Ease yourself into the process with something low-key, like cooking a new dish; maybe you could try to recreate something you enjoyed in a restaurant, or ask a friend for a recommendation. Or, if you\u2019ve never thought of yourself as green-fingered, grab a pot, throw some seeds in the soil, and (hopefully) watch them grow. There\u2019s something incredibly satisfying about creating something from scratch, especially if it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve done it.</p> <p><strong>A meaningful first<br></strong>If you\u2019d like to make a positive impact while trying something new, all that\u2019s holding you back is your imagination \u2013 life-affirming firsts come in all shapes and sizes. Buying your first reusable coffee cup or metal straw are both quick and easy ways to lessen your impact on the environment. Or take a bigger stance by switching to a green energy provider or buying your first electric car. With a range of up to 245 miles* and a free home-charging point available with eligible retail purchases**, the New Renault ZOE is the ideal first electric car. When you experience its dynamic design and high-quality tech, and enjoy motoring that\u2019s better for the environment, you\u2019ll wonder why you hadn\u2019t made the switch sooner.</p> <p><strong>Break free from your routine<br></strong>Obviously our routines are there for a reason \u2013 we all have to make money and step up to certain obligations. But if you want to experience a new first, interrupting the cycle of your everyday life is a great place to start. Something as simple as changing up your commute can break the monotony and help you gain a new perspective; try getting off the bus a stop early and walking the rest of the way to work, changing underground lines at a different station, or driving home via a different route once in a while. Feeling braver? Then take inspiration from the classic 1980s movie Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off and book a midweek leave day \u2013 surely the ultimate middle finger to the nine-to-five. Go to a gallery, treat yourself to a fancy, boozy lunch \u2013 the opportunity for experiencing firsts are endless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9696fa117a0f456320da48344ddb8b2fd5cb541d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9696fa117a0f456320da48344ddb8b2fd5cb541d/0_136_5000_3221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New Renault ZOE on a road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New Renault ZOE is the ideal first electric car</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frithjof Ohm INCL.

Even just exploring a nearby borough, village or town for the first time will be enough to jolt you out of autopilot. And when it comes to meeting meaningful new faces for the first time, taking up a hobby or attending a meetup is a great place to start. Join a book club, learn a new language or sign up for a cookery class, and you\u2019ll be ticking off multiple firsts in one fell swoop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-power-of-firsts/2019/dec/06/the-psychology-of-firsts-and-why-they-stick-in-our-memories\">The psychology of firsts \u2013 and why they stick in our memories</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Keep the fire burning<br></strong>There\u2019s nothing quite like the thrill of a new relationship \u2013 those heady early days when you experience so many firsts together.

That said, we all know that exploring new areas and meeting new people enriches our lives in a multitude of ways \u2013 so surely it\u2019s worth making the effort to encounter the unknown on a more regular basis? Chances are, you won\u2019t have to travel far to experience the wonder of a first-time wander round a new place. Even just exploring a nearby borough, village or town for the first time will be enough to jolt you out of autopilot. And when it comes to meeting meaningful new faces for the first time, taking up a hobby or attending a meetup is a great place to start. Join a book club, learn a new language or sign up for a cookery class, and you\u2019ll be ticking off multiple firsts in one fell swoop. Keep the fire burning There\u2019s nothing quite like the thrill of a new relationship \u2013 those heady early days when you experience so many firsts together. And with a little effort, there\u2019s no need for that to become a thing of the past with your partner. Obviously you\u2019ll never be able to experience your first date, first kiss or first night of passion anew, but you can discover so many more firsts together. Resist the oh-so-natural urge to sink into the comfort of the familiar by seeking out new restaurants, new holiday destinations, and even new things to do in the bedroom \u2026 or, possibly, out of it. Experience the thrill of a first for yourself with the New Renault ZOE \u2013 the ideal first electric car.

The shadow foreign secretary said in September while being filmed for a BBC documentary that she was worried about the Labour leader staying neutral. She also feared not coming out strongly in favour of remain would hit the party hard at the ballot box. Thornberry, who is expected to run as party leader, said she was \u201creally pushing\u201d at the time for Labour to openly back remain. Labour suffered heavy losses in last week\u2019s general election in its leave-voting former heartland seats, and it has been suggested voters were looking to the party to take a stronger position on leave, remain or a second referendum. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, for her programme The Brexit Storm Continues during the party\u2019s conference in Brighton, she made clear the extent of her doubts. She said: \u201cI think Jeremy is trying to find a compromise but if he goes into an election saying \u2018I don\u2019t have a view\u2019 on the single biggest decision that we have to make \u2013 I think \u2013 what worries me is that every single interview he does will all be about Brexit.\u201d Asked if Labour could win an election with that position, Thornberry said: \u201cWell, I think it makes it more difficult and that\u2019s why I\u2019m really pushing this because I want Jeremy in No 10.\u201d Labour\u2019s plan was to renegotiate a Brexit deal with the EU within three months, then put it to a public vote within six months. Corbyn would then have decided at a special conference whether the party should back its own renegotiated deal or remain. The party lost 59 seats in the general election last week. Its MPs are embroiled in intense speculation about who will run to be leader, with Thornberry, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, and backbench MPs Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy all mooted as potential candidates. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has said she is interested in the deputy position, vacated by Tom Watson who left parliament this election. Close Corbyn ally Richard Burgon is also said to want the deputy job. The fallout from the election has led to a bitter war of words from MPs who lost their jobs angry at Corbyn\u2019s team.

She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday morning that voters want \u201ca leader they feel could be prime minister\u201d and at the moment he is \u201cthe best proposition\u201d. Chapman said it was not essential for the next leader to be a women or from the north of England to win over voters in former safe seats. \u201cNobody on doorsteps of Darlington said the next leader has to have ovaries or a northern accent,\u201d she added. Thornberry has threatened to sue her former colleague Caroline Flint, who represented Don Valley, for \u201cmaking up shit\u201d about her. The Islington South MP said she had consulted lawyers after Flint claimed on live television that Thornberry had once said to a fellow MP in a leave-voting seat that she was \u201cglad my constituents aren\u2019t as stupid as yours\u201d. Thornberry told Sky News: \u201cI\u2019ve contacted her and I\u2019ve said to her: please withdraw, I\u2019ll give you until the end of the day. And she hasn\u2019t.

He\u2019s greeted by ecstatic barking from his three dogs, one of which leaps into his arms, licking his face enthusiastically. It\u2019s a familiar scene from any farm, anywhere in the world. But this delivery man didn\u2019t drive through muddy fields or down country roads to get here. He freewheeled his bicycle down the blue-striped spiralling entrance of an underground car park. This is La Caverne, the only subterranean agricultural operation in Paris. It is housed within 9,000 sq m of a disused multistorey parking facility beneath a social housing complex.

      "body": "<p>In September 2005, Kate Watkins was a single mum raising four children. That year, her story <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/nov/12/familyandrelationships.family1\" title=\"\">was followed by the Guardian</a>, where she was featured discussing the challenges of family life. She had already met her future husband, Stuart, but she didn\u2019t know it.</p> <p>\u201cWhen my eldest girl, Alice, went to secondary school 14 years ago, she made friends with Stuart\u2019s twin daughters, Lotte and Maddy,\u201d Kate explains. At the time he was married to their mum, but often came to pick the girls up from Kate\u2019s house.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just a friendship at the time,\u201d Stuart says. Kate often spent weekends without adult company and was always happy to see him. \u201cWhen he arrived to get the girls, I\u2019d be so relieved I would ply him with wine just so I could speak to a grownup.\u201d</p> <p>When their daughters hit their teens they began to play up, which meant Kate spent more time with Stuart and his wife. \u201cThey were going out clubbing, sneaking out to parties and getting tattoos,\u201d Kate says. \u201cFor Stuart it was easier, but I was dealing with it alone.\u201d</p> <p>Stuart laughs. \u201cThey weren\u2019t that bad \u2013 just normal teenage stuff.\u201d But the drama brought the pair closer.</p> <p>In 2013, Stuart\u2019s marriage ended. He and his ex stayed in the family home, but agreed to start seeing other people. \u201cFor a long time after the split I was busy with work, but I always had Kate in the back of my mind.\u201d</p> <p>It was another three years before they truly realised the extent of the connection. At the end of January 2016, Kate went to a tribute concert to celebrate the life of her favourite singer, David Bowie. \u201cI loved him so much my children texted me when he died to check if I was OK,\u201d she says. Stuart was in the adjoining pub having a drink. \u201cMy friends wanted to go for dinner and I spotted him,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was really happy to have someone to stay out dancing and partying with.\u201d Her friend made him promise to look after Kate. \u201cI definitely did \u2013 I took her home in a taxi,\u201d he says. That was the night they became a couple.</p> <p>\u201cApart from the physical attraction, I love the way she chats all day long,\u201d says Stuart. \u201cHe\u2019s very funny,\u201d says Kate. \u201cAnd he\u2019s the cleverest man I know. He keeps me on my toes.\u201d</p> <p>Initially they decided against telling their daughters until they had established how serious the relationship was. \u201cThey worked it out after a few weeks and Alice stole my phone to go and prove it to Lotte and Maddy,\u201d remembers Kate. \u201cShe was pretty upset at first, but came round to the idea.\u201d When the couple got married in 2018, all three girls attended the vineyard wedding, along with Kate\u2019s three younger children, Ella, Lucy and James, and Stuart\u2019s eldest daughter, Jade. Kate walked down the aisle to a David Bowie song, naturally. \u201cWe\u2019ve got seven children between us, so we\u2019re a real blended family,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the wedding Ella did a speech where she thanked Stuart for making me so happy.\u201d</p> <p>The couple live in Holmfirth in Yorkshire with Alice and James. Lucy visits during her university holidays and the twins regularly join them for Sunday tea, cooked by Stuart. At weekends they will watch Stuart\u2019s beloved football team, Huddersfield Town. \u201cI loved going to the theatre and reading books; I never expected to like football,\u201d says Kate. \u201cBut Stuart really got me into it and his daughter Jade still comes, too.\u201d</p> <p>Kate says their relationship has brought her back to life. \u201cI think we were both just existing before; now we have so much fun together.\u201d Stuart agrees. \u201cI\u2019ve really got something to live for.\u201d \u2022 <em>Want to share your story?

      "bodyText": "In September 2005, Kate Watkins was a single mum raising four children. That year, her story was followed by the Guardian, where she was featured discussing the challenges of family life. She had already met her future husband, Stuart, but she didn\u2019t know it. \u201cWhen my eldest girl, Alice, went to secondary school 14 years ago, she made friends with Stuart\u2019s twin daughters, Lotte and Maddy,\u201d Kate explains. At the time he was married to their mum, but often came to pick the girls up from Kate\u2019s house. \u201cIt was just a friendship at the time,\u201d Stuart says. Kate often spent weekends without adult company and was always happy to see him. \u201cWhen he arrived to get the girls, I\u2019d be so relieved I would ply him with wine just so I could speak to a grownup.\u201d When their daughters hit their teens they began to play up, which meant Kate spent more time with Stuart and his wife. \u201cThey were going out clubbing, sneaking out to parties and getting tattoos,\u201d Kate says. \u201cFor Stuart it was easier, but I was dealing with it alone.\u201d Stuart laughs. \u201cThey weren\u2019t that bad \u2013 just normal teenage stuff.\u201d But the drama brought the pair closer. In 2013, Stuart\u2019s marriage ended. He and his ex stayed in the family home, but agreed to start seeing other people. \u201cFor a long time after the split I was busy with work, but I always had Kate in the back of my mind.\u201d It was another three years before they truly realised the extent of the connection. At the end of January 2016, Kate went to a tribute concert to celebrate the life of her favourite singer, David Bowie. \u201cI loved him so much my children texted me when he died to check if I was OK,\u201d she says. Stuart was in the adjoining pub having a drink. \u201cMy friends wanted to go for dinner and I spotted him,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was really happy to have someone to stay out dancing and partying with.\u201d Her friend made him promise to look after Kate. \u201cI definitely did \u2013 I took her home in a taxi,\u201d he says. That was the night they became a couple. \u201cApart from the physical attraction, I love the way she chats all day long,\u201d says Stuart. \u201cHe\u2019s very funny,\u201d says Kate. \u201cAnd he\u2019s the cleverest man I know. He keeps me on my toes.\u201d Initially they decided against telling their daughters until they had established how serious the relationship was. \u201cThey worked it out after a few weeks and Alice stole my phone to go and prove it to Lotte and Maddy,\u201d remembers Kate. \u201cShe was pretty upset at first, but came round to the idea.\u201d When the couple got married in 2018, all three girls attended the vineyard wedding, along with Kate\u2019s three younger children, Ella, Lucy and James, and Stuart\u2019s eldest daughter, Jade. Kate walked down the aisle to a David Bowie song, naturally. \u201cWe\u2019ve got seven children between us, so we\u2019re a real blended family,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the wedding Ella did a speech where she thanked Stuart for making me so happy.\u201d The couple live in Holmfirth in Yorkshire with Alice and James. Lucy visits during her university holidays and the twins regularly join them for Sunday tea, cooked by Stuart. At weekends they will watch Stuart\u2019s beloved football team, Huddersfield Town. \u201cI loved going to the theatre and reading books; I never expected to like football,\u201d says Kate. \u201cBut Stuart really got me into it and his daughter Jade still comes, too.\u201d Kate says their relationship has brought her back to life. \u201cI think we were both just existing before; now we have so much fun together.\u201d Stuart agrees. \u201cI\u2019ve really got something to live for.\u201d \u2022 Want to share your story?

She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/22/tell-me-how-it-ends-valeria-luiselli-mexican-migrant-children-us-border\">wrote a book of essays</a> that articulated some of her anger \u2013 and then returned to her story in time for publication this year. The opening pages of the finished novel suggest that she found her way by focusing on the human and the personal: \u201cMouths open to the sun, they sleep. Boy and girl, foreheads pearled with sweat, cheeks red and streaked white with dry spit. They occupy the entire space in the back of the car, spread out, limbs offering, heavy and placid.\u201d</p> <p>This is one of several lovely (not to mention amusing) depictions of the narrator\u2019s two sleeping children. Passages that help remind us that those lost little ones in the title are not statistics, or dots moving around the map, or bureaucratic expenses. They are beautiful innocent dreamers.</p> <p>This bridge to the migrant crisis is strengthened as we follow the family on a road trip from New York to Arizona. Their intimate bickering, their jokes and their conversations about audiobooks make them feel close to exactly the kind of literate reader you might expect to pick up a book like this one.</p> <p>Which makes it all the more jolting when Luiselli reminds us that there are also crucial differences. As the family go further south, they encounter increasing hostility and danger. People go silent when they learn that the narrator is Mexican. Police and authority figures start to exude menace.</p> <p>We realise that these people who have become our intimates are equally close to the \u201calien\u201d families who feature on the fringes of the novel. To those who have been trying to cross to the US, who have been interned, have lost their children, or encountered other forms of desperation. And so we realise that but for accidents of birth and fate, we too could be labelled as aliens.</p> <p>It\u2019s effective \u2013 and there\u2019s plenty more to admire in these early pages. There are, for instance, beautiful sentences: \u201cAn old lady answered the phone, her voice like a distant fire, crackling its way into my ear.\u201d</p> <p>There are also a few things to grumble about. Now and again the politics and big ideas feel shoehorned in. News about the migrant crisis comes a little too conveniently over the car radio. Overheard conversations can rather neatly sum up the book\u2019s big themes. The narrator listens in on a book group in Asheville, who decide that \u201cthe value of the novel they are discussing is that it is not a novel. That it\u2019s fiction but also it is not.\u201d Aha!</p> <p>I also had a few doubts in the early pages about the narrator\u2019s youngest daughter. She is supposed to be five, but often feels much older. Would she really want to have a stake in a conversation about whether to listen to On the Road or Lord of the Flies on audiobook?</p> <p>But soon I was won over. How not to love a girl who responds to one of her parents\u2019 conversational tics by saying \u201cthe point is, the point is, the point is always pointy\u201d? There\u2019s also a fantastic running joke about \u201cJesus Fucking Christ\u201d and who he may actually be. This deeply serious book can be very funny. I especially loved a passage in which the narrator tells someone who loves westerns: \u201cMy favourite western is B\u00e9la Tarr\u2019s S\u00e1t\u00e1tang\u00f3!\u201d This prompts a \u201cterrifying drunken idea\u201d. \u201cWhy,\u201d asks the man, \u201cdon\u2019t we rent it and watch it together in our house?\u201d</p> <p>Well, I was roaring. Luiselli explains that the film is seven hours long, but perhaps the joke only really works if you\u2019ve seen a B\u00e9la Tarr film? Or, more to the point, if you\u2019ve stopped watching one in despair when you\u2019re three hours in but not even halfway and all that\u2019s happened is that it\u2019s started raining.</p> <p>While I was laughing, I was also feeling smug for getting the reference. In this way, Luiselli cleverly flatters us. Her narrator shares hundreds of similarly literate and smart allusions and ideas with the gentle ease of one talking to equals. She is never patronising. She always assumes shared values and understanding. She makes readers feel almost as clever as the family we are reading about.</p> <p>It\u2019s a good trick \u2013 and not just that. \u201cThe intellectual amplitude and the moral seriousness are fortifying and instructive,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/04/writing-about-writing-about-the-border-crisis\">wrote James Wood in the New Yorker</a>. I\u2019d be tempted to go even further. In an age when experts and the intelligentsia are supposed to be the enemy, this celebration of shared culture feels vital. These are our people, we are reminded. And all people are potentially our people. We should hold them close. We should never listen to those who seek to divide them from us and to treat them like aliens.</p>",

Which makes it all the more jolting when Luiselli reminds us that there are also crucial differences. As the family go further south, they encounter increasing hostility and danger. People go silent when they learn that the narrator is Mexican. Police and authority figures start to exude menace. We realise that these people who have become our intimates are equally close to the \u201calien\u201d families who feature on the fringes of the novel. To those who have been trying to cross to the US, who have been interned, have lost their children, or encountered other forms of desperation. And so we realise that but for accidents of birth and fate, we too could be labelled as aliens. It\u2019s effective \u2013 and there\u2019s plenty more to admire in these early pages. There are, for instance, beautiful sentences: \u201cAn old lady answered the phone, her voice like a distant fire, crackling its way into my ear.\u201d There are also a few things to grumble about. Now and again the politics and big ideas feel shoehorned in. News about the migrant crisis comes a little too conveniently over the car radio. Overheard conversations can rather neatly sum up the book\u2019s big themes. The narrator listens in on a book group in Asheville, who decide that \u201cthe value of the novel they are discussing is that it is not a novel. That it\u2019s fiction but also it is not.\u201d Aha! I also had a few doubts in the early pages about the narrator\u2019s youngest daughter. She is supposed to be five, but often feels much older. Would she really want to have a stake in a conversation about whether to listen to On the Road or Lord of the Flies on audiobook? But soon I was won over. How not to love a girl who responds to one of her parents\u2019 conversational tics by saying \u201cthe point is, the point is, the point is always pointy\u201d? There\u2019s also a fantastic running joke about \u201cJesus Fucking Christ\u201d and who he may actually be. This deeply serious book can be very funny. I especially loved a passage in which the narrator tells someone who loves westerns: \u201cMy favourite western is B\u00e9la Tarr\u2019s S\u00e1t\u00e1tang\u00f3!\u201d This prompts a \u201cterrifying drunken idea\u201d. \u201cWhy,\u201d asks the man, \u201cdon\u2019t we rent it and watch it together in our house?\u201d Well, I was roaring. Luiselli explains that the film is seven hours long, but perhaps the joke only really works if you\u2019ve seen a B\u00e9la Tarr film? Or, more to the point, if you\u2019ve stopped watching one in despair when you\u2019re three hours in but not even halfway and all that\u2019s happened is that it\u2019s started raining. While I was laughing, I was also feeling smug for getting the reference. In this way, Luiselli cleverly flatters us. Her narrator shares hundreds of similarly literate and smart allusions and ideas with the gentle ease of one talking to equals. She is never patronising. She always assumes shared values and understanding. She makes readers feel almost as clever as the family we are reading about. It\u2019s a good trick \u2013 and not just that. \u201cThe intellectual amplitude and the moral seriousness are fortifying and instructive,\u201d wrote James Wood in the New Yorker. I\u2019d be tempted to go even further. In an age when experts and the intelligentsia are supposed to be the enemy, this celebration of shared culture feels vital. These are our people, we are reminded. And all people are potentially our people. We should hold them close. We should never listen to those who seek to divide them from us and to treat them like aliens.",

Tui, which briefly flew 15 such planes and was expecting another eight deliveries earlier this year, said a temporary stop would not have any impact. Its next eight 737 Max aircraft are among 400 already built and in storage in Seattle. Tui last week said the 737 Max grounding would cost it \u20ac130m (\u00a3110m) if the plane returns to service in April, and up to \u20ac350-400m if it cannot fly next summer.",

Athletes \u2013 from Olympic champions to high school students \u2013 have come forward to detail harrowing accounts of the physical, sexual, and emotional abuse they have endured at the hands of coaches and how the very institutions set up to protect them have miserably failed to do their jobs. Most of the stories have focused on predatory coaches but less reported, and no less disturbing, are the cases in which athletes have been abused by their own teammates. One recent set of data released by attorney and campaigner Nancy Hogshead-Makar said that 23% of cases of athlete sexual abuse involved athlete-on-athlete abuse.</p> <p>\u201cWith coaches, you can put barriers in every stage, so concepts of recruitment, of background checks, and making education.

While there is still much that is unknown about the case, it seems that at least some of the allegations stem from his time as an athlete. In the months following his death, two of his fellow skaters \u2013 Bridget Namiotka and Ashley Wagner \u2013 said he had sexually assaulted them. Namiotka said Coughlin, one of her former skating partners, had <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/05/21/john-coughlin-sexually-abused-me-before-he-killed-himself-bridget-namiotka/\">abused</a> her over the course of two years. Wagner, an Olympic bronze medalist, told USA Today that Coughlin assaulted her when both were competitive skaters \u2013 she was 17 and he was 22 \u2013 while she slept after a party in Colorado Springs. SafeSport has refused to complete its investigation, citing the fact that Coughlin is dead and cannot be interviewed.

For example, Ice Partner Search, a website where skaters can find partners for pairs or ice dance, has 34 women listed for pairs and 16 for men. For ice dance, the numbers are even more unbalanced, with 40 men listed to 120 women. The dearth of men has led to some parents taking extreme measures for their daughters. \u201cBoys are so much in demand in skating that a girl who wants to skate pairs will do everything she can to get a partner \u2013 which means fronting the cost of everything. I\u2019ve been offered a free ride by girls,\u201d Chad Brennan, a pairs skater, told <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2014/02/15-insiders-dish-on-the-world-of-figure-skating.html\">the Cut</a> in 2014. \u201cThey offered to pay for my skating and equipment if I moved to live and skate with her.\u201d Indeed, gifts of cars are not unheard of.</p> <p>\u201cYou do have a scarcity of potentially successful male partners and that does definitely create an automatic power imbalance because there are plenty of pair girls and not enough pair guys to go around\u201d Wagner says. \u201cI can\u2019t speak on what that leads to but there is definitely that potential power play in the sport.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3fc2fe092f33aa43e76b1c71f6c5dbb3a8bb24d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fc2fe092f33aa43e76b1c71f6c5dbb3a8bb24d7/0_220_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashley Wagner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashley Wagner: \u2018The thing that I found just unbelievably unacceptable was the reaction towards the victims who were brave enough to come forward\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there is the age difference between pair partners. The International Skating Union\u2019s rules take that into account. In the singles categories, the cutoff for junior competition is 18. In pairs and dance the cutoff for men is 21, a rule necessitated by the fact that often the male partner is older than his female counterpart.</p> <p>\u201cYou have this situation where in figure skating, the female athletes are typically very young,\u201d Wagner says. \u201cI started competing internationally around age 13. That was the start of my elite experience.\u201d</p> <p>Like Namiotka, Jada Kai, a singles skater who performed under the name Melissa Bulanhagui and represented both the US and the Philippines, remembers Coughlin grooming young female skaters at the Delaware rink where they both trained, including her. Kai trained at the same Delaware rink as Coughlin and Namiotka, and was between the ages of 14 and 18 during this period; Coughlin was five years her senior and four years older than Namiotka. \u201cJohn was always, like, really the charismatic type. He was everyone\u2019s friend,\u201d Kai recalls. According to Kai, the grooming started with very small moves, Coughlin would \u201cbe inappropriate and like stroke our legs when no one was looking and stroke our arms.\u201d She says that he would also send the younger girls at the rink flirtatious texts. \u201cThere were a couple of occasions where he would call me in the middle of the night,\u201d Kai says. \u201cI was like 15 at the time. He would be just like, \u2018Oh my god, you wear all black in your tight yoga pants and v-neck shirt.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What Kai describes sounds similar to a report in <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2019/12/10/sexual-abuse-olympic-figure-skater-coaches-being-investigated/2629777001/\">USA Today last week</a> about Morgan Cipres, one half of the 2018 world championship bronze medal winning French pair. The report alleges that Cipres, who trains in Florida, sent a 13-year-old skater at the rink two photos of his penis. Cipres told USA Today that \u201cI have nothing to say about this allegation\u201d.</p> <p>Once, Coughlin came over to Kai\u2019s home to watch a movie. \u201cFor some reason that was OK with my parents,\u201d Kai says. With her mother in the other room, Coughlin started to touch her. \u201cHe just put his hand on my leg and then just started like, stroking his hand on my inner thigh. Just like started petting me during this movie.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d And it\u2019s unlikely that anyone in Kai\u2019s social circle would have been able to help. Her friends were mostly other skaters who might be too afraid to say or do anything that could jeopardize their careers. \u201cEverything is kind of in play for you to not say anything,\u201d Rhind says. \u201cIt\u2019s a negative sweet spot.\u201d</p> <p>Then again, some of Kai\u2019s teammates may not have necessarily understood how problematic Coughlin\u2019s behavior was. \u201cA lot of athletes are homeschooled or don\u2019t have traditional educational experiences. So your social pool is limited to the kids at your rink, which makes it a very small social pool,\u201d Wagner says. \u201cYou go to skating parties and you are really young and there are guys there a lot older and can even legally drink at the same party. And so it\u2019s just this really odd social environment that these athletes find themselves in, which leads to this crazy power imbalance.\u201d</p> <p>Wagner went into great detail about the specifics of skating\u2019s social scene, particularly around age, when she came forward about Coughlin\u2019s assault. She said she was motivated to speak out because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/25/alysa-liu-figure-skating-nationals-champion\">13-year-old Alysa Liu\u2019s win at the 2019 national championships</a>. Wagner was concerned about someone as young as Liu being in a social environment that she was too young to handle. As Wagner noted, in skating, as in many other elite sports, your skill, not your age, dictate your social circle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/19/alysa-liu-figure-skating-young-athletes-sport\">Alysa Liu's remarkable rise: is 13 too young to be an elite athlete?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Romance can also cause problems. It is not uncommon for partners to date and even marry each other. Perhaps the most famous pairs couple in history, the double Olympic champions Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov, were 11 and 15 respectively when they first started skating together. When the pair returned to Olympic competition in 1994 after their marriage and the birth of their daughter, the media played up their romantic relationship almost as much as their technical skill.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen so many so many beautiful relationships blossom out of this sport,\u201d Wagner says. \u201cBut that\u2019s where it can get really confusing for a younger athlete, because you do have all of these romantic success stories to draw inspiration from and it\u2019s taken out of context, it can be really confusing and misleading for a young athlete.\u201d</p> <p>The solution, if there even is one, is not to ban relationships between partners who are of legal age and can consent. \u201cSome of these topics that are tougher are addressed in some of the training that\u2019s available,\u201d says Dan Hill, a spokesperson for the US Center for SafeSport. \u201cFrom a policy standpoint, it\u2019s really hard to ... regulate romance. But you can certainly provide guidelines as to what is and isn\u2019t appropriate.\u201d But educating people about those guidelines is expensive. According to Hill, the Department of Justice gave the Center a three-year grant, totaling $2.5m for education and outreach.</p> <p>The media could also be more careful with how they talk about romantic relationships within pairs skating; in the past, it was certainly overemphasized. \u201cIf everyone involved from journalists to parents to coaches, sport officials, read, or look back at some of the historical coverage and see some of the romanticism that was given to the pairs matching process even or the romance between pairs through the lens of what we know today, I think that we would change some of the vocabulary and \u2026 maybe see it as less innocent and more, something that we should all be mindful of,\u201d Hill says.</p> <p>Though our conversation focused on pairs, Wagner stressed to me that these issues could be found across ice skating as a whole. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a problem that is just specific to pairs skating. This is a cultural issue in which everybody is kind of used to the social scene of skating,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The structural realities of the sport aren\u2019t, in and of themselves, evil. For example, that small women are common is certainly an aesthetic preference, to be sure, but it\u2019s also a result of gravity \u2013 a lighter skater is easier for her partner to lift. And the scarcity of men in the sport, can\u2019t be helped through policy and enforcement. But it\u2019s important to be aware of these structural problems and the potential they create for abuse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s about putting policies in place to make sure that those power imbalances are not allowed to develop</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hill, while not commenting specifically on the Coughlin case, says figuring out risk factors for each sport is an ongoing process. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at an organization or institutional culture, one of the first things you have to do is recognize where the power imbalances are,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd sometimes they\u2019re learned through the reporting structure when you start seeing a pattern of abuse or a certain type of report, that might alert you to a power imbalance that you didn\u2019t recognize or failed to know.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the scarcity of male pairs skaters in the sport didn\u2019t initially appear to be problematic but surely after the Coughlin allegations, it became \u2013 or should become \u2013 an area that requires increased scrutiny.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about training the individuals involved,\u201d Hill says. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting policies in place to make sure that those power imbalances are not allowed to develop into something that turns abusive.\u201d Hill doesn\u2019t specify what those exact policies should be, but he does point to SafeSport\u2019s minor participation policy as part of the remedy. One of the provisions stipulates that when athletes turn 18 they must adhere to the same policies as any other adult coach or administrator would when interacting with teammates 17 and below. This means things like no private texting or time spent one-on-one alone. But, the policy states, \u201cwith the exception of athletes who are members of the same team\u201d and 15 or older. It\u2019s unclear whether this policy would have been of any use in Coughlin\u2019s case, especially regarding the allegations from Namiotka.</p> <p>While it\u2019s one thing to create policies that protect athletes, it\u2019s quite another to educate people about those policies \u2013 and then implement them. Since opening its doors in 2017, SafeSport has been inundated by complaints about sexual misconduct and assault from athletes. And since there is no statute of limitations, a person can file a complaint about abuse that took place years, even decades ago. As has been frequently <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/safesport-the-usocs-attempt-to-stop-child-abuse-is-se-1826279217\">reported</a>, the Center does not have the budget to properly do the job that it has been tasked with.</p> <p>\u201cThe Center is on the record saying it needs more resources. The number of reports has grown to a number that is astonishing,\u201d Hill says. At present, according to Hill, the Center receives approximately 230 reports a month, a 600% increase over the monthly average from 2017. This caseload is managed by 24 employees. In an email, Hill said that by the end of 2020, they expect to have more than 40 employees managing the caseload.</p> <p>\u201cSafeSport is so wrapped up in wrapping up investigations that I don\u2019t think a ton of work has been done on the outreach and education,\u201d Xiao says. While investigating claims and issuing judgements is SafeSport\u2019s primary role, one could imagine that a lack of outreach to the sporting communities which it regulates hampers its ability to do its job well. One can also imagine that the tragic ending of the Coughlin case could have had a chilling effect on reports to the Center about sexual abuse. At the 2019 national figure skating championships, which started right after Coughlin\u2019s death, his friends and supporters were seen wearing red caps in his honor \u2013 Coughlin had been a Kansas City Chiefs fan \u2013 a move that some criticized as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/25870759/john-coughlin-suicide-leaves-more-questions-answers-figure-skating-community\">dismissing the allegations</a> against the skater. \u201cSitting back and watching the reactions to the events that transpired, I understand that it was confusing for a lot of people,\u201d Wagner says. \u201cThe thing that I found just unbelievably unacceptable was the reaction towards the victims who were brave enough to come forward.\u201d</p> <p>For Wagner, it\u2019s vital that skaters develop a life outside of the rink. \u201cI\u2019ve been working really closely with US Figure Skating to develop a curriculum that\u2019s focusing on helping athletes develop a social scene outside of the sport, just to take some of the pressure off of these competitions and parties,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Wagner\u2019s own skating career is proof of concept. \u201cI saw my most successful years in the sport when I had a balanced lifestyle,\u201d she says. It was during the latter, more balanced half of her career that Wagner won silver at the 2016 world championships, ending a 10-year medal drought for American women<strong>.</strong></p> <p>But even a robust social life outside of skating will not eliminate the fear of retaliation that skaters may have in coming forward, especially when the person you\u2019re supposed to report to is a judge or another official who could impact your career down the line. \u201cIf you have something bad happen to you at a competition, you are not going to tell the judge who\u2019s going to be on your panel at nationals that you were drinking and someone inappropriately came onto you,\u201d Wagner says.</p> <p>This is one of the changes that Wagner says US Figure Skating made in response to her allegations. \u201cThey immediately made the move to hire team leaders that are actually qualified to watch out for these athletes instead of just being international officials,\u201d she says.</p> <p>And what happens if the person you\u2019re accusing is your skating partner? Coming forward could ruin everything you have worked so hard for. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for a female athlete to say, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m just gonna put my head down and do the work I have to do because I\u2019m not gonna let this guy derail what I\u2019m doing,\u201d says Katherine Redmond, a victims advocate and founder of the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes.</p> <p>A year into the Coughlin case all we know is this: a young man is dead, his alleged victims are still hurting, and figure skating has only just started to examine itself and plan where to go from here.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "We are in the midst of a great reckoning around abuse in sports. Athletes \u2013 from Olympic champions to high school students \u2013 have come forward to detail harrowing accounts of the physical, sexual, and emotional abuse they have endured at the hands of coaches and how the very institutions set up to protect them have miserably failed to do their jobs. Most of the stories have focused on predatory coaches but less reported, and no less disturbing, are the cases in which athletes have been abused by their own teammates. One recent set of data released by attorney and campaigner Nancy Hogshead-Makar said that 23% of cases of athlete sexual abuse involved athlete-on-athlete abuse. \u201cWith coaches, you can put barriers in every stage, so concepts of recruitment, of background checks, and making education. All those, in theory, could apply to athletes but they don\u2019t really apply to athletes,\u201d says Daniel Rhind, a professor at Loughborough University whose research is primarily focused on safeguarding children in sport. \u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t socialize together, don\u2019t be alone together\u2019... In reality, athletes are in training camps in hotels, what have you. It\u2019s going to be very hard for them to implement such policies.\u201d Though different policies and safeguarding measures may need to be enacted in order to guard against athlete-on-athlete abuse, one feature remains consistent through all forms, be it coach-on-athlete, athlete-on-athlete, or administrator-on-athlete: a power imbalance. \u201cThey follow sort of a similar type of setup where there\u2019s some kind of power one athlete has over the other for some reason,\u201d Han Xiao, the chair of the Athlete Advisory Council, says. The imbalance can be the result of many different factors, including the athletic prowess of the abuser, age, or gender. \u201cIt may be that, you know, some athlete just has a lot of respect among the athlete community,\u201d says Xiao. John Coughlin checked almost all of those boxes. He was charismatic, well-respected, and a star in a sport where, at times, significant age differences between men and women are par for the course. Coughlin, a two-time US pairs champion, killed himself in January at the age of 33, a day after he received a suspension from the US Center for SafeSport and US Figure Skating for unspecified sexual misconduct (he denied the allegations before his death). While there is still much that is unknown about the case, it seems that at least some of the allegations stem from his time as an athlete. In the months following his death, two of his fellow skaters \u2013 Bridget Namiotka and Ashley Wagner \u2013 said he had sexually assaulted them. Namiotka said Coughlin, one of her former skating partners, had abused her over the course of two years. Wagner, an Olympic bronze medalist, told USA Today that Coughlin assaulted her when both were competitive skaters \u2013 she was 17 and he was 22 \u2013 while she slept after a party in Colorado Springs. SafeSport has refused to complete its investigation, citing the fact that Coughlin is dead and cannot be interviewed. The organization closed the case above the objections of US Figure Skating, which wanted SafeSport to continue with its investigation. But, as we shall see, there are aspects of pairs skating in particular and figure skating in general that make it particularly vulnerable to athlete-on-athlete abuse. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 Pairs skating isn\u2019t especially popular in the United States \u2013 the US hasn\u2019t experienced the success in the discipline as it has in singles skating and ice dance \u2013 so you\u2019d be forgiven for not having heard of Coughlin until his death made headlines. But Coughlin was a big deal in the world of American pairs skating. He was skilled, tall and charismatic. More importantly Coughlin was, as a man, a rare commodity in a discipline where female skaters struggle to find partners, a state of affairs due, in part, to both external and internalized homophobia. \u201cFor pairs girls, there are 100 girls for every one guy who wants a partner,\u201d Jessica Crenshaw, a pairs skater who competed for Greece, told the New York Times in 2010. \u201cTo be able to find a partner and to be able to compete in Europeans and go to worlds, it\u2019s actually almost a miracle.\u201d Whatever the reasons, it is undeniable that there are fewer male skaters than female, a fact that becomes even more consequential in partner events like pairs or ice dance.

Once, Coughlin came over to Kai\u2019s home to watch a movie. \u201cFor some reason that was OK with my parents,\u201d Kai says. With her mother in the other room, Coughlin started to touch her. \u201cHe just put his hand on my leg and then just started like, stroking his hand on my inner thigh. Just like started petting me during this movie.\u201d She adds: \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d And it\u2019s unlikely that anyone in Kai\u2019s social circle would have been able to help. Her friends were mostly other skaters who might be too afraid to say or do anything that could jeopardize their careers. \u201cEverything is kind of in play for you to not say anything,\u201d Rhind says. \u201cIt\u2019s a negative sweet spot.\u201d Then again, some of Kai\u2019s teammates may not have necessarily understood how problematic Coughlin\u2019s behavior was. \u201cA lot of athletes are homeschooled or don\u2019t have traditional educational experiences. So your social pool is limited to the kids at your rink, which makes it a very small social pool,\u201d Wagner says. \u201cYou go to skating parties and you are really young and there are guys there a lot older and can even legally drink at the same party. And so it\u2019s just this really odd social environment that these athletes find themselves in, which leads to this crazy power imbalance.\u201d Wagner went into great detail about the specifics of skating\u2019s social scene, particularly around age, when she came forward about Coughlin\u2019s assault. She said she was motivated to speak out because of 13-year-old Alysa Liu\u2019s win at the 2019 national championships. Wagner was concerned about someone as young as Liu being in a social environment that she was too young to handle. As Wagner noted, in skating, as in many other elite sports, your skill, not your age, dictate your social circle. Romance can also cause problems. It is not uncommon for partners to date and even marry each other. Perhaps the most famous pairs couple in history, the double Olympic champions Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov, were 11 and 15 respectively when they first started skating together. When the pair returned to Olympic competition in 1994 after their marriage and the birth of their daughter, the media played up their romantic relationship almost as much as their technical skill. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen so many so many beautiful relationships blossom out of this sport,\u201d Wagner says. \u201cBut that\u2019s where it can get really confusing for a younger athlete, because you do have all of these romantic success stories to draw inspiration from and it\u2019s taken out of context, it can be really confusing and misleading for a young athlete.\u201d The solution, if there even is one, is not to ban relationships between partners who are of legal age and can consent. \u201cSome of these topics that are tougher are addressed in some of the training that\u2019s available,\u201d says Dan Hill, a spokesperson for the US Center for SafeSport. \u201cFrom a policy standpoint, it\u2019s really hard to ... regulate romance. But you can certainly provide guidelines as to what is and isn\u2019t appropriate.\u201d But educating people about those guidelines is expensive. According to Hill, the Department of Justice gave the Center a three-year grant, totaling $2.5m for education and outreach. The media could also be more careful with how they talk about romantic relationships within pairs skating; in the past, it was certainly overemphasized. \u201cIf everyone involved from journalists to parents to coaches, sport officials, read, or look back at some of the historical coverage and see some of the romanticism that was given to the pairs matching process even or the romance between pairs through the lens of what we know today, I think that we would change some of the vocabulary and \u2026 maybe see it as less innocent and more, something that we should all be mindful of,\u201d Hill says. Though our conversation focused on pairs, Wagner stressed to me that these issues could be found across ice skating as a whole. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a problem that is just specific to pairs skating. This is a cultural issue in which everybody is kind of used to the social scene of skating,\u201d she says. The structural realities of the sport aren\u2019t, in and of themselves, evil. For example, that small women are common is certainly an aesthetic preference, to be sure, but it\u2019s also a result of gravity \u2013 a lighter skater is easier for her partner to lift. And the scarcity of men in the sport, can\u2019t be helped through policy and enforcement. But it\u2019s important to be aware of these structural problems and the potential they create for abuse. Hill, while not commenting specifically on the Coughlin case, says figuring out risk factors for each sport is an ongoing process. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at an organization or institutional culture, one of the first things you have to do is recognize where the power imbalances are,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd sometimes they\u2019re learned through the reporting structure when you start seeing a pattern of abuse or a certain type of report, that might alert you to a power imbalance that you didn\u2019t recognize or failed to know.\u201d Perhaps the scarcity of male pairs skaters in the sport didn\u2019t initially appear to be problematic but surely after the Coughlin allegations, it became \u2013 or should become \u2013 an area that requires increased scrutiny. \u201cIt\u2019s about training the individuals involved,\u201d Hill says. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting policies in place to make sure that those power imbalances are not allowed to develop into something that turns abusive.\u201d Hill doesn\u2019t specify what those exact policies should be, but he does point to SafeSport\u2019s minor participation policy as part of the remedy. One of the provisions stipulates that when athletes turn 18 they must adhere to the same policies as any other adult coach or administrator would when interacting with teammates 17 and below. This means things like no private texting or time spent one-on-one alone. But, the policy states, \u201cwith the exception of athletes who are members of the same team\u201d and 15 or older. It\u2019s unclear whether this policy would have been of any use in Coughlin\u2019s case, especially regarding the allegations from Namiotka. While it\u2019s one thing to create policies that protect athletes, it\u2019s quite another to educate people about those policies \u2013 and then implement them. Since opening its doors in 2017, SafeSport has been inundated by complaints about sexual misconduct and assault from athletes. And since there is no statute of limitations, a person can file a complaint about abuse that took place years, even decades ago. As has been frequently reported, the Center does not have the budget to properly do the job that it has been tasked with. \u201cThe Center is on the record saying it needs more resources. The number of reports has grown to a number that is astonishing,\u201d Hill says. At present, according to Hill, the Center receives approximately 230 reports a month, a 600% increase over the monthly average from 2017. This caseload is managed by 24 employees. In an email, Hill said that by the end of 2020, they expect to have more than 40 employees managing the caseload. \u201cSafeSport is so wrapped up in wrapping up investigations that I don\u2019t think a ton of work has been done on the outreach and education,\u201d Xiao says. While investigating claims and issuing judgements is SafeSport\u2019s primary role, one could imagine that a lack of outreach to the sporting communities which it regulates hampers its ability to do its job well. One can also imagine that the tragic ending of the Coughlin case could have had a chilling effect on reports to the Center about sexual abuse. At the 2019 national figure skating championships, which started right after Coughlin\u2019s death, his friends and supporters were seen wearing red caps in his honor \u2013 Coughlin had been a Kansas City Chiefs fan \u2013 a move that some criticized as dismissing the allegations against the skater. \u201cSitting back and watching the reactions to the events that transpired, I understand that it was confusing for a lot of people,\u201d Wagner says. \u201cThe thing that I found just unbelievably unacceptable was the reaction towards the victims who were brave enough to come forward.\u201d For Wagner, it\u2019s vital that skaters develop a life outside of the rink. \u201cI\u2019ve been working really closely with US Figure Skating to develop a curriculum that\u2019s focusing on helping athletes develop a social scene outside of the sport, just to take some of the pressure off of these competitions and parties,\u201d she says. Wagner\u2019s own skating career is proof of concept. \u201cI saw my most successful years in the sport when I had a balanced lifestyle,\u201d she says. It was during the latter, more balanced half of her career that Wagner won silver at the 2016 world championships, ending a 10-year medal drought for American women. But even a robust social life outside of skating will not eliminate the fear of retaliation that skaters may have in coming forward, especially when the person you\u2019re supposed to report to is a judge or another official who could impact your career down the line. \u201cIf you have something bad happen to you at a competition, you are not going to tell the judge who\u2019s going to be on your panel at nationals that you were drinking and someone inappropriately came onto you,\u201d Wagner says. This is one of the changes that Wagner says US Figure Skating made in response to her allegations. \u201cThey immediately made the move to hire team leaders that are actually qualified to watch out for these athletes instead of just being international officials,\u201d she says. And what happens if the person you\u2019re accusing is your skating partner? Coming forward could ruin everything you have worked so hard for. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for a female athlete to say, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m just gonna put my head down and do the work I have to do because I\u2019m not gonna let this guy derail what I\u2019m doing,\u201d says Katherine Redmond, a victims advocate and founder of the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes. A year into the Coughlin case all we know is this: a young man is dead, his alleged victims are still hurting, and figure skating has only just started to examine itself and plan where to go from here.",

Lyra\u2019s adventures continue in the complex and detailed worlds Pullman has created. Beautifully written, the story brings you to tears.

The Swedish professor of literature outlines his philosophy of life using literary memoirs by Augustine, Proust and Knausgaard as sources. He claims that true freedom is about how we choose to spend our limited time while we are alive; contrasting this with religious ideas of an eternal afterlife that undermine the value we place on this life \u2026 Given the climate emergency, and the failure of capitalism to respond quickly enough, the time seems ripe for a radical rethink of how we live. <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10493280\">rgilyead</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"354086293c1ea4928d5556e6968afda4f4984539\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/354086293c1ea4928d5556e6968afda4f4984539/175_433_6825_4094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hallie Rubenhold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Historian Hallie Rubenhold, author of The Five.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No trouble making a choice this year: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/13/the-five-by-hallie-rubenhold-review-the-untold-lives-of-the-rippers-victims\">The Five</a> by Hallie Rubenhold (Doubleday)</strong>. It\u2019s a remarkable, well researched and readable book about the lives of the five known victims of Jack the Ripper. It was more than time that those women were shown some respect as human beings. So much has been written about the murderer\u2019s possible identity and the victims have been sidelined for too long.

      "bodyText": "I immensely enjoyed almost all books that I read from this year. By far, Deborah Levy\u2019s The Man Who Saw Everything (Hamish Hamilton) was my favourite. Very close behind was Ann Patchett\u2019s The Dutch House (Bloomsbury), which I picked after reading Cardellina\u2019s enthusiastic comments. I\u2019m so grateful for it because I absolutely loved it \u2026 a stunning novel. VesnaD13 The second book in Philip Pullman\u2019s Book of Dust trilogy, The Secret Commonwealth (Penguin/David Fickling) picks up the story of Lyra, her daemon Pantalaimon, Malcolm and others 20 years after Lord Asriel left Lyra at Jordan College under \u201cscholastic sanctuary\u201d. Lyra\u2019s adventures continue in the complex and detailed worlds Pullman has created. Beautifully written, the story brings you to tears. Eagerly anticipating the third book. IsisWalnut This Life by Martin H\u00e4gglund (Profile) challenged my beliefs. The Swedish professor of literature outlines his philosophy of life using literary memoirs by Augustine, Proust and Knausgaard as sources. He claims that true freedom is about how we choose to spend our limited time while we are alive; contrasting this with religious ideas of an eternal afterlife that undermine the value we place on this life \u2026 Given the climate emergency, and the failure of capitalism to respond quickly enough, the time seems ripe for a radical rethink of how we live. rgilyead No trouble making a choice this year: The Five by Hallie Rubenhold (Doubleday). It\u2019s a remarkable, well researched and readable book about the lives of the five known victims of Jack the Ripper. It was more than time that those women were shown some respect as human beings. So much has been written about the murderer\u2019s possible identity and the victims have been sidelined for too long. I recommend this book to anyone. Maggie B As someone who grew up on dance music and club culture in the late 80s/early 90s, my book of the year is Join the Future: Bleep Techno and The Birth of British Bass Music by Matt Anniss (Velocity Press). Really well written and comprehensively sets the sociopolitical backdrop in Yorkshire to the most exciting five years or so in the development of British dance music.

MrBrown Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk (translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones, Fitzcarraldo). Strange and unusual, it draws you in with its flat, brilliant sentences and brings up in a fresh, sideways fashion some crucial ideas: connection to the larger-than-human natural world; the nature of authority; economic venality; how do we know anything? (For those who might have missed it, she\u2019s the Polish writer who won the 2018 Nobel prize in literature, which I now think was an inspired choice.) cannotlookaway Since I tend to read either library books or secondhand ones, my reading list is a bit short on the latest bestsellers \u2013 my principle usually being if it deserves to be read it will still be good reading a year (or 20) later.

Not everyone may share my enthusiasm for long discussions on modern architecture as voiced by the characters, or musings on feminism. But those interested will enjoy it. CloudyAgain I read The Fell by Robert Jenkins (RedDoor Press) twice. Once as an all-nighter and again slowly to really appreciate the beauty and simplicity of language as we follow the teenage narrator descend into dark and magical places. The bonding and rebelliousness of the urban tribe, the love and loss, the dislocation and abandonment but ultimately the triumph and sheer delight in chaos. It saved my life and it genuinely feels like something very special has been overlooked in this book not getting mass coverage.

In the </strong><strong>past </strong><strong>eight months, due to my mental health, I haven\u2019t been interested in</strong><strong> sex, which </strong><strong>has taken its toll on our relationship. For the </strong><strong>past </strong><strong>two months I have been trying to reintroduce sex </strong><strong> </strong><strong>but now </strong><strong>he lacks </strong><strong>interest</strong><strong> and isn\u2019t sure why</strong><strong>. We are very physically affectionate and happy, </strong><strong> but I\u2019m worried that </strong><strong>our mismatch of interest could become a problem.</strong> </p> <p>All relationships undergo changes in equilibrium from time to time, and since sex is an expression of the partnership, one would expect that to reflect those changes. When one partner struggles with health issues, either physiological or psychological, it is common for the other partner to become \u2013 or at least feel like \u2013 a caretaker, and that can diminish shared eroticism at least temporarily. Caretaking involves assuming a familial role of nursing, advising, nurturing or advocating for the patient, and it often leaves the caretaker feeling worried, stressed and even overwhelmed. Often, the caretaker\u2019s own needs are set aside in favour of maintaining focus on the patient. Your partner needs time to adjust to the change back to his original role. He may need you to show him that you are now strong enough to be able to care for him, too. Most importantly, you need to focus on any mechanism you might have previously used in order to feel attractive, and to summon your seductive power.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve been with my partner for about a year and a half. In the past eight months, due to my mental health, I haven\u2019t been interested in sex, which has taken its toll on our relationship. For the past two months I have been trying to reintroduce sex but now he lacks interest and isn\u2019t sure why. We are very physically affectionate and happy, but I\u2019m worried that our mismatch of interest could become a problem. All relationships undergo changes in equilibrium from time to time, and since sex is an expression of the partnership, one would expect that to reflect those changes. When one partner struggles with health issues, either physiological or psychological, it is common for the other partner to become \u2013 or at least feel like \u2013 a caretaker, and that can diminish shared eroticism at least temporarily. Caretaking involves assuming a familial role of nursing, advising, nurturing or advocating for the patient, and it often leaves the caretaker feeling worried, stressed and even overwhelmed. Often, the caretaker\u2019s own needs are set aside in favour of maintaining focus on the patient. Your partner needs time to adjust to the change back to his original role. He may need you to show him that you are now strong enough to be able to care for him, too. Most importantly, you need to focus on any mechanism you might have previously used in order to feel attractive, and to summon your seductive power. But don\u2019t expect sex to return to perfection immediately; it will just take a little time. \u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).

Next Monday, 23 December, his school will reopen and the teachers and support staff will return, unpaid, to organise a huge \u201cChristmas Eve Eve\u201d party for the 350 pupils and their families.

Other challenges are the urgent need to improve the provision for children with disabilities and special educational needs, teacher shortages, tackling poor classroom discipline, reducing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/18/more-than-49000-pupils-disappeared-from-schools-study\" title=\"\">exclusions</a>, and the need to reform the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/sep/25/headteachers-petition-downing-street-budget-cuts\" title=\"\">unfair funding</a> system that allocates between 50% and 70% more \u201cper pupil funding\u201d to some parts of the country than others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a7f782f7c43827ae563e51974de99a7bc032990\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a7f782f7c43827ae563e51974de99a7bc032990/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Dyson and Parklands children preparing for Christmas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Dyson and Parklands children preparing for Christmas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over in Blackpool, Stephen Tierney, executive director of a small multi-academy trust consisting of St Mary\u2019s, a Catholic secondary school, and two primary schools, Christ the King and St Cuthbert\u2019s, says schools have become \u201cthe fourth emergency service\u201d for families in crisis \u2013 because there is nothing else. The trust\u2019s primary schools will open for five days during the Christmas break to provide shelter, food and warmth for vulnerable pupils.

Children are going back to homes with no carpets, no heating, no food in the fridge, the place is cold, it is not in great repair, and Christmas will be about surviving.

That is where schools come in. Should we have to? No, but if we don\u2019t, then who will?\u201d</p> <p>Tierney\u2019s staff are volunteering to come in without pay, and local organisations are providing food at no cost. Unless children get help, \u201cwhat will they eat this Christmas?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cThe boxes will be going out and they are not what you would expect in a Christmas hamper \u2013 they will have staples such as pasta and rice and tinned tomatoes, because Christmas is survival for these families, not a bonus.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Leeds, the most expensive gifts are matched to those most in need. The reality of survival on the Seacroft estate kicks in, however. \u201cThe last three bikes we gave away ended up on eBay within hours,\u201d says Dyson sadly. </p> <p>The headteachers are not exaggerating.

We are coping with challenges around anxiety about school, as the curriculum has become more academic, plus pressures from home. That manifests in a higher level of eating disorders and self-harm.\u201d </p> <p>Fairer funding is top of Antiss\u2019s Santa wishlist, as he struggles to afford enough specialist teachers and is having to cut down on teaching assistant numbers. Schools in West Sussex are the 10th-worst funded of England\u2019s 152 local education authorities, because of a per-pupil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/08/schools-national-funding-formula-worse-off-headteachers-survey\" title=\"\">funding formula</a> that awards pupils more in some authorities than in others.</p> <p>Antiss points out that a similarly sized school in Hackney, east London, gets 70% more for each pupil than his school does.

      "bodyText": "Sammy will wake up on Christmas morning with little hope of a visit from Santa. He didn\u2019t get a present last Christmas and it is unlikely he will get one this year, because his mother struggles just to put food on the table. But it is not all gloom for the lively eight-year-old. Next Monday, 23 December, his school will reopen and the teachers and support staff will return, unpaid, to organise a huge \u201cChristmas Eve Eve\u201d party for the 350 pupils and their families. Kitchen staff will serve 800 Christmas dinners and each child will see Santa and get to unwrap a present bought by the school with money donated by businesses. \u201cWe\u2019re having unicorns and that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to, as well as Santa and the dancing,\u201d he says. Sammy is a pupil at Parklands primary school in Leeds, which serves one of the biggest council estates in England, an area in the top 1% in England for deprivation. Only a third of working-age adults have jobs and three-quarters of pupils qualify for the pupil premium, the extra money given to schools to support the poorest children. Chris Dyson, its headteacher, says Christmas can be a confusing time for some children. \u201cThey see everyone making Santa lists and yet they don\u2019t get anything they asked for,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have children here who don\u2019t get a present at Christmas or on their birthdays. When I came here five years ago I found very few children had been to see Santa. It broke my heart. I wanted to give them a dream, a hope, and show how invested I am in them, even in holiday times.\u201d Headteachers say that supporting families living in long-term poverty and finding help for children with mental health and welfare issues are among the biggest challenges they will face in 2020. Other challenges are the urgent need to improve the provision for children with disabilities and special educational needs, teacher shortages, tackling poor classroom discipline, reducing exclusions, and the need to reform the unfair funding system that allocates between 50% and 70% more \u201cper pupil funding\u201d to some parts of the country than others. Over in Blackpool, Stephen Tierney, executive director of a small multi-academy trust consisting of St Mary\u2019s, a Catholic secondary school, and two primary schools, Christ the King and St Cuthbert\u2019s, says schools have become \u201cthe fourth emergency service\u201d for families in crisis \u2013 because there is nothing else. The trust\u2019s primary schools will open for five days during the Christmas break to provide shelter, food and warmth for vulnerable pupils. This week they are giving out hampers, funded by a charity appeal. \u201cA decade ago schools wouldn\u2019t have had to do it, but we have had 10 years of austerity. There are consequences for those at the bottom who are bearing the brunt,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking for some of our families. Children are going back to homes with no carpets, no heating, no food in the fridge, the place is cold, it is not in great repair, and Christmas will be about surviving. We were thinking of providing the ingredients for a Christmas lunch \u2013 but then some homes won\u2019t have enough money for fuel to cook it and some don\u2019t even have an oven. \u201cHeads in Blackpool will tell you stories of family after family who make it clear there is no money for Christmas presents this year and there were no presents last year,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is hard to comprehend the hopelessness these parents feel. That is where schools come in. Should we have to? No, but if we don\u2019t, then who will?\u201d Tierney\u2019s staff are volunteering to come in without pay, and local organisations are providing food at no cost. Unless children get help, \u201cwhat will they eat this Christmas?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe boxes will be going out and they are not what you would expect in a Christmas hamper \u2013 they will have staples such as pasta and rice and tinned tomatoes, because Christmas is survival for these families, not a bonus.\u201d Back in Leeds, the most expensive gifts are matched to those most in need. The reality of survival on the Seacroft estate kicks in, however. \u201cThe last three bikes we gave away ended up on eBay within hours,\u201d says Dyson sadly. The headteachers are not exaggerating. Official statistics from the Department for Work and Pensions for 2017-18 show an increase to nearly one in eight \u2013 12% \u2013 of children living in low-income homes and suffering severe material deprivation. The finding is based on a survey of whether households can afford things such as a warm winter coat, celebrations on special occasions, and separate bedrooms for children of different genders over the age of 10. Families living in poverty are more likely to suffer breakdown, ill health and mental health issues, but headteachers in more affluent areas of the country say they, too, are having to provide welfare services that were once supplied by local authorities and the health service. Mark Anstiss, headteacher of Felpham Community College, near Bognor Regis, in West Sussex, says teachers are coping with an increase in the number of children with mental health issues \u2013 on stretched budgets that, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, have gone down by 8% in real terms since 2010. \u201cWe are a typical comprehensive school in terms of socio-economic profile and ability intake and we are seeing a big increase in challenging behaviour and students with emotional health issues coming up from primary school,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s partly to do with changes in society but also because of the loss of help and support from local authorities. We are coping with challenges around anxiety about school, as the curriculum has become more academic, plus pressures from home. That manifests in a higher level of eating disorders and self-harm.\u201d Fairer funding is top of Antiss\u2019s Santa wishlist, as he struggles to afford enough specialist teachers and is having to cut down on teaching assistant numbers. Schools in West Sussex are the 10th-worst funded of England\u2019s 152 local education authorities, because of a per-pupil funding formula that awards pupils more in some authorities than in others. Antiss points out that a similarly sized school in Hackney, east London, gets 70% more for each pupil than his school does. That is more than \u00a33m a year lost to the education of his students in West Sussex. Phillip Potter, head of Oak Grove college, a special school for 11- to 19-year-olds in Worthing, West Sussex, says funding to provide higher salaries for teaching assistants, the \u201cunsung heroes\u201d of special education, is at the top of his letter to Santa. He says he is struggling to buy essential mobility equipment for his high-needs students. \u201cMy dream for 2020 is that the high-needs block will be funded properly and there will be an integrated health, social care and education system to deliver joined-up services for our most vulnerable youngsters, without having to have arguments about who will pay and take things to what feels like 400 panels to get agreement,\u201d he says. While headteachers all have a long list for Santa, they are likely to agree on one thing. \u201cEvery teacher\u2019s dream is that politicians keep out of education,\u201d says Potter. \u201cWe don\u2019t tell doctors how to do heart surgery, so let 2020 be the year that politicians stop telling us how to teach and give us the resources.\u201d Back at Dyson\u2019s school in Leeds, money is not the problem, however. \u201cI raised \u00a3350,000 last year from businesses and have just secured \u00a3150,000 to open the school at February half term, and in the Easter and summer holidays,\u201d he says. Through the extra funds he has been able to employ more teaching assistants to give one-to-one support to the most vulnerable students, reduce class sizes and buy in support from specialists for conditions such as dyslexia. He has concerns about what is happening in education generally, however, particularly over discipline and the number of children other schools are excluding. When he arrived at Parklands, more than 150 children a year were being excluded; now it is down to one \u2013 and that is one too many for Dyson. \u201cI\u2019ve started to take children excluded from other schools to give them a chance,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve built this school on love. I\u2019ve banned teachers shouting at children, I\u2019ve got rid of the dreaded padded isolation cell, played music and given children respect.\u201d He is concerned about the current \u201cwarm-strict\u201d approach to discipline coming from the Department for Education and its behaviour tsar, Tom Bennett, who has defended a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d approach to behaviour and the creation of centralised detention systems and internal inclusion units. \u201cThat way of thinking is that the only way to sort out discipline is to exclude them, to put them in isolation, ban them and put them in boot camps. No! You can do it another way,\u201d Dyson says. \u201c\u2018Warm-strict\u2019 is having lots of rules but trying to put a warm spin on it by saying that as long as your discipline is strong and tough, you can afford to smile at children.\u201d Dyson, a father of three, says he is not afraid to hug children. \u201cWe are a huggy school; if children are upset we give them a hug.\u201d The school is a happy place where children are allowed to wear trainers and joggers, and are not told how to wear their hair. Travis, a pupil excluded from another primary school for violence, appears now to be a model student. \u201cDon\u2019t run in the corridor because you might knock over someone who is disabled,\u201d he warns some younger students. \u201cOpen the door for visitors,\u201d he tells a girl who pushes past.

Bannon left the administration in 2017 after playing a key role in the US president\u2019s equivocation over a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/04/charlottesville-viginia-one-year-on-violence-far-right\">deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia</a>, which was widely condemned, but remains influential.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve turned the Republican party into a working-class party,\u201d said Bannon, relaxing at a table with an autographed photo of Trump behind him. \u201cNow, interestingly, we don\u2019t have any elected representatives who believe that, but that\u2019s a legacy issue. We\u2019ll get over that. We\u2019ve got to find our AOCs.\u201d</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez, a 30-year-old former bartender from New York, was elected to Congress last year and has built a huge social media following as a member of \u201cthe Squad\u201d, a group of four progressive women of colour. Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/16/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-2020-endorsement-democrats\">eagerly sought presidential endorsement</a> went to fellow progressive senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.</p> <p>The Democrats and their supporters have \u201cbetter casting\u201d, Bannon admitted. \u201cThey did an amazing job in 18. I keep saying I admire AOC. I think her ideology\u2019s all fucked up, but I want her. I want to recruit bartenders. I don\u2019t want to recruit any more lawyers. I want bartenders.\u201d</p> <p>Congressional Republicans are dominated by ageing white men from comfortable backgrounds. Among Democrats, Bannon also pointed to military veterans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/25/staten-island-max-rose-republican-democrat-midterms\">Max Rose of New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/04/democrats-inspired-by-trump-to-run-for-office-hillary-clinton\">Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey</a>, both elected as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/06/midterm-elections-2018-exit-polls-voters\">the party swept the House of Representatives in 2018</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect casting. That\u2019s why we got smoked.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats were boosted in the midterms by Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who spent $110m through his own political action committee. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-democrats-donate.html\">An impressive 21 of the 24 candidates</a> he supported won their races. Bloomberg is now also running for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 US election.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>People are missing the point about Bloomberg,\u201d said Bannon, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/us/politics/steve-bannon-trump-war-room-radio.html\">who co-hosts a radio programme</a> about Trump\u2019s impeachment called War Room. \u201cTrump wouldn\u2019t be impeached if it were not for Bloomberg. It\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s hundred million dollars that won the seats \u2026 The Democrat party is just like Republicans: a pass through. There\u2019s no actual people to do anything. They\u2019re not out in any state ringing doorbells. Those activist groups are. That\u2019s where Bloomberg put his hundred million dollars.\u201d</p> <p>In a second interview by phone last week, Bannon drew parallels with the British general election, in which Conservative Boris Johnson trounced Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, accused of failing to stamp out antisemitism in the party. Johnson took a wrecking ball to a \u201cred wall\u201d in traditional working-class areas, just as Trump broke through the \u201cblue wall\u201d in midwestern states in the 2016 election.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a victory for populism,\u201d Bannon said, \u201cObviously radical economic ideas and socialism and more government involvement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/concerns-about-antisemitism-mean-we-cannot-vote-labour\">coupled with virulent antisemitism,</a> is not a winning ticket. I believe the Democratic party here, particularly on the far left \u2013 the Squad, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders \u2013 should embrace the lessons because I don\u2019t believe it was just Corbyn\u2019s personality.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cObviously Corbyn had issues, a personality that seemed to rub people the wrong way, particularly some of his core voters, but this is much deeper than that and you just can\u2019t just turn it off to \u2018one guy was more popular than the other\u2019. This was, I think, a very serious vote and people paid a lot of attention to this and wanted to get Brexit done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4dff55da766765bf85dcf5c13552db75be92bbef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dff55da766765bf85dcf5c13552db75be92bbef/0_73_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I don\u2019t believe it was just Corbyn\u2019s personality.

People really voted for Brexit.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bannon said he was fascinated by focus groups he saw on British TV during the election campaign. \u201cThese were Labour voters and they were not going to vote for Labour and the reason was they kept asking, \u2018How are these programmes going to be paid for?\u2019 What I was most impressed with was the specificity and the granularity of the questions.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be spun any more. They don\u2019t want to be BS\u2019d any more. They want to know what you\u2019re laying out and how you\u2019re going to effectuate it and, most importantly, how you\u2019re going to pay for it and \u2018if paying for it means more increased taxes or less opportunities for me, you\u2019re not going to get my vote no matter how good it sounds\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI think the Democrats, on whether it\u2019s Green New Deal or healthcare for illegal aliens or whatever, ought to take the lessons of the working class. These are lifetime Labour members that voted for a Tory.\u201d</p> <p>Bannon regards Johnson as neither a nationalist nor a populist and likens the prime minister\u2019s vision of Brexit to \u201cSingapore-on-the-Thames\u201d \u2013 very different from the version hoped for by those who voted for him. Even so, Bannon argues that both the Conservatives and Republicans should aim to seize their traditional rivals\u2019 territory by appealing to the working class.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/opinion/sunday/steve-bannon-agenda.html\">Critics say Bannon</a> is an ardent nationalist, nihilist and attention seeker hellbent on disrupting and destroying the political establishment. He suggests his desire to transform the Republican party as a working-class force stems from a worldview that pitches the elites against the so-called \u201cdeplorables\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\">a term based on a comment by Hillary Clinton that</a> was widely seen as an insult to long-disparaged and forgotten people.</p> <p>\u201cMy whole theory on the right is that we if we want capitalism to survive, we need to make people capitalist. The problem is they\u2019re not capitalists. We have oligarchs and serfs. That system is not going to survive. I tell the donors, you may hate me, but all <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/07/16/donald-trump-paul-ryan-feud-227360\">your Paul Ryan bullshit</a> at the Heritage Foundation can\u2019t win national elections. He can\u2019t win Wisconsin, OK? Donald Trump can.\u201d</p> <p>Trump and Bannon\u2019s claims to champion workers have run into credibility problems. Two years ago the president passed a $1.5tn bill that slashed taxes for corporations and the rich, including himself and members of his cabinet.

Bannon, who has worked with openly racist far-right leaders across Europe, denies that racial resentment is central to the resurgent populism \u2013 even though <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/hate-crimes-fbi-report.html\">the FBI reported last month</a> that personal attacks motivated by bias or prejudice have reached a 16-year high, with a sharp increase in violence against Latino people.</p> <p>Recalling the Brexit referendum of 2016, Bannon said: \u201cAs soon as we won in London at the end of June, I kept saying this is a lock for Trump, we\u2019ve just got to drive the same topics. That\u2019s why, when I took over the campaign, it was let\u2019s get back to some basics: stop mass illegal immigration, limit legal immigration, protect your workers. Why do you think Trump today is at 34% approval rating in the Emerson polls among blacks and 36% among Hispanics?

      "bodyText": "Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist associated with global far-right nationalist movements, has urged Republicans to \u201cfind our AOCs\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 to claim the mantle of the party of the working class. In an interview with the Guardian at his Capitol Hill townhouse, Bannon, who helped shape the party in Donald Trump\u2019s image, argued that Republicans have to fight back against the \u201cperfect casting\u201d of Democrats elected to Congress last year by boosting equivalents from their own ranks. The combative 66-year-old is the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, which he once described as \u201cthe platform of the \u2018alt-right\u2019\u201d, a movement that has embraced racism and antisemitism, and an ex-chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s divisive 2016 election campaign. His transition to a senior role at the White House was hailed as \u201cexcellent\u201d by the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and \u201camazing\u201d by Peter Brimelow of the white nationalist site VDAR. Bannon left the administration in 2017 after playing a key role in the US president\u2019s equivocation over a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which was widely condemned, but remains influential. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned the Republican party into a working-class party,\u201d said Bannon, relaxing at a table with an autographed photo of Trump behind him. \u201cNow, interestingly, we don\u2019t have any elected representatives who believe that, but that\u2019s a legacy issue. We\u2019ll get over that. We\u2019ve got to find our AOCs.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, a 30-year-old former bartender from New York, was elected to Congress last year and has built a huge social media following as a member of \u201cthe Squad\u201d, a group of four progressive women of colour. Her eagerly sought presidential endorsement went to fellow progressive senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The Democrats and their supporters have \u201cbetter casting\u201d, Bannon admitted. \u201cThey did an amazing job in 18. I keep saying I admire AOC. I think her ideology\u2019s all fucked up, but I want her. I want to recruit bartenders. I don\u2019t want to recruit any more lawyers. I want bartenders.\u201d Congressional Republicans are dominated by ageing white men from comfortable backgrounds. Among Democrats, Bannon also pointed to military veterans such as Max Rose of New York and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, both elected as the party swept the House of Representatives in 2018. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect casting. That\u2019s why we got smoked.\u201d Democrats were boosted in the midterms by Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who spent $110m through his own political action committee. An impressive 21 of the 24 candidates he supported won their races. Bloomberg is now also running for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 US election. \u201cPeople are missing the point about Bloomberg,\u201d said Bannon, who co-hosts a radio programme about Trump\u2019s impeachment called War Room. \u201cTrump wouldn\u2019t be impeached if it were not for Bloomberg. It\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s hundred million dollars that won the seats \u2026 The Democrat party is just like Republicans: a pass through. There\u2019s no actual people to do anything. They\u2019re not out in any state ringing doorbells. Those activist groups are. That\u2019s where Bloomberg put his hundred million dollars.\u201d In a second interview by phone last week, Bannon drew parallels with the British general election, in which Conservative Boris Johnson trounced Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, accused of failing to stamp out antisemitism in the party. Johnson took a wrecking ball to a \u201cred wall\u201d in traditional working-class areas, just as Trump broke through the \u201cblue wall\u201d in midwestern states in the 2016 election. \u201cI think it\u2019s a victory for populism,\u201d Bannon said, \u201cObviously radical economic ideas and socialism and more government involvement, coupled with virulent antisemitism, is not a winning ticket. I believe the Democratic party here, particularly on the far left \u2013 the Squad, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders \u2013 should embrace the lessons because I don\u2019t believe it was just Corbyn\u2019s personality.\u201d He added: \u201cObviously Corbyn had issues, a personality that seemed to rub people the wrong way, particularly some of his core voters, but this is much deeper than that and you just can\u2019t just turn it off to \u2018one guy was more popular than the other\u2019. This was, I think, a very serious vote and people paid a lot of attention to this and wanted to get Brexit done.\u201d Bannon said he was fascinated by focus groups he saw on British TV during the election campaign. \u201cThese were Labour voters and they were not going to vote for Labour and the reason was they kept asking, \u2018How are these programmes going to be paid for?\u2019 What I was most impressed with was the specificity and the granularity of the questions. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be spun any more. They don\u2019t want to be BS\u2019d any more. They want to know what you\u2019re laying out and how you\u2019re going to effectuate it and, most importantly, how you\u2019re going to pay for it and \u2018if paying for it means more increased taxes or less opportunities for me, you\u2019re not going to get my vote no matter how good it sounds\u2019.\u201d He added: \u201cI think the Democrats, on whether it\u2019s Green New Deal or healthcare for illegal aliens or whatever, ought to take the lessons of the working class. These are lifetime Labour members that voted for a Tory.\u201d Bannon regards Johnson as neither a nationalist nor a populist and likens the prime minister\u2019s vision of Brexit to \u201cSingapore-on-the-Thames\u201d \u2013 very different from the version hoped for by those who voted for him. Even so, Bannon argues that both the Conservatives and Republicans should aim to seize their traditional rivals\u2019 territory by appealing to the working class. Critics say Bannon is an ardent nationalist, nihilist and attention seeker hellbent on disrupting and destroying the political establishment. He suggests his desire to transform the Republican party as a working-class force stems from a worldview that pitches the elites against the so-called \u201cdeplorables\u201d, a term based on a comment by Hillary Clinton that was widely seen as an insult to long-disparaged and forgotten people. \u201cMy whole theory on the right is that we if we want capitalism to survive, we need to make people capitalist. The problem is they\u2019re not capitalists. We have oligarchs and serfs. That system is not going to survive. I tell the donors, you may hate me, but all your Paul Ryan bullshit at the Heritage Foundation can\u2019t win national elections. He can\u2019t win Wisconsin, OK? Donald Trump can.\u201d Trump and Bannon\u2019s claims to champion workers have run into credibility problems. Two years ago the president passed a $1.5tn bill that slashed taxes for corporations and the rich, including himself and members of his cabinet. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a thinktank in Washington, said 80% of the tax cuts would wind up in the pockets of the top 1% while the middle class continued to struggle. The White House adviser Stephen Miller, a white nationalist, told Bannon in a 2016 radio interview that America could be \u201cdecimated\u201d by immigration and lose its sovereignty. Bannon, who has worked with openly racist far-right leaders across Europe, denies that racial resentment is central to the resurgent populism \u2013 even though the FBI reported last month that personal attacks motivated by bias or prejudice have reached a 16-year high, with a sharp increase in violence against Latino people. Recalling the Brexit referendum of 2016, Bannon said: \u201cAs soon as we won in London at the end of June, I kept saying this is a lock for Trump, we\u2019ve just got to drive the same topics. That\u2019s why, when I took over the campaign, it was let\u2019s get back to some basics: stop mass illegal immigration, limit legal immigration, protect your workers.

Under the constitution, a president can serve two five-year terms. But ahead of next year\u2019s election, government officials and allies of Cond\u00e9 have been dropping hints about amending the constitution or writing a new one to let him stand again.</p> <p>As far back as January, the then Russian ambassador <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/27/russians-have-special-status-politics-and-mining-mix-in-guinea\">backed a change of the constitution</a> to allow the \u201clegendary\u201d 81-year-old president to \u201creinvigorate\u201d the country.</p> <p>Then in May, the prime minister, Ibrahima Fofana, publicly admitted the constitution could be changed. The then justice minister resigned in opposition to the plan. In July, a leaked memo from June, signed by the foreign affairs minister, appeared to advise diplomatic missions on proposed constitutional amendments. Meanwhile, billboards endorsing a new constitution have erected across Conakry.</p> <p>Finally, in September, Cond\u00e9 made his first public statement on the subject, though he was careful to avoid specifics. \u201cI instruct the prime minister to initiate consultations to gather the opinions of others in an open exchange,\u201d he said in a national TV broadcast.</p> <p>For months hundreds of thousands of Guineans have taken to the streets for weekly protests against the prospect of Cond\u00e9 running for a third term. They chant the Susu phrase for \u201cthis will not happen\u201d, the slogan of the protest movement, and burn car tyres. Many wear red T-shirts, armbands, hats and bandanas \u2013 the colour of the opposition coalition Front National Pour La D\u00e9fense De La Constitution (FNDC).</p> <p>Military and paramilitary forces have responded with live rounds and arrests. At least 20 civilians have been killed in the unrest to date, plus one gendarme.</p> <p>Ten opposition leaders jailed in October for organising mass rallies were temporarily freed earlier this month. On 5 December their case was referred to the constitutional court, prompting cries of joy in the Conakry courtroom.</p> <p>Opposition figures said security forces have been pouring into suburbs adjourning the areas of protest, which are usually opposition strongholds, and indiscriminately killing people.</p> <p>Nadia Nahman, the chief of staff for opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo, said: \u201cAlpha Cond\u00e9 is ready to walk on the bodies of Guineans to take a third term. Killing one\u2019s compatriots to satisfy one\u2019s disproportionate obsession with power is inhuman and despicable.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68521fef66ffbc1e15fcd80a06d227eaa1f5a073\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68521fef66ffbc1e15fcd80a06d227eaa1f5a073/0_40_4759_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters take to the street in Conakry while carrying the Guinean national flag.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters take to the street in Conakry while carrying the Guinean national flag.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cellou Binani/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across west Africa, leaders are tinkering with mandates and wrangling behind the scenes to stay in power for longer. Most recently, Alassane Ouattara, the Ivory Coast president, said he would run for a third term next year if historic rivals Laurent Gbagbo and Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9 were candidates too.</p> <p>On 22 November, Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, was forced to deny rumours he was preparing for a third term bid. \u201cThere are no circumstances \u2013 nor set of circumstances \u2013 under which President Buhari may seek to amend the constitution\u201d, a presidential statement read. \u201cPresident Buhari intends to serve his full second elected term in office, ending 2023 \u2013 and then there shall be a general election in which he will not be a candidate.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Christopher Fomunyoh, the regional director for central and west Africa at the National Democratic Institute, said: \u201cAfter the enthusiastic embrace of democratic transitions in Africa in the early 1990s, some of the continent\u2019s nascent democracies are under assault from recalcitrant autocrats who do believe they are the only individuals capable of running their countries.</p> <p>\u201cIt is quite feasible that civil society organisations, labor unions and political parties opposed to the constitutional manoeuvring succeed in rolling back ongoing attempts in Guinea. We saw similar successes in blocking presidential term elongations in Senegal in 2012, with former president, Abdoulaye Wade, and, more recently, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2016, with former president, Joseph Kabila.\u201d</p> <p>But resisting the will of the government could come at a bloody cost in Guinea, a former French colony that is rich in minerals but ranks among the poorest countries. \u201cThe struggle of the people of Guinea for democracy and the rule of law deserves all the sacrifices,\u201d said Nahman. \u201cNothing will stop the people of Guinea from blocking the way of the promoters of a third mandate.\u201d</p> <p>For Abdourahmane Diallo\u2019s uncle, his nephew\u2019s death won\u2019t discourage the family from participating in the protests. \u201cWe have to keep going,\u201d Boubacar Diallo said. \u201c[Cond\u00e9] must leave power because what he is doing with his government is not at all good.\u201d</p>",

As far back as January, the then Russian ambassador backed a change of the constitution to allow the \u201clegendary\u201d 81-year-old president to \u201creinvigorate\u201d the country. Then in May, the prime minister, Ibrahima Fofana, publicly admitted the constitution could be changed. The then justice minister resigned in opposition to the plan. In July, a leaked memo from June, signed by the foreign affairs minister, appeared to advise diplomatic missions on proposed constitutional amendments. Meanwhile, billboards endorsing a new constitution have erected across Conakry. Finally, in September, Cond\u00e9 made his first public statement on the subject, though he was careful to avoid specifics. \u201cI instruct the prime minister to initiate consultations to gather the opinions of others in an open exchange,\u201d he said in a national TV broadcast. For months hundreds of thousands of Guineans have taken to the streets for weekly protests against the prospect of Cond\u00e9 running for a third term. They chant the Susu phrase for \u201cthis will not happen\u201d, the slogan of the protest movement, and burn car tyres. Many wear red T-shirts, armbands, hats and bandanas \u2013 the colour of the opposition coalition Front National Pour La D\u00e9fense De La Constitution (FNDC). Military and paramilitary forces have responded with live rounds and arrests. At least 20 civilians have been killed in the unrest to date, plus one gendarme. Ten opposition leaders jailed in October for organising mass rallies were temporarily freed earlier this month. On 5 December their case was referred to the constitutional court, prompting cries of joy in the Conakry courtroom. Opposition figures said security forces have been pouring into suburbs adjourning the areas of protest, which are usually opposition strongholds, and indiscriminately killing people. Nadia Nahman, the chief of staff for opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo, said: \u201cAlpha Cond\u00e9 is ready to walk on the bodies of Guineans to take a third term. Killing one\u2019s compatriots to satisfy one\u2019s disproportionate obsession with power is inhuman and despicable.\u201d Across west Africa, leaders are tinkering with mandates and wrangling behind the scenes to stay in power for longer. Most recently, Alassane Ouattara, the Ivory Coast president, said he would run for a third term next year if historic rivals Laurent Gbagbo and Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9 were candidates too. On 22 November, Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, was forced to deny rumours he was preparing for a third term bid. \u201cThere are no circumstances \u2013 nor set of circumstances \u2013 under which President Buhari may seek to amend the constitution\u201d, a presidential statement read. \u201cPresident Buhari intends to serve his full second elected term in office, ending 2023 \u2013 and then there shall be a general election in which he will not be a candidate.\u201d Dr Christopher Fomunyoh, the regional director for central and west Africa at the National Democratic Institute, said: \u201cAfter the enthusiastic embrace of democratic transitions in Africa in the early 1990s, some of the continent\u2019s nascent democracies are under assault from recalcitrant autocrats who do believe they are the only individuals capable of running their countries. \u201cIt is quite feasible that civil society organisations, labor unions and political parties opposed to the constitutional manoeuvring succeed in rolling back ongoing attempts in Guinea. We saw similar successes in blocking presidential term elongations in Senegal in 2012, with former president, Abdoulaye Wade, and, more recently, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2016, with former president, Joseph Kabila.\u201d But resisting the will of the government could come at a bloody cost in Guinea, a former French colony that is rich in minerals but ranks among the poorest countries. \u201cThe struggle of the people of Guinea for democracy and the rule of law deserves all the sacrifices,\u201d said Nahman. \u201cNothing will stop the people of Guinea from blocking the way of the promoters of a third mandate.\u201d For Abdourahmane Diallo\u2019s uncle, his nephew\u2019s death won\u2019t discourage the family from participating in the protests. \u201cWe have to keep going,\u201d Boubacar Diallo said. \u201c[Cond\u00e9] must leave power because what he is doing with his government is not at all good.\u201d",

The OnePlus 7T Pro is a minor update to the stellar OnePlus 7 Pro that keeps all the good bits, improves the camera, and speeds up the fingerprint scanner.</p> \n<p>The monster 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen runs at 90Hz \u2013 compared with 60Hz for most of the competition \u2013 is arguably the best in the business. It\u2019s bright, crisp and super smooth, plus it\u2019s free of holes or camera notches. The selfie camera pops up from the top on command \u2013 a consistent crowd-pleaser.</p> \n<p>The 7T Pro is the fastest-feeling phone \u2013 everything zips along. It has Qualcomm\u2019s top chip, the Snapdragon 855+, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS3.0 storage \u2013 plenty for practically everything. The optical in-display fingerprint scanner is even faster than before continuing to put the competition to shame.</p> \n<p>The latest OxygenOS 10, the firm\u2019s super-slick version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/04/android-10-released-everything-you-need-to-know-about-google-update\">Android 10</a>, is arguably the best in the business too, and you\u2019ll get prompt updates for three years.</p> \n<p>The triple camera system on the back is good too, combining a 48MP main, a 16MP ultra-wide angle and an 8MP telephoto camera. New for the 7T Pro is a super-macro mode, which is surprisingly good, producing crisp images up to just 2.5cm from the lens \u2013 great fun. The 7T Pro can\u2019t quite beat the iPhone 11 Pro or Pixel 4XL, but it matches or beats the rest on detail and utility.</p> \n<p>The 7T Pro lasts about 32 hours between charges, making it one of the better performers.

The iPhone 11 Pro isn\u2019t the biggest or the most expensive of Apple\u2019s 2019 smartphones, but it is the best and very nearly the best phone of the year.</p> \n<p>The iPhone 11 Pro combines a stunning, big-enough 5.8in screen, svelte, luxurious-feeling body, top-notch performance and battery life to keep up with most of the competition.</p> \n<p>Truth be told, the design is basically uncharged since the mould-breaking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/10/iphone-x-review-apple-face-id-all-screen-design-home-button\">iPhone X from 2017</a>. The back is now frosted glass, which looks particularly good in silver, and has a triple camera lump in the top left. The rest stays pretty much unchanged.</p> \n<p>Apple\u2019s Face ID is still the best, most widely-supported face recognition system in the business. The new A13 Bionic chip continues to lead the pack. The gesture navigation system continues to be one of the best, and you\u2019re in line for around five years of iOS software updates from release - at least two more than any other manufacturer will provide.</p> \n<p>This year the iPhone 11 Pro introduces a significantly improved triple camera with ultra-wide, wide and telephoto lenses, which matches the best rivals in photography and beats them in video. It even has an effective night mode now.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not all gravy \u2013 starting with just 64GB of storage is poor. The old Lightning connector still persists, rather than the newer standard of USB-C. There\u2019s no 5G option and it is exceedingly expensive \u2013 you don\u2019t buy the iPhone 11 Pro looking for value for money. Plus iOS 13 has been a mixed bag since its introduction, with a lot of bugs that needed fixing.</p> \n<p>But as a whole, no other phone can match the iPhone 11 Pro in power, capability and size. The iPhone 11 Pro is the smaller phone to buy and the best running iOS.</p> \n<p><strong>Why should you buy it?</strong></p> \n<p>You want the best smaller phone, or simply the best Apple phone, then the iPhone 11 Pro is fantastic, but comes at a considerable cost</p> \n<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want the best iPhone</p> \n<p><strong>Don\u2019t buy if:</strong> you don\u2019t want to spend \u00a31,049 or want to use Android</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Full review:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/07/iphone-11-pro-the-best-small-phone-available\">iPhone 11 Pro review: the best small phone available</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Best smaller Android:</strong> Samsung Galaxy S10</h2> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s10/buy/\">\u00a3799</a> / <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-s10/buy/\">$899</a></p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ead18d1b23b6cdaa33f6731c0c417a8f0576552\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ead18d1b23b6cdaa33f6731c0c417a8f0576552/539_452_3726_2236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"smartphone buyer's guide - samsung galaxy s10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A big, beautiful screen in a smaller phone, the Galaxy S10 is the sweet spot in Samsung\u2019s flagship smartphone line.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"price comparison of samsung galaxy s10\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://m.skimresources.com/widget/skimlinks/pc/iframe/iframe.html?shopId=973&amp;isoCurrencyCode=GBP&amp;isoLanguageCode=en&amp;geolocation=true&amp;nameKeywords=samsung%20galaxy%20s10%20NOT%20month&amp;resultLimit=3&amp;pub=114047X1592509&amp;css=rslxksjjea&amp;priceMin=300&amp;merchantFilterType=EXCLUDE&amp;merchantIds=8903,8902\" name=\"monetizer1\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none;height:154px\"> </iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  These regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

It\u2019s still a glass and metal sandwich, which means you might need a case to protect against falls.</p> \n<p>The Galaxy S10 was recently updated with Samsung\u2019s new One UI 2 software, based on the latest Android 10 including much-improved navigation gestures. You should get about three years of software support from release from Samsung, although the company is usually slower than Google and OnePlus to deliver big Android version updates.</p> \n<p>The rear triple camera is good allowing you to zoom from 0.5 through 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom.

Even at the end of 2019, no other phone provides as comprehensive a combination as Huawei\u2019s new Leica quad camera.</p> \n<p>The 20MP 0.6x ultra-wide angle camera is fun, the main 40MP camera is terrific and it\u2019s joined by a new periscopic 5x optical zoom camera that gets you closer than any other smartphone. If five times magnification wasn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s an excellent 10x hybrid zoom on top and then a digital zoom all the way up to 50x. A 3D depth-sensing time-of-flight sensor rounds out the modules on the back.</p> \n<p>Remarkable levels of zoom aside, the P30 Pro also has low-light performance that instantly turns night into day without having to wait for a couple of seconds of capture. The P30 Pro might not have the best Night Sight rival, but most of the time it simply doesn\u2019t need it.</p> \n<p>The rest of the phone is excellent, too, with stunning colour options. The large 6.47in FHD+ OLED is great, with a small notch in the top containing the selfie camera and slim bezels all round. The curved edges keep the width of the phone to a narrow 73.4mm wide, meaning it\u2019s still relatively manageable and easier to wield day-to-day particularly compared with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/22/oneplus-7t-pro-review-the-best-kind-of-deja-vu\">OnePlus 7T Pro</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/iphone-11-pro-max-review-battery-camera-screen\">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a>.</p> \n<p>The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is second only to the OnePlus 7T Pro\u2019s. Huawei\u2019s Kirin 980 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, provides great performance and a battery that will last about two days. Plus the battery charges super fast and has wireless charging and power sharing.</p> \n<p>Huawei\u2019s modified Android 10, EMUI 10, is highly customisable and has plenty of features but may not be to everyone\u2019s tastes. Huawei is still facing sanctions from the US as part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/20/trump-us-ban-huawei-google-trade-war\">US-China trade war</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/19/google-huawei-trump-blacklist-report\">makes its future uncertain</a>.

OnePlus guarantees two years of software updates and an additional year of bi-monthly security updates from the release date of the phone too.</p> \n<p>It even has the fastest and best in-display fingerprint scanner currently available, which is as good as the best dedicated capacitive sensors, good haptics and dual-sim support for having two mobile phone network connections at the same time.</p> \n<p>The triple camera is good too, with ultra-wide, wide and 2x telephoto lenses, plus a dedicated macro mode, but it can\u2019t beat the very best in the market.

The bigger the number the larger the phone, but different phones use different ratios of height to width.</p>\n    <p>How easy it is to handle comes down to the width of the phone and its weight. The narrower and lighter it is, the easier it is to hold in one hand and the less likely you are to drop it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Processor</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>What is commonly called the processor in a phone is actually a system-on-a-chip combining the processor, graphics and other essential systems into one.</p>\n    <p>Generally the newer the processor the more powerful and battery efficient it will be. Samsung, Huawei and Apple make their own, while Qualcomm is the largest supplier to other brands at the high end, with its Snapdragon 8-series range at the top.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>RAM</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The RAM (memory) is where your apps and processes are stored when in use, so the you more your phone has the better, up to a point.</p>\n    <p>Android requires more RAM than iOS, so it's difficult to directly compare them. But with Android at least 4GB of RAM is currently recommended.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Storage</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Different from memory, storage is where everything is stored on the phone, including apps and media. While a few phones can have their storage expanded with microSD cards, most cannot.</p>\n    <p>That means you should aim for 64GB of storage at a minimum, but more if you want to store lots of photos. Cloud services such as Spotify or Google's Photos can help offload your music, photos or videos to the internet.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Software updates</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Keeping your phone secure from hackers is essential, which makes software updates critical to patch bugs and security holes, as well as adding new features and improving things such as battery life and the camera.</p>\n    <p>Not all phones receive regular updates. Apple's support of older phones is the best in the business of around 5 years, followed by Samsung and Google's three years, both from when the phone was released - not when you buy it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Battery life</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Battery life varies drastically between devices, and \"all-day battery\" often doesn't mean 24 hours between charges. Some may not last long enough, particularly if you're out in the evening.</p>\n    <p>Battery life gets worse as the battery ages too, so a two-day battery will likely make sure the phone lasts at least a day two years later.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Camera</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Cameras are the current battleground between the big players, but the margins between them are slimming.</p>\n    <p>Most use computational photography that combines hardware with advanced software algorithms, typically allowing multiple cameras to combine to make one image.</p>\n    <p>As such the camera software makes as much difference as the hardware, and is one of the few areas that actually improves over time with updates.</p>\n    <p>Multi-camera systems often offer more, such as useful zooms, portrait modes and better low-light performance, but they are not all created equally. There are also 3D cameras, which can detect facial expressions and other fun tricks.</p>\n    <p>The number of megapixels (MP) also makes a difference. Having more MP doesn't necessarily equal a better image, but modern smartphone cameras combine multiple pixels to improve image quality producing 12MP shots from 48MP sensors, for example.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Other things to consider</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Wireless charging:</b>&nbsp;convenient, but slower than via cable and normally a charging pad doesn't come in the box</p>\n    <p><b>Durability:</b>&nbsp;generally glass on the front and back of the phone makes it more fragile</p>\n    <p><b>Resale value:</b>&nbsp;iPhones hold their value better than most others</p>\n    <p><b>OLED versus LCD:</b> OLED screens emit their own light so have much deeper blacks and more vibrant colours, while LCD screens are cheaper</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Runners up</h2> \n<p>These are good phones still worth buying if none of the top smartphones fit the bill.</p> \n<p><strong>Apple iPhone 11</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11\">\u00a3729</a> / <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/us/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11\">$699</a></p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4d15e7605d06515d0bba590b3c101ba27fe5b572\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d15e7605d06515d0bba590b3c101ba27fe5b572/1193_325_2683_2684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"smartphone buyer's guide - iphone 11\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Apple\u2019s cheaper iPhone 11 is the follow-up to last year\u2019s iPhone XR and offers most of the features of the iPhone 11 Pro.

Here\u2019s a guide comparing the current top-end smartphones from Apple, Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus and others to help you pick the best handset for you. There has never been a better time to buy a new flagship smartphone with many quality handsets available at a wider range of prices than ever before. Whether your priority is two-day battery life, fantastic camera performance or a spectacular screen, there\u2019s plenty to choose from. This Guardian buyer\u2019s guide to top-end smartphones was last updated on 17 December 2019, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right flagship phone for you. Best overall: OnePlus 7T Pro RRP: \u00a3699 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The follow-up to the best smartphone of the first half of 2019 is, unsurprisingly, the best phone to end 2019. The OnePlus 7T Pro is a minor update to the stellar OnePlus 7 Pro that keeps all the good bits, improves the camera, and speeds up the fingerprint scanner. The monster 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen runs at 90Hz \u2013 compared with 60Hz for most of the competition \u2013 is arguably the best in the business. It\u2019s bright, crisp and super smooth, plus it\u2019s free of holes or camera notches. The selfie camera pops up from the top on command \u2013 a consistent crowd-pleaser. The 7T Pro is the fastest-feeling phone \u2013 everything zips along. It has Qualcomm\u2019s top chip, the Snapdragon 855+, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS3.0 storage \u2013 plenty for practically everything. The optical in-display fingerprint scanner is even faster than before continuing to put the competition to shame. The latest OxygenOS 10, the firm\u2019s super-slick version of Android 10, is arguably the best in the business too, and you\u2019ll get prompt updates for three years. The triple camera system on the back is good too, combining a 48MP main, a 16MP ultra-wide angle and an 8MP telephoto camera. New for the 7T Pro is a super-macro mode, which is surprisingly good, producing crisp images up to just 2.5cm from the lens \u2013 great fun. The 7T Pro can\u2019t quite beat the iPhone 11 Pro or Pixel 4XL, but it matches or beats the rest on detail and utility. The 7T Pro lasts about 32 hours between charges, making it one of the better performers. Charging is exceptionally fast via the firm\u2019s WarpCharge system too, hitting 70% in just 34 minutes via cable. There\u2019s no wireless charging though. Dual-sim support is handy for work or travelling. It\u2019s water resistant to some extent, but has no IP rating. There\u2019s a McLaren limited edition and a 5G version in the US, but not UK where the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G is still the current model. Why should you buy it? The unrivalled screen, sheer speed and in-display fingerprint scanner, combined with the slick OxygenOS 10 make even mundane tasks a joy. The massive OnePlus 7T Pro is a stretch worth making. Buy if: you want the best and fastest superphone experience Don\u2019t buy if: you don\u2019t want to stretch to such a big phone Full review: OnePlus 7T Pro review: the best kind of deja vu Best iOS: Apple iPhone 11 Pro RRP: \u00a31,049 / $999 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Good things come in smaller packages. The iPhone 11 Pro isn\u2019t the biggest or the most expensive of Apple\u2019s 2019 smartphones, but it is the best and very nearly the best phone of the year. The iPhone 11 Pro combines a stunning, big-enough 5.8in screen, svelte, luxurious-feeling body, top-notch performance and battery life to keep up with most of the competition. Truth be told, the design is basically uncharged since the mould-breaking iPhone X from 2017. The back is now frosted glass, which looks particularly good in silver, and has a triple camera lump in the top left. The rest stays pretty much unchanged. Apple\u2019s Face ID is still the best, most widely-supported face recognition system in the business. The new A13 Bionic chip continues to lead the pack. The gesture navigation system continues to be one of the best, and you\u2019re in line for around five years of iOS software updates from release - at least two more than any other manufacturer will provide. This year the iPhone 11 Pro introduces a significantly improved triple camera with ultra-wide, wide and telephoto lenses, which matches the best rivals in photography and beats them in video. It even has an effective night mode now. It\u2019s not all gravy \u2013 starting with just 64GB of storage is poor. The old Lightning connector still persists, rather than the newer standard of USB-C. There\u2019s no 5G option and it is exceedingly expensive \u2013 you don\u2019t buy the iPhone 11 Pro looking for value for money. Plus iOS 13 has been a mixed bag since its introduction, with a lot of bugs that needed fixing. But as a whole, no other phone can match the iPhone 11 Pro in power, capability and size. The iPhone 11 Pro is the smaller phone to buy and the best running iOS. Why should you buy it? You want the best smaller phone, or simply the best Apple phone, then the iPhone 11 Pro is fantastic, but comes at a considerable cost Buy if: you want the best iPhone Don\u2019t buy if: you don\u2019t want to spend \u00a31,049 or want to use Android Full review: iPhone 11 Pro review: the best small phone available Best smaller Android: Samsung Galaxy S10 RRP: \u00a3799 / $899 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 If you want the Android sweet-spot between a big, stunning screen and smaller phone size that\u2019s easier to handle and fit in a pocket, that\u2019s the Galaxy S10. The 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen with a small hole-punch notch in the top right is one of the best on the market and is big enough to make the most of apps and movies look great. Small bezels all round make the phone pretty compact compared with rivals, and it\u2019s light too. It\u2019s still a glass and metal sandwich, which means you might need a case to protect against falls. The Galaxy S10 was recently updated with Samsung\u2019s new One UI 2 software, based on the latest Android 10 including much-improved navigation gestures. You should get about three years of software support from release from Samsung, although the company is usually slower than Google and OnePlus to deliver big Android version updates. The rear triple camera is good allowing you to zoom from 0.5 through 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom. It won\u2019t beat the Pixel 4 XL or iPhone 11 Pro, but gets the job done. The selfie camera pokes straight though the screen and is one of the better ones on the market. Performance is good but battery life is a bit weak, lasting a day of usage but not much more. The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor mounted under the display has proved to be a bit slow and finickity over time, which can be annoying. Why should you buy it? A big screen Android experience in a relatively small phone is the main selling point, but the good camera, performance and looks help too. Buy if: you want a good balance of screen and phone size without breaking the bank Don\u2019t buy if: you want brilliant battery life Full review: Samsung Galaxy S10 review: the sweet spot Best camera: Huawei P30 Pro RRP: \u00a3750 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The best camera on a phone is the Huawei P30 Pro by some margin. Even at the end of 2019, no other phone provides as comprehensive a combination as Huawei\u2019s new Leica quad camera. The 20MP 0.6x ultra-wide angle camera is fun, the main 40MP camera is terrific and it\u2019s joined by a new periscopic 5x optical zoom camera that gets you closer than any other smartphone. If five times magnification wasn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s an excellent 10x hybrid zoom on top and then a digital zoom all the way up to 50x. A 3D depth-sensing time-of-flight sensor rounds out the modules on the back. Remarkable levels of zoom aside, the P30 Pro also has low-light performance that instantly turns night into day without having to wait for a couple of seconds of capture. The P30 Pro might not have the best Night Sight rival, but most of the time it simply doesn\u2019t need it. The rest of the phone is excellent, too, with stunning colour options. The large 6.47in FHD+ OLED is great, with a small notch in the top containing the selfie camera and slim bezels all round. The curved edges keep the width of the phone to a narrow 73.4mm wide, meaning it\u2019s still relatively manageable and easier to wield day-to-day particularly compared with the OnePlus 7T Pro or iPhone 11 Pro Max. The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is second only to the OnePlus 7T Pro\u2019s. Huawei\u2019s Kirin 980 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, provides great performance and a battery that will last about two days. Plus the battery charges super fast and has wireless charging and power sharing. Huawei\u2019s modified Android 10, EMUI 10, is highly customisable and has plenty of features but may not be to everyone\u2019s tastes. Huawei is still facing sanctions from the US as part of the US-China trade war, which makes its future uncertain. The P30 Pro\u2019s recent Android 10 update showed that it should continue to receive updates as normal, however. Why should you buy it? The camera is game-changing in meaningful, not gimmick-filled ways, while the rest of the phone is excellent Buy if: you want the best camera on a great phone Don\u2019t buy if: you want a smaller phone or are worried about US blockade of Huawei Full review: Huawei P30 Pro review: game-changing camera, stellar battery life Best value: OnePlus 7T Price: \u00a3549 / $599 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Pound for pound the OnePlus 7T offers the best performance, design and experience than any other smartphone. It\u2019s got the big, good-looking 6.41in full HD OLED screen, with a small, widow\u2019s-peak-like notch at the top for a selfie camera. New for the 7T is a 90Hz refresh rate, which like its bigger sibling the 7T Pro, makes even the mundane silky smooth. It\u2019s got 2019\u2019s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 855+ processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of fast UFS3.0 storage. It also lasts a good 31 hours on a charge, and its OxygenOS 10 Android software is fast and slick. OnePlus guarantees two years of software updates and an additional year of bi-monthly security updates from the release date of the phone too. It even has the fastest and best in-display fingerprint scanner currently available, which is as good as the best dedicated capacitive sensors, good haptics and dual-sim support for having two mobile phone network connections at the same time. The triple camera is good too, with ultra-wide, wide and 2x telephoto lenses, plus a dedicated macro mode, but it can\u2019t beat the very best in the market. There\u2019s no formal water resistance rating and no wireless charging, but WarpCharge sees it hit full charge in 60 minutes flat. Why should you buy it? A great 90Hz screen, excellent software and the best performance, in-display fingerprint scanner and a good camera mean you have to spend significantly more to get a better phone than this Buy if: you want a top-notch phone but don\u2019t want to spend more than \u00a3549 Don\u2019t buy if: you want a really good camera Full review: OnePlus 7T review: the new cut-price flagship king Runners up These are good phones still worth buying if none of the top smartphones fit the bill. Apple iPhone 11 RRP: \u00a3729 / $699 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Apple\u2019s cheaper iPhone 11 is the follow-up to last year\u2019s iPhone XR and offers most of the features of the iPhone 11 Pro. It has slightly battery life too, but is missing the excellent ultra-wide angle camera, has a slightly larger, but worse screen. It is made of aluminium and glass, instead of stainless steel, losing its luxurious feel and the knowledge that it\u2019s the best Apple can make. The iPhone 11 looks great in red or white, but it\u2019s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, costing as much or more as true flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 11 certainly holds its own for the money, but the iPhone 11 Pro still the one to buy if you want the best iPhone. If you want a cheaper phone, switch to Android or buy last year\u2019s iPhone XR. Full review: iPhone 11 review: an iPhone XR with a better camera Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max RRP: \u00a31,149 / $1,099 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 If you must have an iPhone and it must have a massive screen or epic battery life then the iPhone 11 Pro Max is your only option. But it has really poor ergonomics, is big, expensive and heavy, making the smaller iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11 are better options. Full review: iPhone 11 Pro Max review: salvaged by epic battery life Samsung Galaxy S10e RRP: \u00a3669 / $650 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 The smallest, cheapest variant of Samsung\u2019s current S10 line is still good, but falls slightly short of the high bar set by the regular Galaxy S10. The Galaxy S10e loses the optical zoom with only two cameras on the back, has a flat, slightly smaller screen and a lower capacity battery. It also ditches in the in-screen fingerprint scanner for one embedded in the power button \u2013 great for right-handed users but not so for the left handed. It doesn\u2019t feel any smaller in the hand, but can be had for less if you must have a top-end Samsung for the lowest possible cost or dislike curved screens. Samsung Galaxy S10+ RRP: \u00a3899 / $999 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The bigger version of the Galaxy S10 with a 6.4in QHD+ display has the best screen available on any device. The oval-shaped hole-punch notch is novel, containing two good selfie cameras. The triple rear camera is good, but not a patch on the Huawei P30 Pro. Performance is good, so is the software, but the battery life is slightly disappointing compared with the best. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be frustrating to use. Full review: Samsung Galaxy S10+ review: a simply stunning screen Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ RRP: \u00a3999 / $1,099 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 The Galaxy Note 10+ is a Samsung super-fan\u2019s dream. It has the biggest screen on a Samsung with a monstrous 6.8in on the diagonal, new faster UFS3.0 storage, reasonable battery life and plenty of party tricks. The stylus can now be used as a magic wand for gestures, there are three cameras on the back and is available in a 5G version too. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be a bit frustrating to use. Full review: Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ review: bigger and now with a magic wand Samsung Galaxy S10 5G RRP: \u00a31,099 / $1,299 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 The biggest, most powerful version of Samsung\u2019s S-line is the S10 5G and it\u2019s huge with a 6.7in QHD+ AMOLED screen, long oval-shaped hole-punch notch for the selfie cameras, and four cameras on the back. Performance, software and battery are good, but it\u2019s not as slick or ergonomic as the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be frustrating to use. Full review: Samsung Galaxy S10 5G review: bigger, faster and lasts longer Huawei Mate 20 Pro RRP: \u00a3899.99 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Mate 20 Pro has the big, attractive 6.39in QHD+ screen, svelte body, long battery life and great performance that made it the top phone of 2018. However, its excellent triple camera system with 3x optical zoom has been outdone by Huawei\u2019s newer P30 Pro, which has a Leica quad camera with 5x optical zoom. It recently received EMUI 10 (Android 10) and is worth looking out for deals, particularly if you want the 3D face unlock option. Full review: Huawei Mate 20 Pro review: cutting-edge brilliance Google Pixel 4 XL RRP: \u00a3829 / $899 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 The Google Pixel 4 XL is a mixed bag. On the one hand you have a good-looking 6.3in QHD+ AMOLED display running at 90Hz, a stellar camera, new Soli radar gesture system, amazing new on-device AI and super-fast 3D Face Unlock. But on the other you have no fingerprint scanner, meaning until apps are updated to use the Face Unlock you\u2019re forced back to using the old pin or password, the battery life is fairly short and there have been quite a few bugs that have needed fixing since launch. One day it might be great. Full review: Google Pixel 4 XL review: not quite ready for primetime Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 RRP: \u00a3499 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Xiaomi\u2019s first slider phone offers more than most for the money, with top-flight specs for 2018 competing directly with the OnePlus 6T and Honor View20. It takes a different approach to the problem of where to put the selfie camera in an all-screen design, hiding it behind the screen on slide-out section. Good, but quite as great as its competition, this huge phone is held back by a heavy weight and a software experience that just isn\u2019t as good, despite solid gesture navigation options.

The Committee on Climate Change, which advises the UK and devolved governments on their targets and policies, said Scotland\u2019s credibility would be damaged unless it took action before Glasgow hosts next year\u2019s global climate talks. The COP26 negotiations have been billed as the most important since the Paris talks in 2015. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has invested her personal and party\u2019s reputation in taking action on the climate. Lord Deben, the CCC\u2019s chair, said Scotland\u2019s rapid progress on cutting emissions was in danger of stalling because its policies on transport, farming and home heating were insufficiently far-reaching. It risked missing its target of cutting overall emissions by 56% compared with 1990 levels by 2020, he said, and it needed to take urgent and significant action to enable it to hit its target of net zero by 2045. \u201cScotland has set an ambitious world-leading net zero target of 2045.

      "body": "<p>Last year, in randomly selected school halls across the country, Britain pitted its 15-year-olds in an academic competition of wits against children from 79 other countries. The Pisa (Programme for International Student Assessment) tests have taken place across the globe every three years since 2000, and a country\u2019s score is often used to boast about its smartness (or otherwise). The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/03/british-schoolchildren-among-least-satisfied-with-their-lives-says-oecd-report\" title=\"\">results</a> this year showed the United Kingdom has finally made it into the top five. But our standout statistic isn\u2019t for academic prowess; it\u2019s for our children\u2019s disproportionately high fear of failure.</p> <p>According to the results, British girls are the fifth most afraid of failure in the world, pipped only by Taipei, Macau, Singapore, and Brunei. Our fear gender gap is also one of the largest, with girls substantially <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Samfr/status/1201789348578045952/photo/1\" title=\"\">more anxious than boys</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/08/how-do-you-teacher-children-to-be-resilient-ask-limbless-veteran\">How do you teach children to be resilient? Ask a limbless veteran</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are a variety of likely reasons for this. Passing exams brings tangible rewards in Britain today. Degree holders earn <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/graduates-continue-to-benefit-with-higher-earnings\" title=\"\">higher average wages</a> than those without a degree, and the difference is particularly marked for women, whose alternative to a graduate career tends to be a lower-paid <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/13731\" title=\"\">vocational role</a>, such as a care worker. Gender equality may owe less to shifts in social conscience, and more to women worrying themselves into hard work and promotion. This is good, some might say. Indeed, if girls are doing so much better at school, isn\u2019t it boys we should be worrying about?</p> <p>Mental health figures are always tricky to navigate, with lots of caveats, but a consistent finding across several recent reports is that Britain\u2019s teenage girls are self-harming and struggling with emotional disorders \u2013 the most recent <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/838022/State_of_the_Nation_2019_young_people_children_wellbeing.pdf\" title=\"\">NHS data</a> puts the figure at one in five (22.4%) by the age of 19, more than three times the rate for boys. This sounds ludicrously high \u2013 is every fifth teenager really struggling emotionally? But if we\u2019re fifth in the world for students\u2019 fear, I worry they are right. And while we may look at the data and say it is not hurting their grades, if it\u2019s causing scars on their arms and hearts, we ought carefully to consider what might be causing the problem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/23/britain-crisis-childhood-former-childrens-commissioner-al-aynsley-green-book\">Britain has created a crisis in childhood, says former children\u2019s commissioner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fifteen-year-olds in the UK are approaching high-stakes exams that affect their next step in education.

Perhaps this is why life satisfaction for all children in the UK \u2013 boys and girls \u2013 has <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/pisa-2018-what-we-have-learned-about-childrens-life-satisfaction/\" title=\"\">dropped faster since 2015 than in any other country</a>.</p> <p>Assessment does not have to work like this. Wales has kept some modular exams and continues to rethink how things could be different under its new curriculum. For instance, must exams be timed? Children in most countries don\u2019t sit final exams until 18, when they are older and more confident. This ensures they continue learning maths and English throughout school.

      "bodyText": "Last year, in randomly selected school halls across the country, Britain pitted its 15-year-olds in an academic competition of wits against children from 79 other countries. The Pisa (Programme for International Student Assessment) tests have taken place across the globe every three years since 2000, and a country\u2019s score is often used to boast about its smartness (or otherwise). The results this year showed the United Kingdom has finally made it into the top five. But our standout statistic isn\u2019t for academic prowess; it\u2019s for our children\u2019s disproportionately high fear of failure. According to the results, British girls are the fifth most afraid of failure in the world, pipped only by Taipei, Macau, Singapore, and Brunei. Our fear gender gap is also one of the largest, with girls substantially more anxious than boys. There are a variety of likely reasons for this. Passing exams brings tangible rewards in Britain today. Degree holders earn higher average wages than those without a degree, and the difference is particularly marked for women, whose alternative to a graduate career tends to be a lower-paid vocational role, such as a care worker. Gender equality may owe less to shifts in social conscience, and more to women worrying themselves into hard work and promotion. This is good, some might say. Indeed, if girls are doing so much better at school, isn\u2019t it boys we should be worrying about? Mental health figures are always tricky to navigate, with lots of caveats, but a consistent finding across several recent reports is that Britain\u2019s teenage girls are self-harming and struggling with emotional disorders \u2013 the most recent NHS data puts the figure at one in five (22.4%) by the age of 19, more than three times the rate for boys. This sounds ludicrously high \u2013 is every fifth teenager really struggling emotionally? But if we\u2019re fifth in the world for students\u2019 fear, I worry they are right. And while we may look at the data and say it is not hurting their grades, if it\u2019s causing scars on their arms and hearts, we ought carefully to consider what might be causing the problem. Fifteen-year-olds in the UK are approaching high-stakes exams that affect their next step in education. Analysis of the 2015 Pisa results found that children in England were not tested more than in other countries \u2013but since then, England has largely scrapped coursework for GCSEs, and exam resits, while increasing the difficulty and length of tests. Perhaps this is why life satisfaction for all children in the UK \u2013 boys and girls \u2013 has dropped faster since 2015 than in any other country. Assessment does not have to work like this. Wales has kept some modular exams and continues to rethink how things could be different under its new curriculum. For instance, must exams be timed? Children in most countries don\u2019t sit final exams until 18, when they are older and more confident. This ensures they continue learning maths and English throughout school. Such changes could make a difference and should be debated. But we must bear one thing in mind. When Ofqual, the exams regulator, interviewed teachers about the changes, many said they were concerned the new system caused greater anxiety for pupils. The researchers concluded that changing everything around was likely to stress people more than if they had been left alone. As we roll into a new government, we owe it to our young people to look carefully at what is influencing these scores and what we can do to help. However, we must go gently, for it may be that our overzealous enthusiasm for change prompted the problem in the first place. Children are not guinea pigs to be trained up for Pisa. Let\u2019s all remember that.",

Brexit was the \u201cirrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people\u201d, the prime minister said. It will not, however, be plain sailing.</p> <p>The size of the Tory majority was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/13/brexit-eu-leaders-call-for-swift-ratification-after-tory-victory\">welcomed at an EU summit in Brussels</a>, with leaders feeling it would give Johnson free rein to decide his negotiating objectives and compromise in the talks where necessary. They are now waiting to see what incarnation of the PM will emerge now he is secure in Downing Street.</p> <p>But the French president warned Johnson continued regulatory harmonisation would be the price for protecting the flow of UK-EU trade. \u201cThe more ambitious the trade deal, the more we need regulatory harmonisation,\u201d Emmanuel Macron said.</p> <p>The new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said talks on the future relationship would drag on beyond 2020, with certain parts of the deal needing to be prioritised and others left for later. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/eu-brexit-transition-period-boris-johnson\">EU officials could</a> take the initiative and request an extension themselves as a way out of the problem.</p> <p>Johnson has repeatedly said he would not extend the 11-month transition period during which the talks are supposed to be concluded and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/michael-gove-promises-brexit-trade-deal-with-eu-by-end-of-2020\">Michael Gove, a senior minister, confirmed</a> categorically on Monday that the UK would have a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/johnson-warned-majority-will-not-speed-up-brexit-talks\">Sir Ivan Rogers</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/johnson-warned-majority-will-not-speed-up-brexit-talks\">, however, warned</a> that Johnson\u2019s large majority would not hand him any extra power in his negotiations with Brussels and that the time pressures created by his commitment not to extend the transition period could force Britain into accepting major concessions.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s former envoy to the EU added that Johnson had still not resolved the central contradiction in his plans between wanting Britain to diverge from EU rules, while also wanting a comprehensive trade deal in place in just a year\u2019s time.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/uk-not-match-fit-for-brexit-talks-says-former-may-aide-raoul-ruparel\">Raoul Ruparel</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/uk-not-match-fit-for-brexit-talks-says-former-may-aide-raoul-ruparel\">, Theresa May\u2019s former special adviser on exiting the EU, said</a> the UK did not appear to be \u201cmatch fit\u201d for the next phase of negotiations, with \u201ca huge amount of work to be done\u201d on the detail of what the UK wants and Whitehall \u201cnot ready to negotiate such a complex and wide-ranging agreement\u201d.</p> <h2>What next</h2> <p>The new government planned to give Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill its first and second readings and first vote on Friday after two days of swearing-in of MPs, the state opening of parliament and the Queen\u2019s speech, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/16/brexit-boris-johnson-plan-set-to-be-put-before-mps-on-friday\">Downing Street has said</a>.</p> <p>After that Johnson will have only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/brexit-what-the-tories-landslide-victory-means\">15 or 16 sitting days left before 31 January</a> to get the withdrawal agreement bill over the line, with some amendments possible \u2013 most likely on Northern Ireland trade and any request to extend the transition period extension, over which parliament may well want a say.</p> <p>The European parliament must also ratify the withdrawal agreement, with two plenary sessions planned on 13 and 29 January, in principle allowing trade talks to start from 1 February.</p> <p>That looks unlikely, however, since <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2019-2019/0007/cbill_2019-20200007_en_5.htm#pt4-pb5-l1g31\">the withdrawal bill</a> requires a prior statement of negotiating objectives to be first approved by the Commons \u2013 meaning Johnson and the government are finally going to have to say what form they really want the future relationship to take: Canada-plus? EEA? Norway?</p> <p>This is likely to be the central question of the coming few weeks.</p> <p>That\u2019s on top of: the Department for Exiting the EU merging (rumour has it) with the Department for International Trade; HMRC starting work on all the new processes and systems it will need in Northern Ireland; and specialised committees being set up to work out the details for UK-Northern Ireland trade.</p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p>Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish National party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/nicola-sturgeon-to-demand-powers-for-scottish-independence-referendum\">\u201coverwhelming\u201d election victory</a> \u2013 it won 48 of the country\u2019s 59 Westminster seats \u2013 gave her a clear mandate to hold a new independence referendum.</p> <p>Despite Johnson\u2019s rejection of any such move, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/nicola-sturgeon-to-publish-independence-referendum-blueprint\">Scot</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/nicola-sturgeon-to-publish-independence-referendum-blueprint\">land\u2019s first minister</a> said she would publish the blueprint for a second referendum next week.</p> <p>Jo Swinson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/jo-swinson-lib-dems-on-course-for-grim-night\">quit as Liberal Democrat leader</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/devastated-jo-swinson-apologises-lib-dems-election-failure\">apologised to her party</a> for a dismal election in which she lost her seat and the party slipped to 11 MPs \u2013 but said she did not regret fighting on a defiantly pro-remain platform.</p> <h2>Top comment</h2> <p>In the Guardian, Timothy Garton Ash says with Brexit now a certainty, we can still champion the values we share with millions of other Europeans:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The battle to keep Britain in the EU is lost; the battle for a European England has only just begun. When we remainers marched in our hundreds of thousands through the streets of London, bearing our improvised posters and European flags, we were not just defending British membership in a particular set of European institutions. We were also defending a certain idea of Britain and, within that, a certain idea of England: open, tolerant, internationalist, civic and civil, attentive to the social foundations of individual liberty and not just to its raw economic expression. These are values we share with millions of other Europeans. In this sense, we were also standing up for a European England. And we can do so still. In this hour of defeat I feel impelled to say, with George Orwell: I believe in England, and I believe that we shall go forward.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Top tweet</h2> <p>The always well-informed Charles Grant, co-founder of the Centre for European Reform, reads the tea leaves.

You can catch our latest Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here, and for daily updates head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories In case you spent the past few days on another planet, Boris Johnson secured an emphatic victory in the UK\u2019s general election as voters backed his promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and take the country out of the EU by 31 January. The Conservative party captured 365 of the 650 seats in the Commons, a comfortable majority of well over 70 and the party\u2019s best showing in a parliamentary election since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s win back in 1987. Labour, meanwhile, was plunged into bitter recriminations after the party won just 203 seats, its worst result in 84 years, as voters who had overwhelmingly voted to leave shied away from from the party\u2019s ambiguous Brexit policy. Johnson\u2019s gamble on calling an early vote to break MPs\u2019 deadlock over Brexit paid off, and he will now move swiftly to ratify his deal. Brexit was the \u201cirrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people\u201d, the prime minister said. It will not, however, be plain sailing. The size of the Tory majority was welcomed at an EU summit in Brussels, with leaders feeling it would give Johnson free rein to decide his negotiating objectives and compromise in the talks where necessary. They are now waiting to see what incarnation of the PM will emerge now he is secure in Downing Street. But the French president warned Johnson continued regulatory harmonisation would be the price for protecting the flow of UK-EU trade. \u201cThe more ambitious the trade deal, the more we need regulatory harmonisation,\u201d Emmanuel Macron said. The new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said talks on the future relationship would drag on beyond 2020, with certain parts of the deal needing to be prioritised and others left for later. EU officials could take the initiative and request an extension themselves as a way out of the problem. Johnson has repeatedly said he would not extend the 11-month transition period during which the talks are supposed to be concluded and Michael Gove, a senior minister, confirmed categorically on Monday that the UK would have a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year. Sir Ivan Rogers, however, warned that Johnson\u2019s large majority would not hand him any extra power in his negotiations with Brussels and that the time pressures created by his commitment not to extend the transition period could force Britain into accepting major concessions. The UK\u2019s former envoy to the EU added that Johnson had still not resolved the central contradiction in his plans between wanting Britain to diverge from EU rules, while also wanting a comprehensive trade deal in place in just a year\u2019s time. Raoul Ruparel, Theresa May\u2019s former special adviser on exiting the EU, said the UK did not appear to be \u201cmatch fit\u201d for the next phase of negotiations, with \u201ca huge amount of work to be done\u201d on the detail of what the UK wants and Whitehall \u201cnot ready to negotiate such a complex and wide-ranging agreement\u201d. What next The new government planned to give Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill its first and second readings and first vote on Friday after two days of swearing-in of MPs, the state opening of parliament and the Queen\u2019s speech, Downing Street has said. After that Johnson will have only 15 or 16 sitting days left before 31 January to get the withdrawal agreement bill over the line, with some amendments possible \u2013 most likely on Northern Ireland trade and any request to extend the transition period extension, over which parliament may well want a say. The European parliament must also ratify the withdrawal agreement, with two plenary sessions planned on 13 and 29 January, in principle allowing trade talks to start from 1 February. That looks unlikely, however, since the withdrawal bill requires a prior statement of negotiating objectives to be first approved by the Commons \u2013 meaning Johnson and the government are finally going to have to say what form they really want the future relationship to take: Canada-plus? EEA? Norway? This is likely to be the central question of the coming few weeks. That\u2019s on top of: the Department for Exiting the EU merging (rumour has it) with the Department for International Trade; HMRC starting work on all the new processes and systems it will need in Northern Ireland; and specialised committees being set up to work out the details for UK-Northern Ireland trade. Best of the rest Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish National party\u2019s \u201coverwhelming\u201d election victory \u2013 it won 48 of the country\u2019s 59 Westminster seats \u2013 gave her a clear mandate to hold a new independence referendum. Despite Johnson\u2019s rejection of any such move, Scotland\u2019s first minister said she would publish the blueprint for a second referendum next week. Jo Swinson quit as Liberal Democrat leader and apologised to her party for a dismal election in which she lost her seat and the party slipped to 11 MPs \u2013 but said she did not regret fighting on a defiantly pro-remain platform. Top comment In the Guardian, Timothy Garton Ash says with Brexit now a certainty, we can still champion the values we share with millions of other Europeans: The battle to keep Britain in the EU is lost; the battle for a European England has only just begun. When we remainers marched in our hundreds of thousands through the streets of London, bearing our improvised posters and European flags, we were not just defending British membership in a particular set of European institutions. We were also defending a certain idea of Britain and, within that, a certain idea of England: open, tolerant, internationalist, civic and civil, attentive to the social foundations of individual liberty and not just to its raw economic expression. These are values we share with millions of other Europeans. In this sense, we were also standing up for a European England. And we can do so still. In this hour of defeat I feel impelled to say, with George Orwell: I believe in England, and I believe that we shall go forward.

The \u201calumni choir\u201d, made up of women who wanted to stay on after an initial year following their referral to Amies, has gone on to perform for the Desmond Tutu Foundation, Sadiq Khan at City Hall and, most recently, the packed Christmas service at St James\u2019s in Piccadilly organised by Amos Trust \u2013 a highlight, says Dickson.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s changed me,\u2019\u2019 says Racheal Olawaniotogun, a soprano in the choir. \u201cFrom my past experience to where I am today, words cannot describe it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy self-esteem \u2013 which was so low \u2013 gradually increased, and I was able to interact and ask questions of people. I wasn\u2019t able to do that before.\u201d</p> <p>Originally from Nigeria, Olawaniotogun has been singing with the choir for the past three years.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I sing, I feel joyous. The inside of me feels very light \u2013 everything outside, whatever I\u2019m going through, it disappears.\u201d</p> <p>Olawaniotogun, who is now studying for a degree in accounting, says singing has provided her with coping mechanisms she can use to protect her mental health.</p> <p>She feels uncomfortable in large groups of people, but has gradually come to terms with performing in front of crowds.</p> <p>\u201cBeing in situations like that really helped me,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s start with being in class at university. You\u2019re in a massive room. In choir we focus on each other, we\u2019re in the moment \u2026 so whenever I\u2019m in such a crowd, I just close my eyes and try to focus on one thing.\u201d</p> <p>Dickson agrees that the confidence the women show on stage can impact other areas of their lives. \u201cIt means that when they are speaking to lawyers and solicitors, they can stand up in front of them and look them in the eye and tell them what\u2019s happened to them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"6041e016062431763e6679055c5e79784dea9ff3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6041e016062431763e6679055c5e79784dea9ff3/0_0_3333_5000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Choir member Sonia with her daughter\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Choir member Sonia with her daughter.

That\u2019s why, when we sing, we sound amazing! Because we\u2019re bonded like sisters.\u201d</p> <p>The choir provides a weekly meal and travel expenses to rehearsals and performances, allowing those in the process of seeking asylum, who often have extremely limited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/25/britain-accused-failing-basic-moral-duty-slavery-victims\">access to funds</a>, to participate.</p> <p>A creche is provided for those with children. \u201cIt means you\u2019re not put at a disadvantage because you have a child \u2026 and you can have a couple of hours where you\u2019re not with your child, which \u2013 for any single mother \u2013 is huge,\u201d Dickson says. Providing these facilities helps to promote a supportive atmosphere in which the choir can bond. </p> <p>It doesn\u2019t always work out though, says Dickson. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for people whose trust has been betrayed consistently to hold on to anything that\u2019s good in their lives. Even if you might prove to them time and time again: \u2018I\u2019m not going to let you down, I\u2019m going to be here, what I say will happen,\u2019 it can be very hard for them to trust that.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes you get things where people start talking together in little groups in their own language and undermine the group.</p> <p>\u201cSome are unable to get past that insecurity \u2013 no matter how many times you talk to them \u2013 where in order to make themselves feel better, they have to make someone else feel worse. That\u2019s something very common in people who have been traumatised. We work very hard to address these issues.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/pan-intercultural-arts/sets/amies-freedom-choir-recordings-2018-2019\">  <iframe height=\"460\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F825417533&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Dickson and her co-facilitator Anna Samant, who accompanies the women on the piano, aim to create a culture of respect by asking the women to sign a contract that they help to write when they join. \u201cThey understand that everyone has the right to their own religion and sexuality, and no one has the right to undermine that,\u201d Dickson says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"7b6406fc176cba18c5caf77594e77579dbebad15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b6406fc176cba18c5caf77594e77579dbebad15/0_0_3333_5000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Patience\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patience, a member of the choir</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Dragoi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"8d342a4906b873971993099c0c7a56668d6ecdf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d342a4906b873971993099c0c7a56668d6ecdf1/0_0_3333_5000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Patience\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hadia, a member of the choir</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Dragoi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Patience (left) and Hadia (right), members of the Alumni choir</p></li> </ul> <p>Samant and Dickson also try to foster a spirit of cultural awareness by putting together songs that incorporate musical traditions from the women\u2019s countries of origin, such as Souall\u00e9, which blends a Guyanese folk song with one popular in Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p> <p>For Olawaniotogun, the diversity of the choir is a strength. \u201cThere are different people, new faces.

Their first song quietens the room and acts as an introduction. \u201cWe are Amie, beautiful and strong,\u201d they sing a cappella, their floral headdresses complementing the reds, golds and greens of the Christmas trees behind them. Each woman\u2019s journey to this spot in the West End has been a long one. The members of Amies Freedom Choir are all survivors of modern slavery, trafficked into the UK from the Caribbean, Africa, eastern Europe or south-east Asia. They are just some of the thousands of women brought to the UK to be forced into domestic labour or prostitution \u2013 a problem that continues to grow, according to a Salvation Army report that states there has been a 21% increase in the number of trafficking victims seeking support in 2019. Amies Freedom Choir perform in London, wearing headdresses made by Clea Broad For the singers whose voices fill the vast church on a cold December evening, joining Amies \u2013 French for \u201cfemale friends\u201d \u2013 marked the end of one journey but the start of another. Aside from physical injuries and the practical concerns of navigating the complex British immigration system, those who escape modern slavery often suffer from mental health issues including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. \u201cWhen they join they have difficulty standing up and saying their name out loud \u2026 they are terrified to do that,\u2019\u2019 says the conductor and project director, Adwoa Dickson. The first thing they practise is saying their name to the group. \u201cThey learn to say: \u2018I am here, I am proud, and I own this space,\u2019\u201d says Dickson. Alongside fellow co-founder Annabel Rook, Dickson started the project in 2010 as a weekly drama workshop to help rebuild the confidence of female survivors of human trafficking referred to them by frontline charities. They soon found that singing had a \u201cpreviously unseen\u201d effect on the women, and decided to set up a dedicated group. Dickson says she can often see the effects of trauma in the physicality of new members. In a case study of one new recruit, Dickson wrote that when the woman was not singing, she would \u201csit on her chair holding her arms around herself, self-soothing by rocking back and forth\u201d. Using her voice effected a dramatic change, though, reported Dickson. \u201cThe moment she engaged in vocalising musically, she became a different person.\u201d The choir starts by playing group games, before moving on to rehearsals and eventually \u2013 for those who wish \u2013 performances. The \u201calumni choir\u201d, made up of women who wanted to stay on after an initial year following their referral to Amies, has gone on to perform for the Desmond Tutu Foundation, Sadiq Khan at City Hall and, most recently, the packed Christmas service at St James\u2019s in Piccadilly organised by Amos Trust \u2013 a highlight, says Dickson. \u201cIt\u2019s changed me,\u2019\u2019 says Racheal Olawaniotogun, a soprano in the choir. \u201cFrom my past experience to where I am today, words cannot describe it.\u201d \u201cMy self-esteem \u2013 which was so low \u2013 gradually increased, and I was able to interact and ask questions of people. I wasn\u2019t able to do that before.\u201d Originally from Nigeria, Olawaniotogun has been singing with the choir for the past three years. \u201cWhen I sing, I feel joyous. The inside of me feels very light \u2013 everything outside, whatever I\u2019m going through, it disappears.\u201d Olawaniotogun, who is now studying for a degree in accounting, says singing has provided her with coping mechanisms she can use to protect her mental health. She feels uncomfortable in large groups of people, but has gradually come to terms with performing in front of crowds. \u201cBeing in situations like that really helped me,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s start with being in class at university. You\u2019re in a massive room. In choir we focus on each other, we\u2019re in the moment \u2026 so whenever I\u2019m in such a crowd, I just close my eyes and try to focus on one thing.\u201d Dickson agrees that the confidence the women show on stage can impact other areas of their lives. \u201cIt means that when they are speaking to lawyers and solicitors, they can stand up in front of them and look them in the eye and tell them what\u2019s happened to them.\u201d Choir member Sonia with her daughter (left) and Francesca Ojefua with her daughter Geri (right). Ojefua, along with fellow junior co-facilitator Shamuna Rahman, acts as pastoral support to the choir While the nature of the women\u2019s arrival in the UK means most have no support network, the choir offers a chance to make friends. \u201cYou laugh, you eat together \u2013 we don\u2019t have that, we don\u2019t have a family here, we\u2019re more alone,\u2019\u2019 says Olawaniotogun. \u201cWe\u2019re like a family. That\u2019s why, when we sing, we sound amazing! Because we\u2019re bonded like sisters.\u201d The choir provides a weekly meal and travel expenses to rehearsals and performances, allowing those in the process of seeking asylum, who often have extremely limited access to funds, to participate. A creche is provided for those with children. \u201cIt means you\u2019re not put at a disadvantage because you have a child \u2026 and you can have a couple of hours where you\u2019re not with your child, which \u2013 for any single mother \u2013 is huge,\u201d Dickson says. Providing these facilities helps to promote a supportive atmosphere in which the choir can bond. It doesn\u2019t always work out though, says Dickson. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for people whose trust has been betrayed consistently to hold on to anything that\u2019s good in their lives. Even if you might prove to them time and time again: \u2018I\u2019m not going to let you down, I\u2019m going to be here, what I say will happen,\u2019 it can be very hard for them to trust that. \u201cSometimes you get things where people start talking together in little groups in their own language and undermine the group. \u201cSome are unable to get past that insecurity \u2013 no matter how many times you talk to them \u2013 where in order to make themselves feel better, they have to make someone else feel worse. That\u2019s something very common in people who have been traumatised. We work very hard to address these issues.\u201d Dickson and her co-facilitator Anna Samant, who accompanies the women on the piano, aim to create a culture of respect by asking the women to sign a contract that they help to write when they join. \u201cThey understand that everyone has the right to their own religion and sexuality, and no one has the right to undermine that,\u201d Dickson says. Patience (left) and Hadia (right), members of the Alumni choir Samant and Dickson also try to foster a spirit of cultural awareness by putting together songs that incorporate musical traditions from the women\u2019s countries of origin, such as Souall\u00e9, which blends a Guyanese folk song with one popular in Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For Olawaniotogun, the diversity of the choir is a strength. \u201cThere are different people, new faces. You adjust and it\u2019s really amazing.\u201d Her favourite song to sing is Osprey, which begins with the lyrics: \u201cFlying high, flying free, osprey, on the wind you ride\u201d. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re singing a song, it\u2019s like you\u2019re telling a story\u201d, she explains. \u201cSometimes when I\u2019m singing and the song attaches a meaning to me, it makes me cry because it\u2019s so emotional. \u201cIt\u2019s powerful\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "We will leave our live coverage of the bushfire crisis there. There is a statewide total fire ban in place for NSW from midnight tonight, as well as total fire bans in the Wimmera district of Victoria and parts of South Australia. The heatwave, which saw temperatures reach 46.5C in Ceduna and above 40C in Adelaide today, will continue in South Australia and stretch across to Victoria tomorrow. It\u2019s forecast to reach 39.5C in Melbourne on Wednesday and 44C in Mildura. Sydney won\u2019t get really hot until Thursday, but there will be thick smoke around all morning. Stay safe, stay hydrated, and don\u2019t go jogging in the smoke. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow. This is how the rescue operation for those koalas at Kanangra-Boyd National Park was carried out. The heatwave that began in Western Australia last week has reached Adelaide, and temperatures have exceeded 40C in much of the state \u2013 including Adelaide \u2013 with a high of 45.5C in Ceduna. The Gospers Mountain megafire is continuing to burn in Wollemi national park in the Blue Mountains, but is being controlled. It remains active on both sides of Bells Line of Road and fire is increasing in Berambing, but has eased near Wallerawang, Lidsdale and Blackmans Flat. There will be a community meeting about the Gospers Mountain fire at Grose View public school at 7.30 tonight, and a bushfire information point will be open at Cullen Bullen rural fire station between 4pm and 5pm. Watch and act alerts remain in place for the Gregory River fire and Mount Maria fire in Queensland. The communities of Promisedland and Pine Creek near the Cordalba state forest, and Lowmead near Lake Monduran, have been told to evacuate. New South Wales is about to go into a four-day statewide total fire ban, which will coincide with the heatwave. In a stark reminder that the effects of bushfires often extend many years after the fire has been put out, 445 people who were affected by the 2013 Dunalley bushfires in Tasmania have launched a class action against those they allege were responsible for the fire. The Dunalley fire destroyed 193 homes and 186 other properties, including the Dunalley school and police station. The cost of the fire is estimated to be more than $100m. A terrifying photograph of one family sheltering from the flames under a jetty was the subject of one of Guardian Australia\u2019s first reports. AAP reports that legal papers for the class action were lodged with the supreme court of Hobart, alleging that a man and a woman were negligent in lighting or failing to properly put out a campfire which later flared and burned through 25,000 hectares. They claim that a campfire was lit in a tree stump at a property in Forcett, 20km north-east of Dunalley, on 12 December 2013. It is alleged dirt was kicked on to the stump and two half-buckets of water poured on the fire, with the belief it had been extinguished. The woman on 1 January saw steam coming from stump after rain but did not take any steps to investigate, it is also claimed. Two days later, in hot, dry and windy weather and when the fire danger was very high to severe, the smouldering fire spread to grass and then into bushland. The class action claims the man and woman ought to have known when they lit the campfire in December there was a risk of fire spreading over a wide area. A rescue operation is under way to protect a significant wild koala population in the Kanangra-Boyd national park in the Blue Mountains from the threat of bushfire and extreme heat. The Kanangra-Boyd koalas are directly in the path of a 140,000-hectare bushfire. They\u2019re also one of the most genetically diverse wild koala populations in the country and, crucially, one of only two chlamydia-free wild koala populations in NSW. The organisation Science for Wildlife and the Taronga Wildlife hospital have rescued a small group \u2013 three adult males and five adult females, four of which have joeys \u2013 and taken them to the wildlife hospital until it is safe to release them to the wild. It is one of five areas of significant koala population under threat from the Blue Mountains fires including the Gospers Mountain megafire, Science for Wildlife\u2019s director, Dr Kellie Leigh, said. We have found at least five areas that support significant numbers of koalas and three of those are currently being hit by bushfires. I spoke to the NPWS who are dealing with these fires, and they gave us their full support to get some out. The national park is closed to the public due to fire risk but they gave us a two-day window when it was safe to go in in front of the fire. These koalas are hard to find and catch. We wish could have saved more but we\u2019re glad we could rescue this group. A lot of good people helped at very short notice. Koalas are a threatened species and are vulnerable to extinction in many parts of their range due to habitat loss, Leigh says. Saving each and every koala population is vital to the species\u2019 survival. It\u2019s just reached 40C in Adelaide. On that topic, Victoria is set to cop the heat tomorrow. Melbourne is forecast to reach 39C. A heat health alert has also been issued for the north of the state. Bendigo is set to hit 42C, and Echuca, Swan Hill and Mildura will reach between 43C-45C. Today it\u2019s already 36.4C in Mildura, 34.4C in Shepparton, 33.5C in Albury, and 30.1C at Melbourne airport. For eastern states the heatwave will be worse at the end of the week, posing a concern for athletes at the weekend. There\u2019s an important discussion to be had here, reminiscent of the haze in Sydney that shrouded a Sheffield Shield cricket match last week. At the time, New South Wales spinner Steve O\u2019Keefe said the air was \u201cnot healthy\u201d and \u201ctoxic\u201d, and said Cricket Australia needed to look at its air quality policy. At Sydney\u2019s Wynyard station, the Red Cross and the City of Sydney have installed a dramatic burnt Christmas tree. Created from wood from fire-hit areas, it is part of a charity drive to collect Christmas donations for those affected. In NSW, it\u2019s 37.9C in Bourke and 35.8C in Mildura. It\u2019s 30.5C in Canberra. The latest Bureau of Meteorology observations: it is 39.5C in Adelaide\u2019s city centre, and the forecast is for 40C. It\u2019s 42.1C in Port Augusta, and 44.5C in Ceduna. Residents along Tableland and Cross roads are being told to prepare to leave with the Mount Maria bushfire at watch and act level. The fire is burning in the vicinity of Cross, Hills, Wytallabah and Kirkpatrick roads but no properties are under threat. But Queensland fire and emergency warns the situation could change quickly. NSW RFS reports an increase in fire activity for the massive Gospers Mountain fire near Bells Line of Road and Mount Wilson Road but no properties are under threat. There are reports that the heatwave and fires are resulting in a number of Christmas events being cancelled. The rural fire brigade for my home town of Winmalee in the Blue Mountains, for example, has cancelled taking Santa to some parts of the town because of the predicted high fire situation. AAP reports that NSW Health has warned that if you see bats and flying foxes in distress over summer, don\u2019t touch them: People should avoid rescuing distressed bats and flying foxes during mass die-offs over the summer. NSW Health\u2019s zoonotic disease manager, Keira Glasgow, says humans could catch a rabies-like infection while trying to rescue dying animals. \u201cMost people scratched or bitten by a bat have been trying to rescue them \u2013 it is essential that people do not touch bats to avoid being infected,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cWhile human infection is very rare, if not prevented lyssavirus progresses to a rabies-like illness which is almost always fatal.\u201d Large numbers of bat deaths are associated with heatwaves or a lack of food. NSW Health says the cause of current deaths isn\u2019t known but they were likely to continue over summer. Three people have died from Australian bat lyssavirus since 1996. If people are bitten they should clean the wound with soap and water for at least five minutes before applying antiseptic and seeking medical advice, NSW Health says. Don\u2019t use drones near fires. We\u2019ve seen a few of these warnings in the past few weeks but it bears repeating. Fire and Rescue NSW\u2019s chief remote pilot, Anthony Wallgate, said in a Faebook post that firefighters increasingly rely on drones to collect data and monitor fires when the public uses drones it can make it dangerous for everyone. \u201cIf members of the public fly drones in or near a fire area, then we can\u2019t do our job,\u201d he said. \u201cFixed-wing and rotary aircraft can\u2019t fly and are unable to fight the fires as we are forced to ground all aircraft for safety reasons.\u201d Residents in Promisedland and Pine Creek are being told to prepare to leave. The fire in Elliott River state forest is at watch and act level. The fronts of the fire are travelling in a north and north-westerly direction. Timed without irony, the federal resources minister, Matt Canavan, has sent out a press release on the \u201cstrong international demand for Australian coal\u201d. It goes into great detail about the government\u2019s plans to wind down its coal production for the sake of the planet, as recommended by world-leading scientists ... no, it doesn\u2019t. Canavan is drawing our attention to a report by the International Energy Agency which he says has forecast coal will remain \u201can important part of the global energy mix\u201d after being the source of 38% of the world\u2019s electricity in 2018. \u201cThe IEA report shows Australia is well placed to take advantage of the shifts in international demand, and to supply markets in south-east Asia and India as new coal-based electricity generation comes on line over the coming years,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the sake of Aussie jobs and our dynamic regional communities we need to grasp the opportunities that coal presents, both here and overseas.\u201d Some more information on those Queensland fires from AAP: Two communities in south-east Queensland have been told to get ready to leave as two dangerous bushfires rage north of Bundaberg. The residents of Mount Maria, about 75km north of Bundaberg, have been warned to be prepared as the fire burns close to homes on the eastern side of the town. The fire was at watch and act level this morning. Another at Promisedland and Pine Creek was also at watch and act and residents have been told to prepare to leave ahead of a fire burning in the Elliott River state forest. The leave now warning was also issued for Gregory River (north of Childers) yesterday. Queensland police have increased the size of an exclusion area in the region. The area is now bound by Cedars Road, the Burnett River, Onoprienkos Road and Newlands Road. Childers Road is closed in both directions. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, says bushfires have already taken a \u201ctragic\u201d toll on the state, AAP reports, but she feels current resourcing is meeting the state\u2019s needs. \u201cWhen you have extreme fire fronts this large, people have to make decisions about what to protect, where to put priorities, where to put resources and I have every confidence that our teams are doing an exceptional job,\u201d Berejiklian said today. \u201cIf you look at how bad the fires have been and how widespread they\u2019ve been, it\u2019s pretty much a miracle the lives lost haven\u2019t been more, and I\u2019m deeply grateful for that.\u201d She said NSW was resourced to meet the crisis: \u201cI feel at this stage that our resourcing is meeting needs.\u201d Six people have died so far this season and more than 720 homes have been lost. The NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers, says firefighters will not be able to contain every blaze before conditions deteriorate. \u201cWhile we\u2019re very concerned about the Gospers Mountain fire, there are more than 100 fires burning throughout the state,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone of them could cause problems over ensuing days.\u201d The most recent update from Queensland\u2019s fire service on this Gregory River fire is from about two hours ago, but it is at a watch and act level with residents told to be ready to activate their fire plan. A local ABC reporter, Johanna Marie, reports the Bruce highway has been closed between Bundaberg and Childers. At the moment there are no emergency level fires, despite the continuing seriousness of the crisis. In NSW there are about 100 fires burning at advice level. In Queensland there are three fires at watch and act, and five at advice level. In Western Australia there are 15 at advice level fires. In Victoria eight fires are at advice level. In South Australia firefighters have contained a grass fire at Myponga, but warnings are still current. A reminder that \u201cheatwaves are Australia\u2019s deadliest severe weather\u201d with this outlook from the Bureau of Meteorology yesterday at the start of what it\u2019s calling a week of \u201cexceptional heat\u201d. It\u2019s likely to break numerous December and all-time temperature records across the country, and we might even top Australia\u2019s warmest day on record (7 January 2013) which had 40.3 C as a nationwide average. Here\u2019s a very quick wrap-up of what we\u2019re looking at, and it\u2019s not good news, with maps showing a lot of purple (a new colour they had to add to the temperature guidelines in recent years). \u201cAustralia is burning while we turn a blind eye to the driving force which is climate change and a warming planet.\u201d Former fire commissioner Greg Mullins and a number of former emergency service heads held a press conference a short time ago, addressing the nation on the bushfire crisis \u201cand the leadership vacuum in Canberra\u201d. \u201cHere in NSW the fires are totally unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cMore country has been burned, three times more homes lost than our worst previous fire season in history, and the fires are still burning. We have a heatwave coming. Who knows what that will do, and the driving force behind this is climate change.\u201d Mullins said the prime minister had declined their repeated requests to meet. They have met ministers David Littleproud and Angus Taylor and given them a list of suggestions. They\u2019re confident of a response, Mullins says. \u201cHowever, it falls to us because of that leadership vacuum to call an emergency bushfire summit after this summer. When the experts, the firefighters, are available and taking a well-earned rest. We don\u2019t know when that will be. Normally it would be March but it might be April, it might be May.\u201d Mullins says he wants to see farmers, health professionals, Indigenous people, firefighters, people from the military and politicians from all levels of government at the summit. \u201cIt\u2019s no good saying we\u2019re only a small emitter of carbon dioxide,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not true. Amongst about 200 countries, we\u2019re number 17. When we add in the coal we sell to other countries we come up to about number five. \u201cWe have no moral leadership as we saw in Madrid. The bushfires weren\u2019t even mentioned. Other countries were aghast.\u201d The lovely year six kids at Windsor public school have donated their annual fundraising to the RFS. We previously reported the RFS is confident it will be able to keep the Mount Piper power station safe but was a little more concerned about the fire\u2019s proximity to the Springvale coalmine. Jamie Hanson, head of campaigns at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, has raised comparisons with Victoria\u2019s Hazelwood mine fire in 2014 which emitted dangerous toxic fumes after it caught alight from a nearby bushfire. \u201cThese chemicals are extremely toxic and dangerous to communities and families, but especially the Australians most vulnerable to health impacts, such as children and the elderly,\u201d he said. \u201cNew South Wales is already in the grips of an air pollution crisis from these bushfires, and if a coalmine and coal power station are ignited as a result of this bushfire emergency, the health risks to Australians are extremely high.\u201d It\u2019s a smoky day for Canberra again. A reminder that NSW Health\u2019s advice is that vulnerable people \u2013 the young, elderly and those with respiratory conditions \u2013 should stay indoors, avoid exercise and minimise exposure as much as possible. This was taken today at Sydney\u2019s Central Station and shows masks for sale. But remember, only a few styles work. Sad news from the Mount Tomah botanic gardens in the Blue Mountains, which were affected by the Gospers Mountain fire. The director of horticulture says \u201cmost of the 186-hectare conservation area burned\u201d. The RFS says it is \u201cconcerned\u201d about the potential for the huge Gospers Mountain fire to reach the Springvale coalmine, and the nearby Mount Piper power station. It was reported earlier that the fire was 6km from the power station but the RFS is confident the station will be safe. \u201cThat fire is some kilometres away [from the coalmine] but we are concerned about that,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cCrews on the ground are maintaining obviously close monitoring of that fire because the last thing we need is for that to get into coal areas or worse. \u201cIt is a critical facility and as such fire agencies will do whatever they can to keep fire out of that area.\u201d The outlook is better for the power station \u2013 the RFS says the weather is on its side. \u201cIt\u2019s not directly under threat at the moment. The fire is still a few kilometres away from that area. Luckily it won\u2019t get the worst of the weather because the fire is to the east of that. \u201cThere are a lot of units monitoring that. We are quite confident of protecting that facility.\u201d Fire authorities and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, are giving a press conference. The RFS says roughly a dozen buildings have been destroyed by the Gospers Mountain fire. \u201cWe think there are a dozen homes destroyed in that area but we do have to get crews in there. There are reports of other buildings but we need to get people in to look. Was it sheds? Was it homes? But certainly we\u2019re talking around a dozen homes.\u201d As the bushfire conditions worsen this week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, is on holiday, a move which has angered climate campaigners and opposition MPs. NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge tweeted that the prime minister had \u201can obligation to stick around\u201d. Morrison\u2019s office confirmed to the New Daily that he was on holiday but said widespread claims on social media that the prime minister was in Hawaii were \u201cwrong\u201d. One protest, organised by the school strikers for climate, is planned for Thursday, outside Kirribilli House in Sydney. \u201cExtreme heat is gripping us this week and towns are running out of water, yet our prime minister has fled the country,\u201d organisers said. \u201cThose on the frontlines don\u2019t get this luxury. \u201cScott Morrison tells us to be quiet, chill out, enjoy the cricket whilst failing to show the leadership we need when we\u2019re in the midst of a massive climate crisis.\u201d Morrison is on a family holiday \u2013 not in a professional capacity \u2013 with his wife and daughters during the school holidays. Inland NSW will feel the heat today although the heatwave has not yet made it to the coast (for now). It is forecast to to reach 40C in Bourke and Brewarrina, 41C in Wilcannia, 39C in Broken Hill, 40C in Menindee, 37C in Tamworth and 36C in Albury. It will be 33C in Canberra. The forecast for SA later this week is frightening. Oodnadatta will hit 47C on Wednesday and stay like that until Friday. Port Augusta will reach 47C on Thursday, and Wudinna 48C. On Friday Port Augusta and Whyalla will rise to 48C . Meanwhile Adelaide will experience highs of 42C, 41C and 44C on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. In NSW, the huge Gospers Mountain megafire which covers more than 400,000 hectares is burning within 6km of the Mount Piper power station, the Western Advocate reports. Now that the dust and mercury have settled, we can confirm that various heat records were smashed on Monday across the country. Yesterday Perth posted a maximum of 40.9C. This made it three days in a row above 40C for the WA capital, the first time in December since records began. The average maximum temperature for Perth this month is an astonishing 36C, 7C above average. And it was also the fourth day over 40C day in December, setting another record. The previous record was two, and there are still 14 days in the month to go. In Queensland the temperature in Brisbane hit 41.2C by midday. That equalled the previous record for the city\u2019s hottest day, set in 1981. In Gatton in the Lockyer Valley, a record did fall. The top of 43.2C was the hottest December temperature recorded there, beating the previous record which was set on Saturday. Before that the record had stood since 2002. In Oakey, Beerburrum and Nambour, temperatures also exceeded the previous December record, the Bureau of Meteorology said. And the big news from this morning: a coalition of 29 former fire and emergency chiefs say they will go ahead and hold a bushfire crisis summit with or without Scott Morrison. Last week a former NSW fire chief, Greg Mullins, and a former Queensland fire chief, Lee Johnson, called for the national summit on how Australia should prepare for bushfires in a changed climate. Earlier this year the fire chiefs had asked to meet the prime minister, but said their advice had been ignored. The group is calling for action on the climate crisis which has made bushfire season longer and more intense. Here\u2019s the fire map for NSW. A quiet morning, with all fires are at advice. But yesterday the commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, warned that conditions will deteriorate \u2013 and fires will flare up \u2013 as the heat kicks in. Good morning and welcome to our continuing coverage of the bushfire crisis. The heatwave that settled over Australia yesterday bringing above-40C temperatures to Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland is set to continue and slowly move east. Today Adelaide is forecast to hit 40C and Port Augusta 45C. In WA, Perth will peak at 33C, and the Kimberley and Pilbara will reach 44C. In Queensland, Birdsville will hit 46C, and in NSW, Wilcannia will reach 41C. Overnight three fires in NSW that had flared to emergency levels (Gospers Mountain, Palmers Oaky and Kerry Ridge) were downgraded to watch and act, and further downgraded to advice, thanks to the work of the RFS. In WA, the fire north of Yanchep was also downgraded after it had burned at emergency levels all day across 13,000 hectares.",

A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the US Constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.<br></p>\n    <p>The formal process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment, the equivalent of congressional charges.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>According to arcane&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-106sdoc2/pdf/CDOC-106sdoc2.pdf\">Senate rules</a>, after the House notifies the Senate that impeachment managers have been selected, the secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, tells the House that the Senate is ready to receive the articles. Then impeachment managers appear before the Senate to \u201cexhibit\u201d the articles, and the Senate confirms it will consider the case.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer of the Senate notifies the supreme court chief justice,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/trump-impeachment-john-roberts-chief-justice-trial\">John Roberts</a>, of the impending trial. Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.</p>\n    <p>After the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.</p>\n    <p>The senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.</p>\n    <p>The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded.</p>\n    <p>Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result.

By contrast, Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-inquiry-12-12-2019/h_31b153c5fcf6c0c17b18a0661e93f987?utm_source=zeta&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The+Point+-+December+12%2C+2019&amp;bt_ee=rYIKAWfEou%2FLz1bEo7uNzaiJj%2B0Pd59ZKeXbOcJPLE2lmHcNm1fodIZvy4PcYdW8&amp;bt_ts=1576193467577\">predicted</a> his party will remain united in opposition to articles of impeachment.</p> \n<p>Not a single House Republican voted for a resolution outlining the next stage of the impeachment proceedings. Two Democrats broke from their party, a rhetorical gift to Republicans who touted \u201cbipartisan opposition\u201d to the investigation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very sad thing for our country but it seems to be very good for me politically,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday, moments after the House judiciary committee approved the articles of impeachment on a party-line vote.</p> \n<p>Pelosi has insisted that she never wanted to impeach the president. She was in Congress during the impeachment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton\">Bill Clinton</a>, when the then House speaker, Newt Gingrich, resigned after wrongly predicting that the effort would help Republicans during the 1998 congressional midterm elections. During Pelosi\u2019s first tenure as speaker, she resisted calls from her party to impeach George W Bush over the Iraq war. She managed a similar approach with Trump throughout the Mueller investigation.</p> \n<p>She warned that Trump was \u201cgoading\u201d Democrats into a divisive impeachment investigation. As talk of impeachment intensified, she insisted that she would rather see Trump \u201cin prison\u201d than impeached. But Trump, she said, left Congress \u201cno choice\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe facts of the Ukraine situation,\u201d she said, explaining her transformation on impeachment. \u201cIt just changed everything.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite her initial reluctance to impeach, which angered some corners of her caucus, she has largely earned their praise for her \u201cexpeditious\u201d and \u201cdeliberate\u201d handling of the proceedings.</p> \n<p>Pelosi has maintained tight control over the impeachment process. She decided with her lieutenants to keep the articles of impeachment narrowly focused on Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, rather than to charge him with a third article of impeachment for obstruction of justice based on the evidence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/apr/18/mueller-report-trump-russia-key-takeaways\">uncovered</a> during the course of the Mueller investigation. The effect, Trump said recently, is an \u201cimpeachment-lite\u201d. But Democratic leaders believe it will help protect the party\u2019s most vulnerable members, who only came out in support of an impeachment inquiry after Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine were revealed.</p> \n<p>In recent weeks, she has displayed rare flashes of frustration when pressed on the motives behind her leap on impeachment. \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me,\u201d she told a reporter who asked if she hated the president.</p> \n<p>\u201c<em>He</em> is the one who is dividing the country on this,\u201d she said, referring to Trump. \u201c<em>We</em> are honoring the constitution of the United States.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last week, less than an hour after she formally accused Trump of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d, Pelosi announced that congressional negotiators had reached a trade agreement with the administration, a top campaign promise for the president.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe certainly wouldn\u2019t miss any opportunities because of the present occupant in the White House,\u201d Pelosi said at the Politico\u2019s Women Rule Summit last week. Matter-of-factly, she added: \u201cIt\u2019s just not worth it, in my view.\u201d</p>",

In a matter of days, she dropped her objections and launched a formal impeachment inquiry. Pelosi\u2019s evolution from holdout to leader in the process has pushed a president to the brink of impeachment for only the third time in US history. With the House poised to vote this week, impeaching the 45th president of the United States for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress is a legacy-defining moment for a speaker whose career has already had many. \u201cIn the dark days of the revolution, Thomas Paine said, \u2018The times have found us,\u2019\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe think the times have found us now.\u201d The outcome is all-but assured. The Democratic-controlled House is expected to easily pass both articles of impeachment. But the margin could matter. While public support for impeachment has climbed since September, polling indicates that support for it remains below 50%. Democrats who break from the party could help bolster Republicans\u2019 claim that opposition to impeachment is bipartisan. They could also harm some of the so-called \u201cfrontline\u201d Democrats who are risking their political future by supporting Trump\u2019s removal from office. \u201cThis is a vote that people will have to come to their own conclusion on,\u201d Pelosi told reporters. \u201cThe facts are irrefutable.\u201d She said her leadership team will not \u201cwhip\u201d the vote, meaning members will not be pressured to stand with the party. She declined to say how many Democrats might vote against the articles of impeachment. Privately Democrats estimate that they could lose between two to half a dozen. By contrast, Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, has predicted his party will remain united in opposition to articles of impeachment. Not a single House Republican voted for a resolution outlining the next stage of the impeachment proceedings. Two Democrats broke from their party, a rhetorical gift to Republicans who touted \u201cbipartisan opposition\u201d to the investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad thing for our country but it seems to be very good for me politically,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday, moments after the House judiciary committee approved the articles of impeachment on a party-line vote. Pelosi has insisted that she never wanted to impeach the president. She was in Congress during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, when the then House speaker, Newt Gingrich, resigned after wrongly predicting that the effort would help Republicans during the 1998 congressional midterm elections. During Pelosi\u2019s first tenure as speaker, she resisted calls from her party to impeach George W Bush over the Iraq war. She managed a similar approach with Trump throughout the Mueller investigation. She warned that Trump was \u201cgoading\u201d Democrats into a divisive impeachment investigation. As talk of impeachment intensified, she insisted that she would rather see Trump \u201cin prison\u201d than impeached. But Trump, she said, left Congress \u201cno choice\u201d. \u201cThe facts of the Ukraine situation,\u201d she said, explaining her transformation on impeachment. \u201cIt just changed everything.\u201d Despite her initial reluctance to impeach, which angered some corners of her caucus, she has largely earned their praise for her \u201cexpeditious\u201d and \u201cdeliberate\u201d handling of the proceedings. Pelosi has maintained tight control over the impeachment process. She decided with her lieutenants to keep the articles of impeachment narrowly focused on Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, rather than to charge him with a third article of impeachment for obstruction of justice based on the evidence uncovered during the course of the Mueller investigation. The effect, Trump said recently, is an \u201cimpeachment-lite\u201d. But Democratic leaders believe it will help protect the party\u2019s most vulnerable members, who only came out in support of an impeachment inquiry after Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine were revealed. In recent weeks, she has displayed rare flashes of frustration when pressed on the motives behind her leap on impeachment. \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me,\u201d she told a reporter who asked if she hated the president. \u201cHe is the one who is dividing the country on this,\u201d she said, referring to Trump. \u201cWe are honoring the constitution of the United States.\u201d Last week, less than an hour after she formally accused Trump of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d, Pelosi announced that congressional negotiators had reached a trade agreement with the administration, a top campaign promise for the president. \u201cWe certainly wouldn\u2019t miss any opportunities because of the present occupant in the White House,\u201d Pelosi said at the Politico\u2019s Women Rule Summit last week. Matter-of-factly, she added: \u201cIt\u2019s just not worth it, in my view.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Skoon Gallery, Isle of Harris, Hebrides The light and landscapes of the Hebrides have long been a huge draw for artists, and there are several small galleries dotted around the white sand bays, crags and bogs of beautiful Harris. Skoon deserves special consideration for its matchless views and darn good Dundee marmalade cake, brownies and hot smoked South Uist salmon on oatcakes. All work shown and sold here is by resident artist Andrew John Craig: the prime subjects for his oils are sweeping Harris beaches, and smeary sunsets. \u2022 Free, skoon.com Hestercombe, Taunton, Somerset Hestercombe is set in immaculate Georgian and Edwardian gardens with waterfalls, lakes, Victorian shrubbery and formal beds \u2013 but unlike most galleries on old English estates, where dark, gilt-framed oil paintings sit between suits of armour, this one is daringly innovative. Works by Marc Quinn, Tracey Emin, Peter Doig and Richard Long have featured in exhibitions here, and until 9 February 2020 Ben Rivers\u2019 Urthworks explores themes of sci-fi, dystopian futures and climate change, connecting Urth, the Norse goddess of fate, and the novel Earthworks by Brian Aldiss, about the world after ecological breakdown. Surreal, geological images are accompanied by films shot in Somerset. \u2022 Adult \u00a312.50, child \u00a36.25, hestercombe.com Goldmark Gallery, Uppingham, Rutland Musicians including Ralph McTell, Eliza Carthy and Richard Thompson have played this brilliant little gallery\u2019s 60-seat Front Room gig space. There are occasional jazz concerts, film screenings and talks with lunch. On other days, there\u2019s free coffee, tea or water for visitors. The art is scattergun, vast and great: its 50,000 stock items include works by Le Corbusier and Henri Matisse, and bronzes by Elisabeth Frink. An exhibition of John Farrington oil paintings is scheduled for February. Ceramics are huge here, with four exhibitions a year, while greats including Eduardo Paolozzi and Paula Rego have used the print workshop. The gallery is a very good reason to visit this attractive market town. \u2022 Free, goldmarkart.com The Secret Garden Gallery, Lochranza, Isle of Arran Lochranza, the most northerly village on the glorious isle of Arran, is a work of art in itself, spread around the ruins of a 13th-century castle, home to a herd of red deer, and nudging against a sea loch with a backdrop of spectacular peaks. Here, a converted church, Castlekirk Arthouse, houses the Secret Garden Gallery and three bed and breakfast guest rooms. The gallery walls are hung with work by local and visiting artists, there are occasional gigs and workshops, and guests are encouraged to make their own art while staying here, or bring an instrument and play a tune. \u2022 Free entry, doubles from \u00a370 B&amp;B, castlekirk.co.uk Harley Gallery, Welbeck, Nottinghamshire On the great Welbeck estate in Sherwood Forest, the Harley is an acclaimed modern building on the ruins of a Victorian gasworks. It hosts five contemporary exhibitions a year, of photography, art and ceramics. Next door is the Portland Collection of treasures belonging to the Dukes of Portland, whose seat this has been since 1607, in a building that won the Riba National Award in 2016. The site also has a School of Artisan Food, artists\u2019 studios, a craft shop and a cafe using local veggies and the estate\u2019s meat. Coming up are Brick by Brick, featuring 18 international artists working with Lego, and,in June, the Earth and Fire ceramics fair. \u2022 Free entry, harleygallery.co.uk MoMa, Machynlleth, Powys In a little Welsh town famous for its natural environment, Centre for Alternative Technology and comedy festival, the Museum of Modern Art Machynlleth packs a punch with its programme by exciting Welsh artists. Seven exhibition spaces are attached to an old Wesleyan chapel, now a centre for performing arts, where an auditorium with pews hosts music, drama and lectures. A current exhibition of \u201cfauxidermy\u201d by Helly Powell has mounted fabric animal heads made from Welsh blanket material inspired by a collection of early Welsh folk tales called the Beasts of Mabinogion. Flat whites, toasties and soups feature on the simple menu in its cosy Cafe Glas. \u2022 Free, moma.machynlleth.org.uk Watts Gallery Artists\u2019 Village, Surrey Painter and sculptor George Frederic Watts was considered one of the finest Victorian artists, and his wife Mary \u2013 whom he married when he was 69 \u2013 was a famous designer, and both became philanthropists. Limnerslease, their Arts and Crafts home in Compton, is a gorgeous half-timbered building surrounded by pretty woodlands that visitors can tour. The contemporary gallery shows groundbreaking work (currently In Print: Capturing Light, about printmaking, until 5 Jan). The Welsh rarebit and the chocolate cake in the tea shop are almost as highly praised as the art. \u2022 Adults \u00a311.50, children free, wattsgallery.org.uk Gallery at Home, Usk, Monmouthshire This converted cow barn is styled like an interiors magazine shoot, with wooden floors, black walls, exposed bulbs and Jield\u00e9 lights. The work is tasteful and edgy, currently photography and work relating to social issues. Making art more accessible to all while remaining thought-provoking is the ethos here, and artists often hold open sessions, workshops and talks. Green fields and mountains are yours for the stomping after a nice fat cake and coffee at a candlelit table in the cafe. \u2022 Free entry, galleryathome.co.uk Thornthwaite Galleries, Keswick, Cumbria Cumbria\u2019s bank barns were where Scottish farmers once housed their cattle to fatten them up over winter before selling them in spring. Now, in one that houses Thornthwaite Galleries and Teashop, it\u2019s ramblers and sightseers who are fattened up, on toasted slabs of plum bread and puffy cheese scones.

As new MPs prepare to be sworn in today in the Commons, Labour is starting to get its house in order after its disastrous election result, with Rebecca Long-Bailey firming as the candidate most likely to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. The Salford MP is good friends with fellow contender Angela Rayner, who now appears to have curtailed her leadership ambitions and is instead aiming for the deputy leader spot. Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is expected to win the backing of the party\u2019s largest donor, Unite, and key Corbyn allies \u2013 though it is not a done deal yet. The leadership contest is expected to formally begin on 7 January and it is a field of six at present \u2013 here are all the contenders. The leadership transition may yet be a painful one; Corbyn is likely to face an angry parliamentary party meeting tonight, with some incensed he still has not apologised for his election failure or contacted the 60 ousted MPs directly. Speaking of transitions, a freshly emboldened Boris Johnson has moved to nail down the Brexit timetable, seeking to set down in law a transition end date of 31 December 2020.

      "bodyText": "Mining giant Rio Tinto\u2019s plans to clean up the controversial Ranger uranium mine have been thrown into doubt after objections from a Singapore-based hedge fund. The mine is owned by ASX-listed Energy Resources Australia (ERA), which in turn is 68% owned by Rio Tinto. ERA is required to remediate the mine site and return it to a state fit to be incorporated in the surrounding Kakadu national park, by 2026. There have been longstanding concerns about the risk of a uranium leak from the Ranger mine, amplified by its location at the eastern end of the remote national park in the Northern Territory. A decade ago it was revealed contaminated water was leaking every day from a tailings dam. In 2013 a burst leach tank at the mine released up to 1m litres of acidic radioactive slurry. Those concerns, which contributed heavily to Mirrar native title holders insisting that mining cease, underscore the risk if the site is left without remediation. Last month, ERA asked shareholders to tip in an additional $476m to finance the clean-up operation, and Rio Tinto said it would guarantee the money if no other shareholders wanted to contribute. If no other shareholders participate \u2013 quite likely as the deal is not expected to generate any financial return for ERA \u2013 Rio Tinto will end up with more than 95% of the company\u2019s shares. As part of the underwriting agreement, ERA also undertook not to develop a mine at Jabiluka, to the north of Ranger, which has been strenuously opposed by the Mirrar traditional owners. However, the entire plan was thrown into disarray on Wednesday after the Takeovers Panel put conditions on the deal following a complaint from Singapore hedge fund Zentree Investments, which owns about 16% of ERA and is controlled by investor Richard Magides. Magides could not be reached for comment but in the past has reportedly accused Rio Tinto of trying to get its hands on $646m in tax losses run up by ERA. He also claimed Rio Tinto has overstated the cost of remediation and called for the development of Jabiluka, which ERA has agreed not to mine without the consent of the traditional owners, and another resource, Ranger 3 Deeps, which the company regards as uneconomic. The deal proposed by ERA and Rio Tinto would have allowed Rio Tinto to compulsorily buy Zentree\u2019s stake if it ended up with more than 90% of the company\u2019s shares. This would give it complete control of the company and allow it to consolidate it into its corporate group or wind it up. But the Takeovers Panel has barred Rio Tinto from doing so for a year. The panel found that \u201cRio Tinto sought to consolidate control and acquire ERA\u201d through the underwriting arrangement because minority shareholders were unlikely to participate, but had not given enough information to the market about its intentions once it had the company in its grip. ERA had also not done enough to ensure a board committee looking at the issue was sufficiently independent of Rio Tinto, the panel said. It is not clear whether Rio Tinto would be willing to stump up the $464m potentially required if it is barred from taking full control of ERA. Guardian Australia understands traditional owners remain confident that Rio Tinto will do so regardless. \u201cAdequate funding for comprehensive clean-up of the Ranger site is essential,\u201d a Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation spokesperson said. \u201c[Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation] welcomes ERA and Rio Tinto\u2019s commitment to finding a funding solution to restore country.\u201d On Friday, Rio Tinto applied for a review of the decision.",

      "body": "<p>I met my first husband in London while working in a pub in West Kensington. I had just turned 18 when we got married at Fulham register office. We moved in with his mum in Hackney, but the relationship hit the rocks when another member of his family arrived on the scene. I don\u2019t know if it was jealousy or something else, but when we were left alone one evening this man took a cut-throat razor from his pocket, held it to my throat and ordered me to leave. I had been married for only six weeks, but I left \u2013 even though I had nowhere to go.</p> <p>My first night on the street was terrifying. It was winter and it was cold and noisy; I was all alone, not knowing where to turn for help. I realised quickly that the only help I was going to receive was from myself. Back then, platform tickets at Victoria station were only 2p. I figured out that the Dover train would stay in the station from roughly 12.15am to 6.30am. I bedded down on that train with a valid ticket to get me out of any trouble.</p> <p>I mostly kept to myself on the street. I was self-reliant. I stored my clothes in luggage lockers at Victoria and cleaned up in the station\u2019s loos. The only time I depended on others was when I was absolutely penniless. There used to be a cafe at Victoria called the No 9 and I would work with a group of four other homeless people to steal meals. I am not proud of this, but we had to survive.</p> <p>Life was tough on the streets. I spent a year sleeping rough among drug addicts, alcoholics and sex workers. Most of them, despite their problems, were decent people and they would often help in whatever ways they could. When I couldn\u2019t get my head down, I would wander the streets or see out the night in the 24-hour cafes. It was in one of these cafes that my life turned around.</p> <p>I had taken sanctuary in a Wimpy in Leicester Square and was cradling a bowl of soup that had to last all night. A man was staring right at me. I tried not to make eye contact with him, but it didn\u2019t stop him from coming over. He started talking to me and opened up about his life and family. His name was David. We must have sat there for hours. Finally, he offered me a bed for the night.

      "bodyText": "I met my first husband in London while working in a pub in West Kensington. I had just turned 18 when we got married at Fulham register office. We moved in with his mum in Hackney, but the relationship hit the rocks when another member of his family arrived on the scene. I don\u2019t know if it was jealousy or something else, but when we were left alone one evening this man took a cut-throat razor from his pocket, held it to my throat and ordered me to leave. I had been married for only six weeks, but I left \u2013 even though I had nowhere to go. My first night on the street was terrifying. It was winter and it was cold and noisy; I was all alone, not knowing where to turn for help. I realised quickly that the only help I was going to receive was from myself. Back then, platform tickets at Victoria station were only 2p. I figured out that the Dover train would stay in the station from roughly 12.15am to 6.30am. I bedded down on that train with a valid ticket to get me out of any trouble. I mostly kept to myself on the street. I was self-reliant. I stored my clothes in luggage lockers at Victoria and cleaned up in the station\u2019s loos. The only time I depended on others was when I was absolutely penniless. There used to be a cafe at Victoria called the No 9 and I would work with a group of four other homeless people to steal meals. I am not proud of this, but we had to survive. Life was tough on the streets. I spent a year sleeping rough among drug addicts, alcoholics and sex workers. Most of them, despite their problems, were decent people and they would often help in whatever ways they could. When I couldn\u2019t get my head down, I would wander the streets or see out the night in the 24-hour cafes. It was in one of these cafes that my life turned around. I had taken sanctuary in a Wimpy in Leicester Square and was cradling a bowl of soup that had to last all night. A man was staring right at me. I tried not to make eye contact with him, but it didn\u2019t stop him from coming over. He started talking to me and opened up about his life and family. His name was David. We must have sat there for hours. Finally, he offered me a bed for the night. I was reluctant \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the first time that a male stranger had propositioned me with this offer - but for some reason I trusted him. I was right. I had a full night\u2019s sleep on a real bed. When I woke up the next morning, this kind stranger had left me a key, some money and a note, suggesting I buy new clothes. When he returned, he had found me a live-in job at the Hotel InterContinental on Park Lane, where he worked. The speed at which my life was changing felt surreal. It was an amazing feeling to have someone see beyond the scruffy stranger on the street and actually notice me and believe in me. David and I became very close friends. Eventually, I left the hotel and took a job as a housekeeper. A few weeks afterwards, I discovered that David had been killed in a hit-and-run as he got off the bus on Park Lane. For him to lose his life like that was so cruel. He was gentle, kind and never expected anything from me; he didn\u2019t deserve to have his life taken away like that.

      "body": "<p>On the face of it, the centrepiece of Sharon Van Etten\u2019s fifth album is straightforward. Seventeen is magnificent, yes, in its evocation and evolution of that windswept strain of 80s rock that emerged when musicians who predated punk turned their ears to the new wave. But isn\u2019t nostalgia for being a teenager one of the oldest entries in rock\u2019s lexicon? \u201cI used to be free,\u201d she sings, \u201cI used to be 17.\u201d It is on finding out more about Van Etten\u2019s life that one realises she might have more desire than most to retrace her teenage steps and wonder where else they might have led.</p> <p>She was 17 when she entered a relationship that was to dominate the succeeding years. \u201cHe was an addict and abusive and so I just never knew who I would be coming home to,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/06/sharon-van-etten-interview-remind-me-tomorrow\">she told the Observer earlier this year</a>. It wasn\u2019t that Remind Me Tomorrow keeps returning to that part of her past; but it seems as though becoming a parent led Van Etten \u2013 already a devastatingly intimate songwriter \u2013 to look at life in a way that calibrates the joys against the sorrows, to see the darkness but be willing to banish it.</p> <p>The mood is set from the opening seconds of the album. \u201cSitting at the bar, I told you everything / You said, \u2018Holy shit, you almost died,\u201d she sings, beginning I Told You Everything. That song is about recounting something from her past to her partner, about taking the jump from the easy intimacy of friendship to the point where one has to at least partially dismantle the facade and reveal something of what lies behind. It is also a potent symbol of hope: that from the sharing of a devastating confidence can come love.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiWasRqxGcI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BiWasRqxGcI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiWasRqxGcI\">Listen to I Told You Everything on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>At times, Remind Me Tomorrow is uncomplicatedly joyous. Jupiter 4 is as plainly spoken as a supermarket Valentine\u2019s Day card: \u201cOur love\u2019s for real / How\u2019d it take a long, long time / To let us feel?\u201d In Malibu, Van Etten and her companion are \u201cjust a couple of dudes who don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d, cruising around in a little red car. Yet it is also an album that is unsettling, even at its most reassuring.</p> <p>The choice of US indie\u2019s buzziest producer, John Congleton (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/03/angel-olsen-all-mirrors-review\">Angel Olsen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/09/st-vincent-interview\">St Vincent</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/30/future-islands-review-glasgow-barrowlands-far-field\">Future Islands</a>), was a statement that this would not sound like her previous albums \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t. Van Etten had tired of the guitar before making Remind Me Tomorrow, and synths and keyboards are the dominant instruments.

      "bodyText": "On the face of it, the centrepiece of Sharon Van Etten\u2019s fifth album is straightforward. Seventeen is magnificent, yes, in its evocation and evolution of that windswept strain of 80s rock that emerged when musicians who predated punk turned their ears to the new wave. But isn\u2019t nostalgia for being a teenager one of the oldest entries in rock\u2019s lexicon? \u201cI used to be free,\u201d she sings, \u201cI used to be 17.\u201d It is on finding out more about Van Etten\u2019s life that one realises she might have more desire than most to retrace her teenage steps and wonder where else they might have led. She was 17 when she entered a relationship that was to dominate the succeeding years. \u201cHe was an addict and abusive and so I just never knew who I would be coming home to,\u201d she told the Observer earlier this year. It wasn\u2019t that Remind Me Tomorrow keeps returning to that part of her past; but it seems as though becoming a parent led Van Etten \u2013 already a devastatingly intimate songwriter \u2013 to look at life in a way that calibrates the joys against the sorrows, to see the darkness but be willing to banish it. The mood is set from the opening seconds of the album. \u201cSitting at the bar, I told you everything / You said, \u2018Holy shit, you almost died,\u201d she sings, beginning I Told You Everything. That song is about recounting something from her past to her partner, about taking the jump from the easy intimacy of friendship to the point where one has to at least partially dismantle the facade and reveal something of what lies behind. It is also a potent symbol of hope: that from the sharing of a devastating confidence can come love. At times, Remind Me Tomorrow is uncomplicatedly joyous. Jupiter 4 is as plainly spoken as a supermarket Valentine\u2019s Day card: \u201cOur love\u2019s for real / How\u2019d it take a long, long time / To let us feel?\u201d In Malibu, Van Etten and her companion are \u201cjust a couple of dudes who don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d, cruising around in a little red car. Yet it is also an album that is unsettling, even at its most reassuring. The choice of US indie\u2019s buzziest producer, John Congleton (Angel Olsen, St Vincent, Future Islands), was a statement that this would not sound like her previous albums \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t. Van Etten had tired of the guitar before making Remind Me Tomorrow, and synths and keyboards are the dominant instruments. When guitar appears, it can be a disruptor \u2013 as with the massively fuzzed and overdriven line that breaks into the verses of You Shadow. Even on a song as platitudinous as Hands \u2013 written, she said, after arguing with her partner and about forgiving the frivolous offences of everyday life \u2013 the music has a gothic intensity that doesn\u2019t allow the sentiments to sit quietly. (At times, oddly, it sounds like the older sibling to Billie Eilish\u2019s 2019 debut.) Although it uses sounds and textures familiar from the 80s, Remind Me Tomorrow doesn\u2019t sound like an 80s record. But it recalls the kind of 80s pop when older musicians would reach the top end of the charts with sophisticated, modern records that used production techniques from records for teenagers and applied them to songs about adult life. Remind Me Tomorrow is a grownup record that doesn\u2019t sound jaded. It is alive with possibility.",

This is a film forever in an ecstatic rush.</p> <p>As for Chalamet? Luckily, Gerwig gives full rein to the horror of latter-day Laurie, burning through his cash and getting bratty and unattractive, which means his casting worked, for me at least, an absolute treat.</p>",

This is a film which is busy in the best way. Scenes fall over themselves with chatter; generally, of course, from the March sisters \u2013 Jo (Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Beth (Eliza Scanlen) and Amy (Florence Pugh). All the actors are terrific, with Ronan and Pugh standouts. Laura Dern is a balm as Marmie and Meryl Streep muzzles just enough of her camp as Aunt March. Chalamet is an ebullient, nervy Laurie, with Chris Cooper swaddled in beard and tough love as his grandfather and James Norton kindly as his Meg-smitten tutor. There\u2019s a cute cameo, too, for Tracy Letts (who plays the dad in Lady Bird) as Jo\u2019s crass publisher. Gerwig\u2019s big innovation, other than some post-feminist self-authorship revisionism \u2013 which doesn\u2019t feel nearly so grisly as that description suggests \u2013 is to shuffle the timeline. We start with Jo trying to flog stories in New York, then flit back and forth between present day and various stages of flashback. Given that most people will be going in knowing the two big twists (who dies, who turns down who), it\u2019s only sensible. It also freshens the whole thing up. You\u2019re never quite sure of what happens next, and Gerwig proves an innovative editor \u2013 there are great trims and terrific jumps, too. This is a film forever in an ecstatic rush. As for Chalamet? Luckily, Gerwig gives full rein to the horror of latter-day Laurie, burning through his cash and getting bratty and unattractive, which means his casting worked, for me at least, an absolute treat.",

      "body": "<p>People have long used decades to frame the past. Think of how potent \u201cthe 60s\u201d has been. But the artificiality of the exercise means that the more you look at a decade, the more complicated it seems. A decade is experienced in an infinity of ways. It is made up of fragments. It blurs at the edges with other decades. Ghosts of previous ones live on within it, and premonitions of those to come gradually infiltrate it.</p> <p>How will we remember the last 10 years? Above all, as a time of crises. During the 2010s, there have been crises of democracy and the economy; of the climate and poverty; of international relations and national identity; of privacy and technology. There were crises at the start of the decade, and there are crises now. Some of them are the same crises, unsolved. Others are like nothing we have experienced before. Some of them are welcome: old hierarchies collapsing. Others are catastrophes.</p> <p>All these crises, so close together, have made the 2010s seem much longer than the two previous decades. Sometimes, a single day\u2019s events \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/18/brexit-super-saturday-will-the-deal-pass\" title=\"\">a Brexit showdown</a>, a Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/02/how-trump-uses-twitter-storms-to-make-the-political-weather\" title=\"\">meltdown</a> \u2013 have felt more dramatic, and more exhausting to follow, than entire years did during the 1990s and 2000s. In Britain \u2013 supposedly one of the world\u2019s most stable, gradualist democracies \u2013 politics since 2010 has often been manic. Parties have hastily changed their leaders and policies; sometimes their entire guiding philosophies. Last week\u2019s general election was the fourth of the decade; the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s had two apiece.</p> <p>The sheer turmoil of the 2010s has sometimes made what came before seem distant and utterly different. \u201cThe changes we\u2019ve undergone, both wonderful and terrible, are astonishing,\u201d wrote the American social critic <a href=\"https://www.londonreviewbookshop.co.uk/blog/2016/9/hope-in-the-dark---rebecca-solnit\" title=\"\">Rebecca Solnit</a> in 2016. The world of the 2000s, she concluded, \u201chas been swept away\u201d. In place of centrist politicians and steady economic growth, the 2010s have brought shocks, revolts and extremists. Hung parliaments; rightwing populists in power; physical attacks on politicians; Russian influence on western elections; elderly leftists galvanising young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2017/jun/24/corbyn-receives-heros-welcome-at-glastonbury-2017-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Britons</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/13/bernie-sanders-2020-democratic-race\" title=\"\">Americans</a>; rich, rightwing leaders in both countries captivating working-class voters \u2013 scenarios close to unimaginable a decade ago have become familiar, almost expected.</p> <p>And yet beneath this surface frenzy, politics has, in many ways, been stagnant. Throughout Trump\u2019s presidency, his approval ratings have been terrible, but unusually stable. Three-and-a-half years after the referendum, Britain remains almost evenly divided over EU membership. Despite governing disastrously for much of the decade, the Conservatives are still in power.</p> <p>In the 2010s, it has often felt as if everything is up for grabs \u2013 from the future of capitalism to the future of the planet \u2013 and yet nothing has been decided. Between the decade\u2019s sense of stasis and sense of possibility, an enormous tension has built up. It is still awaiting release. In 2010, a few days after that year\u2019s election had, to widespread surprise, produced the decade\u2019s first hung parliament, the philosopher John Gray told me: \u201cBritain will spend something like a decade inching to some sort of new economic and political settlement.\u201d Gray is often seen as a professional pessimist, but this time he was too optimistic.</p> <p>While the decade\u2019s Conservative ascendancy has gone on and on, extraordinary crises have spread through British society. During the 2010s, the average life expectancy, which had been growing almost continuously for a century, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/23/why-is-life-expectancy-falling\" title=\"\">stopped rising</a>. The average wage rose more slowly than in any decade since the Napoleonic wars. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/07/million-more-uk-children-in-poverty-than-in-2010\" title=\"\">million more</a> children with working parents entered poverty. The number of people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/the-empty-doorway\" title=\"\">sleeping rough</a> more than doubled. One of the archetypal British public spaces of the 2000s was St Pancras station in London: once tatty, now renovated, with smart new shops, bustling food outlets and trains to the continent \u2013 a confident intertwining of private prosperity and state spending. Since 2010, its restored Victorian alcoves have filled up with people living in sleeping bags and tents.</p> <p>Beyond the grim new Britain created by a decade of Conservative austerity looms the even bleaker world being created by the climate emergency. Perhaps the most frightening of this year\u2019s many apocalyptic books is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/27/the-uninhabitable-earth-review-david-wallace-wells\" title=\"\">The Uninhabitable Earth</a> by David Wallace-Wells. Its chapter titles read: Heat Death. Hunger. Drowning. Dying Oceans. Unbreathable Air. Wildfire. Plagues. Economic Collapse. Climate Conflict. It\u2019s intended to be a forecast of the planet\u2019s near future that will shock readers out of their complacency. But during the 2010s almost all the disasters that the book names have already started to happen. Global capitalism has largely carried on regardless. For many people in Britain and beyond, the 2010s have been a bad time, with the promise of much worse to come.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>How do you live through such a decade? In Britain, it is a question that people haven\u2019t had to ask for almost half a century \u2013 not since the 1970s, until now the most infamous decade in our modern history. Like the 2010s, it had four elections, a referendum about our relationship with Europe, fears for the environment, a rising threat of political violence, and a pervasive sense of foreboding. In 1978 the social commentator Peter York wrote: \u201cThe real keynotes of the 70s are fragmentation \u2026 fantasy and paranoia \u2013 impossible new situations.\u201d A few months ago, in This Is Not a Drill: An Extinction Rebellion Handbook, the climate activist Dougald Hine <a href=\"http://dougald.nu/negotiating-the-surrender/\" title=\"\">summed up</a> the 2010s in similar terms: \u201cThese are times in which impossible things happen\u201d.</p> <p>Yet in some ways the 2010s have been more frightening than the 70s. Then, the fear was felt more by the elite \u2013 politicians, businessmen \u2013 than by ordinary people, who were still enjoying the last of postwar Britain\u2019s relative egalitarianism and social stability. Nowadays, the fear is almost universal. The creation of social media networks over the last decade and a half, starting with Twitter in 2006, and the conversion of traditional media into non-stop news services, have made awful events seem relentless and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/03/how-the-news-took-over-reality\" title=\"\">impossible to ignore</a>. We have become perpetually anxious.</p> <p>And there seems ever more to be anxious about. The divide in Britain over Europe has become much more bitter. Advocates of undemocratic solutions to Britain\u2019s problems, such as suspending parliament, have moved from the fringes of politics, where they plotted in vain during the 1970s, straight into 10 Downing Street. Meanwhile, the awareness that much of modern life \u2013 air travel, car travel, eating meat, shopping, using plastics \u2013 has malign consequences has grown from a minority preoccupation in the 1970s into an everyday topic. Sometimes in the 2010s, it has felt as if the whole world we have made, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/15/timothy-morton-anthropocene-philosopher\">from the tiniest exhaust particle to the most sprawling conurbation</a>, is toxic. Our language has become precautionary and jittery: \u201csafe spaces\u201d, \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d. Viewed from the 2010s, the fraught 1970s can look like an age of innocence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65e4f2d731e104d097e36c1688a0f208f2d1dc80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65e4f2d731e104d097e36c1688a0f208f2d1dc80/76_78_3368_2020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural of David Bowie in Brixton, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural of David Bowie in Brixton, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty O'Connor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the mid-2010s, and especially in 2016, the year of Trump\u2019s election and the vote for Brexit, there was a persistent online craze for declaring particular years in the 2010s \u201cthe worst ever\u201d. Exaggeration is a wearyingly familiar online mode, and some of the evidence cited was quite narrow and subjective, such as the premature deaths in 2016 of Prince, David Bowie and Carrie Fisher. But the craze spread because it struck a chord. The 2010s have often felt cursed.</p> <p>Yet also during the decade a more scientific group of writers, including the famous psychologist Steven Pinker, started to argue the opposite. Sometimes called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/jul/28/is-the-world-really-better-than-ever-the-new-optimists\" title=\"\">the New Optimists</a>\u201d, they claimed that life around the world in the early 21st century was, in fact, as good as it has ever been \u2013 in terms of health, wealth, amenities and the prevalence of peace. Many of the upward graphs they presented were convincing, as far as they went, but that was usually only up to 2015 \u2013 just before the point at which pessimists usually say the 2010s took a turn for the worse. And when the graphs did go beyond 2015, they were not always reassuring. The number of people living in democracies was falling; the number of people killed in wars and terrorist incidents was rising. As one of the New Optimists\u2019 favourite sources, the website Our World in Data, had to <a href=\"https://environmentaljusticetv.wordpress.com/2019/03/20/our-world-in-data/amp/\" title=\"\">admit</a> this year: \u201cIn some aspects the data suggests the world is getting worse.\u201d</p> <p>It could be a blip. The 2010s could be just a pause in humanity\u2019s erratic upward progress. But there are signs that even Our World in Data doesn\u2019t completely believe that. \u201cOur world today,\u201d it says, \u201cis neither just nor sustainable.\u201d Over the last 10 years, even some of humanity\u2019s cheerleaders have started to lose faith.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Yet to characterise the 2010s as one long crisis is too simple and bleak. A decade usually contains different phases. In Britain, the 2010s can be divided roughly into three. First, from 2010 to 2012, there was a period of turbulence and bewilderment, as the economy, voters and politicians struggled to absorb the shocks from the financial crisis of the late 2000s \u2013 and to accept that the prosperity and relative stability of the previous two decades might be over.</p> <p>Gordon Brown\u2019s ponderous New Labour government fell. David Cameron\u2019s more supple, and shameless, coalition of Conservatives and Lib Dems replaced it. Having gone along with Labour\u2019s fairly expansive approach to public spending for years in opposition, during the 2010 election the Conservatives attacked it as reckless and unaffordable. They claimed that Britain was facing a huge government debt crisis, citing a superficially similar but much deeper one that was already bringing chaos to Greece. It was a form of political message \u2013 the warning of a systemic collapse \u2013 that had been popular in the 1970s and had then fallen gradually into disuse; but it would become a standard practice for all parties as the 2010s went on.</p> <p>Once in government, the Conservatives imposed austerity. At first, the word had an unfamiliar, retro ring, redolent of the 1930s, the last time a British government had carried out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/23/welfare-spending-uk-poorest-austerity-frank-field\" title=\"\">cuts on the scale</a> Cameron intended.<strong> </strong>In response to the return of hard times, another bit of language from the 1930s became ubiquitous in the early 2010s, printed on mugs, posters and tea towels: \u201cKeep Calm and Carry On\u201d. But many Britons did not. During 2010 and 2011 there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/london-riots-escalate-police-battle\" title=\"\">protests and riots</a> across the country \u2013 not on a Greek scale, yet large and sustained enough to spook many commentators. At the end of 2011, with an economic slowdown largely caused by austerity also underway, the latest edition of the Economist newspaper\u2019s annual compendium of predictions, The World in 2012, replaced its usual capitalist cheerleading with warnings about an economic \u201cgreat stagnation\u201d and further \u201cmayhem on the streets\u201d of the west. \u201cThe world won\u2019t end in 2012,\u201d predicted the magazine. \u201cBut at times it will feel as if it is about to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41bfedd04f8767992c3494ac01a5b1dbbf489033\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41bfedd04f8767992c3494ac01a5b1dbbf489033/0_0_3008_1995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rioting in London in August 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rioting in London in August 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Austin/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For some less establishment voices, the turbulence was promising rather than threatening. In 2010, after taking part in large, fierce protests against the education cuts, the political and cultural writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/11/accelerationism-how-a-fringe-philosophy-predicted-the-future-we-live-in\" title=\"\">Mark Fisher</a> declared: \u201cWe\u2019ve broken out of the end of history. What\u2019s certain is that the old world is disintegrating, and soon it will not be possible to even pretend that we can return to it.\u201d </p> <p>Yet all these prophecies were slightly premature. From 2012 to 2015, there was a lull \u2013 the decade\u2019s second phase. The economy recovered. The 2012 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/07/london-2012-olympic-games-changed-britain\" title=\"\">London Olympics</a> distracted people and cheered them up. The same year, Barack Obama was re-elected as US president: there still seemed to be a future for charismatic centrist leaders. Even the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, which for a long time promised to rupture the status quo, ended in a vote for stability.</p> <p>Austerity also proved less politically explosive during the mid-2010s than its critics hoped and some of its advocates feared. The fact that the cuts were cumulative, and so ubiquitous, made austerity hard to organise against \u2013 or even think clearly about in the round. The cuts proved numbing as much as enraging. At the same time, the increases in public spending during the previous decade meant that some state services were well enough equipped by 2010 to absorb the cuts without obvious immediate damage. In 2017, the chief finance officer of a London hospital trust told me that its medical outcomes had only started deteriorating once the cuts had been underway for half a decade. In much of Britain, austerity took a long time to be fully felt.</p> <p>The Conservatives won a majority at the 2015 election before that could happen. A jubilant Cameron told his party conference soon afterwards: \u201cI really believe we\u2019re on the brink of something special \u2026 We can make this era \u2013 these 2010s \u2013 a defining decade for our country \u2026 one which people will look back on and say: \u2018That\u2019s the time when the tide turned.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, many in the political and business elite, untouched by austerity themselves, still believed that the troubled late 2000s and early 2010s had been an aberration, and that the good times had now resumed. For many other people, there was a more tentative hope: that the great unravelling that had begun with the financial crisis could be kept at bay or ignored, at least for a while. You can sense this escapist feeling, still, especially in wealthier parts of Britain, in the queues outside shops with hot new products, in all the heaving, deafening new restaurants. For a lot of people, at least some of the time, the lull of the mid-2010s goes on.</p> <p>Yet since 2015, ever more potent forces have been gathering to disrupt it. The third phase of the 2010s \u2013 the phase we\u2019re in now \u2013 has been more unpredictable, unsettling, and sometimes thrilling, than even the aftermath of the financial crisis. The capture of the Labour party in 2015 by Jeremy Corbyn and the left; the 2016 Brexit vote, and election of Trump; the shock 2017 British election result and hung parliament, the revival of the far right in Britain, the US and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/the-ruthlessly-effective-rebranding-of-europes-new-far-right\" title=\"\">across Europe</a> \u2013 even the fact that this list is so predictable tells us how much political upheaval has become normalised. During the early 2010s, it was hard to say with confidence what Britain would be like \u2013 politically, economically, socially, or in overall mood \u2013 from one year to the next. Nowadays, it\u2019s hard to look a month ahead.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One way to cope with chaos is to accept it. Over the last couple of years, a short, bland sentence has become ubiquitous in British conversations, from interviews with Premier League footballers to soliloquies from Love Island contestants: \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d</p> <p>Usually, it means: \u201cI\u2019m learning to live with something negative\u201d \u2013 a personal setback, a wider injustice, difficult circumstances. It\u2019s a mantra for an age of diminishing expectations, when many people no longer assume \u2013 unlike their postwar predecessors \u2013 that they will become richer than their parents, and live in an ever more sophisticated or just society, on an ever more hospitable planet. When people say \u201cIt is what it is\u201d, they are rarely challenged. Instead, they are usually heard in respectful silence. In a difficult world, fatalism and stoicism are useful qualities.</p> <p>Another coping mechanism is escape. Possibly the most revealing leisure activity of the 2010s is shutting yourself away with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/26/the-30-best-box-sets-to-watch-before-you-die\" title=\"\">TV series</a>: typically a drama set in another country or another era, with an addictive, slowly resolved plot, many characters, elaborate settings, and enough episodes to allow for watching in binges. In an age of squeezed incomes, TV dramas are worlds you can explore on the cheap.</p> <p>But pricier forms of escapism have been in demand, too. Theatre productions promise to be \u201cimmersive\u201d \u2013 one of the decade\u2019s favourite promotional terms \u2013 by placing you inside the spectacle, sometimes for extended durations. Sales of expensive, fuel-guzzling SUVs, often with tinted windows, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/25/suvs-second-biggest-cause-of-emissions-rise-figures-reveal\" title=\"\">grew rapidly</a> across the world during the 2010s: drivers increasingly want to be raised above and sealed off from the street. Meanwhile, upmarket restaurants, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/27/chiltern-firehouse-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\" title=\"\">Chiltern Firehouse</a> in London, a former fire station which reopened as a luxurious, enclosed compound in 2013, feel more and more like stage sets: so completely designed and choreographed that the world outside temporarily disappears. Even the great winners of the 2010s \u2013 the 1% \u2013 sometimes want to forget.</p> <p>During the decade, it became cooler than usual in Britain to eat comforting things: bread, cakes, pies, even <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/grilled-cheese-recipes_n_58ebbdd5e4b0ca64d9181015\" title=\"\">grilled cheese sandwiches</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/06/genius-of-great-british-bake-off\" title=\"\">Great British Bake Off</a>, first broadcast in 2010, made cooking with lots of carbs and sugar respectable again. Meanwhile, more and more restaurants and cafes started offering a meal designed to obliterate the day: the boozy bottomless brunch. Alcohol, starch and fat \u2013 these are the tastes, perhaps, of a society that wants to procrastinate, to not think about the future too much.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f4281f59fca8ca540c47dfad74a89a4bb58d73a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4281f59fca8ca540c47dfad74a89a4bb58d73a3/0_0_3000_1950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Berry, formerly of the Great British Bake Off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Berry, formerly of the Great British Bake Off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clothes have become more cocooning: enormous puffer jackets, scarves the size of small blankets, fleeces and woolly hats. In the 2000s, clothes and silhouettes were leaner and more formal \u2013 tight suits, skinny trousers \u2013 as if people expected to seize exciting new opportunities, or at least to work in offices. In the 2010s, social mobility has stalled, and many of the jobs being created \u2013 and often taken by middle-class graduates \u2013 involve zero-hours contracts and outdoor work. Baggy, warm, informal clothes are for people who expect either to be hanging around at home, waiting to hear that their labour is required, or to be hauling parcels and takeaway orders, out in the cold.</p> <p>Perhaps the human silhouette that most embodies the 2010s is that of the thousands of cyclists working for the food delivery service Deliveroo, which was founded in London in 2013 and now operates in dozens of cities across Europe and beyond. The huge insulated containers the riders carry on their backs, like uglier, unprotective snail shells, seem to say: Work is a burden you must accept, however much of your dignity it takes away.</p> <p>In a working world that requires quick switches between inactivity and activity, that values powers of endurance, caffeine is a vital drug. In many British town and city centres during the 2010s, otherwise emptied out by online commerce, cafes proliferated, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/dec/22/pubs-coffee-shops\" title=\"\">replacing shops and pubs</a> as the busiest indoor spaces. Many of these cafes are full of people silently working, rather than socialising, or dosing themselves with double espressos so they can go and work somewhere else.</p> <p>Another way to cope with the 2010s has been to work obsessively on yourself. From the 1950s to the 1990s, being young in the west was often associated with lounging around, or rebelling, or living for the moment. But in the 2010s being young often means relentlessly working and studying, polishing your public persona, and keeping fit. The massively popular Hunger Games novels and films, about young people being forced to compete to the death with each other by a cruel, middle-aged elite, came out between 2008 and 2015. Intended as dystopian science fiction, they quickly began to seem like more like satire, or even social realism.</p> <p>\u201cThe worse things get\u201d, writes the American essayist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour\" title=\"\">Jia Tolentino</a>, \u201cthe more a person is compelled to optimise [themselves].\u201d This can be presentational: a carefully maintained Instagram feed (the app was released in 2010). Or it can be physical. Yoga, marathons, triathlons \u2013 it\u2019s not hard to see their renewed popularity over the last decade as an effort by people, conscious or otherwise, to hone themselves for a tougher world.</p> <p>New consumer devices for collecting personal data, such as the Fitbit Tracker, which first went on sale in 2010, mean that this self-optimisation can be measured, and compared with the efforts of others, as never before. This process has created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/24/new-status-symbol-hard-work-spending-ceos\" title=\"\">a new hierarchy</a>, particularly within the American middle class, but increasingly in its European counterpart, too, which privileges the leanest people, the most punishing exercise classes, the most body-conscious brands of workout clothes. Only in a decade so concerned with self-improvement and self-presentation could \u201cathleisure\u201d become a fashion category, and toned arms become such a potent status symbol for people who never need to do manual work.</p> <p>And finally, the harsher world of the 2010s has also prompted many people to undergo a more private, less visible toughening \u2013 one they may not even acknowledge to themselves. They have got used to walking past the decade\u2019s casualties in the street, and not giving them much thought. In the 2010s, as in Victorian times, if you want an untroubled mind, it doesn\u2019t pay to look at the world around you too hard.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Other reactions to the turmoil of the last 10 years have been less individualistic. One person\u2019s crisis can be another\u2019s opportunity, and the difficulties since 2010 of so many previously dominant value systems \u2013 capitalism, centrism, traditional conservatism, white male supremacy \u2013 have opened up space for new political movements, at a rate not seen since the 1960s.</p> <p>Some of these movements, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/11/how-metoo-revealed-the-central-rift-within-feminism-social-individualist\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/12/black-lives-matter-deray-mckesson-ferguson-protests\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a>, are revolts against age-old injustices, largely made possible, and then accelerated and amplified, by the new digital networks. Others, such as Extinction Rebellion and Corbynism, have been reactions to glaring inadequacies in modern mainstream politics: its inability, or unwillingness, to address the climate emergency; or to create an economy and society that works for the majority.</p> <p>Other, more rightwing insurrections, such as the campaign for Brexit, have been partly driven by nostalgia: a yearning to go back to the slower, simpler Britain that supposedly existed before today\u2019s globalised, unsettled country. And yet \u2013 in a disorientating twist typical of our times \u2013 the Brexit movement also has a ruthlessly modernising side. Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of its most prominent figures, may dress like an Edwardian patriarch, but he is <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v41/n15/james-meek/the-two-jacobs\" title=\"\">the co-founder</a> of an international investment fund, and the beneficiary and advocate of an ever more footloose, disruptive capitalism.</p> <p>One thing all the new movements of the 2010s have in common is that they have already changed how millions of people think, both inside the movements and outside them. Another is that we don\u2019t know, yet, how permanent and influential that change will be. #MeToo could turn out to be one of many heavily resisted campaigns in feminism\u2019s long struggle \u2013 or it could transform, for good, how women and men relate to each other, and how women think about themselves. The Brexit movement could be a passing nationalist surge \u2013 or a force that revives the Tory party for the long term.</p> <p>Most of these movements have an impatient, millenarian quality \u2013 an expectation that momentous change is close at hand. This is a huge shift away from the politics of the 1990s and 2000s, when western politicians such as Brown sought to reshape society through modest, incremental reforms, such as making school class sizes smaller. In the end, grand schemes such as Brexit may disappoint \u2013 or worse. But the 2010s have reacquainted voters with the idea that politics can be about big promises and fundamental choices.</p> <p>More quietly, the 2010s have also brought a renewed realisation that culture is political \u2013 after decades when most creative people and cultural critics avoided that conclusion. Literary and art prizes now regularly go to people whose work is overtly political, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/20/margaret-atwood-moving-away-from-gilead-testaments\" title=\"\">Margaret Atwood</a>, or more subtly so, such as the architecture collective <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/08/assemble-guerrilla-gardeners-of-granby-liverpool-terrace-turner-prize\" title=\"\">Assemble</a>, who won the Turner prize in 2015 for helping to rebuild a rundown part of Liverpool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da19482d8444c4513e69dff92a95d0cffe29b513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da19482d8444c4513e69dff92a95d0cffe29b513/133_0_5339_3204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists dressed as characters from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in the Texas Capitol Rotunda in May 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists dressed as characters from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in the Texas Capitol Rotunda in May 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Gay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent years, such competitions have begun to be scrutinised for their sensitivity to questions of race, class and gender. Although prizes are inherently elitist, they are now also increasingly expected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/15/the-guardian-view-on-arts-prizes-a-20th-century-phenomenon\" title=\"\">to promote</a> greater equality in society as a whole. It is a contradiction characteristic of the decade\u2019s politics, where a greater awareness of the injustices suffered by many social groups, and sometimes a greater willingness to redress them, co-exists with an intensifying individualism \u2013 with a growing preference for letting people self-identify and respecting each person\u2019s particular life experience. Whether these collectivist and individualist tendencies can co-exist in the long term is a question that the decade has not resolved.</p> <p>What is more, the reawakening of politics since 2010 has only been partial. In the decade\u2019s four British general elections, the turnouts have been 65%, 66%, 69% and 67% \u2013 only a modest improvement on the apathetic turnouts of the 2000s, and well below the <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8060\" title=\"\">20th-century average</a>. Even the supposedly critical Brexit referendum was devalued, to a degree, by the non-participation of more than a quarter of the electorate. The indifference of many potential remain voters \u2013 turnout in some Europhile areas of London was lower than in general elections \u2013 was as much responsible for the final result as the commitment of many leavers.</p> <p>In 2012, Mark Fisher said that Britain was suffering from \u201cdepression economics and boomtime politics\u201d: the disengagement prompted by the relatively comfortable 1990s and 2000s was lingering on, despite the reopening of so many economic issues by the financial crisis. Seven years later, apathy remains a habit for many Britons. Politics may have become much more vibrant, ambitious, and relevant over the past decade, but they haven\u2019t noticed. Or, worse still, they don\u2019t like it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In many areas of our lives, the 2010s have been less transformative than we often think. In 2011, the music critic Simon Reynolds published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/02/total-recall-retromania-all-rage\" title=\"\">Retromania</a>: Pop Culture\u2019s Addiction to Its Own Past, a book about the power of nostalgia in the early 21st century that still resonates today. He argued that digital technology, far from enabling more creativity, had actually made it both harder and less essential for artists. Instead of coming up with new ideas, they could now roam the internet\u2019s infinite archives, and build careers out of clever hybrids and pastiches of previous forms.</p> <p>Since Reynolds\u2019 book came out, the mounting crises of the 2010s have made the avoidance of the present in favour of the past even more appealing. Pop culture from the 1990s, in particular, such as the cosy TV series Friends, has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/21/the-age-of-comfort-tv-why-people-are-secretly-watching-friends-and-the-office-on-a-loop\" title=\"\">hugely popular</a> again. In our often backward-looking society, \u201cTime itself seem[s] to become sluggish,\u201d wrote Reynolds, \u201clike a river that starts to meander\u201d.</p> <p>In the 1970s, a similar feeling of cultural time slowing down \u2013 just as political events were speeding up \u2013 spread through western culture, from pop music to fashion, architecture to academia. The confident, future-orientated mindset of mid-20th-century modernism was gradually replaced by the doubting one of postmodernism, which questioned, as many people do now, whether progress and truth were possible at all. And even in politics, for all the decade\u2019s dramas, the 70s actually resolved little.

      "bodyText": "People have long used decades to frame the past. Think of how potent \u201cthe 60s\u201d has been. But the artificiality of the exercise means that the more you look at a decade, the more complicated it seems. A decade is experienced in an infinity of ways. It is made up of fragments. It blurs at the edges with other decades. Ghosts of previous ones live on within it, and premonitions of those to come gradually infiltrate it. How will we remember the last 10 years? Above all, as a time of crises. During the 2010s, there have been crises of democracy and the economy; of the climate and poverty; of international relations and national identity; of privacy and technology. There were crises at the start of the decade, and there are crises now. Some of them are the same crises, unsolved. Others are like nothing we have experienced before. Some of them are welcome: old hierarchies collapsing. Others are catastrophes. All these crises, so close together, have made the 2010s seem much longer than the two previous decades. Sometimes, a single day\u2019s events \u2013 a Brexit showdown, a Donald Trump meltdown \u2013 have felt more dramatic, and more exhausting to follow, than entire years did during the 1990s and 2000s. In Britain \u2013 supposedly one of the world\u2019s most stable, gradualist democracies \u2013 politics since 2010 has often been manic. Parties have hastily changed their leaders and policies; sometimes their entire guiding philosophies. Last week\u2019s general election was the fourth of the decade; the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s had two apiece. The sheer turmoil of the 2010s has sometimes made what came before seem distant and utterly different. \u201cThe changes we\u2019ve undergone, both wonderful and terrible, are astonishing,\u201d wrote the American social critic Rebecca Solnit in 2016. The world of the 2000s, she concluded, \u201chas been swept away\u201d. In place of centrist politicians and steady economic growth, the 2010s have brought shocks, revolts and extremists. Hung parliaments; rightwing populists in power; physical attacks on politicians; Russian influence on western elections; elderly leftists galvanising young Britons and Americans; rich, rightwing leaders in both countries captivating working-class voters \u2013 scenarios close to unimaginable a decade ago have become familiar, almost expected. And yet beneath this surface frenzy, politics has, in many ways, been stagnant. Throughout Trump\u2019s presidency, his approval ratings have been terrible, but unusually stable. Three-and-a-half years after the referendum, Britain remains almost evenly divided over EU membership. Despite governing disastrously for much of the decade, the Conservatives are still in power. In the 2010s, it has often felt as if everything is up for grabs \u2013 from the future of capitalism to the future of the planet \u2013 and yet nothing has been decided. Between the decade\u2019s sense of stasis and sense of possibility, an enormous tension has built up. It is still awaiting release. In 2010, a few days after that year\u2019s election had, to widespread surprise, produced the decade\u2019s first hung parliament, the philosopher John Gray told me: \u201cBritain will spend something like a decade inching to some sort of new economic and political settlement.\u201d Gray is often seen as a professional pessimist, but this time he was too optimistic. While the decade\u2019s Conservative ascendancy has gone on and on, extraordinary crises have spread through British society. During the 2010s, the average life expectancy, which had been growing almost continuously for a century, stopped rising. The average wage rose more slowly than in any decade since the Napoleonic wars. A million more children with working parents entered poverty. The number of people sleeping rough more than doubled. One of the archetypal British public spaces of the 2000s was St Pancras station in London: once tatty, now renovated, with smart new shops, bustling food outlets and trains to the continent \u2013 a confident intertwining of private prosperity and state spending. Since 2010, its restored Victorian alcoves have filled up with people living in sleeping bags and tents. Beyond the grim new Britain created by a decade of Conservative austerity looms the even bleaker world being created by the climate emergency. Perhaps the most frightening of this year\u2019s many apocalyptic books is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells. Its chapter titles read: Heat Death. Hunger. Drowning. Dying Oceans. Unbreathable Air. Wildfire. Plagues. Economic Collapse. Climate Conflict. It\u2019s intended to be a forecast of the planet\u2019s near future that will shock readers out of their complacency. But during the 2010s almost all the disasters that the book names have already started to happen. Global capitalism has largely carried on regardless. For many people in Britain and beyond, the 2010s have been a bad time, with the promise of much worse to come. * * * How do you live through such a decade? In Britain, it is a question that people haven\u2019t had to ask for almost half a century \u2013 not since the 1970s, until now the most infamous decade in our modern history. Like the 2010s, it had four elections, a referendum about our relationship with Europe, fears for the environment, a rising threat of political violence, and a pervasive sense of foreboding. In 1978 the social commentator Peter York wrote: \u201cThe real keynotes of the 70s are fragmentation \u2026 fantasy and paranoia \u2013 impossible new situations.\u201d A few months ago, in This Is Not a Drill: An Extinction Rebellion Handbook, the climate activist Dougald Hine summed up the 2010s in similar terms: \u201cThese are times in which impossible things happen\u201d. Yet in some ways the 2010s have been more frightening than the 70s. Then, the fear was felt more by the elite \u2013 politicians, businessmen \u2013 than by ordinary people, who were still enjoying the last of postwar Britain\u2019s relative egalitarianism and social stability. Nowadays, the fear is almost universal. The creation of social media networks over the last decade and a half, starting with Twitter in 2006, and the conversion of traditional media into non-stop news services, have made awful events seem relentless and impossible to ignore. We have become perpetually anxious. And there seems ever more to be anxious about. The divide in Britain over Europe has become much more bitter. Advocates of undemocratic solutions to Britain\u2019s problems, such as suspending parliament, have moved from the fringes of politics, where they plotted in vain during the 1970s, straight into 10 Downing Street. Meanwhile, the awareness that much of modern life \u2013 air travel, car travel, eating meat, shopping, using plastics \u2013 has malign consequences has grown from a minority preoccupation in the 1970s into an everyday topic. Sometimes in the 2010s, it has felt as if the whole world we have made, from the tiniest exhaust particle to the most sprawling conurbation, is toxic. Our language has become precautionary and jittery: \u201csafe spaces\u201d, \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d. Viewed from the 2010s, the fraught 1970s can look like an age of innocence. During the mid-2010s, and especially in 2016, the year of Trump\u2019s election and the vote for Brexit, there was a persistent online craze for declaring particular years in the 2010s \u201cthe worst ever\u201d. Exaggeration is a wearyingly familiar online mode, and some of the evidence cited was quite narrow and subjective, such as the premature deaths in 2016 of Prince, David Bowie and Carrie Fisher. But the craze spread because it struck a chord. The 2010s have often felt cursed. Yet also during the decade a more scientific group of writers, including the famous psychologist Steven Pinker, started to argue the opposite. Sometimes called \u201cthe New Optimists\u201d, they claimed that life around the world in the early 21st century was, in fact, as good as it has ever been \u2013 in terms of health, wealth, amenities and the prevalence of peace. Many of the upward graphs they presented were convincing, as far as they went, but that was usually only up to 2015 \u2013 just before the point at which pessimists usually say the 2010s took a turn for the worse. And when the graphs did go beyond 2015, they were not always reassuring. The number of people living in democracies was falling; the number of people killed in wars and terrorist incidents was rising. As one of the New Optimists\u2019 favourite sources, the website Our World in Data, had to admit this year: \u201cIn some aspects the data suggests the world is getting worse.\u201d It could be a blip. The 2010s could be just a pause in humanity\u2019s erratic upward progress. But there are signs that even Our World in Data doesn\u2019t completely believe that. \u201cOur world today,\u201d it says, \u201cis neither just nor sustainable.\u201d Over the last 10 years, even some of humanity\u2019s cheerleaders have started to lose faith. * * * Yet to characterise the 2010s as one long crisis is too simple and bleak. A decade usually contains different phases. In Britain, the 2010s can be divided roughly into three. First, from 2010 to 2012, there was a period of turbulence and bewilderment, as the economy, voters and politicians struggled to absorb the shocks from the financial crisis of the late 2000s \u2013 and to accept that the prosperity and relative stability of the previous two decades might be over. Gordon Brown\u2019s ponderous New Labour government fell. David Cameron\u2019s more supple, and shameless, coalition of Conservatives and Lib Dems replaced it. Having gone along with Labour\u2019s fairly expansive approach to public spending for years in opposition, during the 2010 election the Conservatives attacked it as reckless and unaffordable. They claimed that Britain was facing a huge government debt crisis, citing a superficially similar but much deeper one that was already bringing chaos to Greece. It was a form of political message \u2013 the warning of a systemic collapse \u2013 that had been popular in the 1970s and had then fallen gradually into disuse; but it would become a standard practice for all parties as the 2010s went on. Once in government, the Conservatives imposed austerity. At first, the word had an unfamiliar, retro ring, redolent of the 1930s, the last time a British government had carried out cuts on the scale Cameron intended. In response to the return of hard times, another bit of language from the 1930s became ubiquitous in the early 2010s, printed on mugs, posters and tea towels: \u201cKeep Calm and Carry On\u201d. But many Britons did not. During 2010 and 2011 there were protests and riots across the country \u2013 not on a Greek scale, yet large and sustained enough to spook many commentators. At the end of 2011, with an economic slowdown largely caused by austerity also underway, the latest edition of the Economist newspaper\u2019s annual compendium of predictions, The World in 2012, replaced its usual capitalist cheerleading with warnings about an economic \u201cgreat stagnation\u201d and further \u201cmayhem on the streets\u201d of the west. \u201cThe world won\u2019t end in 2012,\u201d predicted the magazine. \u201cBut at times it will feel as if it is about to.\u201d For some less establishment voices, the turbulence was promising rather than threatening. In 2010, after taking part in large, fierce protests against the education cuts, the political and cultural writer Mark Fisher declared: \u201cWe\u2019ve broken out of the end of history. What\u2019s certain is that the old world is disintegrating, and soon it will not be possible to even pretend that we can return to it.\u201d Yet all these prophecies were slightly premature. From 2012 to 2015, there was a lull \u2013 the decade\u2019s second phase. The economy recovered. The 2012 London Olympics distracted people and cheered them up. The same year, Barack Obama was re-elected as US president: there still seemed to be a future for charismatic centrist leaders. Even the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, which for a long time promised to rupture the status quo, ended in a vote for stability. Austerity also proved less politically explosive during the mid-2010s than its critics hoped and some of its advocates feared. The fact that the cuts were cumulative, and so ubiquitous, made austerity hard to organise against \u2013 or even think clearly about in the round. The cuts proved numbing as much as enraging. At the same time, the increases in public spending during the previous decade meant that some state services were well enough equipped by 2010 to absorb the cuts without obvious immediate damage. In 2017, the chief finance officer of a London hospital trust told me that its medical outcomes had only started deteriorating once the cuts had been underway for half a decade. In much of Britain, austerity took a long time to be fully felt. The Conservatives won a majority at the 2015 election before that could happen. A jubilant Cameron told his party conference soon afterwards: \u201cI really believe we\u2019re on the brink of something special \u2026 We can make this era \u2013 these 2010s \u2013 a defining decade for our country \u2026 one which people will look back on and say: \u2018That\u2019s the time when the tide turned.\u2019\u201d In 2015, many in the political and business elite, untouched by austerity themselves, still believed that the troubled late 2000s and early 2010s had been an aberration, and that the good times had now resumed. For many other people, there was a more tentative hope: that the great unravelling that had begun with the financial crisis could be kept at bay or ignored, at least for a while. You can sense this escapist feeling, still, especially in wealthier parts of Britain, in the queues outside shops with hot new products, in all the heaving, deafening new restaurants. For a lot of people, at least some of the time, the lull of the mid-2010s goes on. Yet since 2015, ever more potent forces have been gathering to disrupt it. The third phase of the 2010s \u2013 the phase we\u2019re in now \u2013 has been more unpredictable, unsettling, and sometimes thrilling, than even the aftermath of the financial crisis. The capture of the Labour party in 2015 by Jeremy Corbyn and the left; the 2016 Brexit vote, and election of Trump; the shock 2017 British election result and hung parliament, the revival of the far right in Britain, the US and across Europe \u2013 even the fact that this list is so predictable tells us how much political upheaval has become normalised. During the early 2010s, it was hard to say with confidence what Britain would be like \u2013 politically, economically, socially, or in overall mood \u2013 from one year to the next. Nowadays, it\u2019s hard to look a month ahead. * * * One way to cope with chaos is to accept it. Over the last couple of years, a short, bland sentence has become ubiquitous in British conversations, from interviews with Premier League footballers to soliloquies from Love Island contestants: \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d Usually, it means: \u201cI\u2019m learning to live with something negative\u201d \u2013 a personal setback, a wider injustice, difficult circumstances. It\u2019s a mantra for an age of diminishing expectations, when many people no longer assume \u2013 unlike their postwar predecessors \u2013 that they will become richer than their parents, and live in an ever more sophisticated or just society, on an ever more hospitable planet. When people say \u201cIt is what it is\u201d, they are rarely challenged. Instead, they are usually heard in respectful silence. In a difficult world, fatalism and stoicism are useful qualities. Another coping mechanism is escape. Possibly the most revealing leisure activity of the 2010s is shutting yourself away with a TV series: typically a drama set in another country or another era, with an addictive, slowly resolved plot, many characters, elaborate settings, and enough episodes to allow for watching in binges. In an age of squeezed incomes, TV dramas are worlds you can explore on the cheap. But pricier forms of escapism have been in demand, too. Theatre productions promise to be \u201cimmersive\u201d \u2013 one of the decade\u2019s favourite promotional terms \u2013 by placing you inside the spectacle, sometimes for extended durations. Sales of expensive, fuel-guzzling SUVs, often with tinted windows, grew rapidly across the world during the 2010s: drivers increasingly want to be raised above and sealed off from the street. Meanwhile, upmarket restaurants, such as the Chiltern Firehouse in London, a former fire station which reopened as a luxurious, enclosed compound in 2013, feel more and more like stage sets: so completely designed and choreographed that the world outside temporarily disappears. Even the great winners of the 2010s \u2013 the 1% \u2013 sometimes want to forget. During the decade, it became cooler than usual in Britain to eat comforting things: bread, cakes, pies, even grilled cheese sandwiches. The Great British Bake Off, first broadcast in 2010, made cooking with lots of carbs and sugar respectable again. Meanwhile, more and more restaurants and cafes started offering a meal designed to obliterate the day: the boozy bottomless brunch. Alcohol, starch and fat \u2013 these are the tastes, perhaps, of a society that wants to procrastinate, to not think about the future too much. Clothes have become more cocooning: enormous puffer jackets, scarves the size of small blankets, fleeces and woolly hats. In the 2000s, clothes and silhouettes were leaner and more formal \u2013 tight suits, skinny trousers \u2013 as if people expected to seize exciting new opportunities, or at least to work in offices. In the 2010s, social mobility has stalled, and many of the jobs being created \u2013 and often taken by middle-class graduates \u2013 involve zero-hours contracts and outdoor work. Baggy, warm, informal clothes are for people who expect either to be hanging around at home, waiting to hear that their labour is required, or to be hauling parcels and takeaway orders, out in the cold. Perhaps the human silhouette that most embodies the 2010s is that of the thousands of cyclists working for the food delivery service Deliveroo, which was founded in London in 2013 and now operates in dozens of cities across Europe and beyond. The huge insulated containers the riders carry on their backs, like uglier, unprotective snail shells, seem to say: Work is a burden you must accept, however much of your dignity it takes away. In a working world that requires quick switches between inactivity and activity, that values powers of endurance, caffeine is a vital drug. In many British town and city centres during the 2010s, otherwise emptied out by online commerce, cafes proliferated, replacing shops and pubs as the busiest indoor spaces. Many of these cafes are full of people silently working, rather than socialising, or dosing themselves with double espressos so they can go and work somewhere else. Another way to cope with the 2010s has been to work obsessively on yourself. From the 1950s to the 1990s, being young in the west was often associated with lounging around, or rebelling, or living for the moment. But in the 2010s being young often means relentlessly working and studying, polishing your public persona, and keeping fit. The massively popular Hunger Games novels and films, about young people being forced to compete to the death with each other by a cruel, middle-aged elite, came out between 2008 and 2015. Intended as dystopian science fiction, they quickly began to seem like more like satire, or even social realism. \u201cThe worse things get\u201d, writes the American essayist Jia Tolentino, \u201cthe more a person is compelled to optimise [themselves].\u201d This can be presentational: a carefully maintained Instagram feed (the app was released in 2010). Or it can be physical. Yoga, marathons, triathlons \u2013 it\u2019s not hard to see their renewed popularity over the last decade as an effort by people, conscious or otherwise, to hone themselves for a tougher world. New consumer devices for collecting personal data, such as the Fitbit Tracker, which first went on sale in 2010, mean that this self-optimisation can be measured, and compared with the efforts of others, as never before. This process has created a new hierarchy, particularly within the American middle class, but increasingly in its European counterpart, too, which privileges the leanest people, the most punishing exercise classes, the most body-conscious brands of workout clothes. Only in a decade so concerned with self-improvement and self-presentation could \u201cathleisure\u201d become a fashion category, and toned arms become such a potent status symbol for people who never need to do manual work. And finally, the harsher world of the 2010s has also prompted many people to undergo a more private, less visible toughening \u2013 one they may not even acknowledge to themselves. They have got used to walking past the decade\u2019s casualties in the street, and not giving them much thought. In the 2010s, as in Victorian times, if you want an untroubled mind, it doesn\u2019t pay to look at the world around you too hard. * * * Other reactions to the turmoil of the last 10 years have been less individualistic. One person\u2019s crisis can be another\u2019s opportunity, and the difficulties since 2010 of so many previously dominant value systems \u2013 capitalism, centrism, traditional conservatism, white male supremacy \u2013 have opened up space for new political movements, at a rate not seen since the 1960s. Some of these movements, such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, are revolts against age-old injustices, largely made possible, and then accelerated and amplified, by the new digital networks. Others, such as Extinction Rebellion and Corbynism, have been reactions to glaring inadequacies in modern mainstream politics: its inability, or unwillingness, to address the climate emergency; or to create an economy and society that works for the majority. Other, more rightwing insurrections, such as the campaign for Brexit, have been partly driven by nostalgia: a yearning to go back to the slower, simpler Britain that supposedly existed before today\u2019s globalised, unsettled country. And yet \u2013 in a disorientating twist typical of our times \u2013 the Brexit movement also has a ruthlessly modernising side. Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of its most prominent figures, may dress like an Edwardian patriarch, but he is the co-founder of an international investment fund, and the beneficiary and advocate of an ever more footloose, disruptive capitalism. One thing all the new movements of the 2010s have in common is that they have already changed how millions of people think, both inside the movements and outside them. Another is that we don\u2019t know, yet, how permanent and influential that change will be. #MeToo could turn out to be one of many heavily resisted campaigns in feminism\u2019s long struggle \u2013 or it could transform, for good, how women and men relate to each other, and how women think about themselves. The Brexit movement could be a passing nationalist surge \u2013 or a force that revives the Tory party for the long term. Most of these movements have an impatient, millenarian quality \u2013 an expectation that momentous change is close at hand. This is a huge shift away from the politics of the 1990s and 2000s, when western politicians such as Brown sought to reshape society through modest, incremental reforms, such as making school class sizes smaller. In the end, grand schemes such as Brexit may disappoint \u2013 or worse. But the 2010s have reacquainted voters with the idea that politics can be about big promises and fundamental choices. More quietly, the 2010s have also brought a renewed realisation that culture is political \u2013 after decades when most creative people and cultural critics avoided that conclusion. Literary and art prizes now regularly go to people whose work is overtly political, such as Margaret Atwood, or more subtly so, such as the architecture collective Assemble, who won the Turner prize in 2015 for helping to rebuild a rundown part of Liverpool. In recent years, such competitions have begun to be scrutinised for their sensitivity to questions of race, class and gender. Although prizes are inherently elitist, they are now also increasingly expected to promote greater equality in society as a whole. It is a contradiction characteristic of the decade\u2019s politics, where a greater awareness of the injustices suffered by many social groups, and sometimes a greater willingness to redress them, co-exists with an intensifying individualism \u2013 with a growing preference for letting people self-identify and respecting each person\u2019s particular life experience. Whether these collectivist and individualist tendencies can co-exist in the long term is a question that the decade has not resolved. What is more, the reawakening of politics since 2010 has only been partial. In the decade\u2019s four British general elections, the turnouts have been 65%, 66%, 69% and 67% \u2013 only a modest improvement on the apathetic turnouts of the 2000s, and well below the 20th-century average. Even the supposedly critical Brexit referendum was devalued, to a degree, by the non-participation of more than a quarter of the electorate. The indifference of many potential remain voters \u2013 turnout in some Europhile areas of London was lower than in general elections \u2013 was as much responsible for the final result as the commitment of many leavers. In 2012, Mark Fisher said that Britain was suffering from \u201cdepression economics and boomtime politics\u201d: the disengagement prompted by the relatively comfortable 1990s and 2000s was lingering on, despite the reopening of so many economic issues by the financial crisis. Seven years later, apathy remains a habit for many Britons. Politics may have become much more vibrant, ambitious, and relevant over the past decade, but they haven\u2019t noticed. Or, worse still, they don\u2019t like it. * * * In many areas of our lives, the 2010s have been less transformative than we often think. In 2011, the music critic Simon Reynolds published Retromania: Pop Culture\u2019s Addiction to Its Own Past, a book about the power of nostalgia in the early 21st century that still resonates today. He argued that digital technology, far from enabling more creativity, had actually made it both harder and less essential for artists. Instead of coming up with new ideas, they could now roam the internet\u2019s infinite archives, and build careers out of clever hybrids and pastiches of previous forms. Since Reynolds\u2019 book came out, the mounting crises of the 2010s have made the avoidance of the present in favour of the past even more appealing. Pop culture from the 1990s, in particular, such as the cosy TV series Friends, has become hugely popular again. In our often backward-looking society, \u201cTime itself seem[s] to become sluggish,\u201d wrote Reynolds, \u201clike a river that starts to meander\u201d. In the 1970s, a similar feeling of cultural time slowing down \u2013 just as political events were speeding up \u2013 spread through western culture, from pop music to fashion, architecture to academia. The confident, future-orientated mindset of mid-20th-century modernism was gradually replaced by the doubting one of postmodernism, which questioned, as many people do now, whether progress and truth were possible at all. And even in politics, for all the decade\u2019s dramas, the 70s actually resolved little. Most of the decisive changes to Britain and the US during the late 20th century didn\u2019t come until afterwards, with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan\u2019s seminal 1980s governments. A similar dynamic may be at work now. Brexit has yet to happen. Global capitalism has yet to alter course, as growth slows and inequality grows. Trump\u2019s presidency has yet to be judged by the electorate. Britain has yet to experience Boris Johnson\u2019s equally risky brand of populism as a form of government, in any significant sense, rather than as simply a crude but effective new way of winning elections. A radical government of the left, while appealing to an increasing number of young voters, remains a more theoretical prospect still. The climate crisis is probably only just beginning. Digital technology has only just started to change us. And many of the people involved in all the political activism of the last 10 years are just beginning their careers as voters, as possible politicians. If you think the 2010s, our age of crises, have seen too much upheaval \u2013 or if you think things haven\u2019t been shaken up enough \u2013 just wait. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

With Omaha Sketchbook, Halpern explores the notion of American masculinity, his setting the midwestern Nebraskan city of the title where fundamentalist Christian values predominate. The book is designed to look like one of his work-in-progress notebooks, while his portraits and landscapes have a sense of suspended time as if the meaning of the place and its people remains somehow elusive despite the deep fascination he feels for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdc9d512b0eb0535baa3ed87dee24c9755c46adc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdc9d512b0eb0535baa3ed87dee24c9755c46adc/0_70_787_472/500.jpg\" alt=\"Omaha Sketchbook\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">American masculinity ...

It makes for an interesting, if surreal, blend of image and text, with lines such as \u201cThe smoke of grenades in the meadow of our eyelashes\u201d accompanying photos of stone-throwing students facing off against cops firing teargas. This faithful facsimile from the ever-inventive M\u00f6rel books is an artefact from another, more revolutionary, time and a reminder of the impromptu creativity that attended the now distant youth protests of May 68.</p> <h2><strong>13</strong></h2> <h2>American Origami by Andres Gonzalez (<a href=\"https://fw-books.nl/product/andres-gonzalez-american-origami/\">Fw:Books</a>)</h2> <p>A complex photobook on every level, American Origami is an exploration of the psychological aftermath of seven American mass school shootings which combines Andres Gonzalez\u2019s own detached, low-key photographs of now familiar towns and communities with a surfeit of statistical and forensic documents. Resembling a packed folder, the book unfolds to reveal a wealth of other related materials: news clippings, handwritten notes, drawings, memorabilia and an inventory of objects that speak of mass grieving. (More than 65,000 teddy bears were sent to Sandy Hook elementary school alone in the wake of the shooting there.) An ambitious attempt at understanding \u2013 and visualising \u2013 the fallout from a senselessly recurring American tragedy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cb27d272a34a7176c30868d726a002bb53a8366\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cb27d272a34a7176c30868d726a002bb53a8366/0_127_3780_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heady mix \u2026 Twins, 2016, from End.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heady mix \u2026 Twins, 2016, from End.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Eamonn Doyle. Courtesy of Michael Hoppen Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>12</strong></h2> <h2>Made in Dublin by Eamonn Doyle (<a href=\"https://thamesandhudson.com/eamonn-doyle-made-in-dublin-9780500545089\">Thames &amp; Hudson</a>)</h2> <p>A single retrospective volume that comprises Irish photographer Eamonn Doyle\u2019s three self-published and now highly collectible photobooks, i, On and End. The first was described by Martin Parr as \u201cthe best street photobook in a decade\u201d. Doyle\u2019s often disorienting images of Dublin\u2019s passing strangers are here paired with characteristically surreal prose by the Irish novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/09/kevin-barry-books-that-made-me\">Kevin Barry</a> and the bold design is by the photographer\u2019s longtime collaborator Niall Sweeney. The result adds up to a heady remix of Doyle\u2019s small but vital back catalogue, its iconoclastic spirit more attuned to his parallel career as an electronic music producer and record label boss.</p> <h2><strong>11</strong></h2> <h2>Mother by Paul Graham (<a href=\"https://mackbooks.co.uk/products/mother-br-paul-graham\">Mack</a>)</h2> <p>A deceptively simple photobook that comprises just 14 portraits of Paul Graham\u2019s elderly mother as she sits in an armchair in a retirement home. The muted colour tones and floral patterns of her clothes, bathed in natural light from a nearby window, seem almost universal in their evocation of old age and fragility. Graham\u2019s point of view remains constant, his camera recording the slightest shifts in mood and expression. An intimate and meditative, but never intrusive, series of portraits that speak quietly of family ties, ageing and encroaching mortality.</p> <h2><strong>10</strong></h2> <h2>The Unforgetting by Peter Watkins (<a href=\"https://www.skinnerboox.com/books/theunforgetting\">Skinnerboox</a>)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2fbee378a3aa371c6e281385ef58e106dffcbb1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fbee378a3aa371c6e281385ef58e106dffcbb1a/0_88_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Unforgetting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carrying secrets ... The Unforgetting</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Federico Carpani/Peter Watkins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peter Watkins was nine years old when his mother took her own life by walking into the sea. His long-term project, The Unforgetting, is part elegy, part meditation on the tides and long shadow of grief. Watkins creates sculptural still lifes from the things left behind, whether an unopened handbag or a cassette tape, each carrying its own secrets and imbued with a talismanic presence. Whether self-portraits or constructed tableaux, his starkly formal images reverberate with a sense of absence. A book about remnants, traces, memories and the unsettling power of photography.</p> <h2><strong>9</strong></h2> <h2>Light Break by Roy DeCarava (<a href=\"https://davidzwirnerbooks.com/product/roy-decarava-light-break\">David Zwirner Books</a>)</h2> <p>Alongside the recently published The Sound I Saw, which gathers Roy DeCarava\u2019s beautifully meditative portraits of jazz performers including John Coltrane and Billie Holiday, Light Break offers a wider perspective on the life and work of a singular, somewhat elusive 20th-century American photographer. A master of often luminous street scenes and quiet, deeply observational portraits, DeCarava is perhaps most well known for Sweet Flypaper of Life, his collaboration with Langston Hughes. This illuminating retrospective shows the full range of his work and the consistency of his vision.</p> <h2><strong>8</strong></h2> <h2>Elf Dalia by Maja Daniels (<a href=\"https://mackbooks.co.uk/products/elf-dalia-br-maja-daniels?variant=24026398523456\">Mack</a>)</h2> <p>The village of \u00c4lvdalen, in the west of Sweden, still has its own ancient language, Elfdalian. The place and its people cast a spell on Swedish-born photographer Maja Daniels, who spent her childhood summers there, roaming free in the woods. Her book is a meditation on memory, mystery and belonging that contrasts her own often impressionistic landscapes and portraits with the work of a pioneering local photographer and eccentric, Tenn Lars Persson, who was born there in 1878.

      "bodyText": "15 Omaha Sketchbook by Gregory Halpern (Mack) American photographer Gregory Halpern\u2019s much anticipated follow-up to 2016\u2019s acclaimed ZZYZX, which was a meditation on Los Angeles as a heightened state of mind as much as an actual place. With Omaha Sketchbook, Halpern explores the notion of American masculinity, his setting the midwestern Nebraskan city of the title where fundamentalist Christian values predominate. The book is designed to look like one of his work-in-progress notebooks, while his portraits and landscapes have a sense of suspended time as if the meaning of the place and its people remains somehow elusive despite the deep fascination he feels for them. 14 On the Barricades (M\u00f6rel) Originally published on Bastille Day, 1968, by City Lights in San Francisco, On the Barricades is a sturdy zine-type publication that juxtaposes grainy images from the student uprising in Paris that year with the often elliptical situationist slogans that appeared daily on the city\u2019s walls. It makes for an interesting, if surreal, blend of image and text, with lines such as \u201cThe smoke of grenades in the meadow of our eyelashes\u201d accompanying photos of stone-throwing students facing off against cops firing teargas. This faithful facsimile from the ever-inventive M\u00f6rel books is an artefact from another, more revolutionary, time and a reminder of the impromptu creativity that attended the now distant youth protests of May 68. 13 American Origami by Andres Gonzalez (Fw:Books) A complex photobook on every level, American Origami is an exploration of the psychological aftermath of seven American mass school shootings which combines Andres Gonzalez\u2019s own detached, low-key photographs of now familiar towns and communities with a surfeit of statistical and forensic documents. Resembling a packed folder, the book unfolds to reveal a wealth of other related materials: news clippings, handwritten notes, drawings, memorabilia and an inventory of objects that speak of mass grieving. (More than 65,000 teddy bears were sent to Sandy Hook elementary school alone in the wake of the shooting there.) An ambitious attempt at understanding \u2013 and visualising \u2013 the fallout from a senselessly recurring American tragedy. 12 Made in Dublin by Eamonn Doyle (Thames &amp; Hudson) A single retrospective volume that comprises Irish photographer Eamonn Doyle\u2019s three self-published and now highly collectible photobooks, i, On and End. The first was described by Martin Parr as \u201cthe best street photobook in a decade\u201d. Doyle\u2019s often disorienting images of Dublin\u2019s passing strangers are here paired with characteristically surreal prose by the Irish novelist Kevin Barry and the bold design is by the photographer\u2019s longtime collaborator Niall Sweeney. The result adds up to a heady remix of Doyle\u2019s small but vital back catalogue, its iconoclastic spirit more attuned to his parallel career as an electronic music producer and record label boss. 11 Mother by Paul Graham (Mack) A deceptively simple photobook that comprises just 14 portraits of Paul Graham\u2019s elderly mother as she sits in an armchair in a retirement home. The muted colour tones and floral patterns of her clothes, bathed in natural light from a nearby window, seem almost universal in their evocation of old age and fragility. Graham\u2019s point of view remains constant, his camera recording the slightest shifts in mood and expression. An intimate and meditative, but never intrusive, series of portraits that speak quietly of family ties, ageing and encroaching mortality. 10 The Unforgetting by Peter Watkins (Skinnerboox) Peter Watkins was nine years old when his mother took her own life by walking into the sea. His long-term project, The Unforgetting, is part elegy, part meditation on the tides and long shadow of grief. Watkins creates sculptural still lifes from the things left behind, whether an unopened handbag or a cassette tape, each carrying its own secrets and imbued with a talismanic presence. Whether self-portraits or constructed tableaux, his starkly formal images reverberate with a sense of absence. A book about remnants, traces, memories and the unsettling power of photography. 9 Light Break by Roy DeCarava (David Zwirner Books) Alongside the recently published The Sound I Saw, which gathers Roy DeCarava\u2019s beautifully meditative portraits of jazz performers including John Coltrane and Billie Holiday, Light Break offers a wider perspective on the life and work of a singular, somewhat elusive 20th-century American photographer. A master of often luminous street scenes and quiet, deeply observational portraits, DeCarava is perhaps most well known for Sweet Flypaper of Life, his collaboration with Langston Hughes. This illuminating retrospective shows the full range of his work and the consistency of his vision. 8 Elf Dalia by Maja Daniels (Mack) The village of \u00c4lvdalen, in the west of Sweden, still has its own ancient language, Elfdalian. The place and its people cast a spell on Swedish-born photographer Maja Daniels, who spent her childhood summers there, roaming free in the woods. Her book is a meditation on memory, mystery and belonging that contrasts her own often impressionistic landscapes and portraits with the work of a pioneering local photographer and eccentric, Tenn Lars Persson, who was born there in 1878. It is this visual dialogue between old and new, strange and commonplace, that lends the book its quiet cumulative power. 7 Slant by Aaron Schuman (Mack) Prefaced by an Emily Dickinson poem \u2013 \u201cTell all the Truth but tell it slant\u201d \u2013 Aaron Schuman\u2019s book couples his own wryly revealing photographs (all taken within a 30-mile radius of the poet\u2019s home town of Amherst, Massachusetts) with clippings from the police report section of the local newspaper. To give just one example: \u201cA man shoveling snow on State Street told police he saw a strange orange glow coming from the eastern sky that might have been something on fire. Police determined the glow was probably the sun coming up for the day.\u201d Slant is a witty, deadpan meditation on small-town America that carries a darker undertow in the age of fake news, post-truth politics and alternative facts. 6 The Park by Kohei Yoshiyuki (Yossi Milo/Radius Books) Some photobooks stand alone for their subject matter and the audacity of their approach. The Park is a case in point. In the early 1970s, Kohei Yoshiyuki captured the illicit sexual encounters that took place in Tokyo\u2019s parks at night, creeping close to furtive couples and the voyeurs that observed them. His infrared camera lends these clandestine acts another layer of transgression, capturing the desperation and essential loneliness of these fleeting encounters as well as the creepiness of those watching. A compelling if unsettling book, reissued with additional previously unseen images. 5 The Second Shift by Clare Gallagher (self-published) \u201cThe Second Shift is the term given to the hidden shift of housework and childcare primarily carried out by women on top of their paid employment,\u201d writes Irish artist Clare Gallagher in her short introduction to a beautifully designed book of deftly observed images.

To the sceptical photographer, California had become a \u201chead lab\u201d for the adventurous and impressionable. The more he travelled, though, the more his fascination grew.

      "body": "<p>On the most basic level, Chernobyl was merely one of the best true-story miniseries ever made, capitalising on the curious fact that most people know hardly anything about the meltdown of a nuclear reactor in Pripyat, Ukraine, in April 1986, despite the incident\u2019s global infamy.</p> <p>Both dismantling and dramatising the cover-up that followed, Chernobyl marshalled the relevant information from a shocking and complex bigger picture. It started with a one-hour disaster movie, ended with a courtroom drama where scientific minutiae became heavy dramatic blows, and used a conspiracy thriller to drive us from one to the other.</p> <p>Humming in the background was the awful, almost unimaginable consequences of a serious radiation leak, a horror elegantly painted by director Johan Renck: fallen birds asphyxiating on pavements; petals of lethal debris fluttering down on children; human skin turning vermillion. Like a good war epic, Chernobyl was deft at letting us see that a character was walking into hell just before they realised it, or showing us the moving sight of a lowly functionary knowing they were doomed, but fulfilling their duty anyway. How bad was it? Worse than you thought \u2013 so much worse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It showed how institutions can turn people into liars who, in extreme circumstances, lose their basic humanity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The story of incompetence, mendacity and the wanton waste of life was taken by some as a statement on the heartless bureaucracy of a communist administration. To an extent it was, and it was OK to enjoy the deliciously evoked aesthetics of the knackered Soviet Union: cigarettes! Greasy moustaches! Itchy chocolate fabrics and intimidatingly dull tower blocks! But those who leapt on it as an illustration of capitalism\u2019s superiority had it wrong, and not just because Chernobyl took the odd factual liberty, or because the west has had plenty of its own atomic balls-ups that were a dollop of dumb luck away from catastrophe.</p> <p>This show went deeper than a partisan gotcha. It made universal observations, painfully resonant in the UK or US in 2019, about how institutions and hierarchies turn people into liars who, in extreme circumstances, lose their basic humanity. Scene after scene saw someone, tasked with upholding an ideology, doling out an obvious untruth or incredible cruelty with a stony face, prompting the question: they don\u2019t really believe what they\u2019re saying \u2026 do they?</p> <p>Paul Ritter was a good shout for the role of Anatoly Dyatlov, the most senior man in the plant\u2019s control room, who gave the technicians fatal orders then gaslit any underling who dared complain. Banal and malign, he was a terribly familiar portrait of a ratty coward who has chosen the dark side.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"136bb3e89ad94124b8930256dc4bf97286da72a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/136bb3e89ad94124b8930256dc4bf97286da72a2/0_123_4240_2544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brittle nobility \u2026 Jared Harris as Valery Legasov with Emily Watson as Ulana Khomyuk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plucky avengers \u2026 Jared Harris as Valery Legasov with Emily Watson as Ulana Khomyuk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam Daniel/Sky UK/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the standout turn was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/01/jared-harris-chernobyl-the-crown-mad-men-richard\">Jared Harris</a> as nuclear scientist Valery Legasov, embodying our collective urge to stand up and scream, \u201cNo! This is all lies!\u201d Chernobyl\u2019s main narrative drive was watching Legasov push the Soviet authorities to abandon the party line and acknowledge the calamity, certain that he was doing right but never sure of his own courage. Harris is a master of that kind of brittle nobility.</p> <p>He was bolstered by Legasov\u2019s involvement in two platonic romances. Boris Shcherbina (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), a politician sent to keep Legasov in check, instead helped him because his loyalty to the Kremlin hadn\u2019t eroded his decency; Ulana Khomyuk (Emily Watson), a scientist who was even more idealistic in her pursuit of truth than Legasov was, implored him not to waver. Khomyuk was a fiction, a composite of the experts who spoke up. In one of many impeccable judgment calls by writer Craig Mazin, her creation gave Chernobyl a classic trio of plucky avengers, each reassuring the others \u2013 and us \u2013 that good individuals still exist. Mazin himself was overturning the odds here, delivering a masterpiece having previously been best known for fratboy movie dreck like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/26/the-hangover-part-2-review\">The Hangover Part II</a>.</p> <p>To immortalise Legasov and co, years after their deaths, required a drama of rare power and beauty \u2013 a near-perfect example of the programme-maker\u2019s art.

      "bodyText": "On the most basic level, Chernobyl was merely one of the best true-story miniseries ever made, capitalising on the curious fact that most people know hardly anything about the meltdown of a nuclear reactor in Pripyat, Ukraine, in April 1986, despite the incident\u2019s global infamy. Both dismantling and dramatising the cover-up that followed, Chernobyl marshalled the relevant information from a shocking and complex bigger picture. It started with a one-hour disaster movie, ended with a courtroom drama where scientific minutiae became heavy dramatic blows, and used a conspiracy thriller to drive us from one to the other. Humming in the background was the awful, almost unimaginable consequences of a serious radiation leak, a horror elegantly painted by director Johan Renck: fallen birds asphyxiating on pavements; petals of lethal debris fluttering down on children; human skin turning vermillion. Like a good war epic, Chernobyl was deft at letting us see that a character was walking into hell just before they realised it, or showing us the moving sight of a lowly functionary knowing they were doomed, but fulfilling their duty anyway. How bad was it? Worse than you thought \u2013 so much worse. The story of incompetence, mendacity and the wanton waste of life was taken by some as a statement on the heartless bureaucracy of a communist administration. To an extent it was, and it was OK to enjoy the deliciously evoked aesthetics of the knackered Soviet Union: cigarettes! Greasy moustaches! Itchy chocolate fabrics and intimidatingly dull tower blocks! But those who leapt on it as an illustration of capitalism\u2019s superiority had it wrong, and not just because Chernobyl took the odd factual liberty, or because the west has had plenty of its own atomic balls-ups that were a dollop of dumb luck away from catastrophe. This show went deeper than a partisan gotcha. It made universal observations, painfully resonant in the UK or US in 2019, about how institutions and hierarchies turn people into liars who, in extreme circumstances, lose their basic humanity. Scene after scene saw someone, tasked with upholding an ideology, doling out an obvious untruth or incredible cruelty with a stony face, prompting the question: they don\u2019t really believe what they\u2019re saying \u2026 do they? Paul Ritter was a good shout for the role of Anatoly Dyatlov, the most senior man in the plant\u2019s control room, who gave the technicians fatal orders then gaslit any underling who dared complain. Banal and malign, he was a terribly familiar portrait of a ratty coward who has chosen the dark side. But the standout turn was Jared Harris as nuclear scientist Valery Legasov, embodying our collective urge to stand up and scream, \u201cNo! This is all lies!\u201d Chernobyl\u2019s main narrative drive was watching Legasov push the Soviet authorities to abandon the party line and acknowledge the calamity, certain that he was doing right but never sure of his own courage. Harris is a master of that kind of brittle nobility. He was bolstered by Legasov\u2019s involvement in two platonic romances. Boris Shcherbina (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), a politician sent to keep Legasov in check, instead helped him because his loyalty to the Kremlin hadn\u2019t eroded his decency; Ulana Khomyuk (Emily Watson), a scientist who was even more idealistic in her pursuit of truth than Legasov was, implored him not to waver. Khomyuk was a fiction, a composite of the experts who spoke up. In one of many impeccable judgment calls by writer Craig Mazin, her creation gave Chernobyl a classic trio of plucky avengers, each reassuring the others \u2013 and us \u2013 that good individuals still exist. Mazin himself was overturning the odds here, delivering a masterpiece having previously been best known for fratboy movie dreck like The Hangover Part II. To immortalise Legasov and co, years after their deaths, required a drama of rare power and beauty \u2013 a near-perfect example of the programme-maker\u2019s art. Miraculously, that\u2019s what Chernobyl was.",

His suspicious girlfriend ignored the adage that revenge is a dish best served cold and instead rooted through her kitchen for the strongest spices she could find and served him hot chicken. Thornton Prince III not only tolerated the extra heat, but he enjoyed the meal so much that he and his brothers opened the original BBQ Chicken Shack in Nashville. Now known as Prince\u2019s, the restaurant offers hot chicken in different cuts and spice levels served with white bread and pickles to tourists, businessmen and locals \u2013 black, white and every shade between.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been in my family for almost 90 years,\u201d Andr\u00e9 Prince Jeffries, 73, tells me over the phone from Nashville. \u201cWe were the only ones for a long time, and I\u2019m glad that Kim has the desire to spread the restaurant.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up, Prince spent time in both LA and Nashville. Her Tennessee summers were spent watching her aunt preparing chicken at Prince\u2019s. That means \u201cshe\u2019s already got it\u201d, says Jeffries of the \u201chot chicken touch\u201d.</p> <p>With no written recipe, the Princes learn to perfect hot chicken through instinct, observation and experimentation. Prince began to practice cooking hot chicken as a college student in the 1990s and kept at it for a decade. \u201cWe taste test until you get the Prince family nod,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Although her family members had given her cooking the OK, it took her until 2016 to muster the courage to leave behind her entertainment career in production and development and open her own restaurant. There was just one problem: she couldn\u2019t afford the $7,000 monthly lease to run such a business. So, she started off with Hotville pop-ups while prepping and at a Los Angeles Chinatown restaurant. In August 2017, the restaurant was sold and Prince lost that last shred of stability. \u201cI had to move out abruptly,\u201d she says. \u201cI cried a lot of tears.\u201d</p> <p>Enter Greg Dulan, who runs three successful restaurants in the LA area. He offered to let her store kitchen equipment at Dulan\u2019s on Crenshaw \u2013 a local soul food institution \u2013 and to hold pop-ups there.</p> <p>Having witnessed Prince\u2019s pop-ups selling out on the Dulan\u2019s patio, he believed in Hotville enough to become Prince\u2019s business partner.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a social aspect of eating hot chicken that you don\u2019t normally see in a restaurant setting,\u201d Dulan says. \u201cThis one is sweating and asking for water, the other one is laughing because he\u2019s burning.

LA has more than two dozen restaurants specializing in hot chicken, and even more feature the dish as a menu item.</p> <p>Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken opened its doors in 2017. Founder David Kopushyan says he visited the Prince\u2019s pop-up \u201cnumerous times\u201d during its 42-week run from 2016 to 2017.</p> <p>\u201cSeeing places like Hotville resonate locally definitely reinforced the idea that a hot chicken restaurant could work in LA,\u201d Kopushyan says. Today Dave\u2019s has two locations, in East Hollywood and North Hollywood, and Kopushyan says the business has the potential to grow to hundreds of franchises in the near future.</p> <p>\u201cDave\u2019s Hot Chicken is a good product,\u201d Prince says. \u201cBut our flavor profile is so distinctly different, it can\u2019t be compared.

In fact, most owners of hot chicken restaurants in Los Angeles remain strangers to her. Chef Johnny Ray Zone of Howlin\u2019 Rays in LA\u2019s Chinatown is the exception. Since Howlin\u2019 opened in 2016, Zone has made a point of paying respect to the Nashville restaurants that have inspired him, a move Prince appreciates.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s seen how many times I go out to Nashville,\u201d Zone says. \u201cShe\u2019s seen me fly my staff out to Nashville to teach them about the culture.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI try everybody\u2019s chicken,\u201d Kim Prince says. But as the niece of Andr\u00e9 Prince Jeffries, owner of the legendary Prince\u2019s Hot Chicken Shack in Nashville, she often regrets it. \u201cJust because you put it on your menu does not make it Nashville hot chicken,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been stumped that they would use the word Nashville so loosely.\u201d Marinated in spices hot enough to drain the sinuses, her family\u2019s hot chicken has been a local tradition since the 1930s. But word began to spread in 2011, when Prince\u2019s Hot Chicken Shack was featured on TravelChannel\u2019s Man v Food Nation and then was presented with a James Beard award honoring restaurants that serve timeless regional cuisine in 2013. Today, the \u201chot chicken\u201d label can be found on the menus of KFC and Panda Express, as well as a slew of restaurants and food trucks in cities across the country. Prince had to stand by and watch outsiders capitalize on her family\u2019s recipe as she struggled for years to find the financial backing for her own venture. Determined not to lean on her aunt for support, she attracted investors who offered predatory deals and sought help from banks which were equally as unhelpful. But in November, wearing a chef\u2019s jacket, bandanna and her hair in two french braids, Prince was signing for shipments arriving and advising workers where decor needed to be hung on freshly painted walls. She was in the final stages of Tuesday\u2019s grand opening, the day she takes her family\u2019s legacy back. Her new restaurant, Hotville Chicken in South Los Angeles, marks the first time a member of her family has opened a hot chicken restaurant outside of Nashville (they operate two restaurants there). \u201cYou can\u2019t get more authentic than getting it from me,\u201d Prince says. \u201cI\u2019m unapologetic about saying that.\u201d This opening was a long time in the making, and her struggle is not an exception, but more like the rule. According to the National Restaurant Association, just 8% of US restaurants are black-owned, largely because the racial wealth gap has made it difficult for African Americans to access the resources needed to launch food establishments. Adding salt to the wound is that although African Americans have a harder time starting their own restaurants, black culinary traditions have historically influenced food trends that non-blacks profit from. Adrian E Miller, James Beard award-winning author of Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine says that over the past 25 years, black and \u201cethnic\u201d foods have increasingly been reinterpreted and absorbed by the mainstream. In 2016, for instance, the department store Neiman Marcus sparked outrage for selling $66 collard greens and bacon, which is a soul food staple typically found in black-owned restaurants for under $10. \u201cSouthern food, it\u2019s exploding in popularity, but the people benefiting tend to be white chefs,\u201d Miller says. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going out to support soul food places.

This week\u2019s midyear economic fiscal outlook (Myefo) included new money earmarked for \u201ccontinued improvements to visa service arrangements\u201d over three years. The Coalition government has been pushing ahead with the estimated $1bn privatisation of the visa processing system since well before the last election. It was supposed to announce its decision on proceeding \u2013 or not proceeding \u2013 with a preferred tender in October. With costs partially met from existing resources, the Myefo papers revealed an additional $25.6m in 2019-20 had been committed \u201cto improve the online service delivery and data management capabilities of the visa and citizenship processing [information and communications technology] system\u201d. \u201cThe measure will improve the Department of Home Affairs\u2019 ability to verify the identity of individuals arriving in Australia,\u201d the papers said. \u201cThe measure will also allow continued engagement with the market for a strategic technology solution to ensure Australia\u2019s visa systems remain competitive, relevant and safeguard national security.\u201d Guardian Australia sought further information from the home affairs department twice but received no response. The opposition spokesman on immigration and citizenship, Andrew Giles, accused the prime minister, Scott Morrison, of \u201cfattening the pig for market day\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s already spent $80m on the tendering process and now Morrison is spending more than $30m to upgrade the IT system in order to privatise it,\u201d he said. Labor has consistently opposed the process, which has drawn significant attention and concern over the national security and employment implications of privatising the government function, and because a member of one of the two publicly known bidding consortiums is run by Scott Briggs, who is closely linked to senior members of government. Both Morrison and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had recused themselves from consideration of the tender \u201cdue to conflicts of interest\u201d. On Tuesday Giles said Dutton had refused to talk about the privatisation scheme \u201cbecause it can\u2019t be justified\u201d. The government has previously said it would retain responsibility and accountability for \u201csovereign functions including immigration policy, visa decision making and security checks\u201d. \u201cThe government is not privatising the visa system or outsourcing responsibility for visa decision making,\u201d the home affairs department spokesman said. Guardian Australia has previously reported departmental briefings to industry which said the successful tenderer could offset the $1bn cost by raising revenue through \u201cpremium\u201d services. However, Abul Rizvi, a former department deputy secretary, warned that that could see a private provider create fast and slow lanes for processing, which he said had \u201cfrightening\u201d long-term implications. The Community and Public Sector Union said privatising visa processing threatened 3,000 jobs. \u201c[T]his increased funding shows that the government are pushing ahead no matter the consequences,\u201d said the CPSU\u2019s national secretary, Melissa Donnelly. \u201cThe increased funding for privatisation today shows the government continues to ignore the international warnings from those that have gone down this path. \u201cVisas are already expensive in Australia, and costs have risen rapidly in the UK in just a few years since visa processing was privatised there.

There, as in Britain, members\u2019 bills are a chance for MPs to have laws that they have proposed debated in the house.

The official receptacle is stored in an office at New Zealand\u2019s parliament, Mallard said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in a place where it has enormous public access but it\u2019s not in a safe or anything.\u201d New Zealand is known for its socially progressive legislation, often passing bills on hotly contested issues ahead of other western countries. Some of those matters had become law only after their random selection from the biscuit tin, Mallard said. Among them were marriage equality, legalised in 2013, and assisted dying, which will go to New Zealanders for a referendum in 2020. \u201cGovernments often have a reluctance to lead on social change but often there are members who are prepared to stick their necks out and do what they think is right in this sort of area,\u201d Mallard said. \u201cThis probably provides just a bit more opportunity for them to do it.\u201d While the tin looks a little worse for wear, Mallard does not anticipate needing to replace it. \u201cThis was designed to keep biscuits fresh and I can\u2019t see the \u2026 counters going off in the next hundred years,\u201d he said.",

I can barely believe it when she says Christmas wouldn\u2019t be the same if she didn\u2019t thank me. We nearly lost you, I splutter. But I lived, she shrugs. The sugar hit is exquisite but sweetest of all is her forgiveness.</p> <p>No matter who you ask, it has been a difficult year in medicine. Pressures are high, morale low. Aside from the usual demands of seeing more patients with fewer resources and distinguishing honest patient care from administrative doublespeak, doctors have grappled with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/25/dozens-of-refugee-medical-transfers-held-up-by-naurus-controversial-approval-system\">refugee policy</a> and <a href=\"https://ama.com.au/media/climate-change-health-emergency\">climate change</a>. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/30/private-health-insurance\">\u201cdeath spiral\u201d</a> of Australian private health insurance has somehow been twisted into a verdict about the failings of the public hospital system. Violent patients and disgruntled relatives have seen it fit to flog doctors for systemic failures. The gap between expectation and reality has often seemed unbridgeable, but amid all this we have repeated a constant theme: our patients keep us going.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Patients help us sharpen our focus, hone our humanism, and find the best of ourselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Patients help us sharpen our focus, hone our humanism, and find the best of ourselves. Ironically, the greater the bureaucratic hardships the more we circle back to the great privilege and deep consolations of patient care. Therefore, for my final column of the year, I would like to say thank you to the patients who have eased our lives in untold ways.</p> <p>Let me begin with the patients in the waiting room. We know that many of you are sick, jittery or both and that you carry a 1,000-page novel to pass the time. We know that your appointment time must feel like a \u201crecommended retail price\u201d with an unclear relationship to reality. The staff don\u2019t know how long the doctor will be. The parking meter is expiring. You are frustrated but helpless.</p> <p>While you wait, we want you to know that we are seeing the patient who brings up \u201cone more thing\u201d, which turns out to be the most urgent symptom of all. Or we are navigating a delicate conversation with a woman who suspects but doesn\u2019t want to know that she is cognitively impaired. Or seeing a new patient who has burst into tears at the 14-minute mark and it would be unthinkable to say at 15 minutes that his allocated time is up. No doctor is proud of keeping patients waiting but to all the patients who tolerate the delay with grace and understanding, we say thank you for biting your tongue. Thank you for not making us feel worse or for simply acknowledging that we are busy. Let me also suggest that if you want the waiting times to go down, doctors can sympathise but elected politicians can effect change.</p> <p>Next I want to say thank you to inpatients. Acutely dependent on us, you are reluctant to protest against the many indignities of your situation. Sometimes every minute of delayed treatment matters. Other times communication is lacking. Or the environment is inimical to recovery \u2013 the nurse is slow, the tea is cold, your fellow patients are disruptive. To be clear, we want you to announce your chest pain and defy rude conduct, but if the 8pm pills were a little late, or your elective gastroscopy was bumped by a bleeding emergency, or your nurse spent more time on another patient, thank you for not losing your temper. All patients are needy, but some are needier. Your understanding that it\u2019s rarely our direct fault when things don\u2019t go according to plan is like a collective balm. It doesn\u2019t make us complacent; instead we appreciate the special resolve it must take to consider the big picture and not complain.</p> <p>Thank you to every patient who has stopped to talk to our cleaners, porters, tray-bearers, chaplains and volunteers. They are hidden in plain sight and they\u2019re an integral part of our workforce. Doctors and nurses are often thanked but your kindness to them means more than a mass-printed certificate because they come to work for you, and they are some of the staunchest defenders of your dignity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/14/letter-to-an-oncologist-do-you-remember-my-mum\">Letter to an oncologist: Do you remember my mum? | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have saved the best for last. It\u2019s no secret that the rewards of being a doctor exact a price. My children know that patients typically take precedence over performances although this is increasingly common in many households. But on many days the job of being an oncologist continues beyond the hospital with ethical dilemmas and heartbreaking situations, none of which can wait until tomorrow.

      "bodyText": "It is dangerously hot but he has chosen to attend his appointment when others have rescheduled. His cancer is gone, and his life has resumed a normality that once felt permanently threatened. His return to the factory line was like an ascension to a throne, a reminder of his family\u2019s dependence on his meagre income. Our visit is short and reassuring. As he leaves he carefully removes a box cocooned by an ice pack and says in halting English: \u201cDoctor, I made for you.\u201d He opens the box to reveal a sparkling creation of multi-layered jelly, the shimmering surface too perfect to break. He has prepared it out of concern for my welfare on a fire-prone day because he thought I might not stop for hydration. Touched, I tell him that thank you doesn\u2019t seem enough, but he simply beams and says: \u201cYou are good to me.\u201d Months later it\u2019s nearly Christmas, a day that I had not expected my elderly patient to see after being felled by a single dose of chemotherapy. Tears rolled down her eyes when I apologetically explained that I hadn\u2019t anticipated such a dramatic reaction. Her expression that accused me of being negligent stung more than any words. Despite my grave fears, she recovered. She is famous for pastries made from a recipe in her head. For years she has brought them in, but now after her near-death even the thought of the delights seems heretical. But she has made a special appointment to deliver a mound of goods that must have taken all day to bake. Her back aches but her eyes are smiling. I can barely believe it when she says Christmas wouldn\u2019t be the same if she didn\u2019t thank me. We nearly lost you, I splutter. But I lived, she shrugs. The sugar hit is exquisite but sweetest of all is her forgiveness. No matter who you ask, it has been a difficult year in medicine. Pressures are high, morale low. Aside from the usual demands of seeing more patients with fewer resources and distinguishing honest patient care from administrative doublespeak, doctors have grappled with refugee policy and climate change. The \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of Australian private health insurance has somehow been twisted into a verdict about the failings of the public hospital system. Violent patients and disgruntled relatives have seen it fit to flog doctors for systemic failures. The gap between expectation and reality has often seemed unbridgeable, but amid all this we have repeated a constant theme: our patients keep us going. Patients help us sharpen our focus, hone our humanism, and find the best of ourselves. Ironically, the greater the bureaucratic hardships the more we circle back to the great privilege and deep consolations of patient care. Therefore, for my final column of the year, I would like to say thank you to the patients who have eased our lives in untold ways. Let me begin with the patients in the waiting room. We know that many of you are sick, jittery or both and that you carry a 1,000-page novel to pass the time. We know that your appointment time must feel like a \u201crecommended retail price\u201d with an unclear relationship to reality. The staff don\u2019t know how long the doctor will be. The parking meter is expiring. You are frustrated but helpless. While you wait, we want you to know that we are seeing the patient who brings up \u201cone more thing\u201d, which turns out to be the most urgent symptom of all. Or we are navigating a delicate conversation with a woman who suspects but doesn\u2019t want to know that she is cognitively impaired. Or seeing a new patient who has burst into tears at the 14-minute mark and it would be unthinkable to say at 15 minutes that his allocated time is up. No doctor is proud of keeping patients waiting but to all the patients who tolerate the delay with grace and understanding, we say thank you for biting your tongue. Thank you for not making us feel worse or for simply acknowledging that we are busy. Let me also suggest that if you want the waiting times to go down, doctors can sympathise but elected politicians can effect change. Next I want to say thank you to inpatients. Acutely dependent on us, you are reluctant to protest against the many indignities of your situation. Sometimes every minute of delayed treatment matters. Other times communication is lacking. Or the environment is inimical to recovery \u2013 the nurse is slow, the tea is cold, your fellow patients are disruptive. To be clear, we want you to announce your chest pain and defy rude conduct, but if the 8pm pills were a little late, or your elective gastroscopy was bumped by a bleeding emergency, or your nurse spent more time on another patient, thank you for not losing your temper. All patients are needy, but some are needier. Your understanding that it\u2019s rarely our direct fault when things don\u2019t go according to plan is like a collective balm. It doesn\u2019t make us complacent; instead we appreciate the special resolve it must take to consider the big picture and not complain. Thank you to every patient who has stopped to talk to our cleaners, porters, tray-bearers, chaplains and volunteers. They are hidden in plain sight and they\u2019re an integral part of our workforce. Doctors and nurses are often thanked but your kindness to them means more than a mass-printed certificate because they come to work for you, and they are some of the staunchest defenders of your dignity. I have saved the best for last. It\u2019s no secret that the rewards of being a doctor exact a price. My children know that patients typically take precedence over performances although this is increasingly common in many households. But on many days the job of being an oncologist continues beyond the hospital with ethical dilemmas and heartbreaking situations, none of which can wait until tomorrow. The time given to patients is taken from family, and it can be difficult for young minds to understand their place in a parent\u2019s world that is meant to place the child at its centre. Recently at the shops a former patient saw me with my daughter and hurried to catch us. Addressing my daughter, she said: \u201cI want you to know that I used to be very sick once and your mum and others took amazing care of me for many years. You should be very proud of your mum \u2013 I know I am.\u201d \u201cWow, that\u2019s so nice of you!\u201d my clearly thrilled daughter replied. But it wasn\u2019t merely nice. It was a profound act of generosity that made an impression on my child and her siblings in a way that none of my reasoned explanations could. Doctors are regularly lauded for helping patients but we should stop to acknowledge all the ways in which our patients help us. You may not even know that you were the best thing that happened to us today, but thank you for accompanying us on the journey. I would like to wish you a happy holiday season and look forward to sharing more news and views next year. \u2022 Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

      "body": "<p>I left Sing Street, the new musical from Enda Walsh and John Carney at New York Theatre Workshop, with a song on my lips. Unfortunately, that song was Falling Slowly, from Walsh and Carney\u2019s previous musical, Once. Enjoyable, admirable and starring a superabundance of talented actor-musicians, many of them still in their teens, Sing Street is nevertheless so slim it seems to disappear before the last note has sounded.</p> <p>Adapted by Walsh from Carney\u2019s 2016 film and directed by Rebecca Taichman, the show is set in a no-hope 1980s Dublin. Sixteen-year-old Conor (Brenock O\u2019Connor, sweet and charismatic) finds himself removed from his fee-paying school and enrolled at a free all-boys academy run by the Christian Brothers. When Conor meets a girl, Zara Devlin\u2019s poised Raphina, he asks her to star in a music video for his band. Trouble is, he doesn\u2019t have a band. With the help of Darren, a new school friend, he instantly acquires one. He acquires Raphina nearly as easily.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/05/jagged-little-pill-review-alanis-morissette-musical-broadway-new-york-broadhurst-theatre\">Jagged Little Pill review \u2013 Alanis musical hits Broadway with a bang</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sing Street exists on the rickety border between grim realism and fairytale. Some of the conflicts seem real enough \u2013 the recession, Conor\u2019s parents\u2019 unhappiness, the abusive family lives of several of his friends, the almost offhand bullying by the head of school \u2013 but they\u2019re resolved or abandoned so swiftly that they feel less like obstacles and more like minor annoyances. Conor writes without anxiety or pause; his band plays each number perfectly from the first count-off. The blighted life of Conor\u2019s brother, Brendan (Gus Halper, who is excellent), weighted down with depression and agoraphobia is compelling, but this isn\u2019t his story.</p> <p>Walsh likes stories.

      "bodyText": "I left Sing Street, the new musical from Enda Walsh and John Carney at New York Theatre Workshop, with a song on my lips. Unfortunately, that song was Falling Slowly, from Walsh and Carney\u2019s previous musical, Once. Enjoyable, admirable and starring a superabundance of talented actor-musicians, many of them still in their teens, Sing Street is nevertheless so slim it seems to disappear before the last note has sounded. Adapted by Walsh from Carney\u2019s 2016 film and directed by Rebecca Taichman, the show is set in a no-hope 1980s Dublin. Sixteen-year-old Conor (Brenock O\u2019Connor, sweet and charismatic) finds himself removed from his fee-paying school and enrolled at a free all-boys academy run by the Christian Brothers. When Conor meets a girl, Zara Devlin\u2019s poised Raphina, he asks her to star in a music video for his band. Trouble is, he doesn\u2019t have a band. With the help of Darren, a new school friend, he instantly acquires one. He acquires Raphina nearly as easily. Sing Street exists on the rickety border between grim realism and fairytale. Some of the conflicts seem real enough \u2013 the recession, Conor\u2019s parents\u2019 unhappiness, the abusive family lives of several of his friends, the almost offhand bullying by the head of school \u2013 but they\u2019re resolved or abandoned so swiftly that they feel less like obstacles and more like minor annoyances. Conor writes without anxiety or pause; his band plays each number perfectly from the first count-off. The blighted life of Conor\u2019s brother, Brendan (Gus Halper, who is excellent), weighted down with depression and agoraphobia is compelling, but this isn\u2019t his story. Walsh likes stories. Plot? Not so much. In adhering closely to the film script, already insubstantial and more of a mood piece than a yarn, the narrative keeps eluding him and most of the characters remain undeveloped. Besides Eamon (Sam Poon), Conor\u2019s rabbit-loving co-songwriter, I couldn\u2019t tell you who Conor\u2019s other bandmates are. (One is tall? One has a moustache?)

Trump would become only the third president in US history to be impeached, along with <strong>Andrew Johnson </strong>and <strong>Bill Clinton. </strong>(<strong>Richard Nixon</strong> resigned before his pending impeachment.)</p> \n  <p>House leaders appear to be on schedule to hold their Wednesday vote, with the judiciary committee releasing its report this morning on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.</p> \n  <p>In the 658-page report, <strong>Democrats </strong>on the judiciary committee accuse Trump of committing constitutional and criminal bribery by trying to press Ukraine to investigate <strong>Joe Biden </strong>and the 2016 election as the country\u2019s military aid was held up.</p> \n  <p>\u201cApplying the constitutional definition of \u2018bribery\u2019 here, there can be little doubt that it is satisfied,\u201d the report reads. \u201cPresident Trump solicited <strong>President Zelensky</strong> for a \u2018favor\u2019 of great personal value to him; he did so corruptly; and he did so in a scheme to influence his own official actions respecting the release of military and security assistance and the offer of a White House meeting. Although President Trump\u2019s actions need not rise to the level of a criminal violation to justify impeachment, his conduct here was criminal.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Republicans </strong>on the judiciary committee wrote a dissent to the report, arguing their Democratic counterparts had committed a grave mistep that could jeopardize future presidencies. The starkly different perspectives on Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine likely foreshadow the Wednesday impeachment vote, which is expected to fall almost entirely along party lines.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84e63dbe833e09b5088c733bf053579ba6e32f6c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84e63dbe833e09b5088c733bf053579ba6e32f6c/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actors hold up flowers as they perform during a ceremony to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in Bastogne, Belgium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actors hold up flowers as they perform during a ceremony to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in Bastogne, Belgium.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francisco Seco/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping an eye on today:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Trump </strong>will have lunch with vice-president <strong>Mike</strong> <strong>Pence</strong> and participate in a roundtable discussion on the Governors\u2019 Initiative on Regulatory Innovation.

We\u2019ll be back tomorrow to cover the lead up to the final House vote to impeach Trump. For now, here are some key links and developments from today: Chuck Schumer, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, warned that a Senate impeachment trial without witnesses would amount to a \u201ccover-up\u201d by the White House. \u201cTrials have witnesses. That\u2019s what trials are all about,\u201d Schumer told reporters. \u201cTo engage a trial without the facts coming out is to engage in a cover-up.\u201d The House judiciary committee laid out its case for impeachment with the release of a 658-page report, charging Trump with placing \u201chis personal, political interests above our national security, our free and fair elections, and our system of checks and balances\u201d. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, said in a New Yorker interview that he wanted Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, \u201cout of the way\u201d as he pushed for investigations into Joe Biden. Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, said Trump\u2019s conduct is \u201cdestructive to our republic\u201d and that it was \u201cvital\u201d the president is impeached. More than a dozen House Democrats who represent districts that Trump carried in 2016 have said they would support impeachment, indicating the Democratic caucus will be largely unified when the vote takes place on Wednesday. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo was criticized after sharing a photo of the Foreign Affairs Policy Board, an advisory group offering counsel to department leadership, that included no women and only one person of color. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to investigators about his interactions with Russia, finally had a sentencing date set \u2013 28 January. Elizabeth Warren called on Mike Bloomberg to \u201canswer\u201d for his past sexist comments and has argued that Bloomberg\u2019s company should release women from nondisclosure agreements so that they can speak freely about the work environment. The US supreme court decided it will not hear an appeal of a ruling that allows homeless people to sleep in public outdoor spaces, dashing the hopes of some west coast cities and municipalities grappling with a homelessness crisis that it would be overturned. A federal judge is allowing Georgia to proceed with a mass purge of its voting rolls planned for Monday evening, but he also scheduled a hearing later in the week to hear more arguments. Next year America faces an epic choice ... and the results could define the country for a generation. A message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened \u2013 democracy, civility, truth. This US administration is establishing new norms of behaviour. Anger and cruelty disfigure public discourse and lying is commonplace. Truth is being chased away. In the coming year, many vital aspects of American public life are in play \u2013 the supreme court, abortion rights, climate policy, wealth inequality, Big Tech and much more. The stakes could hardly be higher \u2013 and the need for a robust, independent press has never been greater. As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. Senator Mitt Romney, another Republican who is facing close scrutiny for his impeachment stance, has dodged questions today about a Senate trial: After Chuck Schumer said a Senate trial without witnesses would be tantamount to a \u201ccover-up\u201d, Romney declined to give his opinion, telling a CNN reporter: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have any point of view, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not willing to share that point of view till I\u2019ve had the chance to talk to others and get their perspectives.\u201d Meanwhile, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told reporters this evening that there was \u201cno reason\u201d for witnesses to testify at a Senate impeachment trial, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t do things just because Senator Schumer asks us to do them.\u201d A new report from the New York Times says children with the greatest economic needs are least likely to benefit from a critical tax credit. From the Times: The 2017 tax bill, President Trump\u2019s main domestic achievement, doubled the maximum credit in the two-decade-old program and extended it to families earning as much as $400,000 a year (up from $110,000). The credit now costs the federal government $127 billion a year \u2014 far more than better-known programs like the earned-income tax credit ($65 billion) and food stamps ($60 billion). But children with the greatest economic needs are least likely to benefit. While Republicans say the increase shows concern for ordinary families, 35 percent of children fail to receive the full $2,000 because their parents earn too little, researchers at Columbia University found. A quarter get a partial sum and 10 percent get nothing. Among those excluded from the full credit are half of Latinos, 53 percent of blacks and 70 percent of children with single mothers. Senator Susan Collins, a more moderate Republican whose vote will be closely watched in the impeachment trial, said she would take a different approach than Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell: McConnell has faced intense scrutiny for saying his plan was to let the president\u2019s legal team inform the Senate GOP\u2019s positions on impeachment. The Senate majority leader has said he is explicitly coordinating with White House counsel. Asked about it today, Collins said she was only consulting with Congressional research service, which provides policy and legal analysis: The US has a plan to send asylum seekers to Honduras who are not from the country, according to documents obtained by the LA Times: The move would in effect end their chances of seeking asylum in the US, the Times said, reporting on an agreement signed between the US secretary of homeland security and Honduras\u2019 foreign minister in September. The agreement reportedly said adults and families seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border could be sent to Honduras without getting an opportunity to make an asylum case in the US. The department of homeland security did not comment to the Times on its report. The Trump administration has aggressively targeted asylum seekers and has already reached similar agreements with El Salvador and Guatemala. Advocates say the ongoing efforts to prevent migrants from seeking asylum in the US has had deadly consequences and will continue to create an escalating humanitarian crisis.

Thank you. In the coming year, many vital aspects of American public life are in play \u2013 the supreme court, abortion rights, climate policy, wealth inequality, Big Tech and much more.

As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. Senator Elizabeth Warren has called on new 2020 rival Mike Bloomberg to \u201canswer\u201d for his past sexist comments and has argued that Bloomberg\u2019s company should release women from nondisclosure agreements so that they can speak freely about the work environment: From Warren, who just spoke with reporters in Fort Madison, Iowa: I think [nondisclosure agreements] are a way for people to hide bad things they\u2019ve done. And I think that women should be able to speak. They need to be released from [nondisclosure agreements]... When women raise concerns like this, we have to pay attention. We have to listen to them, and if Michael Bloomberg has made comments like this, then he has to answer for them.\u201d ABC News recently reported on multiple lawsuits in which women accused Bloomberg of making crude remarks in the 1990s and fostering an uncomfortable work environment for women. Bloomberg has denied those allegations. Facing scrutiny last month for his previous comments about women, Bloomberg\u2019s team said the former New York City mayor recognized that past remarks were \u201cwrong\u201d, but he didn\u2019t directly apologize. A spokesperson told the New York Times: Mike has come to see that some of what he has said is disrespectful and wrong. He believes his words have not always aligned with his values and the way he has led his life.\u201d Bloomberg is also facing some fresh scrutiny today surrounding New York City\u2019s surveillance of Muslims when he was mayor: Congressman Andy Kim, another House Democrat targeted by Trump, has also confirmed that he will vote yes on impeachment: The New Jersey representative is one of the 31 Democrats in swing districts that backed the president. Trump and his allies have been urging supporters to pressure the Democrats to vote against impeachment. The Department of Justice is taking \u201cextraordinary positions\u201d to avoid disclosing grand-jury material that is needed for the House\u2019s impeachment of Trump and Senate trial to remove him from office, according to a new House judiciary committee brief: From the brief: The Department of Justice (DOJ) takes extraordinary positions in this case. It does so to avoid disclosing grand-jury material needed for the House\u2019s impeachment of President Trump and the Senate\u2019s trial to remove him from office. This Court should reject DOJ\u2019s efforts to insulate the President from Congress\u2019s impeachment power and should promptly affirm Chief Judge Howell\u2019s order providing for staged and limited disclosure of grand-jury materials to the House... The need for the withheld material grows more urgent by the day.\u201d Boeing is temporarily halting production of its grounded 737 Max after the Federal Aviation Administration said last week it would not approve the plane\u2019s return to service before 2020. The decision, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, came after the US planemaker\u2019s board held a regular two-day meeting in Chicago over the weekend. The Max, which was Boeing\u2019s bestselling plane, has been involved in two fatal crashes that claimed 346 lives. More than 700 Max jets are now grounded worldwide. It is the first time in 20 years that Boeing has halted 737 production and the move could have significant repercussions for the US economy. Full story from the Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe here: Another former Obama cabinet member has endorsed Joe Biden. Jack Lew, the former treasury secretary, is the fifth member of Obama\u2019s cabinet to back the former vice president: Lew also previously served as White House chief of staff. Watch Lew\u2019s comments on Biden here: The US and Mexico have resolved a labor rights dispute that threatened to derail plans for the House to approve a new North American trade deal this week, the Washington Post reports: Jesus Seade, Mexico\u2019s deputy foreign minister for North America, had in recent days been raising concerns about new labor attaches that he said could circumvent an agreement about American inspections of factories. But he said today he was \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with Trump administration assurances about limits on the new labor attaches, according to the Post. The president spent part of his afternoon lamenting the lack of fireworks at Mount Rushmore in recent years, according to reporters: Governor Kristi Noem, a Republican, thanked Trump for apparently helping ensure that Mount Rushmore could have fireworks next Fourth of July holiday after a decade without it due to forest fire risks: The president has reportedly boasted in the past about wanting his face to be on Mount Rushmore, but that subject did not come up today. Hi all - Sam Levin here in Los Angeles, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. Another House Democrat in a district won by Trump has officially announced support for impeachment \u2013 Congresswoman Elaine Luria of Virginia: The president and his allies have been targeting 31 Democrats who represent swing districts with large populations of Trump supporters. That\u2019s it from me on the blog today. My west coast colleague, Sam Levin, will take things over for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer held a press conference on Capitol Hill, during which he reiterated his demand that White House officials -- including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton -- testify during the likely Senate trial. The New York Democrat argued holding a Senate trial without witnesses would be the equivalent of a \u201ccover-up\u201d. More than a dozen House Democrats who represent districts that Trump carried in 2016 have said they would support impeachment, indicating the Democratic caucus will be largely unified when the vote takes place on Wednesday. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, said in a newly published New Yorker article that he wanted Maria Yovanvitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, \u201cout of the way\u201d as he pushed for investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. The sentencing for Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to investgiators about his interactions with Russia, has been set for Jan. 28. Carly Fiorina, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, argued it was \u201cvital\u201d that Trump be impeached, but she would not say whether she would vote for the eventual Democratic nominee next year. Sam will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, another freshman House Democrat who represents a district that Trump carried in 2016, announced she would also vote in favor of impeachment. More than half of the Democrats representing Trump districts have now come out in favor of impeachment, indicating the House Democratic caucus will likely be largely unified when the vote takes place Wednesday. The newly released Quinnipiac poll found Joe Biden has a double-digit lead over the rest of the Democratic presidential field, as Michael Bloomberg has crept into fifth place just weeks after launching his bid. According to Quinnipiac, Biden has the support of 30% of Democrats. Elizabeth Warren is in second place, but she is 13 points behind Biden at 17%. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg round out the top four at 16% and 9%, respectively. But Bloomberg and Buttigieg are effectively tied because the former New York mayor is only 2 points behind, well within the poll\u2019s margin of error. Although the qualification criteria for the January debate in Iowa have not yet been announced, Bloomberg could likely qualify for the event if he continues to poll at similar levels. Speaking to reporters in the cabinet room at the White House, Trump said Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, had not shared \u201ctoo much\u201d with him after returning from Ukraine. Trump\u2019s comments come hours after the New Yorker published a story in which Giuliani said he wanted Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, \u201cout of the way\u201d to push for investigations of Joe Biden and the 2016 election. \u201cI believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way,\u201d Giuliani said last month, according to the newly published article. \u201cShe was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.\u201d According to a newly released poll, Trump\u2019s approval rating has edged up a bit and opposition to impeachment has slightly decreased since the start of the public impeachment hearings. The Quinnipiac poll found 43 percent of registered voters approve of Trump\u2019s job performance, compared to 38 percent in an Oct. 23 poll. The survey also showed opposition to impeachment has increased from 46% in the October poll to 51% now. Gil Cisneros of California, a freshman House Democrat from California, said he will vote in favor of impeachment, becoming the sixteenth Democratic congressman from a Trump district to announce his support. \u201cI hope all my colleagues will join in recognizing this grave threat and stand up to this Administration in defense of our Constitution,\u201d Cisneros said in a statement announcing his decision. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to investigators about his interactions with Russia, finally has a sentencing date: Jan. 28. The Washington Post reports: U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of Washington, D.C. dismissed Flynn\u2019s motion to find prosecutors in contempt. In a 92-page decision, Sullivan ruled there was no basis for Flynn\u2019s allegations that federal law enforcement officials entrapped the retired three-star Army general into accepting a plea deal and that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s prosecutors had not wrongfully held back 50 requests for evidence from Flynn\u2019s attorneys. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his interactions with Russia\u2019s ambassador after the 2016 U.S. election, had been set to be sentenced Dec. 18. Sullivan this month delayed the sentencing pending a report by a Justice Department inspector general on how the FBI handled the Russia investigation, which reviewed topics related to Flynn\u2019s allegations. The report from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz released last week found that the FBI was justified in opening its 2016 probe into possible coordination between Russia and four members of the Trump campaign, including Flynn. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer criticized the White House for its handling of the impeachment inquiry, arguing a Senate trial without witnesses would be the equivalent of a \u201ccover-up\u201d. \u201cTrials have witnesses. That\u2019s what trials are all about,\u201d Schumer told reporters at his press conference. \u201cTo engage a trial without the facts coming out is to engage in a cover-up.\u201d Echoing the letter he sent to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer said four White House officials -- includng acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton -- should testify in the likely impeachment trial. The White House has repeatedly dodged impeachment investigators\u2019 efforts to have administration officials testify, but Schumer expressed confidence that Democrats and Republicans would support his proposal. Schumer also disputed any comparison between this case and Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, when Schumer voted against witness testiony. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is holding a press conference on Capitol Hill, demanding the likely impeachment trial be \u201cfair\u201d and uncover any relevant evidence. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a single good argument\u201d as to why White House advisers shouldn\u2019t testify or requested documents shouldn\u2019t be turned over, Schumer said. Another freshman Democrat in a Trump district, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, anounced he would also vote to impeach the president, calling his conduct \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Cunningham becomes the 15th House Democrat from a Trump district to announce support for impeachment, signaling the Democratic caucus will likely be largely unified when the vote takes place on Wednesday. Congressman Ben McAdams just became the fourteenth House Democrat from a district Trump carried in 2016 to announce his support for the impeachment inquiry, as the Democratic caucus appears largely unified ahead of Wednesday\u2019s expected vote. Two more freshman House Democrats -- Jennifer Wexton of Virginia and Ben McAdams of Utah -- have announced they will vote in favor of impeaching Trump. The announcements will come as a relief to House Democratic leadership, particularly after congressman Jeff Van Drew signaled over the weekend he would switch his party affiliation due to his opposition to impeachment. The string of announcements from lawmakers like Wexton, McAdams and Elissa Slotkin indicate the Democratic caucus will be almost entirely unified on impeachment. So far, the only House Democrat expected to oppose impeachment is Collin Peterson, although the Minnesota congressman has said he does not plan to leave the party over the issue. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, said in a New Yorker interview that he wanted Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, \u201cout of the way\u201d as he pushed for investigations into Joe Biden. \u201cI believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way,\u201d Giuliani told the magazine last month, according to a newly published article. \u201cShe was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.\u201d Democrats will likely point to Giuliani\u2019s comments as evidence that Trump abused his power by recalling Yovanovitch, a widely praised career diplomat whose reputation was smeared by some of the president\u2019s allies. Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators that, when the deputy secretary of state informed her she was leaving Ukraine, he specifically said she had done nothing wrong but that the directive was coming from above him. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo is being criticized after sharing a photo of the Foreign Affairs Policy Board, an advisory group offering counsel to department leadership, that included no women and only one person of color. Democratic congressman Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, chastized Pompeo and demanded the secretary of state do more to accurately represent America\u2019s diversity among his advisers. And a former state department official noted the all-male board goes against official guidance from the US government on including women in important policy discussions. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House judiciary committee released its impeachment report, accusing Trump of committing constitutional and criminal bribery ahead of Wednesday\u2019s expected House-wide vote on impeachment. The White House is reviewing Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s letter asking for an eventual impeachment trial to include testimony from White House officials, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. Trump suggested he may not participate in the official presidential debates next year, confirming the New York Times\u2019 reporting last week that he has complained about the commission in charge of organizing the debates. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Congressman Joe Cunningham, another freshman House Democrat representing a district Trump easily carried in 2016, said he would announce his decision on impeachment later today. Asked what factors were affecting his decision, Cunningham said he was weighing \u201cthe allegations, which are very serious, and what kind of marker we want to set down for what\u2019s acceptable later on and also what\u2019s best for the country as a whole.\u201d Cunningham\u2019s eventual vote could affect his reelection prospects, considering he won his race last year by only 1%, but the congressman previously voted to formalize the proceedings of the impeachment inquiry. Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer delivered a speech in Iowa City today on his \u201cvision for progressive economic change,\u201d in which the billionaire activist criticzed the frontrunners in the primary. \u201cLook, I have a lot of respect for the four leading Democratic candidates in this race,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the truth: none of them \u2014 not Vice President Biden, not Senator Warren, not Senator Sanders, not Mayor Pete \u2014 have built or run a successful, international business. None of them have a private sector track record of creating jobs \u2014 none of them have first-hand experience growing wealth and prosperity.\u201d Steyer told the audience that the eventual Democratic nominee would need to make an economic argument why Trump does not deserve a second term. \u201cThe Democratic Party \u2014 and America \u2014 needs a nominee who can go to Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin and places all over this country \u2014 and credibly talk about growth and prosperity,\u201d Steyer said. But Steyer appears to be having a hard time convincing Democratic voters that he is best suited to defeat Trump. A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll showed Steyer polling at less than 1%, although he is one of only seven candidates who have qualified for Thursday\u2019s debate. Trump has made more than 15,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to the Washington Post. The president has told more false claims in 2019 than the two previous years combined. The Post reports: In 2017, President Trump made nearly 1,999 false or misleading claims. In 2018, he added another 5,689, for a total of 7,688. Now, with a few weeks still left in 2019, the president already has more than doubled the total number of false or misleading claims in just a single year. As of Dec. 10, his 1,055th day in office, Trump had made 15,413 false or misleading claims, according to the Fact Checker\u2019s database that analyzes, categorizes and tracks every suspect statement he has uttered. That\u2019s an average of more than 32 claims a day since our last update 62 days ago. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, the freshman Democrat who officially announced today she would vote in favor of impeaching the president, has kicked off a town hall in her Michigan district, which Trump carried in 2016. The congresswoman was met with applause and boos from the audience, but one reporter said Slotkin\u2019s supporters seemed to outnumber her detractors. Slotkin said in a Detroit Free Press op-ed published this morning that she would support impeaching Trump, even though the vote could affect her reelection next year. \u201cOver the past few months, I\u2019ve been told more times that I can count that the vote I\u2019ll be casting this week will mark the end of my short political career. That may be,\u201d Slotkin wrote. \u201cBut in the national security world that I come from, we are trained to make hard calls on things, even if they are unpopular, if we believe the security of the country is at stake. There are some decisions in life that have to be made based on what you know in your bones is right. And this is one of those times.\u201d The Supreme Court decided this morning not to review a lower court\u2019s ruling blocking an Idaho ordinance trying to keep homeless people from sleeping on the street. The AP reports: The justices on Monday did not comment as they left in place a ruling that struck down a Boise, Idaho, ordinance. The ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals applies across several Western states where cities are struggling with homelessness brought on by rising housing costs and income inequality. Many have similar restrictions that aim to keep homeless people from sleeping on their streets. The appeals court held that Boise could not make it a crime for homeless people to sleep on the streets when no alternative shelter is available. The decision the justices refused to review found that the Boise ordinance violated the constitutional ban on \u2018cruel and unusual punishment.\u2019 Cory Booker is encouraging his Twitter followers to support the eventual Democratic candidate who will run against Jeff Van Drew, the anti-impeachment congressman who reportedly intends to switch his party affiliation to Republican. Van Drew, a fellow New Jersey lawmaker, has actually endorsed Booker\u2019s White House bid, but it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll stand by that endorsement after he changes parties. Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, said in an interview that it was \u201cvital\u201d to impeach the president. \u201cI think it is vital that he be impeached,\u201d Fiorina told CNN. But she was skeptical of whether Trump should be removed from office \u201cthis close to an election.\u201d \u201cSome of this conduct, like publicly berating a decorated war veteran who shows up in response to a lawfully issued subpoena of Congress, I think that conduct is not just unbecoming, I think it\u2019s destructive to our republic,\u201d Fiorina said in the interview. Fiorina said she voted for Trump in 2016, despite her tension with the then-candidate when the two were seeking the Republican nomination. Trump was criticized for saying of Fiorina in 2015, \u201cLook at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\u201d Trump claimed the comment was not meant as a dig at Fiorina\u2019s appearance, but the former HP CEO said at a debate shortly after the comment was published, \u201cI think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\u201d But despite being \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d by Trump\u2019s job performance, Fiorina would not say whether she would vote against him next year. \u201cIt depends who the Democrats put up,\u201d she said. A newly released poll found Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders leading the Democratic presidential primary days before the sixth debate takes place Thursday in Los Angeles. According to the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, Biden is attracting the support of 24% of Democrats compared to Sanders\u2019 22%. Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg round out the top four at 17% and 13%, respectively. But the poll also interestingly showed Cory Booker hitting 4%, a bump in support after the New Jersey senator failed to qualify for Thursday\u2019s debate stage. Booker\u2019s campaign has complained about the relative dearth of polling since last month\u2019s debate, claiming new polls would show his support increasing. If this poll is accurate, Booker\u2019s team might have been right, which could help him qualify for the January debate. The Democratic National Committee has announced the presidential candidates will debate in Des Moines on January 14, less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses, but they have not yet released the criteria to qualify. The White House is reportedly reviewing the letter sent by Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, which calls for a \u201cfair and honest\u2019\u2019 trial followng the likely House vote to impeach Trump. \u201cThis trial must be one that is fair, that considers all of the relevant facts, and that exercises the Senate\u2019s \u2018sole Power of Impeachment\u2019 under the Constitution with integrity and dignity,\u201d Schumer wrote to majority leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cThe trial must be one that not only hears all of the evidence and adjudicates the case fairly; it must also pass the fairness test with the American people.\u201d Schumer also called for the Senate to hear testiony from White House officials, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. But considering Republicans control the Senate, Democrats will have little recourse if McConnell chooses to ignore all of Schumer\u2019s requests. \u201cLeader McConnell has made it clear he plans to meet with Leader Schumer to discuss the contours of a trial soon,\u201d a McConnell spokesman said in response to Schumer\u2019s letter. \u201cThat timeline has not changed.\u201d Cheri Bustos, the chairwoman of House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, said her organization would hire former staffers to congressman Jeff van Drew who resigned in protest over his decision to join the Republican Party. Bustos followed that tweet with a fundraising pitch, asking supporters to help keep Van Drew\u2019s district in Democratic hands by donating to the DCCC. At least six staffers for congressman Jeff Van Drew have reportedly resigned following reports that the freshman Democrat, who has denounced the impeachment inquiry, would switch his party affiliation to Republican this week. The staffers wrote in a letter that they were \u201cdeeply saddened and disappointed\u201d by Van Drew\u2019s decision, which they said \u201cdoes not align with the values we brought to this job when we joined his office.\u201d Van Drew has criticized Democratic leadership for their handling of teh impeachment inquiry, arguing they have made it into a political exercise. \u201cIt was supposed to be bipartisan, it was supposed to be incontrovertible. It was supposed to be something that was always on the rarest of circumstances,\u201d Van Drew said last week. \u201cWell it\u2019s not bipartisan.\u201d Van Drew\u2019s reported decision to switch parties comes after a Friday meeting with Trump, as well as polling showing a majority of his constituents want to see a new Democratic candidate on the ballot next year. Trump\u2019s tweet about potentially skipping the official debates next year comes days after the New York Times reported the president was considering sitting out the events. The Times reported last week: Mr. Trump has told advisers that he does not trust the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonprofit entity that sponsors the debates, the two people said. Less of a concern for Mr. Trump than who will emerge as the Democratic nominee is which media personality will be chosen as the debate moderator, according to people in contact with him. ... In the 2016 general election debates, Mr. Trump repeatedly complained about being at a disadvantage to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. And the post-debate polls showed Mr. Trump had good reason to be concerned: Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton were essentially tied in the polls going into the first debate, but she received a bump after each of the three face-to-face matchups. ... After his performance in one of the debates was panned, Mr. Trump blamed a \u2018defective mic\u2019 and questioned whether it was done \u2018on purpose\u2019 to put him at a disadvantage. It turned out that a technical malfunction had indeed affected the volume of his voice during that debate, in September 2016. Because this week didn\u2019t already have enough going on, Trump has now suggested he may not participate in the official debates scheduled by the Commission on Presidential Debates, claiming the group is \u201cstacked with Trump Haters &amp; Never Trumpers.\u201d The president dubiously claimed the debates were \u201cup to me\u201d given his incumbency and suggested he would instead consider debating the eventual Democratic nominee \u201cdirectly &amp; avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased Commission.\u201d The commission announced in October it would hold three presidential debates next year on Sept. 29, Oct. 15 and Oct. 22. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, one of several Democrats to flip a dsitrict in 2018 that Trump carried two years ealier, announced she would vote to impeach the president. The Michigan Democrat previously wrote an op-ed supporting the impeachment inquiry, but this is the first time she has publicly confirmed how she would vote on Wednesday. \u201cOver the past few days, I have done what I was trained to do as a CIA officer who worked for both Republicans and Democrats: I took a step back, looked at the full body of available information, and tried to make an objective decision on my vote,\u201d Slotkin wrote in the Detroit Free Press. \u201cI will be voting yes on both [articles of impeachment].\u201d Slotkin acknowledged the vote could affect her reelection bid next year but argued impeachment was in the country\u2019s best interest. \u201cOver the past few months, I\u2019ve been told more times that I can count that the vote I\u2019ll be casting this week will mark the end of my short political career. That may be,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut in the national security world that I come from, we are trained to make hard calls on things, even if they are unpopular, if we believe the security of the country is at stake.\u201d Good morning, live blog readers! This will likely be a historic week in Washington, as the House is expected to vote to impeach Donald Trump on Wednesday. Trump would become only the third president in US history to be impeached, along with Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. (Richard Nixon resigned before his pending impeachment.) House leaders appear to be on schedule to hold their Wednesday vote, with the judiciary committee releasing its report this morning on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. In the 658-page report, Democrats on the judiciary committee accuse Trump of committing constitutional and criminal bribery by trying to press Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election as the country\u2019s military aid was held up. \u201cApplying the constitutional definition of \u2018bribery\u2019 here, there can be little doubt that it is satisfied,\u201d the report reads. \u201cPresident Trump solicited President Zelensky for a \u2018favor\u2019 of great personal value to him; he did so corruptly; and he did so in a scheme to influence his own official actions respecting the release of military and security assistance and the offer of a White House meeting. Although President Trump\u2019s actions need not rise to the level of a criminal violation to justify impeachment, his conduct here was criminal.\u201d Republicans on the judiciary committee wrote a dissent to the report, arguing their Democratic counterparts had committed a grave mistep that could jeopardize future presidencies. The starkly different perspectives on Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine likely foreshadow the Wednesday impeachment vote, which is expected to fall almost entirely along party lines. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping an eye on today: Trump will have lunch with vice-president Mike Pence and participate in a roundtable discussion on the Governors\u2019 Initiative on Regulatory Innovation. He and the first lady will later speak at two Christmas receptions. Defense secretary Mark Esper is leading a US delegation to ceremonies commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in Luxembourg and Belgium. The frontrunners in the Democratic presidential primary are spread out across the country today \u2013 with Bernie Sanders campaigning in California, Elizabeth Warren in Iowa and Joe Biden in New York. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Correction: A previous version of this post said Trump would be the fourth president to be impeached. He would be the third, given that Nixon resigned prior to the House holding its impeachment vote.",

      "bodyText": "The global engineering and services firm GHD has told staff it has concluded its work on Adani\u2019s Carmichael coal project after a 10-year association with the company. The announcement follows an intense campaign by activists, a movement of engineers to shift their industry away from fossil fuels, and significant internal pressure on management by GHD staff. It also comes as another engineering firm, Siemens, considers backing out of an Adani contract. GHD was Adani\u2019s first project partner in Australia. It advised the Indian company after it acquired the project from Linc Energy in 2010 and authored the environmental impact statement that erroneously claimed the project would generate 10,000 jobs. In its email to staff, GHD\u2019s executive general manager, Phil Duthie, said the firm\u2019s current contractual obligations with the mine had concluded. \u201cWe have no ongoing contracts in relation to this project,\u201d Duthie said. \u201cI\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank you for your professional approach over the last six months, a period in which GHD has been publicly targeted by activists.\u201d Duthie said the company would also soon release a plan aimed at supporting the transition, but that the company would continue to support fossil fuel clients in the meantime. \u201cWe recognise the world\u2019s transition to a sustainable energy future is essential, and that the energy shift is complex and will take time,\u201d he said.

Julien Vincent, the chief executive of Market Forces, said GHD\u2019s latest comments were an important step, but was concerned the company still had not ruled out future work for Adani or other work that would expand the fossil fuel industry. In his email, Duthie points to an online Q&amp;A that does not explicitly rule out working with Adani in the future. \u201cThey\u2019ve failed to rule out working any further on this project, and they\u2019ve clearly got a long way to go to align their business plans with Paris [targets],\u201d Vincent said. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say GHD has really bungled this conversation internally and externally in the past few months.

HM Inspectorate of Probation (HMIP) said the Neet rate in Croydon\u2019s youth offending service was 30%, compared with about 2.8% in the borough overall. The division is the second largest in England and Wales. Inspectors have recommended that the Youth Crime Board, which governs the work of the youth offending services, develop learning programmes that would reduce the number of Neets in the system. The chief inspector of probation, Justin Russell, said: \u201cA third of young people known to the YOS are not in post-16 education, employment or training. This is a much higher percentage than in the general population and needs to be addressed.\u201d The findings are reflective of the wider societal issues that play a role in youth crime, serious violence and gangs. The recent case of 14-year-old Jaden Moodie, who was stabbed to death by another teenager, highlighted such complexities, with both victim and perpetrator grappling with challenging life experiences. Five hundred and 44 children and young people in Croydon were cautioned or sentenced in 2018 \u2013 more than 10% of the total for London. The borough has the largest population in London of children aged 10\u201317 (39,334), of whom 54% are from minority ethnic groups. A fifth of children are in low-income families. The inspectorate report said there were high levels of vulnerability for adolescents, including exploitation, domestic abuse and going missing from home, care and education. Youth offending services supervise 10\u2013 to 18-year-olds who have been sentenced by a court or who have come to the attention of the police because of their offending behaviour but have not been charged. The inspectorate concluded that the Croydon division \u201crequires improvement\u201d, though it said the issues were partly due to inadequate practices in children\u2019s social care. Ofsted rated Croydon children\u2019s social care inadequate in 2017, the report noted. However, as recently as July, Ofsted noted that children and young people are beginning to receive a better quality of service, and the pace of improvement is accelerating. Russell said: \u201cAt its best, joint work provides children with an effective safety net, with professionals taking timely actions to mitigate the identified risks to children. In other cases, we found that inadequate practice in the children\u2019s social care department left the YOS in a difficult position in trying to keep children and the public safe, with the YOS having to manage these risk by themselves.\u201d The government has previously been warned that it cannot arrest its way out of the serious violence problem experienced in the capital and other cities as it looks to restore police officer numbers cut over the last nine years. The serious violent crime strategy, published in 2018, said violent crime, like other types of crime and antisocial behaviour, had a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d including low educational attainment, poor health including mental health, unemployment, socio-economic factors, weak ties to family and exclusion rates. A Croydon council spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working to ensure that all our young people aged 16-18 have access to high quality support to enable them to access and sustain education, employment or training. \u201cWe will continue to drive improvements across the board, and have developed an action plan in response to the findings of the YOS inspection.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The steep decline in rape convictions in England and Wales is partially due to a lack of resources which has left the criminal justice system \u201cclose to breaking point\u201d, a damning inspectorate report has found. The 195-page study by HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI) also criticised prosecutors for making intrusive, unnecessary demands for complainants\u2019 mobile phones and medical records. It was commissioned as part of an emergency, \u2018End-to-End\u2019 rape review overseen by the National Criminal Justice Board (CJB), which brings together the Ministry of Justice, Home Office, law enforcement agencies and senior members of the judiciary. The review followed alarm over the rapid rise of rape allegations coinciding with a dramatic fall in cases being taken to trial. \u201cIf 58,657 allegations of rape were made in the year ending March 2019 but only 1,925 successful prosecutions for the offence followed,\u201d the inspectorate commented, \u201csomething must be wrong.\u201d The detailed study did not identify a single cause but pointed to a complex of problems. Its clearest conclusion - that police and prosecutors have been deprived of funding - emerged as Boris Johnson\u2019s new administration pledges to recruit more police officers. \u201cPolice and CPS have seen significant reductions in their resources,\u201c the report stated. \u201c[The criminal justice system] has been under-resourced so that it is close to breaking point. In the case of the police, it may have gone beyond that, and ... the number of rape allegations lost in the investigative process is damning.\u201d Requests for forensic examination of phones, for example, are taking up to 11 months to complete. The report also found that lawyers in the CPS\u2019s Rape and Serious Sexual Offences units were overstretched. Almost 40% of participating CPS lawyers said their caseload was \u201cheavy and unmanageable\u201d. There was also criticism of prosecutors pushing for disclosure of sensitive personal data not \u201cproportionate\u201d to the investigation. In 39% of relevant cases, prosecutors sent out requests that were not \u201cproportionate\u201d involving obtaining \u201cinformation from the complainant\u2019s digital devices, and making requests for third-party material (such as education, medical or social services records) that were not necessary ... Some prosecutors are still asking for a full download of a complainant\u2019s or suspect\u2019s phone.\u201d The inspectorate cleared the CPS of accusations by women\u2019s and victims\u2019 campaign groups that prosecutors are becoming \u201crisk averse\u201d and pursuing only cases with stronger evidence. Prosecutors observed the Code for Crown Prosecutors, the report said. In a 2016 inquiry, HMCPSI found the test was applied incorrectly in 10.1% of rape cases. In the latest batch of cases examined by experienced inspectors that rate fell to to 2%. \u201c\u2026 Rather than the CPS being risk averse, these decisions are often finely balanced, with many difficult matters to weigh up in the evidence.\u201d The report also dismissed claims that a change in \u2018levels of ambition\u2019 for prosecutors had led to more difficult cases being droped by the CPS. HM chief inspector Kevin McGinty said: \u201cSince 2016 there has been a substantial increase in rape allegations, while the number of rape prosecutions has fallen significantly \u2013 which indicates there is a serious problem. \u201cThe CPS has been accused of only choosing easy cases to prosecute, but we found no evidence of that in our report.\u201d The director of public prosecutions Max Hill QC said: \u201cI am reassured that HMCPSI has found no evidence that the CPS has become risk averse when deciding whether to charge these cases.\u201d Responding to the report, Sarah Green, director for End Violence Against Women, a coalition of women\u2019s groups, said: \u201cThe report \u2026 recognises that the statistics \u2026 alone raise huge questions about justice being done, but it insists there is quality CPS decision making.

Dame Vera Baird QC, the victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales, said: \u201cIt is obviously a cause for concern that in 40% of cases material that is intensely private and may include irrelevant but personal details is being demanded.\u201d Claire Waxman, London\u2019s independent victim\u2019s commissioner, said: \u201cThe report shows there is a worrying lack of understanding around the disclosure of digital evidence, with too many disproportionate requests for personal data. \u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThese findings are deeply concerning.

      "bodyText": "Global demand for coal has fallen this year for the first time in two years as Europe and the US turn their backs on coal-fired power plants in favour of cheap gas and renewable energy. A report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that the world\u2019s appetite for coal declined in 2019 after a two-year resurgence following the steepest ever drop in the use of coal-fired power plants. The world\u2019s energy watchdog said it is too soon to say whether the global appetite for coal would continue to decline because the fate of the industry rests largely in the hands of China\u2019s policymakers. Coal remains the world\u2019s single largest source of electricity generation, half of which is produced in China and used to power Chinese power plants. The IEA\u2019s annual report on the coal industry revealed that the largest ever decline in the use of coal-fired electricity was led by steep cuts in coal demand from Europe and the US. Western countries are weaning their energy systems off coal power due to abundant cheaper alternatives such as renewable energy and gas, and flatlining energy demand. Keisuke Sadamori, a director at the IEA, said \u201cthis is not the end of coal\u201d because Asia\u2019s demand for electricity is continuing its steep ascent fuelled by strong economic growth and a growing number of homes with access to electricity. \u201cThe region\u2019s share of global coal power generation has climbed from just over 20% in 1990 to almost 80% in 2019, meaning coal\u2019s fate is increasingly tied to decisions made in Asian capitals,\u201d he said. The IEA expects coal-fired electricity to rise only marginally between 2020 and 2024, at less than 1% a year, which should see its share of the global electricity mix fall to 35% in 2024 from 38% last year. \u201cCoal is disappearing in many advanced economies, but it remains resilient and is even continuing to grow in developing Asia,\u201d he said. But the forecasts could deviate widely, depending on China\u2019s energy policy decisions in its next five-year plan, covering 2021 to 2025. The fossil fuel faces rising public opposition due to concerns over air pollution and the climate crisis. Many governments are now considering stronger climate and environmental policies as renewables and gas become cheaper to use. \u201cIf China changes \u2013 everything changes,\u201d Sadamori said. India bucked the trend for rising coal use in Asia this year. The IEA said the fast-growing economy is expected to record its first drop in coal-fired power in the last 45 years. The low coal power generation in India this year was due to \u201cunusually low growth in electricity demand and exceptionally high hydropower output,\u201d according to Sadamori. \u201cIt is not at all clear that it will be repeated,\u201d he said.",
