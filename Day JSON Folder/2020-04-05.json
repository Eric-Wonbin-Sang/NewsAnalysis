The researchers also drew on existing work on living conditions of Roma people in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo.</p> <p>Absence of water, sanitation and rubbish collection were problems in more than half the case studies, such as Stolipinovo in Bulgaria, Europe\u2019s largest Roma settlement and part of the city of Plovdiv. About 60,000 people are estimated to live in the district, but many are cut off from piped water and sanitation services from the rest of Plovdiv, a European capital of culture in 2019.</p> <p>In Hungary, access to the public water supply for some Roma communities was shut down during summer heatwaves \u2013 decisions affecting 800 people in Gul\u00e1cs in August 2017 and 1,500 inhabitants of Husz\u00e1rtelep in 2013. The northern Hungarian city of \u00d3zd received nearly \u20ac5.5m (\u00a34.8m) from Switzerland to improve provision of running water to Roma communities, but researchers said many had not benefited from the scheme. Authorities claimed Roma households did not pay their bills.</p> <p>Previous research concluded that only about 12% of Roma communities had functioning flush toilets and drainage systems.</p> <p>One vivid example of the desperate conditions Roma people can find themselves living in is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/no-voice-no-future-roma-ignored-as-europe-goes-to-polls\">Pata-R\u00e2t,</a> on the outskirts of Cluj-Napoca in Romania\u2019s north-west, known for its gothic architecture and baroque palaces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"118cca4d506d326b983d92eac8b710e6e3734c1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/118cca4d506d326b983d92eac8b710e6e3734c1d/0_0_4957_3072/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The isolated Roma community living in Pata-R\u00e2t\" width=\"1000\" height=\"620\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The isolated Roma community living in Pata-R\u00e2t.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cronos/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Pata-R\u00e2t about 2,000 Roma people live next to or on a landfill site. \u201cIt\u2019s horrifying,\u201d said the Roma rights activist Ciprian Nodis, who has visited several times. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to what you can see in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. People are living in extreme poverty with no access to utilities, no access to electricity, water. They live in improvised shelters made from recyclable materials that they find on the landfill \u2013 cardboard, or rotten wood, or things like that. Most of them work in the landfill.\u201d</p> <p>He identified four separate Roma communities living at Pata-R\u00e2t: the first group came in the 1960s, and the most recent arrivals in 2013 when Roma residents of Cluj-Napoca were evicted from the city centre. The least fortunate of the four communities live on the landfill itself, where the air, water and soil is deeply polluted. \u201cIt\u2019s a living hell, especially for the children who are born there. It\u2019s bad luck to be born in Pata-R\u00e2t,\u201d Nodis said.</p> <p>But Pata-R\u00e2t is not even exceptional. Researchers identified more Roma communities living on or next to landfill sites at Fakulteta, near Sofia. On the outskirts of the Transylvanian city of Turda, Roma families live on a former industrial site contaminated with mercury. Unsurprisingly Roma people in the 32 case studies were vulnerable to respiratory and infectious diseases, accidents and depression.</p> <p>Meanwhile Roma communities not living on degraded land risk eviction, without legal recourse. About 100 Roma people living in Constan\u01aba in Romania were forced to move to allow for the creation of a holiday resort.</p> <p>Patrizia Heidegger, one of the report\u2019s authors and the director of global policies and sustainability at the EEB, said the 32 cases were only the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>Denial of basic services persisted, despite Roma communities having being settled in the same villages and cities for many years. Absence of water or sanitation was \u201cnot due to not having lived in the place for a long time. It\u2019s really total neglect of neighbourhoods with Roma populations.\u201d</p> <p>The problem was compounded as Roma communities were often blamed for the pollution and land degradation, she said. \u201cThey are perceived as the environmental problem and not as communities that are disproportionately affected by exposure to pollution or the non-provision of environmental services, which then leads to the degradation of their environment.</p> <p>Roma communities faced huge prejudices, she said, citing attitudes such as \u201c\u2018they don\u2019t care about a clean environment, they don\u2019t care where they live, they work in waste dumps anyhow so they live there.\u2019 These are racist prejudices.\u201d</p> <p>The EEB is now calling on EU authorities and member states to increase efforts to protect health, while urging them to recognise the scale of the problem. \u201cWe need to acknowledge that environmental racism exists in Europe. That is the first step,\u201d Heidegger said.</p>",

The northern Hungarian city of \u00d3zd received nearly \u20ac5.5m (\u00a34.8m) from Switzerland to improve provision of running water to Roma communities, but researchers said many had not benefited from the scheme. Authorities claimed Roma households did not pay their bills. Previous research concluded that only about 12% of Roma communities had functioning flush toilets and drainage systems. One vivid example of the desperate conditions Roma people can find themselves living in is Pata-R\u00e2t, on the outskirts of Cluj-Napoca in Romania\u2019s north-west, known for its gothic architecture and baroque palaces. At Pata-R\u00e2t about 2,000 Roma people live next to or on a landfill site. \u201cIt\u2019s horrifying,\u201d said the Roma rights activist Ciprian Nodis, who has visited several times. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to what you can see in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. People are living in extreme poverty with no access to utilities, no access to electricity, water. They live in improvised shelters made from recyclable materials that they find on the landfill \u2013 cardboard, or rotten wood, or things like that. Most of them work in the landfill.\u201d He identified four separate Roma communities living at Pata-R\u00e2t: the first group came in the 1960s, and the most recent arrivals in 2013 when Roma residents of Cluj-Napoca were evicted from the city centre. The least fortunate of the four communities live on the landfill itself, where the air, water and soil is deeply polluted. \u201cIt\u2019s a living hell, especially for the children who are born there. It\u2019s bad luck to be born in Pata-R\u00e2t,\u201d Nodis said. But Pata-R\u00e2t is not even exceptional. Researchers identified more Roma communities living on or next to landfill sites at Fakulteta, near Sofia. On the outskirts of the Transylvanian city of Turda, Roma families live on a former industrial site contaminated with mercury. Unsurprisingly Roma people in the 32 case studies were vulnerable to respiratory and infectious diseases, accidents and depression. Meanwhile Roma communities not living on degraded land risk eviction, without legal recourse. About 100 Roma people living in Constan\u01aba in Romania were forced to move to allow for the creation of a holiday resort. Patrizia Heidegger, one of the report\u2019s authors and the director of global policies and sustainability at the EEB, said the 32 cases were only the tip of the iceberg. Denial of basic services persisted, despite Roma communities having being settled in the same villages and cities for many years. Absence of water or sanitation was \u201cnot due to not having lived in the place for a long time. It\u2019s really total neglect of neighbourhoods with Roma populations.\u201d The problem was compounded as Roma communities were often blamed for the pollution and land degradation, she said. \u201cThey are perceived as the environmental problem and not as communities that are disproportionately affected by exposure to pollution or the non-provision of environmental services, which then leads to the degradation of their environment. Roma communities faced huge prejudices, she said, citing attitudes such as \u201c\u2018they don\u2019t care about a clean environment, they don\u2019t care where they live, they work in waste dumps anyhow so they live there.\u2019 These are racist prejudices.\u201d The EEB is now calling on EU authorities and member states to increase efforts to protect health, while urging them to recognise the scale of the problem. \u201cWe need to acknowledge that environmental racism exists in Europe. That is the first step,\u201d Heidegger said.",

Coronavirus deaths continued to climb and reports of the heartland being unprepared for what may be on its horizon continued to ricochet around the media. In the words of one administration insider, to the Guardian: \u201cThe Trump organism is simply collapsing. He\u2019s killing his own supporters.\u201d Members of the national guard, emergency workers, rank-and-file Americans: all are exposed. Yet Trump appears incapable of emoting anything that comes close to heart-felt concern. Or just providing straight answers. Rather, he is acting like Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America: repeatedly letting governors know the burden of shoring up their sick, their doctors and their people falls on their shoulders first. The national government? It\u2019s the world\u2019s greatest backstop. Remember when the Republican party freaked out about Barack Obama and the US \u201cleading from behind\u201d abroad? Remember the howls that evoked from GOP leaders? Those days are gone. Welcome to what Martin O\u2019Malley, a Democratic former governor of Maryland, calls the \u201cDarwinian approach to federalism\u201d. Trump is telling NFL owners he wants the season to start on time. He is disregarding Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advice on wearing facemasks in public. And he is touting untested coronavirus cures live on national TV. Think Trump University on steroids, only this time we all stand to be the victims. When Dr Anthony Fauci says there is no evidence to back up Trump\u2019s claims surrounding hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, pay attention. The fact Jared Kushner is on the case is hardly reassuring. He\u2019s the guy who thought firing James Comey was win-win politics and promised Middle East peace in our time.

A Downing Street spokesperson said: \u201cOn the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.\u201d The spokesperson said Johnson would stay in hospital \u201cas long as needed\u201d. Officials were keen to stress that this was not an emergency admission, and that Johnson will remain in charge of government, and will be in regular touch with colleagues and civil servants. A government source told Reuters on Monday morning that Johnson had spent the night in hospital. If his condition worsens Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is the designated minister to take charge. Raab is expected to chair a 9.15am Monday meeting of the government\u2019s C-19 committee, which leads the response to the pandemic. The pound fell against the dollar and euro overnight on Monday as foreign exchange markets took fright at the possibility of Johnson being out of action. Johnson had been hoping to leave quarantine on Friday but his persistent temperature meant he had to remain inside his flat at No 11 Downing Street. The Guardian was told last week that Johnson was more seriously ill than either he or his officials were prepared to admit, and that he was being seen by doctors who were concerned about his breathing. But Downing Street flatly denied that the prime minister\u2019s health had seriously deteriorated, and insisted there were no plans at that point for him to be admitted to hospital. Earlier on Sunday, Matt Hancock was asked just how ill the prime minister was. The health secretary told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cHe\u2019s OK. I\u2019ve been talking to him every day, several times a day \u2026 he\u2019s very much got his hand on the tiller. But he\u2019s still got a temperature.\u201d He added: \u201cHe\u2019s working away inside Downing Street. He\u2019s in good spirits.\u201d Hancock himself has only recently come out of isolation after testing positive for coronavirus, although his symptoms appear to have been notably milder. Johnson\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, revealed on Saturday that she had also been suffering from the virus but is recovering. While No 10 did not say what tests Johnson would undergo in hospital, experts said they would be likely to focus on assessing how the prime minister\u2019s lungs, heart and other organs were responding to the virus. \u201cDoctors will be monitoring important vital signs such as oxygen saturations,\u201d said Dr Rupert Beale, who heads the cell biology of infection laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London. \u201cThey will also check blood tests to see what the immune response to the virus looks like, and to assess liver and kidney function. They will perform an electrocardiogram to check the heart. More sophisticated tests may include a CT scan of the chest to get an accurate picture of the lungs.\u201d Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader, was among a string of MPs to tweet their best wishes to Johnson. \u201cWishing the prime minister well and a speedy recovery,\u201d he wrote. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary and Johnson\u2019s main rival for the Conservative leadership last year, tweeted: \u201cThoughts with Boris Johnson this evening. Whatever political persuasion the whole country is united in wanting our PM to get fit and well as soon as possible.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, tweeted: \u201cWishing the PM all the best and a speedy recovery.\u201d Donald Trump, the US president, began his Sunday night press briefing by sending well wishes to Johnson. \u201cHe\u2019s a great friend of mine,\u201d Trump said of his British counterpart. \u201cI\u2019m sure he is going to be fine, he\u2019s a strong man, a strong person.\u201d Johnson\u2019s hospitalisation came after the Department of Health said the number of hospital deaths connected to coronavirus stood at 4,934 people as of 5pm on Saturday, up by 621 from 4,313 the day before. Among recent fatalities was the first serving midwife confirmed to have died with coronavirus. Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex, said Lynsay Coventry, 54, had died on Thursday. Also on Sunday, scientists warned that the 17.5m antibody home testing kits ordered by the government after Johnson said they could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d might fail to detect up to half of coronavirus cases. It had been suggested the kits would be made available to the public within days, but on Sunday Hancock played down their imminent arrival. Scientists involved in validating home testing kits told the Guardian that no test on the market has yet been shown to be sufficiently reliable. One expert said they were more likely to detect only 50%-60% of those with milder symptoms. Also on Sunday: \u2022 Hancock criticised the \u201cunbelievable\u201d behaviour of people packing into parks on a warm day and warned rules on exercise could change, while saying this was not imminent. \u2022 Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, resigned after it emerged she twice went to her second home during the lockdown. \u2022 Italy recorded its lowest number of cases in two weeks, with the total number of people in hospital with the virus falling for the first time since the beginning of the crisis. \u2022 It was announced the Marquess of Bath, the owner of Longleat safari park, had died after contracting coronavirus at age 87.",

However, this weekend Hancock played down expectations, telling BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that there were no immediate plans to roll out antibody testing kits. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the test results through every day, I was looking at some last night,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we still don\u2019t have any that are good enough.\u201d</p> <p>Emerging evidence suggests that there is a wide range of antibody responses to coronavirus across the population, which may make the development of a simple, reliable home test that will work for everyone a considerable challenge. </p> <p>Dr David Ho, a leading infectious disease specialist at Columbia University in New York, said that, based on patient samples analysed by his team, those with severe illness tend to develop a faster and stronger antibody response. In people with milder symptoms, the presence of antibodies in the blood tends to ramp up more slowly, meaning that tests need to performed later.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is after a couple of weeks, the detection rate remains at about 50%-60%, especially in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases,\u201d Ho said. \u201cBut this may not be a fault of the tests, because even using more sensitive methods in the lab we can see the antibody levels are quite low.\u201d</p> <p>It is not yet clear whether this 50%-60% figure will improve much if people are tested three or four weeks after infection. To answer this, recovered patients need to be tracked for a longer period, but Koopmans is not optimistic that the detection rate will reach the levels seen in severe cases.</p> <p>\u201cThe sensitivity of these tests, I expect, will be relatively low,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you end up around 50%-60%. Even if they\u2019re not that costly, why burn all those assays if that\u2019s the information you get?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Some of the commercial home tests claim, in promotional materials, to have sensitivities above 90%. However, these figures are likely to be based on tests in patients recovering in hospital, who represent the most severe end of the spectrum in terms of symptoms. \u201cThere\u2019s this missing piece of how does it work in the 85% of people in the other category,\u201d said Koopmans.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cAntibody tests offer the hope that people who think they have had the disease will know they are immune and get back to life as normal. We are currently working with several companies who are offering these tests and are evaluating their effectiveness.</p> <p>\u201cThe Covid[-19] scientific advisory panel, led by Prof Sir John Bell, is currently undertaking a rapid evaluation process to establish their reliability. We will publish the results of this evaluation once it is completed.\u201d</p>",

However, this weekend Hancock played down expectations, telling BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that there were no immediate plans to roll out antibody testing kits. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the test results through every day, I was looking at some last night,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we still don\u2019t have any that are good enough.\u201d Emerging evidence suggests that there is a wide range of antibody responses to coronavirus across the population, which may make the development of a simple, reliable home test that will work for everyone a considerable challenge. Dr David Ho, a leading infectious disease specialist at Columbia University in New York, said that, based on patient samples analysed by his team, those with severe illness tend to develop a faster and stronger antibody response. In people with milder symptoms, the presence of antibodies in the blood tends to ramp up more slowly, meaning that tests need to performed later. \u201cThe problem is after a couple of weeks, the detection rate remains at about 50%-60%, especially in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases,\u201d Ho said. \u201cBut this may not be a fault of the tests, because even using more sensitive methods in the lab we can see the antibody levels are quite low.\u201d It is not yet clear whether this 50%-60% figure will improve much if people are tested three or four weeks after infection. To answer this, recovered patients need to be tracked for a longer period, but Koopmans is not optimistic that the detection rate will reach the levels seen in severe cases. \u201cThe sensitivity of these tests, I expect, will be relatively low,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you end up around 50%-60%. Even if they\u2019re not that costly, why burn all those assays if that\u2019s the information you get?\u201d Some of the commercial home tests claim, in promotional materials, to have sensitivities above 90%. However, these figures are likely to be based on tests in patients recovering in hospital, who represent the most severe end of the spectrum in terms of symptoms. \u201cThere\u2019s this missing piece of how does it work in the 85% of people in the other category,\u201d said Koopmans. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cAntibody tests offer the hope that people who think they have had the disease will know they are immune and get back to life as normal. We are currently working with several companies who are offering these tests and are evaluating their effectiveness. \u201cThe Covid[-19] scientific advisory panel, led by Prof Sir John Bell, is currently undertaking a rapid evaluation process to establish their reliability. We will publish the results of this evaluation once it is completed.\u201d",

If you let a drop of water fall on a <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/08/do-plants-think-james-wong\">Mimosa pudica</a></em>, its kneejerk response is to recoil its leaves, but, if you continue doing so, the plant will quickly cotton on that the water is harmless and stop reacting. The plants can hold on to this knowledge for weeks, even when their living conditions, such as lighting, are changed. \u201cThat was unexpected because we were thinking about very short memories, in the range of one or two days \u2013 the average memory of insects,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cTo find that plants were able to memorise for two months was a surprise.\u201d Not least because they don\u2019t have brains.</p> <p>In a plant, a single brain would be a fatal flaw because they have evolved to be lunch. \u201cPlants use a very different strategy,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cThey are very good at diffusing the same function all over the body.\u201d You can remove 90% of a plant without killing it. \u201cYou need to imagine a plant as a huge brain. Maybe not as efficient as in the case of animals, but diffused everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most controversial aspects of Mancuso\u2019s work is the idea of plant consciousness. As we learn more about animal and plant intelligence, not to mention human intelligence, the always-contentious term consciousness has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/21/-sp-why-cant-worlds-greatest-minds-solve-mystery-consciousness\">the subject of ever more heated scientific and philosophical debate</a>.<strong> </strong>\u201cLet\u2019s use another term,\u201d Mancuso suggests. \u201cConsciousness is a little bit tricky in both our languages. Let\u2019s talk about awareness. Plants are perfectly aware of themselves.\u201d A simple example is when one plant overshadows another \u2013 the shaded plant will grow faster to reach the light. But when you look into the crown of a tree, all the shoots are heavily shaded. They do not grow fast because they know that they are shaded by part of themselves. \u201cSo they have a perfect image of themselves and of the outside,\u201d says Mancuso.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, the plant emits a distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Science struggles to view plants as active and motivated because its outlook is so humancentric, he argues. One test for self-awareness in animals is whether they can look in a mirror and understand that they are looking at themselves. \u201cVery few animals are able to do this,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cHumans, dolphins, a few apes and probably elephants. This has been taken in recent years as a kind of evidence that just these few groups of animals have self-awareness.\u201d Mancuso believes this is wrong. \u201cMy personal opinion is that there is no life that is not aware of itself. For me, it\u2019s impossible to imagine any form of life that is not able to be intelligent, to solve problems.\u201d</p> <p>Another misconception is that plants are the definition of a vegetative state \u2013 incommunicative and insensitive to what is around them. But Mancuso says plants are far more sensitive than animals. \u201cAnd this is not an opinion. This is based on thousands of pieces of evidence. We know that a single root apex is able to detect at least 20 different chemical and physical parameters, many of which we are blind to.\u201d There could be a tonne of cobalt or nickel under our feet, and we would have no idea, whereas \u201cplants can sense a few milligrams in a huge amount of soil\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Far from being silent and passive, plants are social and communicative, above ground and beneath, through their roots and fungal networks. They are adept at detecting subtle electromagnetic fields generated by other life forms. They use chemicals and scents to warn each other of danger, deter predators and attract pollinating insects. When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, for example, the plant emits a chemical distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate the caterpillars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ef054ca6030930e7faefec8e44f0a039ca969b9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef054ca6030930e7faefec8e44f0a039ca969b9e/0_0_3600_2400/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Old Tjikko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A slower pace of life ...

      "bodyText": "Six months ago the Liverpool chief executive, Peter Moore, was asked what distinguished his club from other European football giants. \u201cWe had this amazing historical figure: Bill Shankly, a Scottish socialist who built the foundation,\u201d he told El Pais. \u201cEven today, when we talk about business, we ask ourselves: \u2018What would Shankly do?\u2019\u201d So what would Shankly do in a global pandemic that threatens to bring the economy and the health system to its knees? The answer, it\u2019s safe to say, would not involve piggybacking on a government scheme to stop mass unemployment when you are the world\u2019s seventh-richest club. Furloughing Liverpool\u2019s non-playing staff \u2013 saving perhaps \u00a31m \u2013 when you have an annual wage bill of \u00a3310m and paid \u00a343m to agents last year is not a good look. True, Newcastle and Spurs did the same last week but by now we know who Mike Ashley and Daniel Levy are. Liverpool were supposed to be different. Yet at a stroke the club\u2019s owner undermined the work of their captain, Jordan Henderson, the driving force behind plans to arrange a Premier League fund for NHS staff. It\u2019s not too late for Fenway Sports Group to admit it has misjudged the public mood, to row back, to apologise. Even the smartest people get it wrong sometimes. However, Liverpool\u2019s problems merely reflect the trouble English football has in responding to these dislocating times. You cannot blame players who are being asked to give up \u2013 or defer \u2013 30% of their salaries for being aggrieved when they don\u2019t know whether the money will go towards the NHS or back into their owners\u2019 pockets. It is also a bit rich for the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to publicly shame footballers when frontline medical staff are lethally short of PPE equipment. And, let\u2019s be honest, if the government really wanted the super-rich to contribute more in this crisis, there is an easy solution: change the tax system. That said it was obvious football might get a kicking weeks ago and the players, the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association and the Premier League should have anticipated it. In mid-March, donating a large sum to the NHS would have been a massive PR win. Now it looks like they are being shamed into it, while also appearing out of touch with fans. There are some who will say the game is less connected to local communities nowadays \u2013 after all, top players make more money in a week than most of us earn in a year. But the evidence suggests otherwise. Spanish academics have twice studied how much Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a mattered to the people of La Coru\u00f1a, first in 2003 and then again in 2012. \u201cOne of the most striking data,\u201d they wrote in their latter study, \u201cis the increase in the percentage of people who believe that if Deportivo disappeared, the quality of life in the city would be worse.\u201d Similar results have been found in England. A 2015 study asked just under 1,200 residents in Luton and Bury how important their club was to the town. A total of 47% in Luton and 39% in Bury felt their quality of life would reduce if their football club was no longer around. Bury are already on the brink and last week two chief executives in sport told me they are working on the assumption things won\u2019t get back to where they were until September.

He told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI think this example of exercise is a really important one, because we\u2019ve said because of the positive benefits to your physical and your mental health that it\u2019s OK to exercise on your own or with members of your own household. \u201cBut if the result of that is that too many people go out and flout the other rules because they say: \u2018Well, if I can exercise then it\u2019s fine for me to do other things,\u2019 then I\u2019m afraid we will have to take action.\u201d But he later clarified his position, saying: \u201c\u2018We can\u2019t rule out further steps but I don\u2019t want anyone to think that any changes to the social distancing rules are imminent, because the vast majority are following the rules.\u201d The temporary closure of Brockwell Park and images of sunbathers from around the country triggered a debate about the use of parks by people who do not have accessible outdoor space during the Covid-19 lockdown. Hancock was backed by the newly-elected Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who said his party would support either a ban on outdoor exercise or on non-essential work if it was needed to curb the spread of Covid-19. \u201cWe do have to take whatever steps are necessary,\u201d said Starmer, who said social distancing was difficult for people who did not have a garden to exercise in, but insisted \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get through this\u201d. Angela Rayner, who was elected as Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said on Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cIt\u2019s all right for people who\u2019ve got big houses and huge back gardens to say that, but if you\u2019re stuck in inadequate accommodation, you\u2019ve got no back garden, nowhere to go, and you\u2019re on top of each other, people should do social distancing, but also be reasonable and proportionate about that.\u201d The Royal Parks \u2013 the charity that manages several parks in London, including Primrose Hill, Greenwich Park and Hyde Park, which were all busy over the weekend \u2013 said its spaces would remain open for now. \u201cOur sole priority at the moment is to keep the parks open and safe for as long as possible, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to ensure this is the case,\u201d a spokesperson said. The charity has previously banned cycling through Richmond Park because of congestion and shut all cafes, catering kiosks and playgrounds at its sites. Officials in Birmingham, which has had the largest amount of confirmed Covid-19 cases of any local authority outside of London, encouraged residents to practise social distancing while continuing to keep its parks open. London Councils \u2013 the membership group representing the 32 London boroughs and the City of London \u2013 said if people failed to follow government advice stricter restrictions on movement could follow. Wail Qasim, the writer and social commentator, used Brockwell Park on Saturday and questioned the logic behind the decision to close it on Sunday, saying it punished the many because of the actions of the few. \u201cBrockwell Park is 50.8 hectares of space. Even if all 3,000 people were in there at the same time they could have 169 square metres alone each,\u201d Qasim tweeted. \u201cYou\u2019re taking green space away from many who have no other option. Please deal with the groups instead of collectively punishing.\u201d",

What was said On BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: I\u2019ve set a very clear goal for the nation as a whole. The whole life sciences industry are coming to the table on this.

Factcheck Hancock was no doubt referring to the \u00a3210m UK donation to the Coalition for Vaccine Preparedness (CEPI), which is the largest single donation since the initiative announced a target of $2bn required from international governments to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. However, the UK was starting from a lower base of funding to CEPI than other countries, including Japan, the US and Norway \u2013 whose total funding to CEPI now stands at nearly \u00a3340m.

      "body": "<p>Everyone is learning how to live, how to work (where possible and necessary), how to be safe and simply <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/02/the-new-rules-of-lockdown-how-to-stay-clean-safe-and-two-metres-away-from-everyone\">how to be</a> during this extraordinary and troubling era of Covid-19.</p> <p>The Guardian and Observer are learning too. With most staff working remotely \u2013 only a small number essential to producing the printed newspapers are in the London office \u2013 the highly collaborative task of journalism has been atomised and reshaped via new ways of liaising and rapid innovation around editorial technology.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A new approach to commissioning has been needed for every section of the newspaper. Sometimes more than once</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The editor\u2019s morning conference is now conducted via live streaming, press briefings are attended by teleconference, podcast presenters have swapped studio for home study, and live blogs are coordinated from kitchen tables. Where once a news editor could shout some breaking news or fresh instruction over the top of a computer, almost everything must be typed, all the right people kept in the loop.</p> <p>The challenges are numerous but the consideration that goes into overcoming them will, I am certain, bring lasting benefit. In this, readers are as ever playing a vital role.</p> <p>Some readers have, for instance, urged the removal of coronavirus articles that are overtaken by events. On the grounds of transparency, accountability and the integrity of the record, the Guardian\u2019s policy is not to take down articles other than in the most exceptional circumstances. During a public health crisis, however, a responsibility to reader safety is essential. How is this best managed?</p> <p>An early example of the issue came on Wednesday 18 March, when the travel desk published an article just ahead of Mother\u2019s Day in the UK, recommending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/18/national-trust-parks-gardens-open-coronavirus-social-distancing-walking\">National Trust parks</a> suitable for walks while social distancing. As fresh air and exercise were still encouraged, this piece was designed to steer people towards less crowded spots.</p> <p>Three days later, the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/press-release/the-national-trusts-latest-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19?awc=3795_1586094081_5f7ae6f0294a5eec2313c999e42ec985&amp;campid=Affiliates_Central_Mem_AWIN_Standard&amp;aff=78888\">National Trust closed its parks and gardens</a> after the government announced more stringent measures. For the best of motives, the article was deleted. Risk had been removed but so had something else. When the story of coronavirus comes to be told, to see how a parkland stroll was recommended on Wednesday but off-limits by Saturday will offer a glimpse into the extent of uncertainty in March 2020.</p> <p>Scale this up across all reporting of a constantly evolving crisis \u2013 one in which national and international response will be scrutinised for clues to handling any future crisis \u2013 and you see why the chronicle matters.</p> <p>Following discussion with senior staff, the National Trust feature was reinstated with prominent labelling and an amended headline. It meant a reader could not wander into the article on a misapprehension but neither had the Guardian hidden its own footsteps. This approach is now taken on a case-by-case basis when any potentially misleading Covid-19 article is identified.</p> <p>The principle regarding removals also applies to rewrites. But every rule needs an exception and in exceptional times one has been made for Covid-19 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/explainers\">explainers</a>\u201d. These articles \u2013 some of which have received tens of millions of views \u2013 answer questions such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-symptoms-what-are-they-should-i-see-doctor\">which symptoms</a> require medical attention, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">when will a vaccine</a> be ready and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-travel-updates-which-countries-have-restrictions-and-fco-warnings-in-place\">which countries</a> have travel restrictions in place. To help readers find the most recent advice, some are regularly updated and republished to take account of new statistics, new information or new questions.</p> <p>However, last week one reader asked anxiously whether a revised explainer meant something vital had been wrong in the original. Her question prompted internal discussion and there will now be a paragraph at the end of such pieces explaining the purpose of updates and that any significant corrections will be footnoted in the usual way.</p> <p>Praise for the journalism has been terrific (\u201cthorough, intelligent and filled with empathy\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m relying on my online Guardian more than ever in lockdown\u201d; \u201cThank you for all that you are continuing to do to get the paper out to us in this difficult time\u201d \u2013 to give a flavour).

      "bodyText": "Everyone is learning how to live, how to work (where possible and necessary), how to be safe and simply how to be during this extraordinary and troubling era of Covid-19. The Guardian and Observer are learning too. With most staff working remotely \u2013 only a small number essential to producing the printed newspapers are in the London office \u2013 the highly collaborative task of journalism has been atomised and reshaped via new ways of liaising and rapid innovation around editorial technology. The editor\u2019s morning conference is now conducted via live streaming, press briefings are attended by teleconference, podcast presenters have swapped studio for home study, and live blogs are coordinated from kitchen tables. Where once a news editor could shout some breaking news or fresh instruction over the top of a computer, almost everything must be typed, all the right people kept in the loop. The challenges are numerous but the consideration that goes into overcoming them will, I am certain, bring lasting benefit. In this, readers are as ever playing a vital role. Some readers have, for instance, urged the removal of coronavirus articles that are overtaken by events. On the grounds of transparency, accountability and the integrity of the record, the Guardian\u2019s policy is not to take down articles other than in the most exceptional circumstances. During a public health crisis, however, a responsibility to reader safety is essential. How is this best managed? An early example of the issue came on Wednesday 18 March, when the travel desk published an article just ahead of Mother\u2019s Day in the UK, recommending National Trust parks suitable for walks while social distancing. As fresh air and exercise were still encouraged, this piece was designed to steer people towards less crowded spots. Three days later, the National Trust closed its parks and gardens after the government announced more stringent measures. For the best of motives, the article was deleted. Risk had been removed but so had something else. When the story of coronavirus comes to be told, to see how a parkland stroll was recommended on Wednesday but off-limits by Saturday will offer a glimpse into the extent of uncertainty in March 2020. Scale this up across all reporting of a constantly evolving crisis \u2013 one in which national and international response will be scrutinised for clues to handling any future crisis \u2013 and you see why the chronicle matters. Following discussion with senior staff, the National Trust feature was reinstated with prominent labelling and an amended headline. It meant a reader could not wander into the article on a misapprehension but neither had the Guardian hidden its own footsteps. This approach is now taken on a case-by-case basis when any potentially misleading Covid-19 article is identified. The principle regarding removals also applies to rewrites. But every rule needs an exception and in exceptional times one has been made for Covid-19 \u201cexplainers\u201d. These articles \u2013 some of which have received tens of millions of views \u2013 answer questions such as which symptoms require medical attention, when will a vaccine be ready and which countries have travel restrictions in place. To help readers find the most recent advice, some are regularly updated and republished to take account of new statistics, new information or new questions. However, last week one reader asked anxiously whether a revised explainer meant something vital had been wrong in the original. Her question prompted internal discussion and there will now be a paragraph at the end of such pieces explaining the purpose of updates and that any significant corrections will be footnoted in the usual way. Praise for the journalism has been terrific (\u201cthorough, intelligent and filled with empathy\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m relying on my online Guardian more than ever in lockdown\u201d; \u201cThank you for all that you are continuing to do to get the paper out to us in this difficult time\u201d \u2013 to give a flavour). But we hear, too, from readers asking for articles that will help them through the crisis. A new series called \u201cHope in a time of crisis\u201c responds to this shared feeling with doses of positive news, beginning on 4 April with the story of a 99-year-old woman who has recovered from coronavirus. It involves marmalade sandwiches. Elsewhere the coping coverage ranges from how pets are helping, readers\u2019 tips on keeping fit and the Guide\u2019s recently launched Staying In newsletter, while for complete distraction The antidote showcases five favourite reads that have nothing to do with Covid-19.

But we have a similar height and build. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s \u201cstyle of play was characterised by long periods at the crease and a relatively slow rate of run-scoring\u201d, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Tavar%C3%A9\" title=\"\">Wikipedia says</a>, and I can do that. Mostly I grind it out when I play for <a href=\"http://www.pacificcc.co.uk/index.php\" title=\"\">Pacific CC</a> in the North East London League.</p> <p>Among Tavar\u00e9\u2019s most tedious innings was a score of 35 runs in six and a half hours at Madras. \u201cAs [Ian] Botham brought the crowd to its feet, Tavar\u00e9 did his utmost to make them sit down again,\u201d wrote Marcus Berkmann in Rain Men. \u201cHere was dullness personified, a walking, twitching anaesthetic.\u201d</p> <p>In one of the first YouTube videos to appear <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuMVLrEW7vw\" title=\"\">when I type Chris Tavar\u00e9</a> the Kent captain is interviewed alongside his opposite number, Botham, at Lord\u2019s after Somerset have just won the 1983 NatWest final, which followed the World Cup. He says getting \u201cTav\u201d out for 39 off 80 balls was a big moment as it opened up an end for Somerset to bowl at. Tavar\u00e9 is gracious in defeat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6ff99cd30210b08184dc09544064231094eb38d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6ff99cd30210b08184dc09544064231094eb38d/0_9_900_1125/800..jpg\" alt=\"A poster for the film 83.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster for the film 83.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Guardian and Observer\u2019s own Vic Marks was the player of the match in that final, taking three for 30 from 10 overs, including <a href=\"http://cherwell.org/2017/11/21/you-never-felt-like-youd-actually-made-it/\" title=\"\">that of his friend Tavar\u00e9</a>. I ask Marks for advice before my audition. \u201cChris spoke slowly and deliberately in a deepish voice \u2013 and not that often, which led briefly to the predictable nickname of Rowdy in early England dressing rooms,\u201d Marks says. \u201cBut he had a neat sense of humour and a tendency toward self-deprecation. I always felt he was a much better player than he thought. He was very popular. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cniRV3M8gRA\" title=\"\">Botham</a> and Bob Willis liked him a lot \u2013 as did everyone else, especially his contrasting opening partner in 1983, Graeme Fowler.\u201d</p> <p>Tavar\u00e9 would make 58 (off 116 balls) in a 115 partnership with Fowler <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/scorecard/65080/england-vs-pakistan-17th-match-prudential-world-cup-1983\" title=\"\">in a seven-wicket victory against Pakistan at Old Trafford in the World Cup</a>. \u201cChris had the neatest of cricket coffins and upon dismissal he would carefully return his kit there. From his demeanour it would be hard to tell whether he had made nought or a hundred,\u201d Marks says. \u201cHe was a cautious man in several ways \u2013 he travelled to India with his own pillow (often coveted by others in some of the hotels) and pyjamas and later on he took to wearing a gumshield when batting, which meant his calling when running between the wickets produced a muffled, barely comprehensible sound, which often meant \u2018Come on then\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cWe all know Chris\u2019s reputation but I can promise you he played some of the most destructive innings in one-day cricket, especially at county level for Kent and then Somerset and the odd one for England. In this format he stood tall and occasionally wandered down the wicket before the ball was bowled. So it wasn\u2019t such a daft idea to have him in the World Cup squad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af74d8be4f6163e3dfbbe3ba9e87811e7e0e547c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af74d8be4f6163e3dfbbe3ba9e87811e7e0e547c/0_0_2413_3627/665..jpg\" alt=\"Toby Chasseaud in the nets. \u2018Mostly I grind it out.\u2019\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toby Chasseaud in the nets. \u2018Mostly I grind it out.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: portraitcollective.com/Sam Bowle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGns4xWFo8\" title=\"\">YouTube video</a> shows highlights of Fowler and Tavar\u00e9 sharing an opening stand of 69 against India in the semi-final at Old Trafford. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s stance is very side-on. He clips the ball through midwicket for an all-run four. He later plays an almost identical shot off the bowling of Kapil Dev, which this time crosses the boundary. This is followed by a cut for four through point. He plays and misses outside off stump to Roger Binny before edging behind to be caught by Syed Kirmani for 32.</p> <p>When I turn up at the Indoor Cricket Centre at Lord\u2019s in November 2018 I find I\u2019m in a group of six players all auditioning for parts, though I\u2019m the only Tavar\u00e9. One chap has to fill the big boots of Botham. Another is auditioning to be the Australian Trevor Chappell and says he has struggled to find much footage of him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGHScrCxF6Y\" title=\"\">other than the notorious under-arm bowling incident of 1981</a>.</p> <p>When I\u2019m asked to speak to camera in the nerves of the moment I forget to talk like Tavar\u00e9. Then I\u2019m asked to bowl my left-arm spin, which I don\u2019t think will help my chances of being cast as Tavar\u00e9 because a) he wasn\u2019t left-handed and b) he didn\u2019t bowl in the World Cup. Still, I\u2019m asked to deliver a ball and sledge the nonexistent batsman \u2013 not necessarily Tavar\u00e9-like behaviour, I think. But then other roles are up for grabs. I\u2019m asked to bowl another ball, appeal loudly and celebrate. Because the ball I bowl has hit neither a pad nor an edge, I forget to appeal straight away, which is embarrassing.</p> <p>Next it\u2019s time to bat. The bowling machine spits a ball at me and I try to drive but manage only to squirt away a bottom edge. The following three deliveries produce a similar result, though, in my defence, I haven\u2019t faced a bowling machine for more than 10 years. I have more success against four back-of-a-length balls, punching them into the off side off the back foot. Then I face four short balls. We\u2019re supposed to pull them but I make poor contact and the ball goes behind square.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f3e76cbeb25cfb8a995e31ff9863fbb306d3acd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f3e76cbeb25cfb8a995e31ff9863fbb306d3acd/0_0_3520_2497/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Chris Tavar\u00e9 facing Rashid Khan on his way to 58 off 116 balls against Pakistan in the 1983 World Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Tavar\u00e9 facing Rashid Khan on his way to 58 off 116 balls against Pakistan in the 1983 World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Hutchison/Daily Mail/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second and third balls produce similar, unspectacular, results. The last ball I am supposed to strike and then celebrate as if I\u2019ve hit the winning runs but I spoon it and when attempting to celebrate struggle to take my helmet off as the strap stays wedged beneath my chin. So, all in all, it\u2019s not been the most convincing of auditions. No surprise, then, I never hear back from them.</p> <p>\u201cThe Indian team had already been cast a long time back but in the UK we were looking for players to represent England, Australia, Zimbabwe and West Indies,\u201d the film\u2019s UK line producer, Cyrus Patel, tells me later. \u201cWe wanted the action to be authentic.\u201d The cast is made up of actors in the main roles with body doubles for the cricketing action. It took eight months to find the West Indies side as the search for them was extended from the UK to the Caribbean. The great fast bowler Malcolm Marshall is played by his son, Mali.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it</p> <footer> <cite>Cyrus Patel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe calibre of cricketers cast was extremely high. They\u2019re all accomplished players because we wanted the action to be as close to international standard as possible,\u201d Patel says. He tells me Tavar\u00e9\u2019s part was taken by Phil Lowe, a cricketer from Loughborough who plays for Newtown Linford in Division One of the Leicestershire and Rutland League.</p> <p>When I track down Lowe, he describes what it was like to be involved in the film. \u201cI had to go to London for training and a wardrobe fitting. We spent a couple of hours in the nets at Lord\u2019s replicating footage from the semi-final between England and India. There were certain shots Tavar\u00e9 played that I would have to replicate and I needed to perfect his technique before filming started.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3c9a02ea77d25748976c070ea050d428da89535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3c9a02ea77d25748976c070ea050d428da89535/0_133_2048_1229/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev and Deepika Padukone as Romi Bhatia Dev in the movie 83.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev and Deepika Padukone as Romi Bhatia Dev in the movie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was told I needed to grow a moustache and let my hair grow as long as possible. I\u2019d never grown a moustache before but luckily by the time filming had come around I\u2019d managed a reasonable one. But I had to wear a wig because there was insufficient time to grow the back and sides long enough, which wasn\u2019t ideal during long, hot days of filming in the summer.\u201d</p> <p>He spent a week in August filming at Stowe school in Buckinghamshire, a couple of days at Osterley CC in London, then at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells and, finally, at Lord\u2019s. \u201cThey were long 12-13 hour days spent on set but we had a lot of fun,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cWe filmed all of the cricket action from the semi-final on a regular cricket pitch that was surrounded by green screens, so that they could CGI the [Old Trafford] stadium and crowd into the shots. It was a fantastic experience to be involved in a big budget film and get to work alongside huge Bollywood stars like Ranveer Singh [who plays Kapil] and [director] Kabir Khan.\u201d</p> <p>It was at the Nevill Ground Kapil scored 175 not out after India were initially reduced to nine for four by Zimbabwe. No original footage exists of this record-breaking innings because BBC cameramen were on strike. But Patel says they tried to recreate it as accurately as they could.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"489e2b12316420144187016883cb46bd08d6adf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/489e2b12316420144187016883cb46bd08d6adf1/0_0_4872_3264/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Kapil Dev sparks celebrations after taking a spectacular catch to dismiss Viv Richards in the 1983 final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kapil Dev sparks celebrations after taking a spectacular catch to dismiss Viv Richards in the 1983 final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cApart from the Nevill Ground all the other venues have changed considerably since 1983 so we made extensive use of CGI to take the viewer back in time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Lord\u2019s couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming to us and over four days in August 2019 we were able to film in the dressing rooms and in the Long Room.\u201d Some of the street and hotel scenes were shot in Glasgow which, in Patel\u2019s words, \u201chas the feel of 1980s London\u201d.</p> <p>Going into the tournament India\u2019s previous World Cup record was dismal. In 1979 they had failed to win a game and in 1975 had won one, against East Africa. West Indies, on the other hand, had never lost a World Cup match, winning the tournament in 1975 and 1979. \u201cIt seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it,\u201d Patel says.</p> <p>In the final, India were bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs and West Indies had the champagne on ice.

      "bodyText": "At the end of the season, just as I\u2019m packing my kit away for the winter, I see an advert circulating on social media: \u201cSkilled cricket players needed. Casting feature film based on 1983 cricket World Cup. Players to represent West Indies, England, Australia and Zimbabwe teams.\u201d Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t hide away my whites just yet, I think. I send the talent agency a headshot and a brief summary of my playing ability, and a week later I\u2019m asked to Lord\u2019s to audition for the part of Chris Tavar\u00e9. To prepare I\u2019m asked to \u201chave a look at some online footage of how he bowls, bats, catches, celebrates, etc, so you have an idea of his personality traits and style\u201d. I was three years old when the 1983 World Cup took place and I remember Tavar\u00e9\u2019s contemporaries Mike Gatting, David Gower and Allan Lamb better than him. But we have a similar height and build. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s \u201cstyle of play was characterised by long periods at the crease and a relatively slow rate of run-scoring\u201d, Wikipedia says, and I can do that. Mostly I grind it out when I play for Pacific CC in the North East London League. Among Tavar\u00e9\u2019s most tedious innings was a score of 35 runs in six and a half hours at Madras. \u201cAs [Ian] Botham brought the crowd to its feet, Tavar\u00e9 did his utmost to make them sit down again,\u201d wrote Marcus Berkmann in Rain Men. \u201cHere was dullness personified, a walking, twitching anaesthetic.\u201d In one of the first YouTube videos to appear when I type Chris Tavar\u00e9 the Kent captain is interviewed alongside his opposite number, Botham, at Lord\u2019s after Somerset have just won the 1983 NatWest final, which followed the World Cup. He says getting \u201cTav\u201d out for 39 off 80 balls was a big moment as it opened up an end for Somerset to bowl at. Tavar\u00e9 is gracious in defeat. The Guardian and Observer\u2019s own Vic Marks was the player of the match in that final, taking three for 30 from 10 overs, including that of his friend Tavar\u00e9. I ask Marks for advice before my audition. \u201cChris spoke slowly and deliberately in a deepish voice \u2013 and not that often, which led briefly to the predictable nickname of Rowdy in early England dressing rooms,\u201d Marks says. \u201cBut he had a neat sense of humour and a tendency toward self-deprecation. I always felt he was a much better player than he thought. He was very popular. Botham and Bob Willis liked him a lot \u2013 as did everyone else, especially his contrasting opening partner in 1983, Graeme Fowler.\u201d Tavar\u00e9 would make 58 (off 116 balls) in a 115 partnership with Fowler in a seven-wicket victory against Pakistan at Old Trafford in the World Cup. \u201cChris had the neatest of cricket coffins and upon dismissal he would carefully return his kit there. From his demeanour it would be hard to tell whether he had made nought or a hundred,\u201d Marks says. \u201cHe was a cautious man in several ways \u2013 he travelled to India with his own pillow (often coveted by others in some of the hotels) and pyjamas and later on he took to wearing a gumshield when batting, which meant his calling when running between the wickets produced a muffled, barely comprehensible sound, which often meant \u2018Come on then\u2019. \u201cWe all know Chris\u2019s reputation but I can promise you he played some of the most destructive innings in one-day cricket, especially at county level for Kent and then Somerset and the odd one for England. In this format he stood tall and occasionally wandered down the wicket before the ball was bowled. So it wasn\u2019t such a daft idea to have him in the World Cup squad.\u201d Another YouTube video shows highlights of Fowler and Tavar\u00e9 sharing an opening stand of 69 against India in the semi-final at Old Trafford. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s stance is very side-on. He clips the ball through midwicket for an all-run four. He later plays an almost identical shot off the bowling of Kapil Dev, which this time crosses the boundary. This is followed by a cut for four through point. He plays and misses outside off stump to Roger Binny before edging behind to be caught by Syed Kirmani for 32. When I turn up at the Indoor Cricket Centre at Lord\u2019s in November 2018 I find I\u2019m in a group of six players all auditioning for parts, though I\u2019m the only Tavar\u00e9. One chap has to fill the big boots of Botham. Another is auditioning to be the Australian Trevor Chappell and says he has struggled to find much footage of him other than the notorious under-arm bowling incident of 1981. When I\u2019m asked to speak to camera in the nerves of the moment I forget to talk like Tavar\u00e9. Then I\u2019m asked to bowl my left-arm spin, which I don\u2019t think will help my chances of being cast as Tavar\u00e9 because a) he wasn\u2019t left-handed and b) he didn\u2019t bowl in the World Cup. Still, I\u2019m asked to deliver a ball and sledge the nonexistent batsman \u2013 not necessarily Tavar\u00e9-like behaviour, I think. But then other roles are up for grabs. I\u2019m asked to bowl another ball, appeal loudly and celebrate. Because the ball I bowl has hit neither a pad nor an edge, I forget to appeal straight away, which is embarrassing. Next it\u2019s time to bat. The bowling machine spits a ball at me and I try to drive but manage only to squirt away a bottom edge. The following three deliveries produce a similar result, though, in my defence, I haven\u2019t faced a bowling machine for more than 10 years. I have more success against four back-of-a-length balls, punching them into the off side off the back foot. Then I face four short balls. We\u2019re supposed to pull them but I make poor contact and the ball goes behind square. The second and third balls produce similar, unspectacular, results. The last ball I am supposed to strike and then celebrate as if I\u2019ve hit the winning runs but I spoon it and when attempting to celebrate struggle to take my helmet off as the strap stays wedged beneath my chin. So, all in all, it\u2019s not been the most convincing of auditions. No surprise, then, I never hear back from them. \u201cThe Indian team had already been cast a long time back but in the UK we were looking for players to represent England, Australia, Zimbabwe and West Indies,\u201d the film\u2019s UK line producer, Cyrus Patel, tells me later. \u201cWe wanted the action to be authentic.\u201d The cast is made up of actors in the main roles with body doubles for the cricketing action. It took eight months to find the West Indies side as the search for them was extended from the UK to the Caribbean. The great fast bowler Malcolm Marshall is played by his son, Mali. \u201cThe calibre of cricketers cast was extremely high. They\u2019re all accomplished players because we wanted the action to be as close to international standard as possible,\u201d Patel says. He tells me Tavar\u00e9\u2019s part was taken by Phil Lowe, a cricketer from Loughborough who plays for Newtown Linford in Division One of the Leicestershire and Rutland League. When I track down Lowe, he describes what it was like to be involved in the film. \u201cI had to go to London for training and a wardrobe fitting. We spent a couple of hours in the nets at Lord\u2019s replicating footage from the semi-final between England and India. There were certain shots Tavar\u00e9 played that I would have to replicate and I needed to perfect his technique before filming started. \u201cI was told I needed to grow a moustache and let my hair grow as long as possible. I\u2019d never grown a moustache before but luckily by the time filming had come around I\u2019d managed a reasonable one. But I had to wear a wig because there was insufficient time to grow the back and sides long enough, which wasn\u2019t ideal during long, hot days of filming in the summer.\u201d He spent a week in August filming at Stowe school in Buckinghamshire, a couple of days at Osterley CC in London, then at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells and, finally, at Lord\u2019s. \u201cThey were long 12-13 hour days spent on set but we had a lot of fun,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cWe filmed all of the cricket action from the semi-final on a regular cricket pitch that was surrounded by green screens, so that they could CGI the [Old Trafford] stadium and crowd into the shots. It was a fantastic experience to be involved in a big budget film and get to work alongside huge Bollywood stars like Ranveer Singh [who plays Kapil] and [director] Kabir Khan.\u201d It was at the Nevill Ground Kapil scored 175 not out after India were initially reduced to nine for four by Zimbabwe. No original footage exists of this record-breaking innings because BBC cameramen were on strike. But Patel says they tried to recreate it as accurately as they could. \u201cApart from the Nevill Ground all the other venues have changed considerably since 1983 so we made extensive use of CGI to take the viewer back in time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Lord\u2019s couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming to us and over four days in August 2019 we were able to film in the dressing rooms and in the Long Room.\u201d Some of the street and hotel scenes were shot in Glasgow which, in Patel\u2019s words, \u201chas the feel of 1980s London\u201d. Going into the tournament India\u2019s previous World Cup record was dismal. In 1979 they had failed to win a game and in 1975 had won one, against East Africa. West Indies, on the other hand, had never lost a World Cup match, winning the tournament in 1975 and 1979. \u201cIt seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it,\u201d Patel says. In the final, India were bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs and West Indies had the champagne on ice. But Clive Lloyd\u2019s team were then skittled for 140 in 52 overs. They were later to find Kapil knocking on their dressing-room door and asking for some bottles of fizz as the Indian camp had not anticipated victory. Kapil finished the tournament with 303 runs in eight innings at an average of 60.60 and a strike rate of 108.99. He took 12 wickets at an average of 20.41 and a miserly economy rate of 2.91, and caught Viv Richards and Clive Lloyd in the final \u2013 the first spectacularly so. \u201cNever did India think they would get to the final, let alone win it,\u201d Patel says. \u201cThe 1983 World Cup final was a match that transformed a nation. It is one of those perfect underdog sport stories.\u201d The film, to be called simply 83, had been scheduled for release on 10 April before the coronavirus pandemic intervened. And now Patel is unsure whether footage of Lowe batting will make the final cut of India\u2019s success story. Tavar\u00e9 was there but it was Kapil and his men who stole the show.",

      "bodyText": "The scramble for face masks has created a \u201cmadhouse\u201d atmosphere among Chinese manufacturers, who are making huge profits as customers around the world fight to be the first in line. Producers of masks and respirators are demanding to be paid in full before the products leave their factories and are supplying whoever can pay the most and pay fastest, according to Michael Crotty, a textile broker based in Shanghai. Crotty, of Golden Pacific Fashion and Design, said he had spent all of Sunday dealing with a flood of new enquiries from US states, national governments, cities, hospitals, distributors and private companies seeking to protect their employees. \u201cIt\u2019s just a madhouse,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney talks. The factory knows one thing: what\u2019s in my bank account and when did it get there? And if it gets there before the other guy then that\u2019s who is going to get the production time.\u201d Factories that have quickly changed their production lines to make masks are demanding 50% payment when an order is made and the other 50% before the masks leave the factory. With scams proliferating, those are often unacceptable terms to many buyers, especially those spending taxpayers\u2019 money. \u201cThe factory doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Crotty said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting orders from people they\u2019ve never heard of before. It\u2019s a really unusual circumstance to have these factories absolutely in the driver\u2019s seat. And they\u2019re in the driving seat not of a Volkswagen but of a Mercedes limousine.\u201d Wearing masks has long been common in parts of Asia to combat air pollution and the spread of disease, but until now was rare in Europe and the US. The masks on the market range from thin cotton coverings to fine-mesh surgical masks and respirators that form a seal over the mouth and nose and have to conform to strict specifications. Some European countries are weighing up whether to advise the public to wear masks when not at home. Last week the CDC in the US issued guidance recommending wearing a mask in public spaces. Trump has shrugged off the advice so far, saying: \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d French and German officials blamed the US last week for using \u201cwild west\u201d tactics to outbid them, but Crotty said the outbidding appeared to be an all-against-all affair. Over the weekend authorities in Berlin withdrew a claim that the US had \u201cseized\u201d a shipment of 200,000 respirator masks ordered for the city\u2019s police force, a claim that led to an accusation of \u201cmodern piracy\u201d from Berlin\u2019s state interior minister, Andreas Geisel. According to Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, the police now say they were outbid while the respirators were in transit at Bangkok airport. The Berlin authorities say it is unclear where they went and who the ultimate buyer was. Der Tagesspiegel reported that the masks were made by the US manufacturer 3M, but it has denied any involvement in the transaction. The company has come under intense public pressure from Trump in recent days for continuing to supply masks to other countries. On Thursday he invoked the Federal Production Act, which dates back to the Korean war era and has given the administration the right to use \u201cany and all authority\u201d to procure the protective equipment it needs. \u201cWe need the masks.

      "body": "<p>Isn\u2019t it funny, in a lovely sort of way, how rewatching certain films and TV shows feels like reacquainting yourself with old friends? The idea of catching up with loved ones draws rather melancholic feelings these days. In the era of physical distancing and self-isolation, most of us having resigned ourselves to not seeing anybody in person \u2013 let alone shaking their hands or giving them a hug \u2013 for months.</p> <p>Tactile qualities \u2013 that feeling of being able to reach out and touch something \u2013 are synonymous with the beautiful handmade aesthetics of Aardman Animations, the British studio that specialises in claymation. Two of the studio\u2019s beloved franchises, Shaun the Sheep and Wallace and Gromit, belong to worlds I like to revisit when I\u2019m feeling down, finding their joie de vivre and loving, crafted constructions a kind of soul-invigorating tonic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cb798e8593c281a49f743627f57097fe91643eb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb798e8593c281a49f743627f57097fe91643eb8/0_0_4800_4566/1000..jpg\" alt=\"moulded figures of dog and man in an old car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"951\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wallace and his ever-faithful dog Gromit cash in with their humane pest-control outfit, Anti-Pesto, in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo Credit: Courtesy DreamWorks Animation/PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For kids, you say? Au contraire! Both franchises accommodate all ages and, in fact, all schedules too, available in snackable two-minute instalments as well as half-hour episodes and feature-length spin-offs. The briefer the running time, generally speaking, the more appropriate for young children; the short episodes usually don\u2019t have much in the way of storytelling sophistication or messages likely to resonate with adults.</p> <p>The movies are a different story. Full of visual wit, narrative ingenuity and highly creative arrangement of space and setting, they are striking achievements that reflect a unique filmmaking style.</p> <p>The depth and genius of the Shaun the Sheep Movie (which also has an excellent sequel \u2013 A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon) belies its kiddish material materials. At various points the film channels two of my favourite filmmakers \u2013 Jacques Tati and Luis Bu\u00f1uel \u2013 as well as comic geniuses from the pre-talkies era: namely Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. It is in effect a silent film, capturing in entirely visual ways the journey of the titular mammal and his friends to the big city, where they try to find their amnesia-affected farmer, who suffered a blow to the head that was entirely their fault.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae9272fbf320a5566c64e9b2d0e335a601c21f9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae9272fbf320a5566c64e9b2d0e335a601c21f9c/0_0_3730_2108/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Shaun the Sheep: Farmageddon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"565\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shaun the Sheep: Farmageddon belies its kiddish materials.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Johnson/Aardman Animations</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like Tati\u2019s films Playtime and Mon Uncle, speech is primarily used not for the communication of dialogue but as a kind of sound effect, reiterating the film\u2019s visual focus. When the sheep visit a fancy restaurant and pretend to be diners, co-directors Mark Burton and Richard Starzak venture into a surreal Bu\u00f1uellian space reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/28/discreet-charm-bourgeoisie-review\">The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie</a>, Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s noodle-scratching 1972 oddity about a group of people who are always arriving for dinner but never get the opportunity to eat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/03/hugh-grants-guilty-pleasures-rediscovering-the-saucy-and-sapphic-curios-of-his-back-catalogue\">Hugh Grant's guilty pleasures: rediscovering the saucy and Sapphic curios of his back catalogue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a clever joke early on, the sheep hide from a maniacal animal catcher by posing in front of an advertisement depicting an idyllic green countryside; their assailant looks their way but only sees them as part of the picture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/07/guardianobituaries.france\">Jean Baudrillard</a> would surely have relished this moment, in which reality has merged with a simulation and a simulation becomes reality.</p> <p>A similar idea was explored in the TV show: the fifth episode of the fourth season, to be precise (no <em>you\u2019re</em> obsessed!). An attempted installation of a 3D television goes awry, leaving a huge TV-shaped hole in the farmer\u2019s wall.

      "bodyText": "Isn\u2019t it funny, in a lovely sort of way, how rewatching certain films and TV shows feels like reacquainting yourself with old friends? The idea of catching up with loved ones draws rather melancholic feelings these days. In the era of physical distancing and self-isolation, most of us having resigned ourselves to not seeing anybody in person \u2013 let alone shaking their hands or giving them a hug \u2013 for months. Tactile qualities \u2013 that feeling of being able to reach out and touch something \u2013 are synonymous with the beautiful handmade aesthetics of Aardman Animations, the British studio that specialises in claymation. Two of the studio\u2019s beloved franchises, Shaun the Sheep and Wallace and Gromit, belong to worlds I like to revisit when I\u2019m feeling down, finding their joie de vivre and loving, crafted constructions a kind of soul-invigorating tonic. For kids, you say? Au contraire! Both franchises accommodate all ages and, in fact, all schedules too, available in snackable two-minute instalments as well as half-hour episodes and feature-length spin-offs. The briefer the running time, generally speaking, the more appropriate for young children; the short episodes usually don\u2019t have much in the way of storytelling sophistication or messages likely to resonate with adults. The movies are a different story. Full of visual wit, narrative ingenuity and highly creative arrangement of space and setting, they are striking achievements that reflect a unique filmmaking style. The depth and genius of the Shaun the Sheep Movie (which also has an excellent sequel \u2013 A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon) belies its kiddish material materials. At various points the film channels two of my favourite filmmakers \u2013 Jacques Tati and Luis Bu\u00f1uel \u2013 as well as comic geniuses from the pre-talkies era: namely Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. It is in effect a silent film, capturing in entirely visual ways the journey of the titular mammal and his friends to the big city, where they try to find their amnesia-affected farmer, who suffered a blow to the head that was entirely their fault. Like Tati\u2019s films Playtime and Mon Uncle, speech is primarily used not for the communication of dialogue but as a kind of sound effect, reiterating the film\u2019s visual focus. When the sheep visit a fancy restaurant and pretend to be diners, co-directors Mark Burton and Richard Starzak venture into a surreal Bu\u00f1uellian space reminiscent of The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s noodle-scratching 1972 oddity about a group of people who are always arriving for dinner but never get the opportunity to eat. In a clever joke early on, the sheep hide from a maniacal animal catcher by posing in front of an advertisement depicting an idyllic green countryside; their assailant looks their way but only sees them as part of the picture. Jean Baudrillard would surely have relished this moment, in which reality has merged with a simulation and a simulation becomes reality. A similar idea was explored in the TV show: the fifth episode of the fourth season, to be precise (no you\u2019re obsessed!). An attempted installation of a 3D television goes awry, leaving a huge TV-shaped hole in the farmer\u2019s wall. To resolve this situation Shaun and the other sheep put on a performance, tricking the farmer into believing he\u2019s watching TV, including staging a tennis match that results in the farmer getting whacked in the face by a tennis ball \u2013 which he considers to be evidence of highly impressive 3D technology. The feature film Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is a less cerebral and more conventional (including dialogue) experience, combining a similarly wonderful, painstaking aesthetic with a midnight movie premise. When trying to invent a machine that can cure rabbits of their lust for carrots, Wallace accidentally fuses his mind with the mind of a rabbit (just run with it). This creates a werewolf-like situation, with him transforming at night into a huge mutant rabbit thing that terrorises the town \u2013 just in time for its annual giant vegetable competition. Given Wallace is an inventor, co-directors Steve Box and Nick Park deal not just with visual inventions in his reality, but visual inventions in ours, turning daffy domestic contraptions into the basis for entire sequences. At the start of the film, for instance, we watch Wallace\u2019s ridiculous machine for getting dressed, which involves him being woken up by a retractable hand that comes out of the wall and entices him to consciousness by putting cheese under his nostrils (he loves cheese). His bed then pushes him headfirst into a long chute system, too elaborate to explain in a small amount of words, and far more entertaining to simply watch. In the Oscar-winning 1995 short A Close Shave, there is a different wake-up machine \u2013 this one involving Wallace falling through a hole in the floor, into a pair of pants laid out vertically, then onto a spot around the breakfast table, where he gets pelted with porridge by a malfunctioning food-serving machine. Again this kind of comedy has a very long history. It\u2019s not something you see all that much of in contemporary productions, but it makes these gems from Aardman feel kind of old but also kind of new. Perhaps the word I\u2019m looking for is \u201ctimeless\u201d. \u2022 The Shaun the Sheep movie and two seasons of Shaun the Sheep TV show are on Netflix \u2022 Four seasons of Shaun the Sheep TV show and additional spin-off seasons and specials are on Stan \u2022 Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, and episodes of the Wallace and Gromit TV series including A Close Shave are on Netflix and Stan",

      "bodyText": "Private health insurance funds stand to reap a windfall of between $3.5bn and $5.5bn due to a dramatic fall in elective surgery and other medical procedures during the coronavirus crisis, according to new research from the Australia Institute thinktank. Health expert Roy Harvey said if the funds failed to pass on the dramatic fall in costs to customers, more people will flee a private health insurance system that is already in a death spiral. Harvey, who worked with Australia Institute research director Rod Campbell on the report, said that if premiums were cut in line with services the federal government would also save $1bn to $1.5bn a year in subsidies. The Australia Institute paper, \u201cPrivate eyes ..., hips, etc\u201d, models the effect on the funds if benefits paid to members drop by between 30% and 50% during a six-month period. Factors taken into account include health minister Greg Hunt\u2019s decision last week to pay at least $1.3bn to private hospitals to take over beds potentially needed to accommodate Covid-19 victims, and sweeping bans on dental services introduced by dentists. Harvey said that many funds have abandoned premium hikes that were planned for this month, but this was not enough. \u201cThey\u2019ve been saying we won\u2019t put through the 4% increase that they\u2019re allowed to do in April, but if they say, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll give you a 40% discount\u2019, people might stay. \u201cIf they keep their rates unchanged, people will leave in droves.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic has hit a private health industry that experts say was already in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d because young people, who get relatively little from the product, have quit paying premiums. This has left the funds with a membership increasingly weighted towards older people, who typically require more expensive medical procedures. The escalating financial instability of the industry led the regulator to warn in February that only three will be viable in two years unless urgent action is taken. \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019re not talking about a viable system or a product people want to buy,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cThe thing is unsustainable, it\u2019s undermining the public hospital principle of equity and allowing doctors to charge fees that take people out of the public hospitals.\u201d He said it was hard to estimate the impact of the pandemic on private health using publicly available figures, but the $3.5bn to $5.5bn range was a good starting point. \u201cI think any detailed study would come up with figures that are in the range,\u201d he said. \u201cOther people can say, \u2018Oh, I think it\u2019s this or that\u2019, but it\u2019s really to get a discussion started. \u201cThe Productivity Commission could sort this out in less than a week in terms of getting good estimates.\u201d He said the funds should be held accountable for their windfall and money saved by the government could be used to fund other things, such as domestic violence services, that are needed during the pandemic. \u201cThe savings to the commonwealth alone could be one to one and a half billion [dollars] \u2013 one and a half billion used to be a lot of money once,\u201d he said. Campbell said the insurers looked set to trouser their windfall billions. \u201cInsurers claim to be supporting their members through the crisis by delaying premium increases, but they should be passing on these significant savings to households,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the commonwealth does not ensure savings are passed on to customers, it will be one of the most egregious subsidies ever given to an industry already infamous for receiving handouts.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Last Thursday, millions of Britons stood for a second time on doorsteps and balconies, making their appreciation for frontline workers heard in cities, towns and villages. Clap for Carers <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/coronavirus-nhs-workers-applause-clap-for-our-carers-when-time-covid-19-a9426906.html\" title=\"\">began as an online call for applause</a>, retweeted by NHS England. It seems destined to become a weekly national event: Thursday evening at 8pm has become a collective moment in which to show heartfelt admiration and solidarity. Many people will probably look forward to doing the same this Maundy Thursday.</p> <p>This would be a worthwhile thing in itself. One of the major transformations in the life of a locked-down nation is the new anonymity of the days. The things which structured our daily lives \u2013 the bus journey to work; popping down to the canteen; stopping off at the supermarket to pick up dinner \u2013 have been erased. But many people have worked from home at one time or another. It is the long sweep of interchangeable days that is truly new. The weekend no longer carries the promise of a Friday night at the pub, a football match to go to, or a meal out. Sundays are no longer distinguishable from the rest of the seven-day pack. Churches are closed; sociable weekend lunches with friends are another furloughed pleasure, to be resumed with gusto at an unknown date. Coronavirus has flattened out time.</p> <p>The new featurelessness is likely to be felt particularly acutely this week. Britain is a mainly secular country these days, albeit with significant religious minorities. But much of the nation still maps the contours of its year according to a Christian topography. For those who go to religious services regularly, shut churches on Good Friday \u2013 a day devoted to reflection on suffering and mortality \u2013 will feel particularly cruel in current circumstances. For the majority who don\u2019t, bank holidays without the festive possibility of short breaks enjoying the sights of spring will be another strange landmark to add to a growing list.</p> <p>Human beings need pattern, rhythm and variety to give shape and meaning to their time. In The Mirror and the Light, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/01/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review-thomas-cromwell\" title=\"\">gripping final instalment</a> of Hilary Mantel\u2019s Tudor trilogy, the author devotes considerable space to the Pilgrimage of Grace, the northern rebellion which was the largest to threaten the reign of Henry VIII. Among other grievances, the northerners objected to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation\" title=\"\">proclamation </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation\" title=\"\">restricting the </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation\" title=\"\">number of </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation\" title=\"\">holy </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation\" title=\"\">days</a>. The Henrician Reformation judged the old Catholic saints\u2019 days and feast days to be a product of superstition as well as a good excuse for excessive drinking and carousing. The proclamation didn\u2019t go down well. \u201cThey are asking for St Wilfried,\u201d a courtier reports of the rebels in Mantel\u2019s novel. \u201cThey want Giles and Swithin, and all the harvest saints. They would rather have a holiday than get the crops in.\u201d</p> <p>The Pilgrimage of Grace was brutally suppressed by Henry. For the time being, there is no prospect of relief from our own shapeless days. But the regular Thursday night applause, punctuating the middle of the week, perhaps offers a glimpse of a way forward. Many people are stoically attempting to conduct weekend dinner parties, drinks and parties online. Churches will offer <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-virtual-church-services-reach-the-masses-gm0kn20dr\" title=\"\">virtual participation</a> in services on Good Friday and Easter Sunday. Anything that gives an existential grammar to the passing days and weeks is a good idea. As for the coming weekend, Easter eggs are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52097797\" title=\"\">not essential</a>\u201d, to use a phrase that has become overfamiliar over the past couple of weeks. But they will be deemed desirable by many, and they are definitely purchasable.</p> <p>\u2022 Footnote added 9 April 2020: The week before Easter Sunday, from Palm Sunday to Holy Saturday, is known in the Christian church as Holy Week; and the week after, from Easter Day to Easter Saturday, is Easter Week. The headline to this article uses the term \u201cEaster week\u201d in the general sense of the days leading up to the holiday period.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last Thursday, millions of Britons stood for a second time on doorsteps and balconies, making their appreciation for frontline workers heard in cities, towns and villages. Clap for Carers began as an online call for applause, retweeted by NHS England. It seems destined to become a weekly national event: Thursday evening at 8pm has become a collective moment in which to show heartfelt admiration and solidarity. Many people will probably look forward to doing the same this Maundy Thursday. This would be a worthwhile thing in itself. One of the major transformations in the life of a locked-down nation is the new anonymity of the days. The things which structured our daily lives \u2013 the bus journey to work; popping down to the canteen; stopping off at the supermarket to pick up dinner \u2013 have been erased. But many people have worked from home at one time or another. It is the long sweep of interchangeable days that is truly new. The weekend no longer carries the promise of a Friday night at the pub, a football match to go to, or a meal out. Sundays are no longer distinguishable from the rest of the seven-day pack. Churches are closed; sociable weekend lunches with friends are another furloughed pleasure, to be resumed with gusto at an unknown date. Coronavirus has flattened out time. The new featurelessness is likely to be felt particularly acutely this week. Britain is a mainly secular country these days, albeit with significant religious minorities. But much of the nation still maps the contours of its year according to a Christian topography. For those who go to religious services regularly, shut churches on Good Friday \u2013 a day devoted to reflection on suffering and mortality \u2013 will feel particularly cruel in current circumstances. For the majority who don\u2019t, bank holidays without the festive possibility of short breaks enjoying the sights of spring will be another strange landmark to add to a growing list. Human beings need pattern, rhythm and variety to give shape and meaning to their time. In The Mirror and the Light, the gripping final instalment of Hilary Mantel\u2019s Tudor trilogy, the author devotes considerable space to the Pilgrimage of Grace, the northern rebellion which was the largest to threaten the reign of Henry VIII. Among other grievances, the northerners objected to the proclamation restricting the number of holy days. The Henrician Reformation judged the old Catholic saints\u2019 days and feast days to be a product of superstition as well as a good excuse for excessive drinking and carousing. The proclamation didn\u2019t go down well. \u201cThey are asking for St Wilfried,\u201d a courtier reports of the rebels in Mantel\u2019s novel. \u201cThey want Giles and Swithin, and all the harvest saints. They would rather have a holiday than get the crops in.\u201d The Pilgrimage of Grace was brutally suppressed by Henry. For the time being, there is no prospect of relief from our own shapeless days. But the regular Thursday night applause, punctuating the middle of the week, perhaps offers a glimpse of a way forward. Many people are stoically attempting to conduct weekend dinner parties, drinks and parties online. Churches will offer virtual participation in services on Good Friday and Easter Sunday. Anything that gives an existential grammar to the passing days and weeks is a good idea. As for the coming weekend, Easter eggs are \u201cnot essential\u201d, to use a phrase that has become overfamiliar over the past couple of weeks. But they will be deemed desirable by many, and they are definitely purchasable. \u2022 Footnote added 9 April 2020: The week before Easter Sunday, from Palm Sunday to Holy Saturday, is known in the Christian church as Holy Week; and the week after, from Easter Day to Easter Saturday, is Easter Week. The headline to this article uses the term \u201cEaster week\u201d in the general sense of the days leading up to the holiday period.",

The UK coronavirus death toll rose by 621, a slight fall on yesterday when 708 people were confirmed to have died from Covid over the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of victims to 4,934 The number of new people tested daily in the UK for coronavirus returned to above 10,000, according to Department of Health figures. A total of 12,334 new people were reported as being tested in the 24 hours up until 9am today. Health secretary Matt Hancock said he could not provide an exact figure on how many more ventilators the NHS could have in place over the next week in the daily press conference but earlier this morning he told Andrew Marr that \u201cthere should be another 1,500\u201d in a week\u2019s time. He implored people not to flout the coronavirus lockdown rules despite the warm weather and he confirmed that sunbathing was against the rules. He said that if people flout them \u201cwe might have to take further action\u201d. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer is withdrawing from daily media briefings during the coronavirus pandemic, after it emerged she had twice visited her family\u2019s second home in Fife \u2013 prompting a police warning. Scottish government adverts are being shown on television this weekend where Calderwood says: \u201cTo help save lives, stay at home.\u201d These are being edited to remove her. Labour will ask the government \u201cdifficult questions\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic, newly-elected leader, Keir Starmer said, adding that the UK had been slow to begin testing and that equipment for health care workers on the frontline was lacking. However, Starmer said he would seek to engage with the government constructively and that he would support the government if they were to ban outdoor exercise due to some people flouting lockdown rules. Matt Hancock should have stayed home for longer than seven days after contracting Covid-19, Labour\u2019s newly-elected deputy leader Angela Rayner said. The government\u2019s guidelines state that if you have symptoms of coronavirus, you need to self-isolate at home for seven days or for as long as you still have a high temperature, but the World Health Organisation has recommended people self-quarantine for a fortnight. Government minister Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s investment firm was criticised for exploiting the coronavirus crisis after telling clients it provided a chance to make \u201csuper normal returns\u201d. John Alagos, a 27-year-old nurse at Watford general hospital, died on Friday following a 12-hour night shift after complaining of suffering a headache and high temperature upon his return home. His mother, Gina Gustilo told the Mail on Sunday that her son had not been wearing full personal protective equipment despite treating coronavirus patients. The owner of London\u2019s ExCel centre, the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company, has said it will no longer charge the NHS to use the site for the temporary Nightingale hospital. ExCel chief executive Jeremy Rees told the BBC an initial agreement with the NHS to had \u201cincluded a contribution to some fixed costs\u201d. But following reports, he said: \u201cWe have since decided to cover the fixed costs ourselves.\u201d The Foreign Office\u2019s efforts to repatriate British nationals stranded in India continue to draw criticism even after it announced seven charter flights for next week. The flights leave from Mumbai, Goa and Delhi but the cost of \u00a3600 for a one way journey and the lack of information on flights from other airports, particularly in Punjab, have frustrated those stranded. The high commissioner Jan Thompson said these were the \u201cfirst round of charter flights\u201d and would go from Goa to Stansted on 8, 10 and 12 April; from Mumbai to Heathrow on 9 and 11 of April and Delhi to Heathrow on 9 and 11 April. There has been criticism over the high prices, an issue that appears to have heightened existing exasperation over the UK\u2019s failure to send charter flights earlier like other countries including Germany which has repatriated 42,000 of its citizens around the world. Another said it was \u201cabsolutely appalling that those stranded in Punjab were not told sooner they would not be included in the first phase of repatriations\u201d. Thompson said in response that the Foreign Office was \u201clooking to arrange flights for British nationals from other locations\u201d. Public Health England said 11,085 tests for coronavirus were carried out on 8,651 people on Saturday in England. A tweet by the Department of Health added that PHE gave the testing capacity for inpatient care in England as 12,799 tests per day. The announcement comes after a total of 12,334 new people were reported as being tested in the 24 hours up until 9am today. The equivalent figure for yesterday had slipped below 10,000, having previously been above 10,000 for two days in a row (see 3.07pm). Here are some further full lines from the presser. When asked if people are safe to visit family if they have been following the social distancing guidelines correctly, Hancock said uncertainty over how the disease is spread means they should not. This virus can spread in all sorts of different ways, both from directly respiratory and also through objects and through touching objects that others then touch - the uncertainty over who has it, especially before they have symptoms, means that the only effective way of bending the curve down is to reduce that social contact. That\u2019s why we came to the conclusions we did, difficult conclusions, that we have to have such extraordinary social distancing policies in place and why we took the decision more than a week ago now to flip the basis of those rules from saying you can\u2019t do certain things to saying you must stay at home unless you\u2019re doing one of a small number of things. Harries said there is an important distinction between the terms \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201chousehold\u201d. Previously you might have had four or five students living in a flat under one roof, sharing cooking, bathrooms, all sorts of things - that in infection control terms of things is a household. If your family lives in a different town, they are an entirely different household and mixing those two is not what we want to do generally. Stay with the people you live under the same roof with and keep doing that for as long as you can.\u201d During the press conference, health secretary Matt Hancock said he could not provide an exact figure on how many more ventilators the NHS could have in place over the next week. But this morning he told Andrew Marr that \u201cthere should be another 1,500\u201d in a week\u2019s time. He told the Downing St briefing: The production from domestic manufacturers is starting to come on stream. The key goal is to always keep the amount of critical care beds - which nearly all need ventilators - above the demand. We haven\u2019t got an exact figure for how many we will deliver next week not least because when we bring them in from abroad there are risks to the timing. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, he said: We need to make sure we have more ventilators than there are people who need ventilation. At the moment we have between 9,000 and 10,000 ventilators within the NHS right now and we have the 2,000 spare that are critical care beds with ventilator capacity should people need to come into them and we\u2019re ramping that up. The answer is that our goal, instead of the 30,000, is that we need 18,000 ventilators over the coming two weeks.\u201d Asked how many there will be in a week\u2019s time, he said: \u201cThere should be another 1,500.\u201d The government had already appeared to revise down its 30,000 target for ventilators. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer is withdrawing from daily media briefings during the coronavirus pandemic, after it emerged she had twice visited her family\u2019s second home in Fife. Dr Calderwood will remain in the post and continue advising the Scottish Government, but the current advertising campaign which features her will now be revised, according to first minister Nicola Sturgeon. In a statement after Sunday\u2019s excruciating briefing, Sturgeon said: I am acutely aware of the importance of public trust in the advice the government is giving to stay at home in order to save lives and protect our NHS. To maintain that trust we will be revising our public information campaign and the chief medical officer will be withdrawing from media briefings for the foreseeable future. She will continue to provide the Scottish government with the scientific and medical advice on the spread of coronavirus. Although he raised the possibility of an extension of the lockdown earlier today, Hancock said the government is not looking at tightening the rules on exercising outdoors. \u201cWhat we are doing is being absolutely clear that the current rules must be followed,\u201d he said. He said the rules are designed to include exercise to protect people\u2019s physical and mental wellbeing. Harries said: It is not just what you are doing but how you are doing it. If you are sitting on a park bench, people tend to accumulate - it is very difficult to prevent that. Having rules where we are getting all of the benefits and minimising the risks and harms is an important approach to maintain. We have set those rules, we are enforcing against those rules and we will reiterate those rules, because that is the best way to be able to bend the curve down and stop the spread of the virus. At the beginning of the news conference which was not broadcast due to a malfunction, Hancock said he offered his \u201cprofound sympathies\u201d to the families and friends of those who have died. He added: \u201cI\u2019ve lost two people that I was fond of so I understand what a difficult time this is for the country.\u201d Harries said that transport use in the UK had been down since February but needed to be sustained. The first slide [showing transport use] probably hasn\u2019t changed much but that is really good news. What is shows is that our transport use is down and remains down since early March, beginning back in February as well and we\u2019re managing to sustain that. As the secretary of state has said it\u2019s really important that we continue to do that despite the good weather so thank you to the members of the public that have observed that and please ensure that we keep moving in that direction. On the number of lab test reported cases, Harries emphasised the need for caution. You will be aware that our capacity is increasing all the time on laboratory tests. So we need to interpret this with a little bit of caution. We are following to a certain degree an epidemic curve and we can see the rise and we will of course in due course be looking to see that level off, but you will notice that over the last 24 hours or so there is an apparent big surge there. We just need to keep in mind that we need to watch for a trend over time because as our testing capacity increases, inevitably we will find more cases. Asked if he would have asked for Calderwood\u2019s resignation after she twice visited her coastal second home over the past two weekends, Hancock says it is a matter for the Scottish government. And the press conference concludes. Hancock says that even for \u201cthose of who have had it\u201d, it is unclear to what extent those who have contracted coronavirus can transmit the virus. He says there are scientific predictions showing their ability to transmit the virus is lower and their immunity is higher, but the science is not yet definitive. Hancock says the virus can spread in all sorts of different ways and that the uncertainty over who has it \u2013 especially before they have symptoms \u2013 means that the only way to reduce the number of people contracting it is strict social distancing. Harries says people have intermixed the terms family and household. She says it is important for people to remember it is a household isolation policy, not a family one \u2013 though people\u2019s households may comprise their family. Mixing those two is not what we would like to do, generally, she says \u2013 remaining slightly equivocal. She refuses to speculate on the true scale of coronavirus in the UK and acknowledges other countries are ahead in assessing the extent of the pandemic nationally. Harries says it is unclear how the disease outbreak has affected our immunity and says it is important to discover. She says different interventions could come in response to emerging regional data. The government has bought 3.5m finger-prick antibody tests. Asked if the government is going to take equity stakes in any companies hit by the outbreak, Hancock says this is an area where Rishi Sunak has been doing incredible work. He declines to comment on whether Virgin Care would be in line for this help, after Jim Pickard from the FT noted that it has sued the NHS and its owner Richard Branson is a tax exile. Asked about the Queen\u2019s espousal of the nation\u2019s self-discipline, Hancock says we need perseverance in the face of some great challenges, adding that people need to stay at home unless they are going out for any of four reasons. On mass testing, Harries says not everybody in particular care homes and prisons, for example, would be tested but those prioritised key workers have been tested where there have been outbreaks. On whether higher levels of protection should have been in place, amid growing reports of health care workers dying, Hancock muses on whether we are doing the right thing now. You can have a debate about the past, he says, but the previous guidance was based on the previous information that was available. Harries says the guidance has been reviewed to ensure clinicians feel safe. Asked whether people in hospitals with immunosuppressed conditions should be concerned due to doctors having a lack of protective equipment, Hancock says guidance has been updated in line with the emerging science. Harries appears to acknowledge that the previous guidance was not in line with the WHO guidance and that doctors need to be prepared for changing circumstances. Hancock says there are adequate supplies of oxygen in hospitals following reports to the contrary. He recognises an equipment failure led to the diversion of some ambulances, but this was not uncommon. Harries says the public should not be concerned since there was no insufficiency of oxygen. The press conference with health secretary Matt Hancock and deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries is underway. Campaigners have questioned the safety of pregnant women travelling by ferry from Northern Ireland for abortions amid the coronavirus pandemic as the services remain unavailable in the nation despite the law change in October. At the time, it was reported that women would continue to travel to England for medical terminations until March \u2013 but that period appears to have been extended. Here are some clips from earlier\u2019s remarkable press conference in Scotland as we await the daily Downing St briefing. A man has been arrested after a woman was stabbed in the face in a domestic incident, and police have urged victims of domestic abuse not to remain silent during the lockdown. Merseyside Police repeated advice for victims of domestic abuse during the coronavirus lockdown after officers were called to a home in Rainhill, Merseyside, just before 11pm on Saturday following reports of an argument involving the two occupants. A force spokesman said a 44-year-old woman had been stabbed in the face twice, causing injuries above her left eyebrow, and was taken to hospital for treatment. She was later released. A 47-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of wounding. Two children are being looked after by family members following the incident, police said. Det Ch Insp Steve Reardon said: Earlier this week we reminded people about the silent call 999 system for vulnerable people living in our communities, including those who suffer from domestic abuse. We completely understand that victims of domestic abuse could be feeling more vulnerable during the current situation we all find ourselves in, but my message to them is please don\u2019t suffer in silence. If you need our help call us and if you can\u2019t make a call as you would ordinarily do, please use the silent call option available to you. Silent call is a part of the 999 system which allows for people who are not free to speak, but are able to make a noise, to press 55, which alerts the BT operator to the fact that you need help, and they can then connect the call to the police. The system enables all 999 callers to access support in the manner described, it is important that a noise is made when 55 has been pressed. For example if you can only make noise, such as tapping the handset, coughing, crying or even talking to the offender, then these actions will alert the attention of the BT operator. There are growing calls from within the NHS to urgently ramp up staff testing to tackle growing absence from work. NHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: We have welcomed the commitment to significantly increase testing for NHS staff, but we are now at the point where we urgently need this to be ramped up and operating at full capacity. Snapshot surveys indicating high staff sickness and self isolation rates reflect what we\u2019re hearing day in day out from trust leaders \u2013 that trying to cope with record levels of demand with record levels of absence is really difficult. More wide-scale staff testing to confirm whether self isolating staff have COVID-19 cannot come quickly enough. Trusts have rapidly put in place staff testing facilities and they are trying to grow the testing capacity they control as fast as possible. But we know there is still a shortage of swabs, reagents and kits and this urgently needs to be resolved. The lack of testing is affecting frontline staff not just in hospitals, but those who are working in community, mental health and ambulance services. Staff testing is vital to ensure staff in whatever role can get back to work as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, plans to ensure oxygen supplies for critically ill patients are afoot. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said: The NHS has known for over six weeks that treating COVID-19 requires high levels of ventilation support and accompanying oxygen. We\u2019ve therefore been preparing accordingly. Trusts have been working closely with national NHS leaders and oxygen suppliers to ensure hospitals have enough oxygen supply. They\u2019ve also been working with oxygen system engineers to ensure they have the right piping and ducting to carry oxygen to all the required beds including newly created critical care capacity. There is a particular challenge here given that trusts are currently using unprecedented levels of ventilators and oxygen at the same time. This can put a much higher level of pressure on a hospital\u2019s central oxygen supply system than usual, potentially overloading it. We can\u2019t comment on individual incidents but a hospital will declare a critical incident if it can\u2019t take any more patients or if it is suffering a serious incident like a fire. At that point a well prepared and frequently rehearsed critical incident plan will kick in. Patients will diverted to other hospitals and, if need be, existing patients will be transferred to other hospitals as well. This is another good example of the benefits of having a National Health Service where trusts are used to helping each other out if they encounter serious problems.\u201d Turning to party politics briefly, Ian Lavery and Barry Gardiner are to leave the shadow cabinet. Gardiner has said new leader Keir Starmer contacted him to \u201cstand him down\u201d, while it is currently unclear whether Lavery left of his own accord. The owner of London\u2019s ExCel centre, the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company, has said it will no longer charge the NHS to use the site for the temporary Nightingale hospital. ExCel chief executive Jeremy Rees told the BBC an initial agreement with the NHS to had \u201cincluded a contribution to some fixed costs\u201d. But he said: \u201cWe have since decided to cover the fixed costs ourselves.\u201d The Sunday Times reported that the centre, which is owned by ADNEC, was charging the NHS between \u00a32m and \u00a33m in rent to use the east London site. Humaid Matar Al Dhaheri, managing director and group chief executive of ADNEC, said: To be clear, profit has always been the furthest thing from our minds. It is our firm commitment that we will not charge a penny for the use of our facilities, and we will provide the NHS with the operational and logistical support it needs for NHS Nightingale London. The ExCeL\u2019s decision to charge the NHS was in contrast to the NEC in Birmingham, owned by the American private equity giant Blackstone, which is reportedly providing the venue for free. Wayne Rooney has criticised the government and Premier League for putting Britain\u2019s top-flight footballers in a \u201cno-win situation\u201d over the issue of pay cuts, with Gary Lineker and Gary Neville also speaking out. Writing in the Sunday Times, Rooney claimed his fellow professionals were being lined up as \u201ceasy targets\u201d in the wider response to the coronavirus crisis, and branded government criticism of players \u201ca disgrace\u201d. The Premier League\u2019s proposed 30% wage cut or deferral strategy for players was discussed in a conference call with the PFA and the League Managers Association on Saturday. The players\u2019 union later issued a statement suggesting such a move could result in a \u00a3200m tax deficit. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, led calls for Premier League footballers to accept pay cuts, insisting players should \u201cplay their part\u201d by reducing their lucrative salaries. In response, Rooney said he is willing and able to make significant financial contributions, but felt the public pressure being exerted on players was unhelpful. If the government approached me to help support nurses financially or buy ventilators I\u2019d be proud to do so, as long as I knew where the money was going. I\u2019m in a position where I could give something up. Not every footballer is in the same position. Yet suddenly the whole profession has been put on the spot with a demand for 30% pay cuts across the board. Why are footballers suddenly the scapegoats? How the past few days have played out is a disgrace. He [Hancock] was supposed to be giving the nation the latest on the biggest crisis we\u2019ve faced in our lifetimes. Why was the pay of footballers even in his head? Was he desperate to divert attention from his government\u2019s handling of this pandemic? Gary Lineker has also said it is unfair to single out high-earning athletes but expressed confidence that action was imminent, citing recent conversations with players. \u201cWhy not call on all the wealthy to try and help if they possibly can rather than just pick on footballers?\u201d Lineker said during an appearance on Andrew Marr\u2019s BBC One programme. \u201cNobody seems to talk about the bankers, the CEOs, huge millionaires. Are they standing up? Are they being asked to stand up? We don\u2019t know.\u201d Lineker was critical of top-flight clubs, including l Liverpool and Tottenham, who have furloughed non-playing staff using the safety net of the Government\u2019s job retention scheme. \u201cThat\u2019s a different matter entirely,\u201d Lineker said. \u201cThe big clubs, you\u2019d have thought, would have been savvy enough to perhaps try to help more of their workers when players are earning so much money.\u201d In a statement issued by the Scottish government\u2019s national clinical director (see 12.32pm), it was suggested that the chief medical officer merely went to check on her second home this weekend with her family. Now Catherine Calderwood has admitted she also went there last weekend, questions are being raised over how often must one check on their second home. Sturgeon did not provide her absolute backing to Calderwood future in the barnstorming press conference. She said Calderwood had offered to do whatever is in the best interest of the country. \u201cIn my view, that would not be her resignation,\u201d she said. Politicians have criticised the provision of personal protective equipment after a care home worker in Scotland with suspected Covid-19 died. Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said access to protective clothing and equipment for health and social care staff is a \u201cproblem across Scotland\u201d and called on the Scottish government to take urgent action. Baillie, who represents Dumbarton, said: In this time of crisis, we all owe a huge debt of gratitude to those heroic health and care workers who risk their lives daily to care for and treat those in need. This very sad news will come as a great blow to the family and to my local community. My thoughts are with them and I share in their grief. It is clear that access to protective clothing and equipment for health and social care staff is a problem across Scotland. Supplies are rationed because there is simply not enough and the strategy appears to be determined by that shortage of supply, rather than what health guidance dictates. This is simply not good enough and is putting lives at risk. The Scottish government must act urgently to protect our brave frontline workers. It is our duty to do so.\u201d Hazel Nolan, from the GMB union, said advice and guidance to home care workers had been resource-led, not science-led. Not everyone is ignoring the government guidelines, according to the Guardian\u2019s Miles Brignall. This was the A1 in Hertfordshire at midday today. Not a car in sight. It was junction nine, for any motorway nerds. The number of new people tested daily in the UK for coronavirus is back above 10,000, today\u2019s figures from the Department of Health show. A total of 12,334 new people were reported as being tested in the 24 hours up until 9am today. The equivalent figure for yesterday had slipped below 10,000, having previously been above 10,000 for two days in a row. On Thursday, Matt Hancock set out a goal of moving from 10,000 tests a day to 100,000 by the end of April. This would include swab testing in Public Health England and NHS labs, using commercial partners including universities and private businesses, and introducing antibody blood tests. The total number of people in the UK tested since the outbreak began - 195,524 - is the equivalent of around 293 people in every 100,000, or 0.3% of the population. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has taken 15 days to go from just over 5,000 \u2013 5,018 as of 9am March 21 \u2013 to nearly 50,000 \u2013 47,806 as of 9am April 5. Sturgeon would not be drawn on whether the CMO has put at risk the wellbeing of those who have been following the government\u2019s stay-at-home guidance and could be prevented from exercising under measures threatened by the health secretary earlier today due to people allegedly flouting existing rules. Asked why Calderwood has received a warning while people have received fines for sitting in their cars, Sturgeon said it is not a case of one rule for some and one rule for others, but that she cannot speak for the police. Calderwood said she is \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for not adhering to coronavirus guidelines by visiting her second home, adding she had \u201cno excuses\u201d for \u201cnot following the advice she has been giving to others\u201d. She said she cannot justify her actions and can only apologise unreservedly. People make mistakes, according to Sturgeon. The chief medical officer made a mistake in travelling away from her home. Whatever her reasons for doing so it was wrong and she knows that. All of us, including me, will make mistakes in these unprecedented times we are living in. When we do we must be candid about it and learn from it. She said Calderwood is learning from her error and that her advice and expertise during the pandemic has been invaluable. Sturgeon said any loss of this expertise would damage the government. The chief medical officer for Scotland has revealed that she was also at her holiday home in Fife last weekend. Seemingly in response to calls for her resignation, she said she would continue to concentrate on her job. Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said two more people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Scotland, bringing the total deaths there to 220. Sturgeon said this figure, up from 218 on Saturday, should not be taken as being \u201ctruly representative\u201d of the number of deaths, as the way Covid-19 deaths are being notified is changing. She said the figure is \u201clikely to be artificially low\u201d. An NHS nurse has made an emotional appeal to the public to observe lockdown measures. In a video filmed between two ICU shifts, Shirley Watts said the coronavirus crisis had left the NHS \u201con our knees\u201d. A total of 4,934 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Saturday, the Department of Health has said. That is an increase of 621 from 4,313 yesterday when there were 708 new deaths confirmed in the UK \u2013 the largest 24-hour increase since the outbreak began. As of 9am on Sunday, a total of 195,524 people have been tested for Covid, 47,806 of whom tested positive, according to the Department of Health. As my colleagues reported yesterday, the NHS England figures \u2013 which make up the bulk of UK deaths \u2013 reflect the day on which the death was reported, not the actual date of death, which is usually days, sometimes weeks, before it appears in the figures. Public Health Wales has said 12 more people who had tested positive for Covid-19 have died, taking the total number of deaths in Wales to 166. The total number of confirmed deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus in hospitals in England has risen to 4,494, NHS England has said, an increase of 555. The patients were aged between 33 years and 103 years old and 29 of them were aged between 35 and 95 years old and had no known underlying health conditions, according to NHS England. The patients were from the following regions: East of England 40 London 174 Midlands 74 North East &amp; Yorkshire 103 North West 47 South East 81 South West 36 The daily update on UK coronavirus cases will be released later on Sunday, the Department of Health said. The number of people who have died in Northern Ireland after contracting coronavirus has risen by seven to 63, health officials have said. Tests have confirmed a further 91 positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the region to 1,089, though the true total is almost certainly much higher. We should have statistics for the rest of the UK shortly. The Observer\u2019s Nosheen Iqbal has been speaking with the volunteers delivering food to people\u2019s homes. Keir Starmer has received a briefing from senior government officials on the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesman for the new Labour leader said: This afternoon Keir Starmer was briefed over the phone by senior government officials about the coronavirus pandemic. During the call, the Labour leader reiterated his commitment to work constructively with the government in the national interest. Cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance were on the call. A investment management firm founded by Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, has been accused of profiteering from the coronavirus crisis. The MP reportedly owns 15% of Somerset Capital Management (SCM) and amidst the economic disruption caused by coronavirus it is believed that the company has been investing in businesses whose values have fallen but are expected to rally. First reported by the Sunday Mirror, the business\u2019 fund manager Mark Asquith said in a piece of promotional material for investors: History has shown us that super normal returns can be made during this type of environment. Market dislocations of this magnitude happen rarely, perhaps once or twice in a generation, and have historically provided excellent entry points for investors. Strategies such as those believed to have been employed by SCM are not uncommon but new Labour leader Keir Starmer said \u201cnobody should be seeking to take advantage of this crisis\u201d. Prof David Oliver, an NHS consultant physician, has said that there is a \u201cconstant anxiety\u201d among healthcare workers that they could become infected. He told the BBC: Its widely acknowledged that we could have been quicker to provide [protective] equipment to frontline staff. And also the advice has changed two or three times. My perception now is we do have regularly updated and very clear guidance. We\u2019re telling everybody else stay at home and don\u2019t mingle. But its the nature of our work that we have to come into buildings every day and come into contact with clinical colleagues and we don\u2019t know what members of the team have already been infected. Police have visited Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood and issued her with a warning after she visited her second home. Scotland\u2019s chief constable Iain Livingstone said in a statement: Earlier today, local officers visited Dr Catherine Calderwood and spoke to her about her actions, reiterated crucial advice and issued a warning about her future conduct, all of which she accepted. The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone. The former boss of the McLaren Formula One team, businessman Ron Dennis, has launched an initiative to provide one million free meals to frontline NHS workers. He said he co-founded SalutetheNHS.org to feed thousands of hospital staff because he was \u201cin awe\u201d of their work to save lives during the coronavirus pandemic. This is a time when all of us, individuals and businesses alike, need to stand up and be counted in the effort to combat Covid-19. We\u2019re all in this together. I am delighted to be leading this initiative to help ensure that vital NHS workers have nutritious meals while they work every hour in this fight. It means they have one less thing to worry about. The Dennis family is donating \u00a31m through their charity foundation Dreamchasing, alongside 500,000 in match-funding. Tesco will donate food for the meals and the initiative is supported by catering group Absolute Taste and delivery service Yodel. Meals will be made available, for free, to ICU teams, anaesthetic teams and A&amp;E staff who are unable to leave their clinical areas during their 12-hour shifts. Deliveries will start at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford tomorrow and at London children\u2019s hospital Great Ormond Street the following week, before being rolled out to Government-targeted locations. Thousands of casual workers at some of English football\u2019s biggest stadiums have been left unpaid during the Covid-19 shutdown, the Guardian understands. A number of employees from Delaware North \u2013 which provides catering and hospitality services at venues such as the Emirates Stadium, London Stadium, Wembley, Craven Cottage and the Ricoh Arena \u2013 have contacted the Guardian after seeing booked shifts cancelled and receiving no payments since the Premier League season halted last month. Some of the workers, who are on zero-hour or casual arrangements, feel increasingly desperate. The casual workers complain the company has told them there are no shifts for them because of the impact of Covid-19 and that it is trying to establish whether they are eligible to be furloughed under the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme. A long-standing casual employee at one of the venues told the Guardian that they work there for up to five days a week but saw that income stream removed as soon as the season was paused. They said they had received no payment for the shifts they had committed to. Lord Bath of Longleat has died aged 87 after testing positive for coronavirus. Alexander Thynn, the 7th Marquess of Bath, died on Saturday after being admitted to the Royal United Hospital in Bath on March 28. During his time there, it was confirmed that he had Covid-19. Longleat Safari Park confirmed the news in a Facebook post on Sunday, expressing their \u201cdeepest sadness\u201d at Lord Bath\u2019s death. The family would like to express their great appreciation for the dedicated team of nurses, doctors and other staff who cared so professionally and compassionately for Alexander in these extremely difficult times for everyone. They would politely request a period of privacy to deal with their loss. Aspects of our national life are suddenly in the foreground \u2013 from the NHS, through all those low-paid key workers, to spontaneous community initiatives that transcend most of the social divides we were told were insurmountable, writes the Guardian\u2019s John Harris. If the Conservatives cannot turn them into a national story, someone else should at least try \u2013 not for immediate electoral gain, but for two other reasons. In the short-term, it could help many of us to get out of bed every morning and face the day. Looking further ahead, it might start to map out what kind of country we might become when the horrors of the coronavirus begin to recede. On the evidence of the past few months, Starmer may be too bloodless and cautious a politician to pull this off. Maybe his remainer convictions, and widespread mistrust of his party, will deny him a big enough audience. But in the speech released as his victory was announced, there were at least hints of what the moment requires: the elegant recognition that in the midst of the crisis, \u201ctoo many will have given too much\u201d and \u201csome of us will have lost too much\u201d; the unanswerable claim that \u201cwe know, in our hearts, [that] things are going to have to change.\u201d There are reports of children arriving at hospitals with illnesses at more advanced stages than they usually would be at the point of admission, according to the UK\u2019s child health professional body. The president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Russell Viner, has privately contacted the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, to urge for an immediate change in the government\u2019s public information strategy as parents appear reluctant or afraid to go to hospital with their children, OpenDemocracy reported. With vast green spaces such as Victoria Park in London now closed, people are taking to smaller parks to exercise. But why not turn golf courses into exercising spots to allow people to more easily socially distance? The volume of calls to the NHS 111 helpline has surged by 400% since the spread of the coronavirus became a national health crisis. The free service, which offers urgent but non-emergency care advice, has been inundated with calls from Britons since the start of March when the virus took hold. Vodafone, which provides the lines and handles the call traffic for the NHS 111 call centre, said it had doubled capacity to handle 2,400 calls simultaneously. The call centre has experienced huge surges in the number of calls, hitting a peak of 1,100 simultaneously at one point \u2013 four times more than the peaks before the health emergency. Daily peaks vary widely, but for example last Saturday it was 500. The Scotman\u2019s Paris Gourtsoyannis has questioned how the Scottish government\u2019s national clinical director could be certain that the chief medical officer observed social distancing during her visit to Fife (see 11.58am). ITV\u2019s Peter Smith warns that the apparent mixed messaging is becoming dangerous. Waitrose and John Lewis are donating 50,000 boxes of Easter confectionery to NHS workers as a small token of their appreciation in the run-up to Easter. Truffles and mini Easter eggs from John Lewis will be available to NHS staff shopping at 51 stores until the Easter weekend. The Waitrose branches have been chosen due to their proximity to NHS hospitals, with shops based in locations including London, Dorset, Hampshire, Northumberland and the West Midlands. Peter Cross, director of customer experience at the John Lewis Partnership, said: In these extremely difficult times, we wanted to make a small gesture to those working on the frontline. We hope these gifts will go a little way in helping to express our gratitude and simply brighten up the day a little for the NHS staff who are working tirelessly in really challenging circumstances. John Lewis has also donated care packs with items such as pillows, phone chargers, eye masks and hand cream to hospitals to make breaks more comfortable for staff. Matt Hancock should have stayed home for longer than seven days after contracting Covid-19, Labour\u2019s newly-elected deputy leader Angela Rayner has said. The government\u2019s guidelines state that if you have symptoms of coronavirus, you need to self-isolate at home for seven days or for as long as you still have a high temperature, and anyone you live with should stay in for 14 days even if they do not have any symptoms. However, the World Health Organisation has recommended people self-quarantine for a fortnight after possible Covid exposure or having contracted the virus. Rayner, who herself has been self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms, said she was in bed for six days and her symptoms were \u201cvery debilitating\u201d. Speaking to Sky News\u2019 Sophie Ridge On Sunday, she said: I\u2019m disappointed that Matt Hancock, after seven days of having the virus, went out when the World Health Organisation has said you should self-isolate for 14 days. I think it\u2019s right that we do that because I cannot stress enough the severity of the symptoms that I have suffered, as you can tell from how breathless I am still now, and I\u2019m day nine, day 10. I think the government really need to give that clarity and continue to support people doing the right thing. Hancock announced on Friday March 27 he had tested positive for Covid-19, and he came out of isolation on Thursday and presented the daily Downing Street press conference. He is assumed to have self-isolated for 24 hours before he made his positive diagnosis public. Meanwhile, prime minister Boris Johnson remains in isolation as he still has a temperature after going into isolation on March 27. Right wing think tank the Henry Jackson society has claimed that China is liable to pay the UK, along with the other G7 nations, billions in compensation due to alleged underreporting of the scale of the coronavirus outbreak, amid growing calls from Tory MPs led by former deputy prime minister Damien Green for a reset in UK-China relations. The chief medical officer for Scotland, Catherine Calderwood, is now facing calls to resign after she appeared to flout her own advice and visited her coastal second home with her family. Scottish Labour health spokesperson Monica Lennon said: The first minister and her top team must lead by example during this crisis which continues to take lives on a daily basis. The message that people should stay at home to save lives and protect the NHS is the right one. The chief medical officer delivers that instruction on behalf of the government but has failed to follow her own advice. Her actions have undermined Scotland\u2019s pandemic response and her own credibility. Unfortunately, it means she cannot and should not continue in her role. Her position as CMO has become untenable. Rennie and Wendy Chamberlain, the Lib Dem MSP for North East Fife and a former police officer, said government officials such as Calderwood had to command public confidence at a time of crisis. If we are going to get through this pandemic we need medical leaders who everyone can follow. It is with great regret that we say that the chief medical officer will need to go. Local people are irate that holidaymakers and second home owners have ignored the warnings from the chief medical officer to stay at home. The main street was described as being like a motorway and many second homes are full up,\u201d they said. There is real concern that with a swollen population and a virus sweeping through the local health services will just not cope. Prof Neil Ferguson of London University\u2019s Imperial College, one of the scientists whose modelling of the virus helped prompt the lockdown, told Andrew Marr earlier that it was difficult to know when it might be eased, as this would depend on how quickly case numbers reduce. There is no point, having gone through this effort, in releasing a lockdown at a point where case numbers are still high and will resurge even faster than we have seen before. We want case numbers to get to a low point where we can start substituting other measures for the most intrusive and economically costly aspects of the current lockdown. Ferguson said it was also hard to predict total death numbers, but he believed these could be \u201canywhere between 7,000 or so up to a little over 20,000\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story: ITV presenter Piers Morgan and businessman Alan Sugar have disagreed over whether people should be allowed to sunbathe. Matt Hancock said he is \u201csympathetic\u201d to calls for nurses to receive a pay rise. The starting salary for a nurse is \u00a324,214, according to Unison, and the more than 300,000 nurses have suffered real terms pay cuts due to government-imposed wage restraints over the past decade. Asked if nurses deserved a pay rise, Hancock told Andrew Marr: Everybody wants to support our nurses right now and I\u2019m sure there will be a time to debate things like that. At the moment the thing that we\u2019re working on is how to get through this. So I\u2019m very sympathetic to that argument but now is not the moment to enter into a pay negotiation, now is the moment for everybody to be doing their very best. Tributes are being paid to NHS staff known to have died after contracting Covid-19. Two nurses \u2013 both young mothers - five doctors and two healthcare assistants have contracted the coronavirus and died since the start of the outbreak, and there are reports of further such deaths. Nurse Areema Nasreen, 36, died just after midnight on April 2 in intensive care at Walsall Manor Hospital in the West Midlands - the hospital where she had worked for 16 years. Her sister Kazeema, 33, said: She was a legend. Everyone remembers her with so much love and heartbreak because she had so much love to give. She was like a mum to us. She looked after us all. Richard Beeken, chief executive of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, said: \u201cAny death is devastating but losing one of our own is beyond words.\u201d He said Nasreen had started at the hospital as a housekeeper in 2003 before gaining her nursing qualification in 2019. Her dedication to her role and her popularity amongst her colleagues is obvious to see with the outpouring of grief and concern we are seeing around the organisation and on social media. Her vocation in nursing was clear for all to see and she always said that she was so blessed to have the role of a nurse, which she absolutely loved because she wanted to feel like \u2018she could make a difference\u2019 - and you did, Areema, you will be very sadly missed. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, has apologised for visiting her second home despite herself issuing advice to stay at home. In a statement, she said: I wish to apologise unreservedly for the issue reported in the media today. While there are reasons for what I did, they do not justify it and they were not legitimate reasons to be out of my home. While I and my family followed the guidance on social distancing at all times, I understand that I did not follow the advice I am giving to others, and I am truly sorry for that. I know how important this advice is and I do not want my mistake to distract from that. I have a job to do as chief medical officer to provide advice to ministers on the path of this virus and to support the medical profession as they work night and day to save lives, and having spoken with the first minister this morning I will continue to focus entirely on that job. A 20-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly wiping his saliva on products in a Dorset supermarket. The man entered the Lidl store on St Andrews Road in Bridport wearing a face mask and gloves at about 2pm on Friday, Dorset Police said. He was seen to lower the mask and lick his fingers before \u201cpurposefully\u201d rubbing them onto an item in the store. The force said the individual was arrested and charged with an offence of contaminating or interfering with goods with intent under Section 38 of the Public Order Act 1986. He is due to appear before Weymouth Magistrates\u2019 Court on Monday. Dorset Police said the suspect did not have a confirmed case of Covid-19 and was not displaying any symptoms. Nursing Notes, an online publication for healthcare professionals, has announced the death of John Alagos, a 27-year-old nurse at Watford general hospital. His mother, Gina Gustilo told the Mail on Sunday that her son had not been wearing full personal protective equipment despite treating coronavirus patients. They wear PPE, but not totally protective of the mouth. They wear the normal masks. Alagos was found unconscious in his bedroom following a 12-hour night shift on Friday after complaining of suffering a headache and high temperature upon his return home, according to reports. Watford General Hospital said in a statement: Our staff are fully briefed on the symptoms of Covid-19 and we would never expect anyone to remain at work if they were showing these symptoms or indeed were unwell in any way. We have always kept our staff updated on the latest PPE guidance to make sure they have the right level of protection ... John was very popular and will be missed greatly. It did not confirm whether Alagos had died from Covid. More details will emerge in due course. Nursing Notes has launched a digital memorial mapping health and social care professionals who have lost their lives during the fight against Covid. Matt Hancock, the health secretary said the government is on track to have ventilator capacity for 18,000 patients but that it may not be in place before the expected peak of the virus. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show earlier, he said: We need to make sure we have more ventilators than there are people who need ventilation. At the moment we have between 9,000 and 10,000 ventilators within the NHS right now and we have the 2,000 spare that are critical care beds with ventilator capacity should people need to come into them and we\u2019re ramping that up. The answer is that our goal, instead of the 30,000, is that we need 18,000 ventilators over the coming two weeks. Asked how many there will be in a week\u2019s time: \u201cThere should be another 1,500.\u201d On whether the country will be below the capacity it needs in a week\u2019s time when the virus is expected to peak, Hancock said: \u201cNo, because thankfully we\u2019ve got the demand down because the vast majority of people are following their social distancing guidelines.\u201d He added there are no immediate plans to roll-out antibody testing - to test if people have had the virus and recovered - because they are \u201cnot good enough\u201d. Random testing, to provide a survey of how many people have had the virus and where, to better map the outbreak, is ongoing, Hancock said. Results of the first survey are being processed and would be made public in due course, he added. Starmer said he would support the government if they were to ban outdoor exercise due to some people flouting lockdown rules. \u201cWe do have to take whatever steps are necessary. Social distancing, staying indoors, is really difficult for people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly difficult if you don\u2019t have a garden or if you\u2019re in a flat, and I know there are many people in overcrowded accommodation. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to get through this and every time people break the guidance from the government they put other people at risk. \u201cIf the health service can\u2019t cope, people will die. You can see that that\u2019s happening every day.\u201d He added: \u201cI know it\u2019s tough, I know it\u2019s difficult, we are all missing each other, we realise how much social contact matters. \u201cBut I would support the government in this if that\u2019s what they decide to do.\u201d Starmer insisted that his party would scrutinise the government, but would not try to \u201cscore party political points\u201d. He added that prime minister Boris Johnson had allowed him one-to-one privy council meetings with experts and politicians. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to pull together, support the government where it\u2019s right to do so, but asking those difficult questions matters,\u201d said Starmer. \u201cYou can see that when the difficult questions were asked on testing, things began to move. Same thing with equipment on the frontline. \u201cScrutiny is important here. Because if scrutiny points out mistakes that can then be put right, it\u2019s an important thing. But not opposition for opposition\u2019s sake. \u201cI\u2019m not going to score party political points and I won\u2019t demand the impossible.\u201d When asked by Marr if he would consider joining a national government to deal with the crisis, Starmer reiterated the arrangements he has already made with the prime minister. Labour\u2019s newly-elected leader, Keir Starmer, told Andrew Marr that his party would ask the government \u201cdifficult questions\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI think this would be difficult for any government. I do think there have been mistakes along the way\u201d, he said. Starmer said he did not think it was worth \u201cpicking over\u201d the herd immunity approach that the government disputes ever considering. But, he added: \u201cwe were then slow in testing, the equipment that\u2019s needed on the frontline isn\u2019t there.\u201d \u201cBut I want to be very, very clear that I\u2019m going to engage constructively with the government. \u201cI spoke to the prime minister yesterday and said to him that I mean what I say about constructive engagement. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got a duty here to save lives and protect our country and the Labour party under my leadership will ask difficult questions but only for the purpose of pointing out mistakes so they can be put right.\u201d In response to some frontline NHS workers having to use items such as bin liners as protective equipment, Hancock said the government were shipping \u201ctens of millions\u201d of personal protective equipment items to the UK a day. \u201cWe\u2019ve upgraded the PPE standards. Also we\u2019ve got a system coming in to deliver against those standards using the army,\u201d he said \u201cWe\u2019re asking people to put themselves in harms way to care for others and we\u2019ve got to make sure they\u2019ve got the equipment.\u201d On Thursday, the government upgraded the standards of PPE that frontline doctors and nurses are expected to wear from aprons to gowns. Hancock said that calls to a hotline for NHS workers over the lack of protective equipment had declined, although there were \u201cabsolutely\u201d still some problems. He added that three nurses had died from Covid-19. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said the government could ban exercise outdoors if people flout lockdown rules. After saying earlier that sunbathing is against lockdown rules, he told Andrew Marr that if people flout them \u201cwe might have to take further action\u201d. \u201cI understand how difficult these measures are, of course I do. But the truth is the more people go out from home, the more the virus spreads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve said because of the positive benefits to your physical and your mental health that it\u2019s ok to exercise on your own or with members of your own household. \u201cBut if the result of that is that too many people go out and flout the other rules because they say \u2018well if I can exercise, then it\u2019s fine for me to do other things\u2019, then I\u2019m afraid we will have to take action. \u201cMy message is really clear, if you don\u2019t want us to have to take the step to ban exercise of all forms outside of your own home then you\u2019ve got to follow the rules.\u201d Axel von Trotsenburg, the World Bank managing director of operations, has warned of an impending global recession. Speaking on Marr, he said: \u201cWhat we are seeing today is unprecedented. Certainly we haven\u2019t seen something alike since the second world war and also not during the financial crisis 11 years ago.\u201d He added that during the last week, 6.6m people in the US applied for unemployment benefits, on top of 3.3m people who filed the week before. The World bank would be providing financial assistance worth $160bn to poorer countries over the next 15 months. \u201cWe need to consider that these health systems are the weakest in the world and we need to provide our full support,\u201d he added. Professor Neil Ferguson has said there are \u201csome signs\u201d that the current lockdown measures in force across the UK has slowed down the coronavirus epidemic. Ferguson, a key epidemiologist in advising the government, told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that he thinks the crisis will \u201cplateau in the next week to 10 days\u201d. Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s new deputy leader, said the party would work with the government to battle the coronavirus pandemic but would hold it to account. Speaking to Sky New\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Rayner said the government\u2019s was failing on testing, and on protecting frontline NHS staff, and ensuring businesses and employees could \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. Rayner believes she has experienced symptoms in line with those of the coronavirus including a sore throat, a temperature, a headache and fatigue. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that Matt Hancock after seven days of having the virus went out when the World Health Organisation has said that you should wait for 14 days,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to exercise that and I think it\u2019s right that we should do that.\u201d Former health secretary Alan Johnson has condemned the government\u2019s response to Covid-19. The former Labour MP told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cI am absolutely amazed at how badly prepared the government is for this.\u201d He added that during his tenure as health secretary, in which the swine flu pandemic took place in 2009, the government had a risk register. \u201cTop of our risk register was a pandemic,\u201d he said, saying that second on the list was a terror attack. He added that the basic arrangements that government\u2019s should be prepared for in the event of a pandemic was protective equipment for NHS staff, alongside testing. Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of The Doctors\u2019 Association UK, has raised concerns about the \u201csevere lack\u201d of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline NHS workers. He told Sky News that some doctors had told the association that they were having to reuse single-use surgical masks, while others were holding their breath during procedures on coronavirus patients because they didn\u2019t know if their equipment would offer enough protection. He added that some doctors, many of whom did not have symptoms in line with Covid-19 but who lived with people who did, had been sent to a NHS testing centre only to be told their name doesn\u2019t appear on a list and they couldn\u2019t be tested. The prime minister Boris Johnson is in \u201cgood spirits\u201d but still has a temperature over a week after he was diagnosed with Covid-19, according to Hancock. \u201cThe prime minister is working away inside downing street but he\u2019s making sure he protects others by following public health advice,\u201d he added. Hancock, who also contracted the virus, said he did not know if Johnson had been visited by doctors at Downing Street. Hancock said that 8% of NHS frontline staff were currently off work self-isolating amid the coronavirus outbreak. Within that group, 5.7% of doctors are currently off work. \u201cThose figures are stable but we want to get them down obviously, and one of the ways we do that is make sure testing goes up,\u201d said Hancock. Health secretary Matt Hancock is first up on Sophy Ridge on Sky News this morning, emphasising that people should not flout the coronavirus lockdown rules despite the warm weather. \u201cSunbathing is against the rules that have been set out for important public health reasons,\u201d he said, adding that it was \u201cunbelievable frankly to see some people are not following that advice\u201d. \u201cI say this to the very small minority of people who are choosing to flout the guidance you are putting other\u2019s lives at risk and you are putting yourself in harm\u2019s way.\u201d He added that the \u201cvast majority of the public\u201d were following guidance to stay at home unless they are going to buy essentials such as food or medicine, seeking medical care, going to work, or exercising. Hancock\u2019s call for the public to adhere to public health guidance comes as Lambeth Council closed Brockwell Park in south-west London on Saturday, after it claimed that more than 3,000 people had spent the day in the park, sunbathing or hanging out in large groups. I\u2019m Amy Walker, covering the liveblog for the next two hours, you can follow me on Twitter at @amyrwalker. Good morning, and welcome to Sunday\u2019s UK-focused coronavirus live blog. We\u2019ll bring you all the news as it happens, with Matt Hancock due to appear on Sophy Ridge\u2019s Sky News programme this morning along with new Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s successor Keir Starmer gives his first big interview after yesterday\u2019s victory to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr. We\u2019re also expecting the first names in his shadow cabinet to be announced. Starmer has a daunting to-do list as he begins his first full day as Labour leader. The Observer\u2019s Michael Savage has summarised the challenge ahead of him, from Covid-19 and the economy to antisemitism: Elsewhere, London mayor Sadiq Khan has described his \u201cdevastation\u201d that five London bus workers have died after testing positive for coronavirus and urged people to stay home on another sunny day. And there are troubling signs in the midlands, where the death toll has now accelerated past the capital.",

      "body": "<p>I am employed on mental health wards as a support worker, helping people recover from acute problems. It can be a very difficult but also very rewarding job. Covid-19 has not only affected general hospitals but has also had a huge impact on mental health facilities, which are more often run by a skeleton staff, as workers have had to self-isolate. On top of this we are also dealing with mental health patients infected with Covid-19, mostly with mild symptoms of the virus. As we are not considered to be on the frontline, we are not equipped with proper personal protective equipment. We get a basic face mask, gloves and a flimsy apron.</p> <p>Last Tuesday I received a letter that said I should self-isolate even from my own family due to being in a high-risk group. I opened it on returning from a 13-hour shift on a ward where there were patients with suspected Covid-19 \u2013 wearing a basic face mask, gloves and apron. We waited three weeks for those masks. Their protection efficiency is 28%. Still, I regret nothing as those patients, many with severe mental health problems, need someone to look after them.</p> <p>The letter came a bit too late. I did not expect it to come at all as I did not suspect I was in a high-risk group. I naively expected proper PPE. Now I can only count on my luck.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I read with interest and concern the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/ppe-scandal-and-the-doctors-being-rejected\" title=\"\">letter from the parents of the trainee doctor</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/02/its-time-nurses-got-the-recognition-they-deserve\" title=\"\">letters about nurses</a> (2 April). I am making a plea that, in among all the anger and frustration about the scandal that is the lack of PPE, we don\u2019t forget social workers. My son is a social worker in child protection \u2013 working with some of the most vulnerable and at-risk young people in the UK. He is still compelled to do home visits that take him into unregulated environments. His last visit was to a small two-bedroom flat in an impoverished part of London, housing a family of seven. Two members of the household sleep in the living room where the meeting took place. He has been given no advice (even after asking for it), no protection protocols and no PPE.</p> <p>This is a further scandal of neglect. We are too ready to make social workers the perennial scapegoats when things go wrong. Please let\u2019s not ignore them now when they are looking after those young people most at risk. If children are all of our future, then we must support those who care for them on our behalf \u2013 emotionally and practically. All frontline workers should have PPE.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s good that you draw attention to the crisis in care homes (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/uk-care-home-staff-at-breaking-point-as-coronavirus-cases-rise\" title=\"\">UK care home staff \u2018at breaking point\u2019 as coronavirus cases rise</a>, 31 March), but very little attention is given anywhere in the media to carers, like my daughter, who are not attached to care homes but spend all the unsociable hours God sends visiting older people in their own homes, carrying out very intimate and personal tasks without any protective equipment except their usual gloves and hand gel. And I won\u2019t mention the rates of pay, the zero-hours contracts and the worry about what happens if they become ill, financially and in relation to the risks of cross-infection.<br><strong>Maureen Stephenson</strong><br><em>Shilbottle, Northumberland</em></p> <p>\u2022 Much has been made of the tragic deaths of doctors and nurses from Covid-19, but very little of those of other healthcare professionals.

As we are not considered to be on the frontline, we are not equipped with proper personal protective equipment. We get a basic face mask, gloves and a flimsy apron. Last Tuesday I received a letter that said I should self-isolate even from my own family due to being in a high-risk group. I opened it on returning from a 13-hour shift on a ward where there were patients with suspected Covid-19 \u2013 wearing a basic face mask, gloves and apron. We waited three weeks for those masks. Their protection efficiency is 28%. Still, I regret nothing as those patients, many with severe mental health problems, need someone to look after them. The letter came a bit too late. I did not expect it to come at all as I did not suspect I was in a high-risk group. I naively expected proper PPE. Now I can only count on my luck. Name and address supplied \u2022 I read with interest and concern the letter from the parents of the trainee doctor and the letters about nurses (2 April). I am making a plea that, in among all the anger and frustration about the scandal that is the lack of PPE, we don\u2019t forget social workers. My son is a social worker in child protection \u2013 working with some of the most vulnerable and at-risk young people in the UK. He is still compelled to do home visits that take him into unregulated environments. His last visit was to a small two-bedroom flat in an impoverished part of London, housing a family of seven. Two members of the household sleep in the living room where the meeting took place. He has been given no advice (even after asking for it), no protection protocols and no PPE. This is a further scandal of neglect. We are too ready to make social workers the perennial scapegoats when things go wrong. Please let\u2019s not ignore them now when they are looking after those young people most at risk. If children are all of our future, then we must support those who care for them on our behalf \u2013 emotionally and practically. All frontline workers should have PPE. Name and address supplied \u2022 It\u2019s good that you draw attention to the crisis in care homes (UK care home staff \u2018at breaking point\u2019 as coronavirus cases rise, 31 March), but very little attention is given anywhere in the media to carers, like my daughter, who are not attached to care homes but spend all the unsociable hours God sends visiting older people in their own homes, carrying out very intimate and personal tasks without any protective equipment except their usual gloves and hand gel. And I won\u2019t mention the rates of pay, the zero-hours contracts and the worry about what happens if they become ill, financially and in relation to the risks of cross-infection. Maureen Stephenson Shilbottle, Northumberland \u2022 Much has been made of the tragic deaths of doctors and nurses from Covid-19, but very little of those of other healthcare professionals. Two healthcare assistants have succumbed to the illness (Coronavirus deaths of two nurses lead to calls for more protection, 3 April). Healthcare is multidisciplinary. The least well remunerated have the most frequent, intimate and currently dangerous contact with patients. Their passing should be better acknowledged.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps your flatmate has polished off the last beer in the fridge, diverging tastes in Netflix series have led to simmering tensions, or parental negotiations over home-schooling have descended into hostility.</p> <p>Life in lockdown can fuel family tensions, sour friendships and drive a wedge between new romantic partners who have opted to self-isolate together. Help is on hand, however.</p> <p>A former Nasa astronaut, Jay Buckey, has launched an online self-help toolkit aimed at replicating the kind of training designed to help astronauts cope with confinement in small spaces for extended periods.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s challenging to be isolated with a small group of people and to not be able to get away,\u201d said Buckey, who flew on a 16-day <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia\" title=\"Space Shuttle Columbia\">Space Shuttle Columbia</a> mission that orbited the Earth 256 times. \u201cOuter space and your own living room might be drastically different physically, but emotionally the stressors can be the same.\u201d</p> <p>The online training, called <a href=\"https://path.dartmouth.edu/\">the Dartmouth Path Program</a>, was developed to determine how the space programme can manage pressures brought on by long-duration spaceflight. It is already being tested in extreme environments such as research stations in Antarctica, but since social distancing restrictions came into force it has been made freely available to the public online.</p> <p>It includes training on conflict resolution, mood management and self-assessment tools to be able to monitor signs of anxiety and stress.</p> <p>For stress, the programme prompts the participant to consider whether they could be over-reacting, catastrophising or making judgments that don\u2019t fit the evidence. Focused breathing and muscle relaxation techniques are outlined for when you are feeling anxious or angry.</p> <p>The training also covers depression, which can set in when you feel restricted and unable to do the things that normally boost your mood, according to Buckey, who is now a professor of medicine at Dartmouth College.</p> <p>The programme encourages people to select problems and find aspects they can improve or solve and to brainstorm positive steps they can take. It encourages people to think about a single enjoyable activity that is possible to do each day. \u201cIf you focus constantly on what you can\u2019t do or things you want to do or that you\u2019re isolated, that\u2019s not good for mood,\u201d said Buckey.</p> <p>Keeping a balance between group time and private time is crucial, he said. \u201cYou need to allow people their privacy but not to allow them to become isolated and separated from a group,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone\u2019s spending all their time in their room with their door closed, that\u2019s not great. Forcing people to take part in group activities that they\u2019re just not into \u2013 that\u2019s not good either.\u201d</p> <p>According to Buckey, Nasa and other agencies now give psychological training to avoid conflict between crew members, but the problem blighted some missions in the past. The Russian cosmonaut Valentin Lebvedev, who documented his 211-day stay onboard the Space Station Salyut 7 with Anatoly Berezovoy, wrote: \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with us. We silently walk by each other, feeling offended. We have to find some way to make things better.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists on Antarctic missions have also struggled with isolation, Buckey said, pointing to the notes of Jean Rivolier, a French psychologist and chief doctor on several Antarctic expeditions, describing the dismal morale of one party in the 1990s.</p> <p>\u201cOne subject returned early to Sydney on psychological grounds, because he was homesick for his family and he became progressively more depressed,\u201d Rivolier wrote. \u201cWhen the others returned they were humourless, tired, despondent and resentful. None had found the Antarctic experience to be enjoyable, not so much from any rigours of the climate, terrain or personal hardships as from inconsiderate and selfish behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>Pete Davis, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, said the uncertain length of missions to the south pole, due to weather considerations, was challenging.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps your flatmate has polished off the last beer in the fridge, diverging tastes in Netflix series have led to simmering tensions, or parental negotiations over home-schooling have descended into hostility. Life in lockdown can fuel family tensions, sour friendships and drive a wedge between new romantic partners who have opted to self-isolate together. Help is on hand, however. A former Nasa astronaut, Jay Buckey, has launched an online self-help toolkit aimed at replicating the kind of training designed to help astronauts cope with confinement in small spaces for extended periods. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging to be isolated with a small group of people and to not be able to get away,\u201d said Buckey, who flew on a 16-day Space Shuttle Columbia mission that orbited the Earth 256 times. \u201cOuter space and your own living room might be drastically different physically, but emotionally the stressors can be the same.\u201d The online training, called the Dartmouth Path Program, was developed to determine how the space programme can manage pressures brought on by long-duration spaceflight. It is already being tested in extreme environments such as research stations in Antarctica, but since social distancing restrictions came into force it has been made freely available to the public online. It includes training on conflict resolution, mood management and self-assessment tools to be able to monitor signs of anxiety and stress. For stress, the programme prompts the participant to consider whether they could be over-reacting, catastrophising or making judgments that don\u2019t fit the evidence. Focused breathing and muscle relaxation techniques are outlined for when you are feeling anxious or angry. The training also covers depression, which can set in when you feel restricted and unable to do the things that normally boost your mood, according to Buckey, who is now a professor of medicine at Dartmouth College. The programme encourages people to select problems and find aspects they can improve or solve and to brainstorm positive steps they can take. It encourages people to think about a single enjoyable activity that is possible to do each day. \u201cIf you focus constantly on what you can\u2019t do or things you want to do or that you\u2019re isolated, that\u2019s not good for mood,\u201d said Buckey. Keeping a balance between group time and private time is crucial, he said. \u201cYou need to allow people their privacy but not to allow them to become isolated and separated from a group,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone\u2019s spending all their time in their room with their door closed, that\u2019s not great. Forcing people to take part in group activities that they\u2019re just not into \u2013 that\u2019s not good either.\u201d According to Buckey, Nasa and other agencies now give psychological training to avoid conflict between crew members, but the problem blighted some missions in the past. The Russian cosmonaut Valentin Lebvedev, who documented his 211-day stay onboard the Space Station Salyut 7 with Anatoly Berezovoy, wrote: \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with us. We silently walk by each other, feeling offended. We have to find some way to make things better.\u201d Scientists on Antarctic missions have also struggled with isolation, Buckey said, pointing to the notes of Jean Rivolier, a French psychologist and chief doctor on several Antarctic expeditions, describing the dismal morale of one party in the 1990s. \u201cOne subject returned early to Sydney on psychological grounds, because he was homesick for his family and he became progressively more depressed,\u201d Rivolier wrote. \u201cWhen the others returned they were humourless, tired, despondent and resentful. None had found the Antarctic experience to be enjoyable, not so much from any rigours of the climate, terrain or personal hardships as from inconsiderate and selfish behaviour.\u201d Pete Davis, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, said the uncertain length of missions to the south pole, due to weather considerations, was challenging. The \u201cworst thing to do\u201d, he said, was to focus on when isolation would end. \u201cThe best thing to avoid is what\u2019s going to happen in three months time when you\u2019ve only just started,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you can control is what\u2019s going to happen today or tomorrow.\u201d Davis, who returned from a three-month Antarctic mission in February only to be plunged back into confinement at home, advised that simple, considerate gestures could help ensure harmony. \u201cIn Antarctica, full-blown conflict doesn\u2019t tend to happen, but the small niggle of \u2018that\u2019s so annoying\u2019 does,\u201d he said. \u201cJust things like if you\u2019re going to make a cup of tea, make sure you ask everyone as well. It\u2019s such a minor thing but it can get under people\u2019s skin.\u201d",

Neville wrote on Twitter: \u201cHey @MattHancock seeing as though you\u2019re focusing on football so much can you come on @SkySportsMNF this week? Special edition . Questions from the football community / fans will be presented by me , @DavidJonesSky and @Carra23.\u201d The Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, is behind plans to establish a coronavirus fund that will allow players to donate directly to frontline NHS staff. Players want to be sure clubs are not opportunistically looking to save money by reducing their pay. They have sought assurances the money will protect lower-paid colleagues and would also like owners and directors to make the same commitment. There is confusion over where the money is going. The feeling is there would be no benefit to society if the wages are simply going back to the clubs rather than to charities and frontline services. There are many examples of players doing their bit, such as Manchester United\u2019s Marcus Rashford raising \u00a320m to provide meals for vulnerable children, and the rush to accuse footballers of being out of touch has led to a backlash. Wayne Rooney, who plays for Derby, used his Sunday Times column to accuse the government and the Premier League of putting footballers in a \u201cno-win situation\u201d. Neville, the former United and England defender, was equally critical, saying the league took too long to postpone matches and taking aim at clubs who have already used the furlough scheme. Clubs are also in an unenviable position. They have told players the Premier League faces a financial penalty of more than \u00a3750m if the season does not resume and broadcasters demand refunds on games that are not played. They will also suffer losses in gate receipts if games are played behind closed doors and are unable to start selling next year\u2019s season-tickets. The clubs are frustrated their concerns are not being taken seriously by the PFA, with one executive privately questioning whether Gordon Taylor, the head of the union, plans to take a pay cut. The situation is complicated by doubts over when the season will resume. While a solution will need to be found for players whose contracts run out in June, it is also understood some players could have reservations over returning to action because of health and fitness concerns.",

Thomas-Symonds, the MP for the Welsh seat of Torfaen since 2015, was previously a security minister in the shadow home affairs team. Dodds, the Oxford East MP, is a former MEP and has spent nearly three years as a shadow Treasury minister. Among the other appointments, Angela Rayner, the newly elected deputy leader, was also made the Labour party chair. There was a return to the shadow cabinet for Rachel Reeves, the Leeds West MP who was shadow work and pensions minister under Ed Miliband but who spent the entire Corbyn period on the backbenches. She was made shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Jonathan Ashworth remains in the health brief, as was widely expected given the coronavirus pandemic, with Nick Brown staying as chief whip and Angela Smith as shadow Lords leader. Barry Gardiner, Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery were confirmed as having left the shadow cabinet, having served as shadow international trade secretary, shadow Cabinet Office minister and party chair respectively. Trickett tweeted to say Starmer had \u201cpolitely asked me to stand down\u201d. Emily Thornberry, previously shadow foreign secretary, will stay in the shadow cabinet in a new position to be announced on Monday. Nandy\u2019s elevation was the one surprise amid the most senior appointments, with a series of newspapers having tipped the Cardiff MP Jo Stevens as being lined up for the post. While Nandy, the MP for Wigan since 2010, came a third in the leadership race, she emerged during the campaign as a leading voice in promoting Labour efforts to reconnect with voters in struggling towns in the north and Midlands. Nandy\u2019s mantra during the campaign was that Labour must \u201cchange or die\u201d. On foreign affairs she was critical of what she said was the disinclination of Corbyn and his team to criticise Russia, and she called for a more positive defence of international values. In a tweet following the news, Nandy wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s a real honour to be tasked with leading Labour\u2019s foreign policy response in these difficult times.\u201d Starmer said that under his leadership the priority would be to \u201cact in the country\u2019s interest to save lives and protect livelihoods\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe will be a responsible opposition that supports the government where we believe they are right and challenge them when we believe mistakes are being made,\u201d he said. Asked about his plans earlier in the day, Starmer told BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that his shadow cabinet would be \u201cbalanced across the party, it will be balanced across the country \u2013 and of course it will be balanced in terms of diversity\u201d.

As the police were called, the marquess apparently told them: \u201cYou sort it out, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p> <p>He was born Alexander Thynne in London, the eldest son and second child of Henry, Viscount Weymouth, who would become the 6th Marquess of Bath, and his first wife, Daphne, the daughter of the 4th Baron Vivian. Thynnes had lived at Longleat since before 1567, when the house replaced an earlier priory. They claimed descent from Alfred the Great and, less reliably, from the Roman historian Tacitus. Asked by a footman as a small child what he wanted to be when he grew up, Alexander answered: \u201cLord Bath, of course.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander did not get on with his father, whose own eccentricities extended to collecting Adolf Hitler memorabilia and he claimed that he was frequently beaten by his father with a riding crop as a teenager.</p> <p>Raised largely by a nanny at a house in the grounds of Longleat and at the family\u2019s London home in Tite Street, Chelsea, Alexander was educated at Eton and then Christ Church, Oxford, where he chaired the male-only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/07/oxford-bullingdon-club-boris-johnson-sexism-violence-bullying-culture\" title=\"\">Bullingdon Club</a>, largely reserved for the aristocracy and the very wealthy.

After leaving the army, the young viscount entered his lifelong hippy phase.</p> <p>By then Longleat was already famous as a tourist attraction \u2013 one of the first stately homes to be opened to the public in an attempt by the 6th Marquess to pay off the \u00a3700,000 bill for death duties left by the sudden demise of his father in 1946. In its first year of opening, 1949, the house received more than 135,000 visitors and its fame increased in 1966 when a 100-acre drive-through safari park stocked with lions was added to its attractions.</p> <p>Alexander took over the running of the estate as early as 1958, while his younger brother, <a href=\"http://guardsmagazine.com/obits/obits_17Autumn_01Thynne.html\" title=\"\">Christopher</a>, was put in charge of the house. On the 6th Marquess\u2019s death in 1992, Alexander promptly sacked his brother and evicted him from his house on the estate. He enjoyed the publicity that came with running Longleat: \u201cSometimes I leap out and pretend to be a lion!\u201d he said in 2003. \u201c[Visitors] appear very pleased that they have had a chance to see me. It\u2019s very entertaining, particularly if I talk about myself.\u201d</p> <p>From the 1960s he had started <a href=\"http://www.lordbath.co.uk/Murals\" title=\"\">decorating the house with his paintings</a>, achieving a nobbly texture from mixing sawdust and paint and creating enormous mural-like works with titles such as Heaven and Hell (in the kitchens), Night and Day, My Early Life and, most notorious of all, a creation called Kama Sutra in a bedroom. The work showed at least 20 couples engaged in vigorous and varied sexual activities \u2013 \u201cMade \u2019em all up myself,\u201d he said. \u201cJust my imagination.\u201d The room was opened for public viewing in 1969 but was rapidly closed down by the police.</p> <p>Perhaps fortunately, the paintings were created on removable boards, but when Alexander\u2019s son, Ceawlin, took over Longleat in 2010 and moved some of the works into storage, replacing the decor with plain white walls, his father was appalled.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my life\u2019s work and he\u2019s quietly binned it,\u201d he said in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s killed my relationship with him and I don\u2019t feel inclined to pay any interest in his wedding.\u201d</p> <p>That wedding, to the Anglo-Nigerian model and chef Emma McQuiston, caused ructions after the viscount\u2019s mother, Anna, apparently questioned the dilution of \u201c400 years of bloodline\u201d because of the bride\u2019s mixed-race ancestry.</p> <p>As a result Anna was barred from the wedding at Longleat, with security guards posted to keep her out. The marquess and his wife decamped instead to another wedding in Hampshire. Afterwards he retreated to an apartment in the upper storey of Longleat house and rarely saw, or spoke to, his son.</p> <p>He spent many years writing his autobiography, Strictly Private, which was originally planned for 19 volumes. However, only four were issued; publishers were possibly daunted by the knowledge that he claimed to have written 6m words and had still only reached the year 1991. A novel, Pillars of the Establishment, featuring a marquess and two sons who all contracted venereal disease from the same woman, was published in the early 80s.</p> <p>The marquess stood twice unsuccessfully for parliament in the 70s as a candidate for the Wessex Regionalists party, and sat in the Lords as a Liberal Democrat until the Labour reforms in 1999 deprived him of a seat in the upper chamber.</p> <p>He is survived by Anna, their son, Ceawlin, who now becomes the 8th Marquess, and daughter, Lenka, and a further daughter born in 2000 whose paternity he acknowledged.</p> <p>\u2022 Alexander George Thynn, 7th Marquess of Bath, born 6 May 1932; died 4 April 2020</p>",

Asked by a footman as a small child what he wanted to be when he grew up, Alexander answered: \u201cLord Bath, of course.\u201d Alexander did not get on with his father, whose own eccentricities extended to collecting Adolf Hitler memorabilia and he claimed that he was frequently beaten by his father with a riding crop as a teenager. Raised largely by a nanny at a house in the grounds of Longleat and at the family\u2019s London home in Tite Street, Chelsea, Alexander was educated at Eton and then Christ Church, Oxford, where he chaired the male-only Bullingdon Club, largely reserved for the aristocracy and the very wealthy. In 1953, his parents went through a bitter divorce when their son was 21. He did his national service as an officer in the Life Guards, where he won the army\u2019s welterweight boxing championship for officers and dropped the last \u201ce\u201d from his surname in a vain attempt to disguise his family ties. After leaving the army, the young viscount entered his lifelong hippy phase. By then Longleat was already famous as a tourist attraction \u2013 one of the first stately homes to be opened to the public in an attempt by the 6th Marquess to pay off the \u00a3700,000 bill for death duties left by the sudden demise of his father in 1946. In its first year of opening, 1949, the house received more than 135,000 visitors and its fame increased in 1966 when a 100-acre drive-through safari park stocked with lions was added to its attractions. Alexander took over the running of the estate as early as 1958, while his younger brother, Christopher, was put in charge of the house. On the 6th Marquess\u2019s death in 1992, Alexander promptly sacked his brother and evicted him from his house on the estate. He enjoyed the publicity that came with running Longleat: \u201cSometimes I leap out and pretend to be a lion!\u201d he said in 2003. \u201c[Visitors] appear very pleased that they have had a chance to see me. It\u2019s very entertaining, particularly if I talk about myself.\u201d From the 1960s he had started decorating the house with his paintings, achieving a nobbly texture from mixing sawdust and paint and creating enormous mural-like works with titles such as Heaven and Hell (in the kitchens), Night and Day, My Early Life and, most notorious of all, a creation called Kama Sutra in a bedroom. The work showed at least 20 couples engaged in vigorous and varied sexual activities \u2013 \u201cMade \u2019em all up myself,\u201d he said. \u201cJust my imagination.\u201d The room was opened for public viewing in 1969 but was rapidly closed down by the police. Perhaps fortunately, the paintings were created on removable boards, but when Alexander\u2019s son, Ceawlin, took over Longleat in 2010 and moved some of the works into storage, replacing the decor with plain white walls, his father was appalled. \u201cIt\u2019s my life\u2019s work and he\u2019s quietly binned it,\u201d he said in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s killed my relationship with him and I don\u2019t feel inclined to pay any interest in his wedding.\u201d That wedding, to the Anglo-Nigerian model and chef Emma McQuiston, caused ructions after the viscount\u2019s mother, Anna, apparently questioned the dilution of \u201c400 years of bloodline\u201d because of the bride\u2019s mixed-race ancestry. As a result Anna was barred from the wedding at Longleat, with security guards posted to keep her out. The marquess and his wife decamped instead to another wedding in Hampshire. Afterwards he retreated to an apartment in the upper storey of Longleat house and rarely saw, or spoke to, his son. He spent many years writing his autobiography, Strictly Private, which was originally planned for 19 volumes. However, only four were issued; publishers were possibly daunted by the knowledge that he claimed to have written 6m words and had still only reached the year 1991. A novel, Pillars of the Establishment, featuring a marquess and two sons who all contracted venereal disease from the same woman, was published in the early 80s. The marquess stood twice unsuccessfully for parliament in the 70s as a candidate for the Wessex Regionalists party, and sat in the Lords as a Liberal Democrat until the Labour reforms in 1999 deprived him of a seat in the upper chamber. He is survived by Anna, their son, Ceawlin, who now becomes the 8th Marquess, and daughter, Lenka, and a further daughter born in 2000 whose paternity he acknowledged. \u2022 Alexander George Thynn, 7th Marquess of Bath, born 6 May 1932; died 4 April 2020",

      "body": "<p>I have been playing a song about life and death on a loop today. While waiting to interview Will Miller, the former Spurs and Burton Albion footballer who wrote and sang the song just days after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/21/ugo-ehiogu-warrior-gentle-giant\" title=\"\">death of Ugo Ehiogu</a>, his former coach who died in April 2017 aged 44, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8eYk4D9Lua8\" title=\"\">the ghostly video of Crash Landing</a> has been spooling out of my laptop. On a muted, sun-kissed afternoon, it offers a melancholic and beautiful soundtrack for these unsettling times.</p> <p>For Miller, Ehiogu\u2019s death felt like \u201ca crash landing on the moon\u201d. Three years on, trying to adjust to our new isolated reality with illness and death all around us, life continues in an eerie way. \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Miller says. \u201cBut sometimes you have to switch course. I remember being absolutely certain I was going to play first-team football for Tottenham. When I realised it wouldn\u2019t happen, it was like killing an idea of myself. The person I thought I was going to be was dead. I needed to reinvent myself.

      "bodyText": "I have been playing a song about life and death on a loop today. While waiting to interview Will Miller, the former Spurs and Burton Albion footballer who wrote and sang the song just days after the death of Ugo Ehiogu, his former coach who died in April 2017 aged 44, the ghostly video of Crash Landing has been spooling out of my laptop. On a muted, sun-kissed afternoon, it offers a melancholic and beautiful soundtrack for these unsettling times. For Miller, Ehiogu\u2019s death felt like \u201ca crash landing on the moon\u201d. Three years on, trying to adjust to our new isolated reality with illness and death all around us, life continues in an eerie way. \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Miller says. \u201cBut sometimes you have to switch course. I remember being absolutely certain I was going to play first-team football for Tottenham. When I realised it wouldn\u2019t happen, it was like killing an idea of myself. The person I thought I was going to be was dead. I needed to reinvent myself. I found it really difficult and it reminds me of the challenges we\u2019re all facing right now.\u201d From sadness and uncertainty, the 23-year-old engenders optimism and hope as he stresses how art thrives in adversity. \u201cDespite the pain and confusion, storytelling will always play a big part in our lives. In my own experience so many beautiful emotions have come out of difficult times. This time could be a chance for people to do something different. Something better.\u201d Miller\u2019s dream of becoming a star for Spurs, the club he had supported since he was a boy and for whom he played in their academy and development teams for six years, was replaced by Championship football for Burton. \u201cIt felt brutal at 21,\u201d he says. \u201cFootball is so cut-throat. You dedicate everything to that one craft and then someone goes: \u2018We\u2019re not having you.\u2019 At Tottenham I worked it out before they told me. I had an amazing relationship with the club but it wasn\u2019t working.\u201d He did well in the Championship but a bad injury changed everything. Miller fought his way back into Burton\u2019s first team but a year ago this month he decided he no longer wanted to be a professional footballer. He buried that identity in order to become a film-maker and musician. Miller captures the joy of football as well as the fascination of playing pre-season first-team games for Spurs under Mauricio Pochettino but his happiness in his new world is more vivid. It is a reminder that, from the remnants of a past life, something deeper can flourish. These ideas are rooted in Crash Landing. \u201cUgo was an amazing man,\u201d Miller says of the former England footballer who was his under-23 manager at Tottenham. \u201cWe worked with him day in and day out. He was super-concentrated and so gifted. Because he was an ex-player, and because of his personality, he was one of us.\u201d Miller pauses as he recalls Ehiogu\u2019s death from a heart attack. \u201cUgo was the first person I had ever been close to who passed away. I was thinking: \u2018Oh, my God, life\u2019s so fragile.\u2019 I was on loan at Burton and I tried to carry on as normal and train but there was too much shock.

But last June we shot the video and it was an amazing experience again as 45 people, family and friends, were in it.\u201d As a little boy Miller won a BBC nationwide audition for the role of Oliver Twist \u2013 and acted alongside Tom Hardy and Sophie Okonedo. But football meant more to him. When he was 14, and with Leyton Orient, he was offered a year\u2019s trial at Tottenham.

Beyond all the uncertainty and worry it\u2019s a time for reflection and appreciation of each other. Hopefully, out of these dark days, something special can still emerge.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The career of Bill Withers, who has died aged 81 of heart complications, followed an unusual trajectory. He did not try to enter the music industry until after he had spent nine years in the US Navy, leaving the service in 1965 and moving to Los Angeles two years later. By the time he released his debut album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbbwiE2GgkE&amp;list=PL94gOvpr5yt0ZTCb-BSB9yffdRgosvzat\" title=\"\">Just As I Am</a>, in 1971 he was 33, an age at which many pop careers have already been and gone.</p> <p>But Withers made up for lost time. His album was packed with memorable songs, including Harlem and Grandma\u2019s Hands, and entered the US Top 40. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CICIOJqEb5c\" title=\"\">Ain\u2019t No Sunshine</a>, his first single, reached No 3 and became one of the landmark songs in his career, despite lasting a scant two minutes. Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/16/blake-edwards-obituary\" title=\"\">Blake Edwards</a>\u2019 gruelling 1962 film about alcoholism, Days of Wine and Roses, it has become an enduring anthem of loneliness and heartbreak.</p> <p>His second album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpwHeCLAO3M&amp;list=PL94gOvpr5yt0yjw5N1_g8hfmp-BxacIDz\" title=\"\">Still Bill</a> (1972), was another formidable collection (Rolling Stone called it \u201ca stone-soul masterpiece\u201d). It reached No 4 on the US album chart and gave Withers a No 2 hit with Use Me, as well as his sole chart-topping single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOZ-MySzAac\" title=\"\">Lean on Me</a>. This was an ode to the power of friendship conceived with the simplicity of a gospel classic, apparently the work of an artist in complete control of his music and his destiny. In October 1974 he performed in Zaire with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/dec/26/guardianobituaries.usa\" title=\"\">James Brown</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/20/etta-james\" title=\"\">Etta James</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/15/bb-king-obituary-mississippi-farmhand-blues-legend\" title=\"\">BB King</a>, in the run-up to the fabled Rumble in the Jungle world heavyweight fight between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-obituary\" title=\"\">Muhammad Ali</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/george-foreman\" title=\"\">George Foreman</a>.</p> <p>However, what looked like incipient megastardom never came to fruition. After the demise of his original record label, Sussex, Withers was signed to Columbia, where he was never comfortable and felt nothing but contempt for what he considered to be the company\u2019s narrow-minded executives. Though he notched up two more definitive hit singles, the serene and mantra-like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeaS6fuUoA\" title=\"\">Lovely Day</a> (1977) and the hook-up with the saxophonist Grover Washington Jr on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ccik3Fz_Lw\" title=\"\">Just the Two of Us</a> (1981), his sales tailed off.</p> <p>However, it was to Withers\u2019 advantage that he had never considered music his sole purpose in life. \u201cThe business came to me in my 30s,\u201d he later reflected. \u201cI was socialised as a regular guy. I never felt like I owned it or it owned me.\u201d</p> <p>His naval experience had given him self-confidence as well as the skills required of an aircraft mechanic. Before he signed a recording deal he supported himself by working at a variety of aircraft factories in California, paying to make his own demo recordings at night. Emerging from the other end of his music career, he never looked back. He focused on building a property portfolio in partnership with his second wife, Marcia, whom he married in 1976, while raising their children, Todd and Kori. Marcia also supervised the running of his music publishing company \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m lucky I married a woman with an MBA,\u201d he pointed out.</p> <p>Born in Slab Fork, West Virginia, Bill was the youngest of six children of William Harrison Withers Sr, a coal miner, and his wife, Mattie. They divorced when Bill was three, and William Sr died when he was 13. Growing up in poverty, Withers heard whatever music happened to catch his attention. \u201cMostly country music,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd there was music in church, and whatever they taught you at school. And then there was the old Frank Sinatra \u2013 Nat King Cole genre type music. So whatever I could stand to listen to, I listened to.\u201d He remembered singing a capella gospel music, \u201cbecause that\u2019s something we could do without owning any instruments.\u201dHe had been born with a severe stutter: \u201cPeople laughed right in my face when I was trying to say something.\u201d At 17 he joined the navy and a speech therapy course organised by one of his commanding officers helped him to overcome it.

Numerous poorer performing retailers, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/03/debenhams-prepares-to-file-for-bankruptcy-coronavirus\">Debenhams</a> and vintage-inspired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/05/cath-kidston-to-call-in-administrators-amid-coronavirus-lockdown\">retailer Cath Kidston</a>, are on the verge of collapse.</p> <p>Many brands continue to trade online. But some, including Next and Moss Bros, have been forced to close even those operations because of difficulties in protecting workers picking and packing goods in warehouses from infection. Even those companies able to sell online have seen a big slump in orders as the nation lives in its pyjamas and sweat pants during the lockdown.</p> <p>One distribution firm estimated that warehouse space across the UK was more than 90% full and inquiries for emergency clothing storage were up by a quarter ahead of Easter, usually a strong sales period.</p> <p>Suppliers and warehouse operators said there were urgent negotiations about how to house about two weeks worth of stock currently on container ships heading for the UK.</p> <p>One major high street clothing supplier told the Guardian: \u201cSpring/summer season has been cancelled. People will try to reuse stock next year but they will have to slash prices to try and generate cash and some styles will no longer be relevant.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be containers being docked at [ports] for a fee of \u00a3120 a day. All sorts of measures will be taken, because it\u2019s a desperate time.\u201d</p> <p>Another industry insider agreed that discounting was unlikely to clear stock. \u201cNo one buys T-shirts in the winter. The industry has lost a season,\u201d the source said.</p> <p>In the past week it has emerged that both Debenhams and Cath Kidston are preparing to call in administrators, putting thousands of jobs at risk in the already battered retail sector.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/jul/04/cath-kidston-design-business-new-venture\">Cath Kidston</a>, which has 60 stores in the UK and a further 180 overseas, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators, a legal process which protects the business from creditors for 10 working days, as it considers potential rescue options. The company employs 941 people in the UK, 820 of whom were furloughed on 22 March under the government scheme.</p> <p>Advisory firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal (A&amp;M) was appointed last month to help Cath Kidston seek a buyer as the British brand, which opened its first store in 1993, struggled to make a profit for its Hong Kong-based owner Baring Private Equity Asia.</p> <p>Cath Kidston Group has been in difficulties for some time, recording a pretax loss of \u00a342.3m in the year to the end of March 2018 when sales rose just 1.2% and it closed small retail businesses in France and Spain.</p> <p>Coronavirus lockdowns in the UK and elsewhere have only added to the difficulties and it is understood that even if a buyer is found, the rescue is likely to involve a pre-pack administration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A Cath Kidston spokesperson said: \u201cThe notice of intention forms part of the process by which Cath Kidston is continuing to work with A&amp;M to explore all options for the company in the current climate.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/debenhams\">Debenhams</a> is preparing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/03/debenhams-prepares-to-file-for-bankruptcy-coronavirus\">call in administrators</a> after the struggling department store was forced to close all its outlets under the lockdown while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green\">Sir Phi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green\">lip Green</a>\u2019s Arcadia Group, the owner of Topshop and Miss Selfridge, is expected to permanently close hundreds of stores as it suffers from competition from the likes of Asos, Boohoo and Primark.</p> <p>The lockdown has added to existing pressures on retailers from the consumer switch to online shopping and rising costs from business rates coupled with the fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 Brexit vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Fashion brands have been hit particularly hard as young people switch from spending on outfits to alternatives such as digital subscriptions and mobile phones.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fashion retailers and their suppliers are braced for a massive shake-out of the industry as an estimated \u00a310bn of clothing piles up in warehouses during the coronavirus lockdown. Retail insiders said major firms including Primark, Peacocks, Arcadia and Next had all stopped taking deliveries to their warehouses because they had no more room. Numerous poorer performing retailers, including Debenhams and vintage-inspired retailer Cath Kidston, are on the verge of collapse. Many brands continue to trade online. But some, including Next and Moss Bros, have been forced to close even those operations because of difficulties in protecting workers picking and packing goods in warehouses from infection. Even those companies able to sell online have seen a big slump in orders as the nation lives in its pyjamas and sweat pants during the lockdown. One distribution firm estimated that warehouse space across the UK was more than 90% full and inquiries for emergency clothing storage were up by a quarter ahead of Easter, usually a strong sales period. Suppliers and warehouse operators said there were urgent negotiations about how to house about two weeks worth of stock currently on container ships heading for the UK. One major high street clothing supplier told the Guardian: \u201cSpring/summer season has been cancelled. People will try to reuse stock next year but they will have to slash prices to try and generate cash and some styles will no longer be relevant. \u201cThere will be containers being docked at [ports] for a fee of \u00a3120 a day. All sorts of measures will be taken, because it\u2019s a desperate time.\u201d Another industry insider agreed that discounting was unlikely to clear stock. \u201cNo one buys T-shirts in the winter. The industry has lost a season,\u201d the source said. In the past week it has emerged that both Debenhams and Cath Kidston are preparing to call in administrators, putting thousands of jobs at risk in the already battered retail sector. Cath Kidston, which has 60 stores in the UK and a further 180 overseas, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators, a legal process which protects the business from creditors for 10 working days, as it considers potential rescue options. The company employs 941 people in the UK, 820 of whom were furloughed on 22 March under the government scheme. Advisory firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal (A&amp;M) was appointed last month to help Cath Kidston seek a buyer as the British brand, which opened its first store in 1993, struggled to make a profit for its Hong Kong-based owner Baring Private Equity Asia. Cath Kidston Group has been in difficulties for some time, recording a pretax loss of \u00a342.3m in the year to the end of March 2018 when sales rose just 1.2% and it closed small retail businesses in France and Spain. Coronavirus lockdowns in the UK and elsewhere have only added to the difficulties and it is understood that even if a buyer is found, the rescue is likely to involve a pre-pack administration. A Cath Kidston spokesperson said: \u201cThe notice of intention forms part of the process by which Cath Kidston is continuing to work with A&amp;M to explore all options for the company in the current climate.\u201d Debenhams is preparing to call in administrators after the struggling department store was forced to close all its outlets under the lockdown while Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, the owner of Topshop and Miss Selfridge, is expected to permanently close hundreds of stores as it suffers from competition from the likes of Asos, Boohoo and Primark. The lockdown has added to existing pressures on retailers from the consumer switch to online shopping and rising costs from business rates coupled with the fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 Brexit vote. Fashion brands have been hit particularly hard as young people switch from spending on outfits to alternatives such as digital subscriptions and mobile phones.",

Following claims of disagreements between the Department of Health and Social Care and both NHS England and Public Health England (PHE) over difficulties in rolling out more tests for the virus, the health service took the unusual step of calling the reports \u201cfactually wrong\u201d. Meanwhile, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, dismissed the idea that he and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had disagreed over when to end the lockdown. The reports capped a difficult week for the government after criticism over the slow pace of testing and the provision of protective equipment for NHS and care staff. The nadir came on Wednesday when a stumbling performance by Alok Sharma, the business secretary, prompted even some loyal newspapers to lead their next day\u2019s editions with talk of chaos. The following day Hancock emerged from seven days of isolation because of coronavirus symptoms to pledge that 100,000 tests a day would be carried out by the end of the month, a target he conceded on Sunday would be hard to achieve. In a story alleging widespread splits within government and between ministers and various agencies, the Sunday Times said ministers were blaming NHS England and PHE over the delays in supplying protective equipment and for taking an over-centralist, controlling attitude towards private laboratories helping with tests. NHS bosses are believed to be particularly annoyed at the claim they are unwilling to work with the private sector, pointing to a deal made last month to work with private hospitals to share the burden. An NHS England spokesman said the claims were \u201cfactually wrong\u201d, saying NHS hospital labs had done the testing they had been asked to do, focused on patients and staff, and that mass testing would always have needed outside help. NHS England \u201chas itself rapidly engaged with the private sector in areas for which it has responsibility, as evidenced by a deal to redeploy almost all independent hospitals across England to help with the expected surge of coronavirus patients\u201d, the spokesman said. \u201cThis means another 20,000 staff, 8,000 more beds and an extra 1,000 ventilators can all be used in this battle.\u201d They added: \u201cThe NHS in partnership with the military has acted in record time to establish new Nightingale hospitals in London and now in four other regions across the country.

Asked on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show whether he had fallen out with the new chancellor, Hancock said: \u201cNo, we\u2019re working very closely together and what matters is that we can get out of this as fast as possible.\u201d Hancock added: \u201cI think that Rishi is doing an absolutely brilliant job as chancellor, the measures that he\u2019s put in place to support businesses, to support people, self-employed people and employed people are absolutely phenomenal, and in fact he has been lauded around the world for the first-class economic response we have got in this country.\u201d",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, Biden, 77, sequestered at home in Wilmington, Delaware, was asked if he would wear a mask.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important to follow the science, listen to the experts do what they tell you.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, 73, said \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself\u201d and added that he was \u201cfeeling good\u201d.</p> <p>The wearing of masks is recommended as a way to stop people who have the virus but may not be showing symptoms from infecting others.</p> <p>Trump ploughed on: \u201cSomehow, sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Biden responded: \u201c[Trump] may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is \u2026 follow the science. That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us. So if I go out in public, and I have not gone to commercial places of late, I haven\u2019t gone to my local church \u2026 but my generic point is that you should follow the science.\u201d</p> <p>Biden also described preparations the Obama administration took to handle any pandemic, moves he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> had dismantled.</p> <p>\u201cWe did a lot to prepare,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know \u2026 we set up a pandemic office within the White House, we expanded CDC in other countries so we could in fact, observe, see when things were coming, how things were moving.</p> <p>\u201cWe put people in China. I mean we did a whole lot of things, and they got a very detailed breakdown on this by a briefing, the Trump administration, when we transitioned out of office, but the president dismantled almost all of that and he drastically cut the budget for the CDC \u2026 so he didn\u2019t follow through on any of what we suggested was going to be a real problem.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do much better than [what is] being done now.\u201d</p> <p>Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Jay Inslee, governor of Washington state where the virus first took hold on US soil, slammed Trump over the White House response.</p> <p>\u201cThis is ludicrous that we do not have a national effort in this,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cTo say [the federal government is] a backup\u201d \u2013 as Trump has repeatedly said this week \u201c\u2026Can you imagine if Franklin Roosevelt said: \u2018I\u2019ll be right behind you Connecticut, good luck building those battleships\u2019?</p> <p>\u201cIf he wants to be a wartime president, be a wartime president.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden will wear a mask if he goes out in public, the former vice-president and probable Democratic presidential nominee said on Sunday. Donald Trump said on Friday he would not wear a mask, despite new guidelines issued by the White House that day \u2013 and announced from the Briefing Room podium by the president \u2013 for people to wear face coverings in public places. In an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week, Biden also defended his work as vice-president in the Obama administration in terms of preparing for such a pandemic. Trump has repeatedly sought to blame his predecessor for the federal government\u2019s slow and disjointed response to the arrival on US soil of Covid-19, the virus which by Sunday had infected more than 312,000 Americans and killed nearly 8,500. At the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters \u201cthe [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure\u201d. But he added: \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d In an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, Biden, 77, sequestered at home in Wilmington, Delaware, was asked if he would wear a mask. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important to follow the science, listen to the experts do what they tell you.\u201d Trump, 73, said \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself\u201d and added that he was \u201cfeeling good\u201d. The wearing of masks is recommended as a way to stop people who have the virus but may not be showing symptoms from infecting others. Trump ploughed on: \u201cSomehow, sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d Biden responded: \u201c[Trump] may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is \u2026 follow the science. That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us. So if I go out in public, and I have not gone to commercial places of late, I haven\u2019t gone to my local church \u2026 but my generic point is that you should follow the science.\u201d Biden also described preparations the Obama administration took to handle any pandemic, moves he said Trump had dismantled. \u201cWe did a lot to prepare,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know \u2026 we set up a pandemic office within the White House, we expanded CDC in other countries so we could in fact, observe, see when things were coming, how things were moving. \u201cWe put people in China. I mean we did a whole lot of things, and they got a very detailed breakdown on this by a briefing, the Trump administration, when we transitioned out of office, but the president dismantled almost all of that and he drastically cut the budget for the CDC \u2026 so he didn\u2019t follow through on any of what we suggested was going to be a real problem. \u201cWe can do much better than [what is] being done now.\u201d Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Jay Inslee, governor of Washington state where the virus first took hold on US soil, slammed Trump over the White House response. \u201cThis is ludicrous that we do not have a national effort in this,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cTo say [the federal government is] a backup\u201d \u2013 as Trump has repeatedly said this week \u201c\u2026Can you imagine if Franklin Roosevelt said: \u2018I\u2019ll be right behind you Connecticut, good luck building those battleships\u2019? \u201cIf he wants to be a wartime president, be a wartime president. Show some leadership. Mobilize the industrial base of the United States, that\u2019s what we need.\u201d On ABC, Biden also weighed in on the controversial dismissal of the US navy captain Brett Crozier, calling it \u201cclose to criminal\u201d. Capt Crozier was removed from command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt this week after he wrote a memo about concerns for his crew on the aircraft carrier with coronavirus cases aboard. Capt Crozier was cheered from the ship but on Saturday Trump criticized him for writing the letter. \u201cI thought it was terrible what he did, to write a letter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a class on literature.

Esper also dismissed reports that, as the Washington Post put it, Modly \u201ctold one colleague [on] Wednesday, the day before he announced the move: \u2018Breaking news: Trump wants him fired\u2019.\u201d Biden said it was \u201cclose to criminal the way they\u2019re dealing with this guy.

My staff were worried too.\u201d</p> \n<p>People rely on the bakeries and he did not want to let the community down so came up with a plan to deliver bread instead. Five bakers work overnight and bag up rolls and bread that is then taken by one driver to 20 surrounding villages. Each village has a designated weekly delivery day.</p> \n<p>Reeve relies on local businesses that have been temporarily forced to close, such as the Wyndham Arms pub in Dinton, to organise orders. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be done without the village coordinators,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe landlady, Mary Gibbens, takes customer orders and card payments over the phone and we drop off once a week and people in the village collect from her.

      "bodyText": "The sight of UK supermarket shelves being stripped bare in a matter of days and farmers warning that lack of workers could cause produce to go to waste has highlighted how quickly food supply chains can be disrupted. Though supermarkets have introduced rationing and panic buying appears to be on the wane, there is lingering uncertainty about what to expect in the weeks and months ahead. Some food producers and suppliers have acted quickly and creatively to try to ensure fresh food remains available across the UK. Here are some of the people and grassroots initiatives trying to make a difference. The community group Planna Fwyd \u2013 Welsh for plant food \u2013 is a community project in the Dyfi Valley in mid Wales. The project organises a variety of food production initiatives, from Zoom lessons for first-time crop growers to sending out seed packets for families to grow in their gardens, and has about 100 local people involved. The group also plans to organise a second world war-style \u201cland army\u201d of volunteers to work on farms, with about 30 people signed up and plenty more showing interest, out of a town of 2,000 people. The project was born three weeks ago, after Mach Maethlon, a community organisation working to improve food supply and sustainability in the local area, joined up with the local coronavirus aid group in an attempt to combat fears around a food shortfall. \u201cAfter the crisis kicked off, we got lots of people saying they were worried about food supply, and asking if they could help,\u201d said Katie Hastings, one of the group\u2019s coordinators. \u201cWe had a range of people, from families wanting to turn their land to veg, to farmers wanting to grow food on empty land.\u201d The group are having to reckon with social distancing regulations, ensuring that volunteers can work collectively and share toolswithout putting each other at risk. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to work to improve the food supply here for eight years, and have had a sudden burst of enthusiasm. We import a lot of vegetables here, and while the project came in response to fear over food supplies, it will hopefully have a positive ongoing impact after the crisis,\u201d Hastings said. The group also hopes to help those in isolation. \u201cThere are a lot of people at home struggling with not working and being isolated. If we can work out a safe way to work on farms, it gives them the chance to do something meaningful,\u201d Hastings said. The baker Reeve the Baker was established in 1952 in Barford St Martin, a village six miles west of Salisbury in Wiltshire. These days the company has 200 staff and 12 shops dotted around Wiltshire, Dorset and Hampshire. One hour after Boris Johnson announced the UK lockdown, its owner, Gary Reeve, grandson of the bakery\u2019s founder, Harold Reeve, closed all the shops and furloughed most of the staff. \u201cIt was the hardest decision of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have stayed open, we\u2019re a food business, but we have small shops and enforcing social distancing would have been a nightmare. My staff were worried too.\u201d People rely on the bakeries and he did not want to let the community down so came up with a plan to deliver bread instead. Five bakers work overnight and bag up rolls and bread that is then taken by one driver to 20 surrounding villages. Each village has a designated weekly delivery day. Reeve relies on local businesses that have been temporarily forced to close, such as the Wyndham Arms pub in Dinton, to organise orders. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be done without the village coordinators,\u201d he said. \u201cThe landlady, Mary Gibbens, takes customer orders and card payments over the phone and we drop off once a week and people in the village collect from her. She knows everyone and makes sure all the elderly and vulnerable get their supplies. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone back to how it was when my grandfather was baking bread. He would deliver to villages too. The community spirit we\u2019ve encountered has been amazing.\u201d In addition to the deliveries there is a pop-up shop in the town of Wilton twice a week. The truck driver Jacques van Doornewaard is a lorry driver bringing fruit and vegetables from the Netherlands to the UK. He travels about three times a week bringing goods including pears, strawberries and mushrooms to British supermarkets. According to Van Doornewaard, Britain\u2019s shelves would run out of fresh produce within a couple of days without supplies from countries including the Netherlands. \u201cIf the supply chain of food was disrupted for 24 or 48 hours, all shops would be empty,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout truck drivers everything would come to a standstill. \u201cIt\u2019s much quieter than usual. The ferry\u2019s capacity is 280 lorries, and on a quiet day there are about 105. Yesterday, on the ferry there were less than 50 drivers. We have to eat in shifts to maintain social distancing.\u201d Van Doornewaard used to deliver to food markets, who would sell the produce to restaurants, but this supply chain has closed down in recent weeks. Instead, more produce is going to supermarkets, as staff scramble to fill the shelves. In the past week, Van Doornewaard has delivered 3,000kg of pears to Tesco in Dagenham, east London, and half as many to Sainsbury\u2019s, also in Dagenham, with stops at farms across southern England. He has also delivered mushrooms, strawberries and cheese. Through the week, he returns to collect thousands of empty trays to take back to be refilled in the Netherlands. The UK lockdown is more severe than in the Netherlands, and he has been struck by the emptiness of British streets. \u201cThe children\u2019s playgrounds are empty. Some minor roadworks are going on, [but] the big construction sites are empty. It\u2019s funny to notice since in the Netherlands that kind of work is still going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like on a Sunday morning, except for the fact that you see almost more lorries than cars.\u201d The local farmers\u2019 initiative As restaurants close their doors, many farmers are struggling to sell their produce to their usual suppliers, while more people are eating at home and struggling to get food from supermarkets. In response to this, Cathy St Germans established Farms to Feed Us, a digital database that connects people with farmers, enabling them to buy fresh food directly. So far, more than 80 farmers, growers and suppliers across the country have signed up. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of fresh produce on our farms and being fished in our seas,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has never been a more important time to eat healthy food and support your local farmers, growers and fishermen.\u201d She added: \u201cWe really focus on small-scale farmers and growers, where the ground isn\u2019t having its life sprayed out of it.

Last week we saw Nicky Doll walk the plank, and were again left with the feeling that a contestant had left way too early, with more to offer ( Rock M Sakura \u2013 we love you). RuPaul is certainly making some <em>interesting</em> decisions this year. Maybe she\u2019s just had enough. Maybe she\u2019s trolling us all. We shall see.</p> <p>As episode 6 opens, Heidi pads into the workroom holding her shoes and rolling her eyes. She has the vibe of someone\u2019s aunt who\u2019s just been told by airport staff that they can\u2019t find her luggage, and we\u2019re here for it. Thank god she\u2019s still here.

Dramatic camera zooms! Rattlesnack shade noise! Cut to opening theme song!</p> <h2>Patricia Quinn dot Wikipedia dot com</h2> <p>This week it\u2019s the fan fave (and undisputably best) yearly maxichallenge, The Snatch Game. No minichallenge, for the second week running. We can see why. In years past, many of the minichallenges seemed a bit forced and pointless.</p> <p>Aiden is doing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Quinn\">Patricia Quinn</a>, the actor who played a Magenta in Rocky Horror and basically nothing else. Picking a cult indie actor no-one\u2019s heard of, for a challenge where referential humour is tantamount, is so Aiden and so, so annoying. Fun fact; we\u2019ve just been on Patricia Quinn\u2019s Wikipedia page and she also played the role of \u201csecond girl at dance\u201d in a film called Adolf Hitler: My Part In His Downfall AND she played someone called Susan White in an episode of The Bill. She is Northern Irish but somehow we doubt Aiden will be doing a British accent.</p> <h2>Miss Vaaanjie</h2> <p>RuPaul enters the workroom accompanied by ex-contestant and catchphrase queen Miss Vanjie! She made her own name a catchphrasejust by walking backwards down the catwalk and saying \u201cMiss VAAAANJIE\u201d multiple times. It spawned a stream of merch, earned her several contracts with big brands, and got her cast in multiple music videos. Pop culture is weird.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4da311c3eac54d4b5c3fbfee5764846302a7f70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4da311c3eac54d4b5c3fbfee5764846302a7f70/0_263_6720_4032/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Vanjie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miss Vanjie is as confused as the rest of us as to how Aiden made it this far.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vanjie asks Heidi how she\u2019s doing and she says she\u2019s \u201cdoing blessed and highly favoured\u201d\u2026 Oooo, kay. Jan\u2019s doing musical theatre legend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernadette_Peters\">Bernadette Peters</a> \u2013 this could be great. We also get a quick and interesting insight into the audition process for the show, when we see a brief shot of Jan\u2019s audition clip, in which she impersonates Kris Jenner. We\u2019ve heard from our sources (drag queens on Facebook) that even just making the audition tape is GRUELLING. It requires multiple tasks and skillsets and, allegedly, you\u2019re not allowed to cut or edit it. It has to be done in one take. Blimey.</p> <p>Crystal Methyd is doing cult pop sensation Poppy! She\u2019s great, and her music\u2019s really fun and inventive,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/11/poppy-youtube-meme-pop-sensation-titanic-sinclair-moriah-pereira\"> take a look</a> if you haven\u2019t already. Needless to say, Ru and Vanjie haven\u2019t heard of her because her music\u2019s actually original and legitimate and wasn\u2019t produced by Lucian Piane. OOoooh, cue shady rattlesnake noise! As much as we love Poppy, we can\u2019t see how she\u2019ll work and be funny for Snatch Game. This could be curtains for Crystal. RuPaul\u2019s being uncharacteristically human on this walkaround, dispensing sound advice and even hugs.</p> <p>Gigi\u2019s got the genius idea of doing Sophia The Robot and firmly sticks to her guns when RuPaul basically advises her not to do it. Good for you, Gigi.</p> <h2>Snatch Game</h2> <p>Here we go, it\u2019s Snatch Game! The two celebs taking part, and this week\u2019s judges are Mean Girls alumni Daniel Franzese (Damian \u201ctoo gay to function\u201d Leigh) and Jonathan Bennett (Aaron \u201cyour hair looks sexy pushed back\u201d Samuels). Heidi isn\u2019t really acting or looking anything like Leslie Jones but she\u2019s hilarious just because it\u2019s her. Jaida\u2019s Cardi B is pretty good. Jan and Widow are great as Bernadette and Tina Turner as well. This is a STRONG Snatch Game.</p> <p>Ru says to Gigi as Sophia \u201cI wonder if you can receive a big black cock?\u201d Err ... whatever happened to double entendre? Gigi\u2019s stunning, with some fab physical comedy and full of high tech puns, despite Ru\u2019s weird questioning.

He\u2019s aged very well since Mean Girls though. Hi Daniel.</p> <p>This week\u2019s runway category is Frozen Eleganza (how much doooolar did Ru get from Disney for that?).

She has the vibe of someone\u2019s aunt who\u2019s just been told by airport staff that they can\u2019t find her luggage, and we\u2019re here for it. Thank god she\u2019s still here. Brita says \u201cI don\u2019t know why I was in the bottom.\u201d Really? Aiden says \u201cquiet Aiden isn\u2019t going to be quiet for much longer.\u201d OoOooh! Expression shots! Dramatic camera zooms! Rattlesnack shade noise! Cut to opening theme song! Patricia Quinn dot Wikipedia dot com This week it\u2019s the fan fave (and undisputably best) yearly maxichallenge, The Snatch Game. No minichallenge, for the second week running. We can see why. In years past, many of the minichallenges seemed a bit forced and pointless. Aiden is doing Patricia Quinn, the actor who played a Magenta in Rocky Horror and basically nothing else. Picking a cult indie actor no-one\u2019s heard of, for a challenge where referential humour is tantamount, is so Aiden and so, so annoying. Fun fact; we\u2019ve just been on Patricia Quinn\u2019s Wikipedia page and she also played the role of \u201csecond girl at dance\u201d in a film called Adolf Hitler: My Part In His Downfall AND she played someone called Susan White in an episode of The Bill. She is Northern Irish but somehow we doubt Aiden will be doing a British accent. Miss Vaaanjie RuPaul enters the workroom accompanied by ex-contestant and catchphrase queen Miss Vanjie! She made her own name a catchphrasejust by walking backwards down the catwalk and saying \u201cMiss VAAAANJIE\u201d multiple times. It spawned a stream of merch, earned her several contracts with big brands, and got her cast in multiple music videos. Pop culture is weird. Vanjie asks Heidi how she\u2019s doing and she says she\u2019s \u201cdoing blessed and highly favoured\u201d\u2026 Oooo, kay. Jan\u2019s doing musical theatre legend Bernadette Peters \u2013 this could be great. We also get a quick and interesting insight into the audition process for the show, when we see a brief shot of Jan\u2019s audition clip, in which she impersonates Kris Jenner. We\u2019ve heard from our sources (drag queens on Facebook) that even just making the audition tape is GRUELLING. It requires multiple tasks and skillsets and, allegedly, you\u2019re not allowed to cut or edit it. It has to be done in one take. Blimey. Crystal Methyd is doing cult pop sensation Poppy! She\u2019s great, and her music\u2019s really fun and inventive, take a look if you haven\u2019t already. Needless to say, Ru and Vanjie haven\u2019t heard of her because her music\u2019s actually original and legitimate and wasn\u2019t produced by Lucian Piane. OOoooh, cue shady rattlesnake noise! As much as we love Poppy, we can\u2019t see how she\u2019ll work and be funny for Snatch Game. This could be curtains for Crystal. RuPaul\u2019s being uncharacteristically human on this walkaround, dispensing sound advice and even hugs. Gigi\u2019s got the genius idea of doing Sophia The Robot and firmly sticks to her guns when RuPaul basically advises her not to do it. Good for you, Gigi. Snatch Game Here we go, it\u2019s Snatch Game! The two celebs taking part, and this week\u2019s judges are Mean Girls alumni Daniel Franzese (Damian \u201ctoo gay to function\u201d Leigh) and Jonathan Bennett (Aaron \u201cyour hair looks sexy pushed back\u201d Samuels). Heidi isn\u2019t really acting or looking anything like Leslie Jones but she\u2019s hilarious just because it\u2019s her. Jaida\u2019s Cardi B is pretty good. Jan and Widow are great as Bernadette and Tina Turner as well. This is a STRONG Snatch Game. Ru says to Gigi as Sophia \u201cI wonder if you can receive a big black cock?\u201d Err ... whatever happened to double entendre? Gigi\u2019s stunning, with some fab physical comedy and full of high tech puns, despite Ru\u2019s weird questioning. Aiden is not doing a Northern Irish accent and the jokes (if they can even be called that) are not landing. Sissy that walk The beauty team have REALLY stepped it up this year, Ru and Michelle look more flawless every week. Ru\u2019s metallic shimmer sensation is gorgeous and Michelle\u2019s dress is beautiful. We cannot say the same for Daniel Franzese\u2019s shirt ... thing [Ed: you are so, soooo wrong]. He\u2019s aged very well since Mean Girls though. Hi Daniel. This week\u2019s runway category is Frozen Eleganza (how much doooolar did Ru get from Disney for that?). Heidi, head-to-toe in white fur, says she\u2019s serving \u201cHigh Empress to the yeti folk.\u201d That\u2019s possibly our favourite runway voiceover quote from anyone ever. The platinum blonde hair really works on her. \u201cI CAN DO CONCEPTUAL LOOKS! I\u2019M NOT AFRAID TO GO TO THOSE PLACES!\u201d says Jan. Sure, Jan. Although, the look, while clever, isn\u2019t our favourite. Gigi\u2019s cute ice-cream girl wins, and deservedly so. Lipsync for your LIFE It took six weeks, but finally the two people who most need to be in the bottom two, are in the bottom two \u2013 Aiden and Brita. The song is OBVIOUSLY Let It Go. Side bar: there\u2019s a special place in hell for the loud people in gay bars who scream along to this song (there\u2019s also a special place in hell for gay bars that play this song). It suddenly starts snowing and Brita does some breathtaking witchery with a sort of flashing hand trick explosion thing. Bye Aiden. Notes and observations Shadiest moment Aiden\u2019s complete lack of acknowledgement that her character was Northern Irish. Catchphrase watch \u201cBlessed and highly favoured\u201d Animal print hunt Timid and tame this week at two garments, with just Crystal\u2019s usual leopardpint shirt and leopardprint neckerchief in her interview clips. Unless we count Heidi\u2019s yeti ... print? No, white fur is not a print. Just between us snowfriends A much better episode this week - it took a while but this season is finally picking up the pace. Some genuine laughs, and a collection of wow and WTF moments. What more can you ask for from Drag Race? \u2022 This article was corrected on 6 April as Patricia Quinn does not have a Northern Irish accent.",

But it\u2019s not just the \u201cgullible mums\u201d disseminating misinformation like sugar-crazed toddlers throwing confetti at a wedding. My partner regularly has to tell off her 75-year-old dad for his factually dubious forwarded emails. (Although his latest offering, with the subject line <em>\u00c0 m\u00e9diter</em>, is actually a thoughtful essay on the pandemic, which <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/03/24/paolo-giordano-je-ne-veux-pas-passer-a-cote-de-ce-que-l-epidemie-nous-devoile-de-nous-memes_6034192_3232.html\">originally appeared</a> in Le Monde.

Some straddle all three. The insouciant needs to be begged to stop going to the pub, but also creates the best content: the dads dancing with their teenage daughters on TikTok, the mums of younger kids churning out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OutNumbMother/status/1239978755713572864?s=20\">funny tweets</a> about home-schooling. In one <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/teens-family-turned-their-garage-to-a-club-quarantine-for\">TikTok video</a>, a dad acts as a bouncer and a mum a bartender, having turned their garage into a nightclub for their son\u2019s 21st birthday. These creatively supercharged boomers are \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 making lockdown slightly less terrible. They\u2019re trying so hard to \u201cmake the best of a bad situation\u201d and \u201clive, laugh, love\u201d their way through it that \u2013 you have to hand it to them \u2013 they\u2019re kind of succeeding. Or at least allowing us to forget about the slow collapse of civilisation in viral, 30-second blasts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/18/coronaviral-the-best-memes-tweets-and-cartoons-to-get-you-through-open-thread\">Coronaviral: the best memes, tweets and cartoons to get you through \u2013 open thread</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the past few weeks, we\u2019ve all seen those irritating references to the great works of art and literature supposedly created during quarantine, such as Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear.

There\u2019s certainly nothing more reflective of the zeitgeist than stir-crazy parents dispensing with their inhibitions; parents in lockdown are doing the \u201clong suffering but cheerful\u201d thing like never before. This is their time to shine, and we should probably just sit back and enjoy the results.</p> <p>The contemplative parents don\u2019t require as much attention. They\u2019re too busy zenning out to memes, or reading French essays. And even the paranoid parents deserve a break. After all, they\u2019re just trying to help, even if their idea of \u201chelping\u201d happens to be sourcing all of their information on a gravely urgent situation from satirical news sites and anti-vaxx forums.

Variations on this joke have now been posted by hundreds of other Twitter users. Another character to have emerged is the protective yet slightly deranged mama bear, yell-typing at her cubs to batten down the hatches and listen up because her friend Maureen from Zumba wrote a very compelling Facebook post on the healing power of dishwasher salt. But it\u2019s not just the \u201cgullible mums\u201d disseminating misinformation like sugar-crazed toddlers throwing confetti at a wedding. My partner regularly has to tell off her 75-year-old dad for his factually dubious forwarded emails. (Although his latest offering, with the subject line \u00c0 m\u00e9diter, is actually a thoughtful essay on the pandemic, which originally appeared in Le Monde. My French isn\u2019t good enough to understand the full text, but an uninformed glance tells me it\u2019s deeply existential.) There appear to be three types of pandemic parent: the insouciant, the paranoid and the contemplative. Some straddle all three. The insouciant needs to be begged to stop going to the pub, but also creates the best content: the dads dancing with their teenage daughters on TikTok, the mums of younger kids churning out funny tweets about home-schooling. In one TikTok video, a dad acts as a bouncer and a mum a bartender, having turned their garage into a nightclub for their son\u2019s 21st birthday. These creatively supercharged boomers are \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 making lockdown slightly less terrible. They\u2019re trying so hard to \u201cmake the best of a bad situation\u201d and \u201clive, laugh, love\u201d their way through it that \u2013 you have to hand it to them \u2013 they\u2019re kind of succeeding. Or at least allowing us to forget about the slow collapse of civilisation in viral, 30-second blasts. In the past few weeks, we\u2019ve all seen those irritating references to the great works of art and literature supposedly created during quarantine, such as Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear. What if that video of a dad pretending to be Basil Fawlty while serving his kids dinner is quarantine\u2019s King Lear? There\u2019s certainly nothing more reflective of the zeitgeist than stir-crazy parents dispensing with their inhibitions; parents in lockdown are doing the \u201clong suffering but cheerful\u201d thing like never before. This is their time to shine, and we should probably just sit back and enjoy the results. The contemplative parents don\u2019t require as much attention. They\u2019re too busy zenning out to memes, or reading French essays. And even the paranoid parents deserve a break. After all, they\u2019re just trying to help, even if their idea of \u201chelping\u201d happens to be sourcing all of their information on a gravely urgent situation from satirical news sites and anti-vaxx forums. They (accidentally) shitpost because they care. And, remember, not all of us have mums to tell us to beat the virus with a hairdryer. Be patient with yours, she means well.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of British homes will be paid to use electricity during the day for the first time, as wind and solar projects produce a surge in clean energy during the coronavirus lockdown. On Sunday morning, windfarms contributed almost 40% of the UK\u2019s electricity, while solar power made up almost a fifth of the power system. Fossil fuels made up less than 15% of electricity, of which only 1.1% came from coal plants. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s energy demand has fallen by around 10% due to the shutdown of pubs, restaurants, companies and factories across the country, leading to the lowest electricity market prices in 10 years. Households on a new breed of home energy tariff will even be paid to use electricity during the day on Sunday, because sunny weather and a brisk breeze will help generate ample clean electricity to meet the UK\u2019s lower energy needs. The so-called \u201cnegative electricity prices\u201d have previously only been available to homes overnight, when demand is typically at its lowest. But the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and the bright spring weather mean some homes will be able to earn money while using clean electricity during the day for the first time. Households which use the Agile Octopus energy tariff, offered by Octopus Energy, were contacted on Saturday to let them know they would be paid for every kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity they use during the sunniest hours of Sunday afternoon. From 11am-4pm, those customers will earn 0.22p-3.3p per kWh to make use of the UK\u2019s abundant clean energy, the company said. The coronavirus has caused the UK\u2019s demand for electricity to fall by between 9% and 13% so far, according to analysts at Cornwall Insight. While home energy use is higher because people are self-isolating and working from home, the lockdown has led to a lower demand for electricity across the country due to the shutdown of \u201clarge electrical loads\u201d such as factories, shops and railways. Energy bill savings are also likely for homes using variable energy tariffs, which track the wholesale energy markets. A slump in global gas market prices over the last year, combined with the lockdown, caused the wholesale price of electricity on the UK power markets to fall to \u00a328 per megawatt hour (MWh) last week. The electricity market price is down a third from January this year and well below the \u00a344/MWh price recorded this time last year.",

      "body": "<p>Scottish fruit farmers have solved a recruitment crisis that could have resulted in this year\u2019s harvest of strawberries, blueberries and raspberries being destroyed.</p> <p>Several thousand people, including students and restaurant and bar workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak, have taken low-paid fruit-picking jobs in Tayside and Fife normally done by seasonal workers from Bulgaria and Romania.</p> <p>Farmers across the UK have said fruit and vegetable harvests are threatened by lockdown measures that have prevented tens of thousands of workers from flying in from eastern Europe for the picking season.</p> <p>Recruitment agencies have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/28/fruit-and-veg-will-run-out-unless-britain-charters-planes-to-fly-in-farm-workers-from-eastern-europe\">proposed chartering special flights</a> to bring in workers from the continent, but in Tayside most vacancies have been filled by locals after an urgent appeal from farmers to fill 3,200 vacancies.</p> <p>James Porter, a fruit farmer who helps run Angus Growers, an organisation with members in Angus, Perthshire and Fife, said most of the 19 farms that took part in the appeal had filled all their vacancies. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a big response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging and it gives me a bit of hope we might still be harvesting our crops.\u201d Many were students whose university courses had stopped and who normally had summer jobs.</p> <p>Porter said Scottish farms produced about 25% of the UK\u2019s soft fruit each year. Angus Growers members produced 12,400 tons of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries last year.</p> <p>Picking for the first crops would start in two weeks, Porter said, and picking for berries grown in heated tunnels had already begun.

      "bodyText": "Scottish fruit farmers have solved a recruitment crisis that could have resulted in this year\u2019s harvest of strawberries, blueberries and raspberries being destroyed. Several thousand people, including students and restaurant and bar workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak, have taken low-paid fruit-picking jobs in Tayside and Fife normally done by seasonal workers from Bulgaria and Romania. Farmers across the UK have said fruit and vegetable harvests are threatened by lockdown measures that have prevented tens of thousands of workers from flying in from eastern Europe for the picking season. Recruitment agencies have proposed chartering special flights to bring in workers from the continent, but in Tayside most vacancies have been filled by locals after an urgent appeal from farmers to fill 3,200 vacancies. James Porter, a fruit farmer who helps run Angus Growers, an organisation with members in Angus, Perthshire and Fife, said most of the 19 farms that took part in the appeal had filled all their vacancies. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a big response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging and it gives me a bit of hope we might still be harvesting our crops.\u201d Many were students whose university courses had stopped and who normally had summer jobs. Porter said Scottish farms produced about 25% of the UK\u2019s soft fruit each year. Angus Growers members produced 12,400 tons of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries last year. Picking for the first crops would start in two weeks, Porter said, and picking for berries grown in heated tunnels had already begun. Picking would accelerate in May and peak from June onwards. He said fruit picking was a skilled and demanding job, requiring speed, dexterity and knowledge about which fruit to pick. Migrant workers had been doing this work for 10 to 15 years, he said, and were extremely fast. New recruits also needed to learn how to work safely with machinery and equipment, and maintain physical distancing while picking to reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus. He said it would take time and training for recruits to develop the skills his normal workforce had, and it was unclear whether the people who had signed up for this season\u2019s harvest would turn up or stay on if they found the job too demanding. Local recruits may also leave if their old jobs return and universities resume teaching once the lockdown is relaxed, he added. \u201cA lot of things have to line up and work this summer. We really are in uncharted territory.\u201d Similar problems confronted asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower andbrussels sprout farmers this summer, he said. \u201cThis is a big chunk of people\u2019s healthy eating in the summer months, particularly in conditions like this [during the lockdown] where people aren\u2019t necessarily having a healthy lifestyle, having lots of exercise and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the more important to make sure we secure the healthy ingredients they need.\u201d",

The numbers are far too small, by normal clinical trial standards, and some have highlighted inconsistencies in those reports. Most egregiously of all, critics say, there is no proper control group \u2013 no group of age- and sex-matched patients who do not receive the treatment and who are monitored under the same conditions. Didier Raoult, the doctor leading the study, says it would be unethical to have one in a situation where people are fighting for their lives, his staff are risking theirs to save them, and there are no other really effective drug options.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/05/uk-coronavirus-covid-19-live-news-hancock-starmer\">UK coronavirus live news: Hancock says follow the rules or we'll ban all exercise outside</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Raoult directs France\u2019s leading centre of excellence in infectious diseases and is among the most highly cited scientists in the world in his domain.

He believes, simply, that time will prove him right.</p> <p>It may do. But when Sir Arthur Newsholme, the chief medical officer of the UK\u2019s local government board, made an ethical decision in August 1918, it turned out to be the wrong one. The first, mild wave of that pandemic had receded, and the first world war was entering its final phases. He decided to shelve plans for fighting a predicted second wave on the grounds that the war effort took precedence. Within a few weeks, Honigsbaum recounts, the flu had returned with a vengeance.</p> <p>\u201cPoliticians are judged by history,\u201d Raoult told me. \u201cI will be judged by my patients.\u201d That may be his mistake. Ours would be to think that our governments and the scientists advising them aren\u2019t making ethical decisions all the time, in this crisis. The decision to restrict testing to hospitals \u2013 like the one to advise elderly people to stay at home before declaring a general lockdown \u2013 were partly ethical. They couldn\u2019t have been anything else. If the scientists had all the answers, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are.</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author.

The numbers are far too small, by normal clinical trial standards, and some have highlighted inconsistencies in those reports. Most egregiously of all, critics say, there is no proper control group \u2013 no group of age- and sex-matched patients who do not receive the treatment and who are monitored under the same conditions. Didier Raoult, the doctor leading the study, says it would be unethical to have one in a situation where people are fighting for their lives, his staff are risking theirs to save them, and there are no other really effective drug options. Raoult directs France\u2019s leading centre of excellence in infectious diseases and is among the most highly cited scientists in the world in his domain. He knows that in proclaiming that his treatment works, he has made an ethical and not an evidence-based decision. In Le Monde last weekend he effectively reminded his fellow doctors that their first duty was to their patients, not to the scientific method. He believes, simply, that time will prove him right. It may do. But when Sir Arthur Newsholme, the chief medical officer of the UK\u2019s local government board, made an ethical decision in August 1918, it turned out to be the wrong one. The first, mild wave of that pandemic had receded, and the first world war was entering its final phases. He decided to shelve plans for fighting a predicted second wave on the grounds that the war effort took precedence. Within a few weeks, Honigsbaum recounts, the flu had returned with a vengeance. \u201cPoliticians are judged by history,\u201d Raoult told me. \u201cI will be judged by my patients.\u201d That may be his mistake. Ours would be to think that our governments and the scientists advising them aren\u2019t making ethical decisions all the time, in this crisis. The decision to restrict testing to hospitals \u2013 like the one to advise elderly people to stay at home before declaring a general lockdown \u2013 were partly ethical. They couldn\u2019t have been anything else. If the scientists had all the answers, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are. \u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author.

The broadcaster, which is publicly owned but funds itself mostly through TV advertising, is estimated to have paid out more than \u00a35m to its 903 staff last month. The payouts, which include hundreds of thousands of pounds in bonuses each to the chief executive, Alex Mahon, the director of programmes, Ian Katz, and the commercial boss, Jonathan Allan, relate to the performance of Channel 4 last year. It is understood Channel 4 will announce this week a range of cost-cutting measures for this year, one of whichincludes a temporary 20% reduction in the salary of the executive team and board. If Channel 4 follows the measures announced by ITV last week, which appears likely, top executives will give up bonuses for this year while staff can expect, at minimum, a pay freeze. It is understood ITV is looking to furlough some staff, and Channel 4 may be forced to do the same.

      "body": "<p>Robert Armstrong, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, who has died aged 93, was the supreme Whitehall mandarin \u2013 discreet, a staunch defender of official secrecy, a loyal servant of his political masters. He held all the key posts as he passed through the Whitehall corridors of power.</p> <p>He was private secretary first to the liberal, reforming Labour home secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/06/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Roy Jenkins</a>, and subsequently, between 1970 and 1975, to a Conservative prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/18/guardianobituaries.conservatives\" title=\"\">Edward Heath</a>, and a Labour one, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson</a>. He was appointed permanent secretary at the Home Office between 1977 and 1979, before reaching Whitehall\u2019s summit, the post of cabinet secretary, a position he occupied between 1979 and 1987, most of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>\u2019s premiership.</p> <p>It was during the Thatcher period that Armstrong\u2019s name became known around the world when, in 1986, he appeared as a key witness in the so-called Spycatcher trial, as the British government attempted to prevent publication in Australia of the memoirs of Peter Wright, a former MI5 officer.</p> <p>In the witness box in the Sydney court, Armstrong came out with a phrase that captured headlines around the world. The phrase was \u201ceconomical with the truth\u201d.</p> <p>He had been asked by Malcolm Turnbull, Wright\u2019s lawyer, why he had written to the publishers Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, saying Thatcher wanted a copy of a book on MI5 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/06/chapman-pincher\" title=\"\">Chapman Pincher</a>, when he was already in possession of the manuscript. The letter, Turnbull suggested, \u201ccontains a lie\u201d. Armstrong replied: \u201cIt was a misleading impression, it does not contain a lie. I don\u2019t think.\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull: \u201cWhat is the difference between a misleading impression and a lie?\u201d</p> <p>Armstrong: \u201cA lie is a straight untruth.\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull: \u201cWhat\u2019s a misleading impression, a kind of bent untruth?\u201d</p> <p>Armstrong: \u201cAs one person said, it is perhaps being economical with the truth.\u201d He pointed out that the phrase was not his own \u2013 it was first used by the philosopher Edmund Burke, he told the court. But it was too late.</p> <p>Armstrong\u2019s response in the Sydney courtroom betrayed a lack of understanding, or at least experience, of the outside world. Comments that may well have earned plaudits in Pall Mall clubs might not necessarily be appreciated on the street.</p> <p>Armstrong strongly believed that civil servants should remain silent to the grave. A duty of lifelong confidentiality was even more necessary, he believed, when it came to members of the security and intelligence agencies. In his affidavit to the Sydney court, he insisted that the publication of Spycatcher was likely to cause \u201cunquantifiable damage\u201d. But the government lost its case.</p> <p>Of all his political masters, Armstrong developed a particularly close personal relationship with Heath. They shared a deep love and knowledge of music. Both were accomplished pianists. Armstrong was fond of recalling the evening of 28 October 1971, when Heath secured a healthy Commons majority of 356 to 244 votes in favour of entry into the European Community, or the Common Market as it was more widely called, a success Heath regarded as his greatest political achievement.</p> <p>Returning to No 10 Heath walked past his staff, briefly acknowledging them but without saying a word went upstairs to his clavichord to play the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8rwMklcGvk\" title=\"\">First Prelude from Book 1 of Bach\u2019s Well Tempered Clavier</a>.</p> <p>After Heath died, in 2005, Armstrong became the first chair of the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, a post he retained until 2013. He strongly defended Heath when, more than a decade after his death, the former prime minister was accused of sexually abusing children. Armstrong described the decision by the Wiltshire police to discuss their investigations at a press conference as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. He added: \u201cYou usually detect some sexuality. I never heard a whiff of sexuality about Heath, whether women or children. He was completely asexual. He had a girlfriend, a copy of his girlfriend\u2019s photo by his bedside. She went off with someone else.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Headington, Oxford, Robert was the son of the organist and eventual principal of the Royal Academy of Music <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-thomas-armstrong-1411509.html\" title=\"\">Thomas Armstrong</a>, and his wife, Hester (nee Draper). He was educated at the Dragon school, Oxford, at Eton, where he was a King\u2019s scholar, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied classics and philosophy. It was an elitist, privileged education.</p> <p>It was also then a traditional route to the foothills of Whitehall\u2019s corridors of power via the Treasury \u2013 the fact that he had studied classics, rather than economics, was no obstacle to a career there. Far from it, and it was at the Treasury, the most influential of government departments, where Armstrong first made his mark, starting as an assistant principal in 1950.</p> <p>Yet Armstrong will always be identified most with the Thatcher years, as an eminence grise who was happiest remaining in the shadows, advising the prime minister on the need for secrecy and urging his fellow Whitehall mandarins to take a tough line against leaks.</p> <p>However, he was thrust into the limelight as he was caught up in a series of spectacular Whitehall crises. Asked to conduct an inquiry into the 1986 Westland helicopter affair, he concluded that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/22/lord-brittan-of-spennithorne\" title=\"\">Leon Brittan</a>, the trade and industry secretary, had leaked a letter damaging to the defence secretary, Michael Heseltine, without saying that Thatcher knew about the stratagem all along.</p> <p>He was subsequently asked by a member of the Commons defence committee whether Thatcher\u2019s remark to MPs that she had given her consent to get \u201caccurate information to the public domain\u201d, as she put it, conflicted with the official version of events. Armstrong admitted her remark \u201cdid not coincide\u201d with an earlier statement in which she said that her agreement was \u201cneither sought nor given\u201d. He explained: \u201cMy understanding is it would be a slip of the tongue.\u201d</p> <p>Armstrong\u2019s defence of official secrecy led him to assert an absolute constitutional doctrine to prevent government officials from whistleblowing, or in any way publicly questioning government policy. Stung by the acquittal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/may/04/official-secrets-act-gavin-williamson-prosecution\" title=\"\">Clive Ponting</a>, charged with breaking the Official Secrets Act for sending details of the movements of the Belgrano, the Argentinian cruiser torpedoed by a British submarine during the Falklands war, he rejected the argument by defence lawyers that civil servants could appeal above the heads of ministers to the \u201cpublic interest\u201d.</p> <p>He issued new guidelines on the duties and responsibilities of government officials. Civil servants may be \u201cservants of the Crown\u201d, he said, but added: \u201cFor all practical purposes the Crown in this context means, and is represented by, the government of the day.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe civil service as such has no constitutional personality or responsibility separate from the duly elected government of the day.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, civil servants had no direct constitutional links with parliament and could never appeal to an overriding \u201cpublic interest\u201d.</p> <p>Thatcher did not always accept his advice. He told her that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/18/jimmy-savile-abused-1000-victims-bbc\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile</a> should not be given a knight- hood on the grounds, he felt, that \u201cthings were not quite what they should be\u201d. He noted that Savile had made no attempt to deny the accounts in the press about his private life. Armstrong\u2019s instincts turned out to be correct.</p> <p>He was a warmer, more sensitive man than he allowed the public \u2013 or many of his professional colleagues \u2013 to appreciate. He also possessed a dry humour. One encyclical he sent to senior Whitehall officials deploring leaks was itself leaked. When the journalist, now film-maker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/paulgreengrass\" title=\"\">Paul Greengrass</a>, raised this during a Granada TV World in Action interview, Armstrong replied: \u201cI was very sad that it took so long as six weeks to leak. I hoped it would leak much sooner than that.\u201d</p> <p>He was knighted in 1978 and made a life peer 10 years later, after he retired, sitting in the Lords as a crossbencher.

      "body": "<p>Last week, Boris Johnson stood on a set of stairs inside 10 Downing Street and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1244339182690066433\">spoke into a smartphone camera</a>. Towards the end of a two-and-half minute monologue about Covid-19 and the national response to it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/29/20000-nhs-staff-return-to-service-johnson-says-from-coronavirus-isolation\">he said something striking</a>: \u201cOne thing I think [the] coronavirus crisis has already proved is that there really is such a thing as society.\u201d</p> \n<p>The words, if anyone missed the reference, were an allusion to an <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/no-such-thing-society\">infamous few sentences</a> from Margaret Thatcher, published in an interview in Woman\u2019s Own magazine in 1987: \u201cI think we\u2019ve been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it\u2019s the government\u2019s job to cope with it \u2026 They\u2019re casting their problem on society. And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first.\u201d</p> \n<p>Though Johnson may well have cited what she said to create a useful distraction among political journalists, what he said nonetheless highlighted something undeniable: that Conservative politicians used to following Thatcher\u2019s example are suddenly having to behave in ways that will be causing some of them no end of unease.</p> \n<p>In the spectacle of the chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/14/rishi-sunak-budget-2020-spending-spree-investment-productivity\">economic interventions</a> and the government\u2019s sudden veneration of the public sector, you can discern Tory shibboleths being suddenly thrown overboard. But things are perhaps more complicated than they appear. Coronavirus will force shifts in policy of a scale no Tory politician would ever have foreseen, but they also chime with underrated things that have been present in post-Thatcher Conservatism for years.

      "bodyText": "Last week, Boris Johnson stood on a set of stairs inside 10 Downing Street and spoke into a smartphone camera. Towards the end of a two-and-half minute monologue about Covid-19 and the national response to it, he said something striking: \u201cOne thing I think [the] coronavirus crisis has already proved is that there really is such a thing as society.\u201d The words, if anyone missed the reference, were an allusion to an infamous few sentences from Margaret Thatcher, published in an interview in Woman\u2019s Own magazine in 1987: \u201cI think we\u2019ve been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it\u2019s the government\u2019s job to cope with it \u2026 They\u2019re casting their problem on society. And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first.\u201d Though Johnson may well have cited what she said to create a useful distraction among political journalists, what he said nonetheless highlighted something undeniable: that Conservative politicians used to following Thatcher\u2019s example are suddenly having to behave in ways that will be causing some of them no end of unease. In the spectacle of the chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s huge economic interventions and the government\u2019s sudden veneration of the public sector, you can discern Tory shibboleths being suddenly thrown overboard. But things are perhaps more complicated than they appear. Coronavirus will force shifts in policy of a scale no Tory politician would ever have foreseen, but they also chime with underrated things that have been present in post-Thatcher Conservatism for years. When David Cameron was in charge, there were periodic fits of interest in a more socially minded Toryism, and the idea of the Conservatives somehow becoming a \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d. Before she was waylaid by Brexit, Theresa May spoke about the need for an activist state. Just before the arrival of Covid-19, when all the talk was of big infrastructure projects and helping places in the so-called \u201cred wall\u201d, cabinet ministers were doing much the same. Of course austerity went on, inequalities were still ignored, and our exit from the EU quickly proved to be a huge distraction from the dire state of our social fabric. But in the midst of a sudden, unprecedented crisis, that is not quite the point. What matters right now is that much of the political groundwork has been done for Johnson and his allies to move away from free-market dogma, and in any case, they have no choice. As and when we start to emerge from the coronavirus period, I would imagine we will be hearing a great deal about a new kind of Conservatism, and the supposed end of a Tory approach to governing that lasted 40 long years, from 1979 to 2019.

With this in mind, we asked three experts five of the most pressing questions about intimacy during the pandemic.</p> <h2><strong>Is Covid-19 sexually transmissible?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dr Jessica Justman: </strong>We\u2019re not seeing patterns that indicate sexual transmission. It\u2019s primarily spread through respiratory droplets.

However, kissing is a very common practice during sexual intercourse, and the virus can be transmitted via saliva. Therefore, the virus can be transmitted by kissing. There is also evidence of oral-fecal transmission of the Covid-19 and that implies that analingus may represent a risk for infection.</p> <h2><strong>So is it OK to have sex?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Justman: </strong>If you or your partner is a Covid-19 case, the advice is to steer clear of each other as much as possible.</p> <p><strong>Dr Julia Marcus: </strong>But for people who don\u2019t have symptoms and don\u2019t have any recent likely exposure and have been staying close to home, I think that, if it\u2019s within your own household, it\u2019s a different story. If you live with a regular sexual partner and you don\u2019t have any symptoms, or likely exposure, sex might actually be a really great way to have fun, stay connected and relieve anxiety during this potentially stressful time.</p> <h2><strong>What about new partners?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Marcus:</strong> The recommendation right now is that we try to stay home as much as we can and really only interact with people for things that are essential, like groceries.

      "body": "<p>The lights shone more brightly than anything I\u2019d ever seen. One million blinding watts strafed across the leaves of countless cannabis plants that peeled off in neat rows in every direction. The warehouse was as pristine as a pharmaceutical facility, and as we strode around in crisp white nylon overalls and box-fresh wellies, the atmosphere was surreal \u2013 interstellar, almost: \u2013 it felt as if we were on a mission to Mars. It was definitely a glimpse of the future.</p> <p>It was 2017 and I had been invited to visit this legal medical cannabis \u201cgrow\u201d in the town of Gatineau, near Ottawa. I was in Canada after writing a paper for the drug-law reform thinktank <a href=\"https://volteface.me/\" title=\"\">Volteface</a>, proposing an online-only, legal cannabis market in the UK as a way to break the logjam between the UK\u2019s two million cannabis smokers and those who fear legalisation. I was meeting with Canadian police and politicians to hear more about that country\u2019s plans to completely legalise cannabis the following year.</p> <p>Back in the UK, a million-watt grow like Gatineau\u2019s would put you in jail for a decade. Here, it was likely to make its owners a very cool, very legal few million in mere months. Added to that, the state would benefit, too, as taxes from sales of the crop would be collected for the common good rather than enriching criminals. It felt utopian.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Were cannabis activists\u2019 hopes of a regulated cannabis market just a pipe dream?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the three decades I have campaigned to reform drug laws, I never expected to see change happen so quickly, or at such scale, as it did in Canada. But, two years on, the Canadian experiment hasn\u2019t quite turned out as we reformers had hoped.</p> <p>The Gatineau greenhouse through which I strode on that day in 2017 was owned by a firm called <a href=\"https://www.thehydropothecary.com/\" title=\"\">the Hydropothecary</a>. Now named Hexo, in October 2019 it shed 200 of its 800 staff. On 4 March one of Canada\u2019s biggest growers, Canopy Growth, announced the <a href=\"https://mjbizdaily.com/cannabis-greenhouse-retreat-continues-with-canopy-closing-two-facilities/\" title=\"\">closure</a> of two mega-greenhouses in the towns of Delta and Aldegrove \u2013 with 500 job losses. The firm also cancelled the opening of a new site in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the black market is still vibrant while cannabis stocks have crashed, medical patients say they can\u2019t get hold of essential medicines, and thousands of jobs have been lost. So what went wrong \u2013 and what went right? Were cannabis activists\u2019 hopes of a regulated cannabis market just a pipe dream?</p> <p>Canada had permitted cannabis for medical use since 2001. Medical patients were allowed to grow four plants, and licensed producers cultivated larger crops for sale online to those with valid prescriptions. But most Canadian cities had illegal \u2013 but tolerated \u2013 dispensaries where the drug was sold completely indiscriminately. These stores made Amsterdam\u2019s coffee shops look as prim as a WI cake stand. The quality and variety of cannabis on sale at these illegal outlets was outstanding, bewildering. Business was not just booming, but blazing.And it was all completely illegal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd209487d720b7d62775e673c0d05952afecd06c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd209487d720b7d62775e673c0d05952afecd06c/0_361_4572_2742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Canada made cannabis boring\u2019: plants being tended at Aurora.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Canada made cannabis boring\u2019: plants being tended at Aurora.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Canada\u2019s Cannabis Act of 2018 was a bold attempt to impose some order on this anarchic retail scene. It legalised the sale to adults of 30g of cannabis in austere packaging from government-licensed shops. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said: \u201cThe old approach to cannabis didn\u2019t work. It was too easy for our kids to get it and gangs and drug dealers were reaping the profits. That changes from now on.\u201d</p> <p>Bill Blair, a former Toronto police chief, became an unlikely cheerleader for legalisation, arguing that to do so would \u201ckeep cannabis out of the hands of youth, and profits out of the hands of criminals\u201d. Two other key goals of regulation were the protection of public health and the reduction in criminality associated with the illegal market. After 50 years of the unending, senseless drug war, peace had broken out.</p> <p>Or so it seemed. Because while Canada may have lit the fuse on an ambitious experiment, every high has a low. Within a year the industry was experiencing mass layoffs, multi-billion-dollar stock-market losses, executive firings and corporate scandals as the overhyped new sector experienced a dramatic and humbling public correction.</p> <p><em><strong>What went wrong? </strong></em>Alastair Moore, co-founder of Hanway Associates, a London-based cannabis consultancy, says the Canadian industry has been driven by vulture capitalism and wishful thinking. \u201cA mix of greed and naivety led this industry to great heights \u2013 and has left it on its knees. While some made lots of money, others lost their investments and now many others have lost their jobs.\u201d</p> <p>According to Moore\u2019s fellow founder, George McBride: \u201cThe key thing is that Canada did actually get the reforms through. In and of itself, that is a huge feat. It\u2019s the first time any major developed country has done so. And so, kudos. However, getting it through has involved a lot of politicians who didn\u2019t understand what they\u2019re talking about designing a really complicated system.\u201d</p> <p>So just how does a state create and regulate an entirely new business of intoxication that has always existed, essentially, in a countercultural, outlaw space? Canada, it turns out, did so cautiously, with every decision deliberated over by a centralised government <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/laws-regulations/task-force-cannabis-legalization-regulation.html\" title=\"\">Task Force</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e422947c68368c78d7f47c098eb9ec75107cdfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e422947c68368c78d7f47c098eb9ec75107cdfd/0_158_4775_2866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green green grass of home: plants at Strathroy, Ontario, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green green grass of home: plants at Strathroy, Ontario, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Added to the complexity of the policy and its implementation, the needle of international capital\u2019s wonky moral compass swung straight at these lucrative new markets. Hundreds of millions of dollars were raised on global capital markets and the Canadian landscape was quickly dotted with massive new grow sites.</p> <p>The so-called \u201cgreen rush\u201d had started and production went into overdrive. Stock prices soared and fortunes were staked, made, doubled and tripled in an atmosphere reminiscent of the 90s dotcom boom, or the Yukon gold rush of the 19th century, when 100,000 prospectors headed into the Canadian hinterlands in search of riches. Many firms hoped to corner the Canadian market by throwing millions of dollars of shareholders\u2019 money into massive grow sites. This time, the gold was green. But soon, things started to fall apart.</p> <p>The main problem Canada\u2019s smokers and growers faced was access: too few retail shops were able to open to serve the eager new market. Canada is a country of 38 million people, divided into 10 provinces that are similar to US states, with provincial governments producing a patchwork of varying regulations. Over a third \u2013 13.5 million \u2013 of all Canadians live in the state of Ontario. But as of 2 March this year, Ontario had just 41 retail cannabis stores. The province of Alberta, home to 4.4 million, has 423 stores.</p> <p>And where there was product available, the price was almost double that of the illegal market. C$5.59 to C$10.23 per gram (or over \u00a340 a quarter ounce). That was caused by tax burdens and overheads: the legal market has to comply with regulations on fungicide and pesticide residue levels, and draconian security requirements for grow sites, such as huge vaults in which to store the cannabis and record-keeping for every person who enters these vaults.</p> <p>The illegal market, meanwhile, is completely unregulated \u2013 and thriving because of this. <a href=\"https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start\" title=\"\">Statistics Canada</a>, a state agency, reports that just 29% of cannabis users buy all of their product from a legal source. Four in 10 Canadians told the organisation that they bought at least some cannabis from illegal sources in 2019.</p> <p>The next problem was that many stores sold poor-quality grass, with smokers complaining that it had been poorly dried and cured, and tasted bad. Modern cannabis users are accustomed to a range of flavours, from lemon to mango, pineapple, strawberry and pine. These flavours are derived from the plant\u2019s natural aroma profile, which skilled growers preserve by careful breeding, correct harvesting and slow, cautious curing of the fragrant flowers.</p> <p>Many players in the new mass market often skipped these steps in the pursuit of profit, says David Brown, a British Columbia-based cannabis industry analyst. \u201cMany consumers have had complaints about high prices and what is perceived as lower quality, especially the tendency of many of the legal dried flower products to be overly dried, often from a rushed or improper curing and drying process.\u201d</p> <p>Why would anyone drive a few miles up the road to score bad weed from many of the government shops when your regular black-market dealer lives nearby, has better product and brings it to your door for half the price?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d421768027b42e683280b719964ab3f625de4ede\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d421768027b42e683280b719964ab3f625de4ede/0_338_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The nose knows: a customer sniffs display samples at Evergreen Cannabis in Vancouver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The nose knows: a customer sniffs display samples at Evergreen Cannabis in Vancouver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s worth reflecting, also, on the psychology of some of these users. \u201cFor a long time, cannabis has been the mark of the rebel, the outsider, the outlaw,\u201d says Brown. \u201cA lot of the people who complain about \u2018bad weed\u2019 and so-called \u2018fake legalisation\u2019 are doing so because parts of their countercultural identity have been altered forever by this law change. Canada has made cannabis boring \u2013 and that was kind of the point.\u201d</p> <p>With few shops to sell to and customers clinging to their traditional dealers, the new cannabis corporations found themselves holding a glut of product. There is a stockpile of grass weighing in at 400 tonnes, at last count, according to official government inventory figures.</p> <p>The rollout of retail shops was left, in many cases, to inexperienced officials in provincial government departments, says McBride. \u201cOntario authorities said, \u2018We don\u2019t trust private organisations to run cannabis shops. We\u2019re going to do it all ourselves.\u2019 Then they tried to do it, but they squandered about $80 million trying to figure out how to do it, and got absolutely nowhere. They had to cancel it and invite private tenders. All these big, shiny grow facilities that cost C$10m, C$20m or C$30m to build, and which all grew loads of cannabis \u2013 there was nowhere to sell it, because there weren\u2019t any shops,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In a stinging irony, medical patients \u2013 the very people whose decades of activism had driven the wider reforms, faced cannabis shortages and a steep increase in price after legalisation as suppliers diverted their medical product in bulk to the new recreational market rather than in hundreds of smaller deals to medical patients.</p> <p><em><strong>Dan Sutton of</strong></em> Tantalus Labs, a British Columbia-based grower that uses natural sunlight and greenhouses, says legalisation has been \u201clargely negative\u201d for medical cannabis users because of this new sales dynamic: \u201cPhysicians have been telling medical users they should buy from the recreational marketplace, which is completely inappropriate \u2013 and it loads them up with extra taxes and tariffs.\u201d </p> <p>Sutton originally built his low-impact, sunlit grow to service medical users, and still focuses on this original customer base \u2013 though they make up just 10% of his sales. \u201cMany licensed producers now don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cSome have just pulled their financial resources on their medical platforms. If a medical user can\u2019t get their medicine \u2013 for people, with, say, multiple sclerosis \u2013 that can lead to severe impairment, traffic accidents and potentially death. That blood is on those licensed producers\u2019 hands that stopped serving those users\u2019 needs,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Paul North, director of communications at Volteface, which commissioned me to write the paper, says Canadian customers\u2019 response to the malfunctioning new markets is understandable: \u201cYou have to provide a superior experience to the illicit market. When it comes to cannabis, this is not easy. Dealers have no marketing restrictions, and can offer a sweet deal and deliver a product to your door. For most people, cannabis use is a relaxing, problem-free and enjoyable experience. Buying the drug needs to match that experience, and; until it does, the illicit market will continue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42bd231f5ec36a40c9b77633f7f63323ae42b06e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42bd231f5ec36a40c9b77633f7f63323ae42b06e/15_47_4090_2453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Product placement: cannabis pills ready for sale in Quebec.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Product placement: cannabis pills ready for sale in Quebec.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hype talks, but money walks. The early euphoria in the cannabis stock market has been replaced by a major dose of paranoia. All cannabis stocks have tanked, with an average 50% wipeout in value right across Canada and the US in the last year. Major players such as <a href=\"https://www.auroramj.com/\" title=\"\">Aurora Cannabis</a> took the biggest hit, with its shares falling from US$12.83 in March 2019 to US$2 today. Another bud behemoth, <a href=\"https://www.tilray.com/\" title=\"\">Tilray</a>, has also had its share price slashed by 80%, from over US$81 to US$16 within a year. Other cannabis giants including <a href=\"https://aphria.ca/\" title=\"\">Aphria</a> lost 60% of their paper value in 2019, while <a href=\"https://www.canopygrowth.com/\" title=\"\">Canopy Growth</a> sank by 54%. Financing has dried up for the new industry, and small-scale retail investors \u2013 often young professionals investing via smartphone apps \u2013 have lost large sums of money. None of this is to assert that Canada\u2019s policy has been a failure. If we compare it to the UK cannabis industry, where illegally trafficked children have been found enslaved in abandoned buildings growing cannabis for gangsters, it is better by several orders of magnitude.</p> <p>Steve Rolles of UK-based drug law reform group <a href=\"https://transformdrugs.org/about-us/\" title=\"\">Transform</a> agrees that it is harsh to judge the project\u2019s success so soon. \u201cWe are still in the rollout phase. They are still in a transition from an illegal economy to a legally regulated one. It will take some time for new market equilibrium to be established, and for new social norms to emerge, and for teething problems to be addressed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Big, shiny grow facilities cost C$20m or C$30m to build and grew loads of cannabis \u2013 but there was nowhere to sell it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How best to create a legal cannabis industry is a question with a particular urgency in the UK today as we build a market for medicinal use \u2013 albeit agonisingly slowly. I strongly believe that cannabis will be legalised for adult use in the UK within five years. And it all goes back to that Gatineau greenhouse I visited in 2017.</p> <p>On that trip, I was accompanied by two Tory party insiders, Blair Gibbs, ex-adviser on police matters to Boris Johnson when he was mayor, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/danny-kruger\" title=\"\">Danny Kruger</a>, son of TV chef Prue Leith, who wrote the \u201chug a hoodie\u201d speech for David Cameron. Both men experienced something of a Damascene conversion in their views on cannabis law during that trip. Days after his return, Kruger wrote in the <em>Spectator</em>: \u201cWe do not need to ban everything bad. After all, the Victorians never prohibited alcohol. They regulated it, taxed it and hedged it about with a culture of disapproval. Instead of the prohibition of cannabis we need an old Victorian virtue: temperance.\u201d</p> <p>Blair Gibbs moved to Canada in 2017 to work as a cannabis consultant, but in August 2019 he took a job in the PM\u2019s office. Both men are now at the very heart of the British government: in 2019 Kruger was parachuted into the safe Tory seat of Devizes to stand as MP in the last election and is also an adviser to Johnson.</p> <p>Whether their weed-friendly outlook survives the cold glare of Whitehall orthodoxy remains to be seen. But it is undeniable that the economic libertarians of the Tory party in 2020 are much more pro-cannabis than their newly nationalising Labour party counterparts. There are, after all, many billions of pounds to be made by the kind of people who fund the Tories: land and property owners and the banks that will finance the new industry.</p> <p><em><strong>What happens if</strong></em> you just legalise this drug? It\u2019s a question no one other than Canada has ever really asked. My view is that we have long known that all drug laws are unworkable, illogical, unjustifiable, unscientific, counterproductive and generate countless unintended consequences \u2013 in fact, drugs laws often create the exact opposite outcomes to those desired. But ironically, and with a beautifully stoned logic, it turns out that legalising cannabis in Canada has generated just as many challenges as it solved.</p> <p>What Canada\u2019s experience demonstrates is that cannabis legalisation does not instantly deliver some great social panacea. There is no promised land. But we should never lose sight of this essential truth: Canadians can no longer be jailed for growing and eating and smoking certain flowers. That is a huge, fundamental step forward, no matter what the stock market indices say.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the market vagaries and the slow shrinking of the illegal market, analyst Andrew Brown is still proud of his country\u2019s bold step into the unknown. \u201cLegalisation in Canada is hardly perfect. After all, we\u2019re less than two years into legalising a product that has been illegal for nearly a century,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a process, not a destination, and the slow, deliberate approach to a well-regulated industry is allowing Canada to set a responsible path forward that other countries can feel safe in following, even refining and improving upon.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The lights shone more brightly than anything I\u2019d ever seen. One million blinding watts strafed across the leaves of countless cannabis plants that peeled off in neat rows in every direction. The warehouse was as pristine as a pharmaceutical facility, and as we strode around in crisp white nylon overalls and box-fresh wellies, the atmosphere was surreal \u2013 interstellar, almost: \u2013 it felt as if we were on a mission to Mars. It was definitely a glimpse of the future. It was 2017 and I had been invited to visit this legal medical cannabis \u201cgrow\u201d in the town of Gatineau, near Ottawa. I was in Canada after writing a paper for the drug-law reform thinktank Volteface, proposing an online-only, legal cannabis market in the UK as a way to break the logjam between the UK\u2019s two million cannabis smokers and those who fear legalisation. I was meeting with Canadian police and politicians to hear more about that country\u2019s plans to completely legalise cannabis the following year. Back in the UK, a million-watt grow like Gatineau\u2019s would put you in jail for a decade. Here, it was likely to make its owners a very cool, very legal few million in mere months. Added to that, the state would benefit, too, as taxes from sales of the crop would be collected for the common good rather than enriching criminals. It felt utopian. For the three decades I have campaigned to reform drug laws, I never expected to see change happen so quickly, or at such scale, as it did in Canada. But, two years on, the Canadian experiment hasn\u2019t quite turned out as we reformers had hoped. The Gatineau greenhouse through which I strode on that day in 2017 was owned by a firm called the Hydropothecary. Now named Hexo, in October 2019 it shed 200 of its 800 staff. On 4 March one of Canada\u2019s biggest growers, Canopy Growth, announced the closure of two mega-greenhouses in the towns of Delta and Aldegrove \u2013 with 500 job losses. The firm also cancelled the opening of a new site in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. Meanwhile, the black market is still vibrant while cannabis stocks have crashed, medical patients say they can\u2019t get hold of essential medicines, and thousands of jobs have been lost. So what went wrong \u2013 and what went right? Were cannabis activists\u2019 hopes of a regulated cannabis market just a pipe dream? Canada had permitted cannabis for medical use since 2001. Medical patients were allowed to grow four plants, and licensed producers cultivated larger crops for sale online to those with valid prescriptions. But most Canadian cities had illegal \u2013 but tolerated \u2013 dispensaries where the drug was sold completely indiscriminately. These stores made Amsterdam\u2019s coffee shops look as prim as a WI cake stand. The quality and variety of cannabis on sale at these illegal outlets was outstanding, bewildering. Business was not just booming, but blazing.And it was all completely illegal. Canada\u2019s Cannabis Act of 2018 was a bold attempt to impose some order on this anarchic retail scene. It legalised the sale to adults of 30g of cannabis in austere packaging from government-licensed shops. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said: \u201cThe old approach to cannabis didn\u2019t work. It was too easy for our kids to get it and gangs and drug dealers were reaping the profits. That changes from now on.\u201d Bill Blair, a former Toronto police chief, became an unlikely cheerleader for legalisation, arguing that to do so would \u201ckeep cannabis out of the hands of youth, and profits out of the hands of criminals\u201d. Two other key goals of regulation were the protection of public health and the reduction in criminality associated with the illegal market. After 50 years of the unending, senseless drug war, peace had broken out. Or so it seemed. Because while Canada may have lit the fuse on an ambitious experiment, every high has a low. Within a year the industry was experiencing mass layoffs, multi-billion-dollar stock-market losses, executive firings and corporate scandals as the overhyped new sector experienced a dramatic and humbling public correction. What went wrong? Alastair Moore, co-founder of Hanway Associates, a London-based cannabis consultancy, says the Canadian industry has been driven by vulture capitalism and wishful thinking. \u201cA mix of greed and naivety led this industry to great heights \u2013 and has left it on its knees. While some made lots of money, others lost their investments and now many others have lost their jobs.\u201d According to Moore\u2019s fellow founder, George McBride: \u201cThe key thing is that Canada did actually get the reforms through. In and of itself, that is a huge feat. It\u2019s the first time any major developed country has done so. And so, kudos. However, getting it through has involved a lot of politicians who didn\u2019t understand what they\u2019re talking about designing a really complicated system.\u201d So just how does a state create and regulate an entirely new business of intoxication that has always existed, essentially, in a countercultural, outlaw space? Canada, it turns out, did so cautiously, with every decision deliberated over by a centralised government Task Force. Added to the complexity of the policy and its implementation, the needle of international capital\u2019s wonky moral compass swung straight at these lucrative new markets. Hundreds of millions of dollars were raised on global capital markets and the Canadian landscape was quickly dotted with massive new grow sites. The so-called \u201cgreen rush\u201d had started and production went into overdrive. Stock prices soared and fortunes were staked, made, doubled and tripled in an atmosphere reminiscent of the 90s dotcom boom, or the Yukon gold rush of the 19th century, when 100,000 prospectors headed into the Canadian hinterlands in search of riches. Many firms hoped to corner the Canadian market by throwing millions of dollars of shareholders\u2019 money into massive grow sites. This time, the gold was green. But soon, things started to fall apart. The main problem Canada\u2019s smokers and growers faced was access: too few retail shops were able to open to serve the eager new market. Canada is a country of 38 million people, divided into 10 provinces that are similar to US states, with provincial governments producing a patchwork of varying regulations. Over a third \u2013 13.5 million \u2013 of all Canadians live in the state of Ontario. But as of 2 March this year, Ontario had just 41 retail cannabis stores. The province of Alberta, home to 4.4 million, has 423 stores. And where there was product available, the price was almost double that of the illegal market. C$5.59 to C$10.23 per gram (or over \u00a340 a quarter ounce). That was caused by tax burdens and overheads: the legal market has to comply with regulations on fungicide and pesticide residue levels, and draconian security requirements for grow sites, such as huge vaults in which to store the cannabis and record-keeping for every person who enters these vaults. The illegal market, meanwhile, is completely unregulated \u2013 and thriving because of this. Statistics Canada, a state agency, reports that just 29% of cannabis users buy all of their product from a legal source. Four in 10 Canadians told the organisation that they bought at least some cannabis from illegal sources in 2019. The next problem was that many stores sold poor-quality grass, with smokers complaining that it had been poorly dried and cured, and tasted bad. Modern cannabis users are accustomed to a range of flavours, from lemon to mango, pineapple, strawberry and pine. These flavours are derived from the plant\u2019s natural aroma profile, which skilled growers preserve by careful breeding, correct harvesting and slow, cautious curing of the fragrant flowers. Many players in the new mass market often skipped these steps in the pursuit of profit, says David Brown, a British Columbia-based cannabis industry analyst. \u201cMany consumers have had complaints about high prices and what is perceived as lower quality, especially the tendency of many of the legal dried flower products to be overly dried, often from a rushed or improper curing and drying process.\u201d Why would anyone drive a few miles up the road to score bad weed from many of the government shops when your regular black-market dealer lives nearby, has better product and brings it to your door for half the price? It\u2019s worth reflecting, also, on the psychology of some of these users. \u201cFor a long time, cannabis has been the mark of the rebel, the outsider, the outlaw,\u201d says Brown. \u201cA lot of the people who complain about \u2018bad weed\u2019 and so-called \u2018fake legalisation\u2019 are doing so because parts of their countercultural identity have been altered forever by this law change. Canada has made cannabis boring \u2013 and that was kind of the point.\u201d With few shops to sell to and customers clinging to their traditional dealers, the new cannabis corporations found themselves holding a glut of product. There is a stockpile of grass weighing in at 400 tonnes, at last count, according to official government inventory figures. The rollout of retail shops was left, in many cases, to inexperienced officials in provincial government departments, says McBride. \u201cOntario authorities said, \u2018We don\u2019t trust private organisations to run cannabis shops. We\u2019re going to do it all ourselves.\u2019 Then they tried to do it, but they squandered about $80 million trying to figure out how to do it, and got absolutely nowhere. They had to cancel it and invite private tenders. All these big, shiny grow facilities that cost C$10m, C$20m or C$30m to build, and which all grew loads of cannabis \u2013 there was nowhere to sell it, because there weren\u2019t any shops,\u201d he says. In a stinging irony, medical patients \u2013 the very people whose decades of activism had driven the wider reforms, faced cannabis shortages and a steep increase in price after legalisation as suppliers diverted their medical product in bulk to the new recreational market rather than in hundreds of smaller deals to medical patients. Dan Sutton of Tantalus Labs, a British Columbia-based grower that uses natural sunlight and greenhouses, says legalisation has been \u201clargely negative\u201d for medical cannabis users because of this new sales dynamic: \u201cPhysicians have been telling medical users they should buy from the recreational marketplace, which is completely inappropriate \u2013 and it loads them up with extra taxes and tariffs.\u201d Sutton originally built his low-impact, sunlit grow to service medical users, and still focuses on this original customer base \u2013 though they make up just 10% of his sales. \u201cMany licensed producers now don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cSome have just pulled their financial resources on their medical platforms. If a medical user can\u2019t get their medicine \u2013 for people, with, say, multiple sclerosis \u2013 that can lead to severe impairment, traffic accidents and potentially death. That blood is on those licensed producers\u2019 hands that stopped serving those users\u2019 needs,\u201d he says. Paul North, director of communications at Volteface, which commissioned me to write the paper, says Canadian customers\u2019 response to the malfunctioning new markets is understandable: \u201cYou have to provide a superior experience to the illicit market. When it comes to cannabis, this is not easy. Dealers have no marketing restrictions, and can offer a sweet deal and deliver a product to your door. For most people, cannabis use is a relaxing, problem-free and enjoyable experience. Buying the drug needs to match that experience, and; until it does, the illicit market will continue.\u201d Hype talks, but money walks. The early euphoria in the cannabis stock market has been replaced by a major dose of paranoia. All cannabis stocks have tanked, with an average 50% wipeout in value right across Canada and the US in the last year. Major players such as Aurora Cannabis took the biggest hit, with its shares falling from US$12.83 in March 2019 to US$2 today. Another bud behemoth, Tilray, has also had its share price slashed by 80%, from over US$81 to US$16 within a year. Other cannabis giants including Aphria lost 60% of their paper value in 2019, while Canopy Growth sank by 54%. Financing has dried up for the new industry, and small-scale retail investors \u2013 often young professionals investing via smartphone apps \u2013 have lost large sums of money. None of this is to assert that Canada\u2019s policy has been a failure. If we compare it to the UK cannabis industry, where illegally trafficked children have been found enslaved in abandoned buildings growing cannabis for gangsters, it is better by several orders of magnitude. Steve Rolles of UK-based drug law reform group Transform agrees that it is harsh to judge the project\u2019s success so soon. \u201cWe are still in the rollout phase. They are still in a transition from an illegal economy to a legally regulated one. It will take some time for new market equilibrium to be established, and for new social norms to emerge, and for teething problems to be addressed.\u201d How best to create a legal cannabis industry is a question with a particular urgency in the UK today as we build a market for medicinal use \u2013 albeit agonisingly slowly.

      "body": "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Spain records smallest percentage rise in infections since start of crisis</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s death toll has risen by 674 to 12,418 in the past 24 hours, according to figures that recorded the lowest number of victims in nine days. It is also the first time since 28 March that daily deaths have dropped below 800. The number of registered cases rose to 130,759 from 124,736, Spain\u2019s ministry said. The 5% rise in infections was the smallest increase since the start of the health crisis. Germany\u2019s confirmed coronavirus infections meanwhile rose by 5,936 in the past 24 hours to 91,714 on Sunday, the third straight drop in the daily rate of new cases.</p> <h2>Global cases pass 1.2 million</h2> <p>The number of confirmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-global-cases-pass-12m-as-trump-warns-us-of-worse-to-come\">cases globally has passed 1.2m</a>, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Just over one in four of these are in the US, which has<strong> </strong>311,544 cases. There have been 64,753 coronavirus-related deaths worldwide. The five countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases were the US, Spain, Italy, Germany and France. China, which is now at number six, reported 30 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, up from 19 a day earlier as the number of cases involving travellers from abroad as well as local transmissions increased.</p> <h2>Trump talks up unproven malaria drug</h2> <p>Donald Trump has directly urged Americans worried about Covid-19 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-us-ventilators-new-york-trump-touts-unproven-cure-malaria-drug\">take a little-studied anti-malaria drug for the disease</a>, despite potentially serious side effects and a lack of data on safety and efficacy in treatment of the pandemic virus. The president also warned the US that the worst was yet to come, and that Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/05/there-will-be-a-lot-of-death-trump-warning-as-covid-19-cases-in-us-pass-300000-video\">would see \u201ca lot of death\u201d</a>. At a lengthy, rambling and combative briefing on Saturday afternoon, the president sought to discredit media reports of his administration\u2019s failures and called some outlets in the White House press corps \u201cfake news\u201d. Scientists around the world are looking for potential treatments but so far have not found a success.</p> <h2>Lombardy enacts law obliging citizens to wear face masks</h2> <p>Authorities in Lombardy, the Italian region worst-affected by coronavirus, have enacted a law obliging citizens to wear face masks when they go outside. In the absence of a mask, people should \u201ccover their mouths and noses with a simple foulard or scarf\u201d, said Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. <br>The law came as <a href=\"https://video.corriere.it/cronaca/coronavirus-napoli-tanta-gente-strada-la-spesa-ma-questa-quarantena/733d255c-7599-11ea-856e-f9aa62c97d7a\">images from major cities </a>including Rome, Naples, Milan and Turin showed an increase in the number of people venturing out in recent days amid good weather.</p> <h2>Pandemic threatens survival of European Union, Spanish PM warns</h2> <p>The European Union\u2019s very survival is at stake and a new \u201cMarshall plan for Europe is needed\u201d to rebuild the continent\u2019s economies, Spain\u2019s prime minister has warned in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/europes-future-is-at-stake-in-this-war-against-coronavirus\">article published by the Guardian</a>. Europe must build a wartime economy and promote European resistance, reconstruction and recovery, Pedro S\u00e1nchez said. A critical juncture had been reached at which even the most fervently pro-European countries and governments, as is Spain\u2019s case, needed real proof of commitment in the form of \u201cunwavering solidarity\u201d.</p> <h2>African economics face \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d if virus not controlled</h2> <p>Economies in some parts of Africa face a \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d unless the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic is controlled, a senior UN official with responsibility for operations on the continent has said. Up to 50% of all projected job growth in Africa will be lost as aviation, services, exports, mining, agriculture and the informal sector all take a hit, according to Ahunna Eziakonwa, the United Nations Development Program regional director for Africa. She told Associated Press: \u201cWe will see a complete collapse of economies and livelihoods. Livelihoods will be wiped out in a way we have never seen before.\u201d</p> <h2>First case recorded in South Sudan as Iran puts death toll at 3,603</h2> <p>South Sudan, one of the world\u2019s poorest states where decades of war and hunger have already devastated infrastructure, has become one of the latest states to record a confirmed case of Covid-19. The case was a 29-year-old woman who arrived in February from the Netherlands, via Ethiopia. Elsewhere, Iran said Covid-19 infections stood at 58,226 while the death toll from the outbreak was 3,603.</p> <h2>Outdoor exercise could be banned if rules flouted, Britons warned</h2> <p>Outdoor exercise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/matt-hancock-warns-tougher-uk-lockdown-too-many-break-rules\">could be banned in Britain</a> if people flout the social distancing rules, the UK\u2019s health minister has warned. Matt Hancock said sunbathing in public spaces was against the government guidance, and told those who dared to disobey that they were putting their own and others\u2019 lives at risk. His warning came ahead of a televised address <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/queen-to-make-personal-tv-address-to-the-nation-on-sunday\">by the Queen</a>, who was expected to praise Britain for its \u201cself-discipline\u201d and \u201cresolve\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <h2>Australian authorities cautiously optimistic</h2> <p>Health authorities in Australia have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/health-officials-hopeful-australia-is-flattening-coronavirus-curve-but-warn-against-complacency\">expressed cautious optimism</a> that the country may be able to limit its domestic outbreak, as the nation\u2019s death toll reached 34.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Spain records smallest percentage rise in infections since start of crisis Spain\u2019s death toll has risen by 674 to 12,418 in the past 24 hours, according to figures that recorded the lowest number of victims in nine days. It is also the first time since 28 March that daily deaths have dropped below 800. The number of registered cases rose to 130,759 from 124,736, Spain\u2019s ministry said. The 5% rise in infections was the smallest increase since the start of the health crisis. Germany\u2019s confirmed coronavirus infections meanwhile rose by 5,936 in the past 24 hours to 91,714 on Sunday, the third straight drop in the daily rate of new cases. Global cases pass 1.2 million The number of confirmed cases globally has passed 1.2m, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Just over one in four of these are in the US, which has 311,544 cases. There have been 64,753 coronavirus-related deaths worldwide. The five countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases were the US, Spain, Italy, Germany and France. China, which is now at number six, reported 30 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, up from 19 a day earlier as the number of cases involving travellers from abroad as well as local transmissions increased. Trump talks up unproven malaria drug Donald Trump has directly urged Americans worried about Covid-19 to take a little-studied anti-malaria drug for the disease, despite potentially serious side effects and a lack of data on safety and efficacy in treatment of the pandemic virus. The president also warned the US that the worst was yet to come, and that Americans would see \u201ca lot of death\u201d. At a lengthy, rambling and combative briefing on Saturday afternoon, the president sought to discredit media reports of his administration\u2019s failures and called some outlets in the White House press corps \u201cfake news\u201d. Scientists around the world are looking for potential treatments but so far have not found a success. Lombardy enacts law obliging citizens to wear face masks Authorities in Lombardy, the Italian region worst-affected by coronavirus, have enacted a law obliging citizens to wear face masks when they go outside. In the absence of a mask, people should \u201ccover their mouths and noses with a simple foulard or scarf\u201d, said Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. The law came as images from major cities including Rome, Naples, Milan and Turin showed an increase in the number of people venturing out in recent days amid good weather. Pandemic threatens survival of European Union, Spanish PM warns The European Union\u2019s very survival is at stake and a new \u201cMarshall plan for Europe is needed\u201d to rebuild the continent\u2019s economies, Spain\u2019s prime minister has warned in article published by the Guardian. Europe must build a wartime economy and promote European resistance, reconstruction and recovery, Pedro S\u00e1nchez said. A critical juncture had been reached at which even the most fervently pro-European countries and governments, as is Spain\u2019s case, needed real proof of commitment in the form of \u201cunwavering solidarity\u201d. African economics face \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d if virus not controlled Economies in some parts of Africa face a \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d unless the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic is controlled, a senior UN official with responsibility for operations on the continent has said. Up to 50% of all projected job growth in Africa will be lost as aviation, services, exports, mining, agriculture and the informal sector all take a hit, according to Ahunna Eziakonwa, the United Nations Development Program regional director for Africa. She told Associated Press: \u201cWe will see a complete collapse of economies and livelihoods. Livelihoods will be wiped out in a way we have never seen before.\u201d First case recorded in South Sudan as Iran puts death toll at 3,603 South Sudan, one of the world\u2019s poorest states where decades of war and hunger have already devastated infrastructure, has become one of the latest states to record a confirmed case of Covid-19. The case was a 29-year-old woman who arrived in February from the Netherlands, via Ethiopia. Elsewhere, Iran said Covid-19 infections stood at 58,226 while the death toll from the outbreak was 3,603. Outdoor exercise could be banned if rules flouted, Britons warned Outdoor exercise could be banned in Britain if people flout the social distancing rules, the UK\u2019s health minister has warned. Matt Hancock said sunbathing in public spaces was against the government guidance, and told those who dared to disobey that they were putting their own and others\u2019 lives at risk. His warning came ahead of a televised address by the Queen, who was expected to praise Britain for its \u201cself-discipline\u201d and \u201cresolve\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic. Australian authorities cautiously optimistic Health authorities in Australia have expressed cautious optimism that the country may be able to limit its domestic outbreak, as the nation\u2019s death toll reached 34. However, senior officials have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early, saying that could lead to a resurgence in cases. The government has also warned its citizens that imported \u201chome\u201d Covid-19 test kits pose a serious risk to public health. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said the kits were not reliable and could lead to people failing to isolate themselves or seek the medical help they need. Criminal investigation launched into handling of cruise ship A criminal investigation is to be launched into the disastrous handling of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has become the single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia, the NSW police commissioner said on Sunday. Mike Fuller announced the move as it was revealed four more passengers from the ill-fated ship have died \u2013 bringing the total to 11, and accounting for more than 30% of all Australian Covid-19 deaths.

Returning to Tallahassee after visiting a coronavirus testing site in Miami and issuing a regional stay-at-home order for the state\u2019s four southernmost counties, he was preparing notes for an upcoming press conference and doubtless thinking about the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FLCaseyDeSantis/status/1244601703795765248\">birth of his third child</a>.</p> <p>The beaches below him were not packed, as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/28/americans-who-dont-take-coronavirus-seriously\">the enduring images</a> that will come to epitomize his lethargic response to the pandemic, but there were enough people milling about to alarm the elected leader of the only one of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-state-by-state-guide-to-coronavirus-lockdowns-11584749351\">the \u201chotspot\u201d states</a> \u2013 those with Covid-19 cases at that stage in excess of 5,000 \u2013 not to have imposed blanket stay-at-home restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cWere there people out there?

Even after issuing Monday\u2019s unified order affecting Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, the governor conceded it contained little that was new. \u201cI just came in and made them all one unit so everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/cruise-ship-coronavirus-passengers-zaandam-rotterdam-florida\">Passengers from coronavirus-hit cruise ships allowed to disembark in Florida</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To nobody\u2019s surprise, DeSantis was taking a leaf straight from the Trump playbook by prioritizing the economy, and listening to advice from the Florida chamber of commerce, Associated Industries of Florida and the state\u2019s restaurant and lodging association over that of public health officials warning of a coming disease tsunami, <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/03/25/gov-ron-desantis-wont-shut-down-florida-heres-who-hes-talking-to-about-that/\">according to the Tampa Bay Times</a>.</p> <p>It was all, in the words of Oscar Braynon, a state senator from Miami Gardens, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/03/24/dumbest-s-desantis-takes-heat-as-he-goes-his-own-way-on-coronavirus-1268818\">\u201cthe dumbest shit I have heard in a long time</a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/03/24/dumbest-s-desantis-takes-heat-as-he-goes-his-own-way-on-coronavirus-1268818\">\u201d</a>.</p> <p>That Florida\u2019s governor has been in lockstep with the messaging and posturing from the White House at every step of the pandemic, up to and including this week\u2019s abrupt volte-face<em>, </em>was a given, at least to those who have followed the former US congressman\u2019s career in Tallahassee.</p> <p>DeSantis \u2013 hailed from the Rose Garden lectern as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/31/824905343/fact-check-trump-praises-florida-governor-despite-criticism-of-coronavirus-respo\">a great governor</a> who knows exactly what he is doing\u201d \u2013 consults with Trump regularly and the two share a similar ideology.</p> <p>As Trump frequently and controversially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/us-china-coronavirus-diplomacy\">called Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d</a>, DeSantis was also castigating outsiders, blaming New Yorkers for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2020/03/28/desantis-supports-trumps-plan-to-quarantine-new-york-1269491\">seeding\u201d the spread in Florida</a> and dispatching <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241471451.html\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241471451.html\">national </a><a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241471451.html\">guard </a><a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241471451.html\">to airports</a> to intercept them. When the president mooted plans to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-guidelines-trump-calls-for-classifying-risk-county-by-county.html\">classify counties by risk level</a>, then last weekend floated the idea of a quarantine for New York, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2020/03/28/desantis-supports-trumps-plan-to-quarantine-new-york-1269491\">DeSantis gave his full support</a>.</p> <p>And as the pressure built this week for a statewide stay-at-home edict, DeSantis admitted he would be taking his orders directly from Washington DC. \u201cWhatever they\u2019re recommending we\u2019ll go ahead and do that,\u201d he said at the Tuesday press briefing. \u201cIf any of those taskforce folks tell me we should do X, Y or Z, then of course we\u2019re going to consider, but nobody has said that to me thus far.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018He put us in a dangerous situation\u2019</h2> <p>The instruction duly came on Wednesday morning, in the form of an appearance on NBC\u2019s Today<em> </em>program by Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general. Asked about DeSantis\u2019s prevarication, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/490562-surgeon-general-coronavirus-guidelines-represent-national-stay-at-home-order\">Adams responded</a> by quoting Trump\u2019s extension of social distancing measures the night before: \u201cMy advice to America would be that these guidelines are a national stay-at-home order.\u201d</p> <p>The message was unmistakable. Trump and DeSantis spoke again by phone later on Wednesday morning, and by mid-afternoon, with the state\u2019s coronavirus death toll ticking above 100 for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2020/EO_20-91.pdf\">Florida executive order 20-91</a> was published. DeSantis said on Thursday on Fox News that the U-turn \u201cwas the right thing to do\u201d because of the Trump extension.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a governor who does not believe he serves the people of Florida but rather kowtows to the president of the United States,\u201d Donna Shalala, a congressional representative for Miami who was the US secretary of health during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, told reporters on Thursday morning.</p> <p>The delay in publishing the order, she added, had been a critical miscalculation. \u201cHe hesitated and hesitated and hesitated. He has put us in a dangerous situation. Numerous people will die because our governor hesitated,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The question now is what consequence the order will have, and whether it has come too late to significantly alter experts\u2019 predictions of a spike in deaths in Florida. On Thursday the University of Washington\u2019s institute for health was still predicting cases in the state would <a href=\"https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections\">crest in early May</a>, but increased its projected peak daily death toll from 136 to 175, a rate that would lead to about 7,000 deaths by mid-June.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to plan for a tsunami on the horizon that everybody is hoping is going to miss our island but is bearing straight down on us,\u201d said Dr Kayser Enneking, professor of anesthesiology at the University of Florida\u2019s department of medicine.</p> <p>\u201cThe response we\u2019ve seen from the state and federal governments has been based not on science but the gut of our leaders. The number of cases in Florida is on the exponential rise, but the lack of testing has impacted our ability to predict where we are in this crisis.\u201d</p> <h2>State was \u2018woefully underprepared\u2019</h2> <p>The picture is also muddled over the medical supplies and equipment Florida says it will need. Last Sunday, Trump insisted that the state\u2019s wishlist, including 5,000 ventilators, half a million each of gloves and gowns, and 2m N95 face masks, had been met from federal supplies. \u201cFlorida has been taken care of,\u201d the president promised. \u201cI looked, they\u2019re very aggressive in trying to get things done and they\u2019re doing a very good job.\u201d</p> <p>But by the following afternoon Jared Moskowitz, appointed by DeSantis as Florida\u2019s director of emergency management last year, had resorted to Twitter, frustrated by failed efforts to bring more masks to the state and lamenting a lack of a federal allocation system.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like a Ponzi scheme,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaredEMoskowitz/status/1244808519465029632\">he wrote</a>, referring to the third-party distribution scheme for equipment <a href=\"https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/All-3M-Products/Consumer/Personal-Safety/Masks-Respirators/?N=5002385+8709316+8710670+8710839+8711017+8735361+3294857497&amp;rt=r3\">manufactured by 3M</a>. \u201cDifferent distributors represented by brokers selling the same lot of masks bidding against each other. I\u2019m chasing ghosts here.\u201d</p> <p>As for testing, Jane Castor, the mayor of Tampa, told Slate she believed the state was <a href=\"https://slate.com/podcasts/what-next/2020/03/a-florida-mayor-prepares-for-covid-19\">\u201cwoefully underprepared</a><a href=\"https://slate.com/podcasts/what-next/2020/03/a-florida-mayor-prepares-for-covid-19\">\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn Hillsborough county, we received just 900 collection kits over a week ago. We went through those in two days. We just received another thousand, and we\u2019ll get through those in two days as well,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She was, however, reluctant to place the blame solely on DeSantis: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time this governor\u2019s been through it. What a hell of a test this is.\u201d</p> <p>George Moraitis, chair of Broward county\u2019s Republican party, was even more generous. \u201cGovernor DeSantis is under the microscope but he\u2019s excelling,\u201d he wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/commentary/fl-op-com-moraitis-desantis-leadership-coronavirus-20200331-sohazgf4zzcljcknwnfyll27qe-story.html\">Sun-Sentinel op-ed</a>. \u201cHe is leading Florida through the Covid-19 outbreak with measured, informed and effective actions to protect both the health and the fundamental rights of all Floridians.\u201d</p> <p>Evan Jenne, co-leader elect of Florida\u2019s House Democrats, told the Guardian<em> </em>that further down the line he would call for a legislative select committee to evaluate the actions of DeSantis and his administration throughout the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to know what went right and what went wrong. I have a feeling that both of those will be long lists,\u201d he said. DeSantis\u2019s decree, however, will appear firmly in the second category, in Jenne\u2019s view, not least because it exempts churches and places of worship.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an executive order with holes big enough you could drive an 18-wheeler through it. Mass meetings of worshipping folks are perfectly fine, and that\u2019s not going to help,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAt no point in our nation\u2019s history has human sacrifice ever been an acceptable form of worship and you\u2019re potentially going to kill someone, if not put them through respiratory hell. It\u2019s not strict enough in any way, shape or form.\u201d</p>",

Not everyone believes they need to govern themselves accordingly.\u201d The scenes on the beaches had clearly resonated with the governor. On Wednesday, before another 24 hours had passed, DeSantis finally issued the statewide shelter-in-place order for Florida\u2019s population of 21 million \u2013 one in five of whom are older than 65 \u2013 that health officials, scientists and political opponents had been pleading with him to sign for more than two weeks. During that time, as the number of cases and fatalities grew, Florida\u2019s beaches remained open, thousands flocked to church services (in defiance of local rules) and carefree seniors in the country\u2019s fastest-growing retirement hub, The Villages, did what they always do: play golf. Offshore, cruise ships stricken with dead or infected crew and passengers waited, unsure if they would be allowed to dock. \u2018DeSantis took a leaf from the Trump playbook\u2019 Meanwhile, DeSantis appeared to fiddle while Florida burned. He pressed ahead with his patchwork management of the crisis: a partial closure in some areas, interstate roadblocks to deter visitors, asking bars and restaurants to shutter, but mostly allowing cities and counties to set their own rules. Even after issuing Monday\u2019s unified order affecting Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, the governor conceded it contained little that was new. \u201cI just came in and made them all one unit so everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. To nobody\u2019s surprise, DeSantis was taking a leaf straight from the Trump playbook by prioritizing the economy, and listening to advice from the Florida chamber of commerce, Associated Industries of Florida and the state\u2019s restaurant and lodging association over that of public health officials warning of a coming disease tsunami, according to the Tampa Bay Times. It was all, in the words of Oscar Braynon, a state senator from Miami Gardens, \u201cthe dumbest shit I have heard in a long time\u201d. That Florida\u2019s governor has been in lockstep with the messaging and posturing from the White House at every step of the pandemic, up to and including this week\u2019s abrupt volte-face, was a given, at least to those who have followed the former US congressman\u2019s career in Tallahassee. DeSantis \u2013 hailed from the Rose Garden lectern as \u201ca great governor who knows exactly what he is doing\u201d \u2013 consults with Trump regularly and the two share a similar ideology. As Trump frequently and controversially called Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, DeSantis was also castigating outsiders, blaming New Yorkers for \u201cseeding\u201d the spread in Florida and dispatching the national guard to airports to intercept them. When the president mooted plans to classify counties by risk level, then last weekend floated the idea of a quarantine for New York, DeSantis gave his full support. And as the pressure built this week for a statewide stay-at-home edict, DeSantis admitted he would be taking his orders directly from Washington DC. \u201cWhatever they\u2019re recommending we\u2019ll go ahead and do that,\u201d he said at the Tuesday press briefing. \u201cIf any of those taskforce folks tell me we should do X, Y or Z, then of course we\u2019re going to consider, but nobody has said that to me thus far.\u201d \u2018He put us in a dangerous situation\u2019 The instruction duly came on Wednesday morning, in the form of an appearance on NBC\u2019s Today program by Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general. Asked about DeSantis\u2019s prevarication, Adams responded by quoting Trump\u2019s extension of social distancing measures the night before: \u201cMy advice to America would be that these guidelines are a national stay-at-home order.\u201d The message was unmistakable. Trump and DeSantis spoke again by phone later on Wednesday morning, and by mid-afternoon, with the state\u2019s coronavirus death toll ticking above 100 for the first time, Florida executive order 20-91 was published. DeSantis said on Thursday on Fox News that the U-turn \u201cwas the right thing to do\u201d because of the Trump extension. \u201cWe have a governor who does not believe he serves the people of Florida but rather kowtows to the president of the United States,\u201d Donna Shalala, a congressional representative for Miami who was the US secretary of health during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, told reporters on Thursday morning. The delay in publishing the order, she added, had been a critical miscalculation. \u201cHe hesitated and hesitated and hesitated. He has put us in a dangerous situation. Numerous people will die because our governor hesitated,\u201d she said. The question now is what consequence the order will have, and whether it has come too late to significantly alter experts\u2019 predictions of a spike in deaths in Florida. On Thursday the University of Washington\u2019s institute for health was still predicting cases in the state would crest in early May, but increased its projected peak daily death toll from 136 to 175, a rate that would lead to about 7,000 deaths by mid-June. \u201cWe are trying to plan for a tsunami on the horizon that everybody is hoping is going to miss our island but is bearing straight down on us,\u201d said Dr Kayser Enneking, professor of anesthesiology at the University of Florida\u2019s department of medicine. \u201cThe response we\u2019ve seen from the state and federal governments has been based not on science but the gut of our leaders. The number of cases in Florida is on the exponential rise, but the lack of testing has impacted our ability to predict where we are in this crisis.\u201d State was \u2018woefully underprepared\u2019 The picture is also muddled over the medical supplies and equipment Florida says it will need. Last Sunday, Trump insisted that the state\u2019s wishlist, including 5,000 ventilators, half a million each of gloves and gowns, and 2m N95 face masks, had been met from federal supplies. \u201cFlorida has been taken care of,\u201d the president promised. \u201cI looked, they\u2019re very aggressive in trying to get things done and they\u2019re doing a very good job.\u201d But by the following afternoon Jared Moskowitz, appointed by DeSantis as Florida\u2019s director of emergency management last year, had resorted to Twitter, frustrated by failed efforts to bring more masks to the state and lamenting a lack of a federal allocation system. \u201cIt feels like a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he wrote, referring to the third-party distribution scheme for equipment manufactured by 3M. \u201cDifferent distributors represented by brokers selling the same lot of masks bidding against each other. I\u2019m chasing ghosts here.\u201d As for testing, Jane Castor, the mayor of Tampa, told Slate she believed the state was \u201cwoefully underprepared\u201d. \u201cIn Hillsborough county, we received just 900 collection kits over a week ago. We went through those in two days. We just received another thousand, and we\u2019ll get through those in two days as well,\u201d she said. She was, however, reluctant to place the blame solely on DeSantis: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time this governor\u2019s been through it. What a hell of a test this is.\u201d George Moraitis, chair of Broward county\u2019s Republican party, was even more generous. \u201cGovernor DeSantis is under the microscope but he\u2019s excelling,\u201d he wrote in a Sun-Sentinel op-ed. \u201cHe is leading Florida through the Covid-19 outbreak with measured, informed and effective actions to protect both the health and the fundamental rights of all Floridians.\u201d Evan Jenne, co-leader elect of Florida\u2019s House Democrats, told the Guardian that further down the line he would call for a legislative select committee to evaluate the actions of DeSantis and his administration throughout the crisis. \u201cWe need to know what went right and what went wrong. I have a feeling that both of those will be long lists,\u201d he said. DeSantis\u2019s decree, however, will appear firmly in the second category, in Jenne\u2019s view, not least because it exempts churches and places of worship. \u201cIt\u2019s an executive order with holes big enough you could drive an 18-wheeler through it. Mass meetings of worshipping folks are perfectly fine, and that\u2019s not going to help,\u201d he said. \u201cAt no point in our nation\u2019s history has human sacrifice ever been an acceptable form of worship and you\u2019re potentially going to kill someone, if not put them through respiratory hell. It\u2019s not strict enough in any way, shape or form.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cComing out here is definitely the best thing I\u2019ve done,\u201d George Cox says. The Brighton left-back is enjoying an interrupted season on loan at Fortuna Sittard, one of many players taking advantage of the chance to develop in the Eredivisie.</p> <p>Fortuna are open about their transfer policy: they acquire young talent and give them the opportunity to play top-flight matches. The aim is to build up the players and sell them on. Loanees such as Cox have a clause allowing the club to sign them permanently and a chance regardless to show whether they are up to the rigours of the professional game.</p> <p>At the start of the season Cox could have dropped down the divisions in England or moved to the Netherlands. \u201cFor my development, I have learned so much over the year. League Two just isn\u2019t the best decision and sometimes it\u2019s sprung on people, as there is an attitude that you need to work your way up in England, but some people need to try something new and going abroad is definitely the best thing.\u201d</p> <p>Cox had a spell at Northampton in League Two last season during which he was limited to five appearances but he has played 21 games for Fortuna, becoming a regular under the manager, Sjors Ultee, and his assistant Kevin Hofland, a former Netherlands international who knows a thing or two about defending.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You must see it as a school, that by going abroad you will learn something new with a new teacher</p> <footer> <cite>Kevin Hofland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe standard is massive; Ajax are leaps and bounds above other teams,\u201d Cox says. \u201cI played against Ajax in my third game and the standard hits you straight away and I don\u2019t think people realise how clever they are. I was playing against Quincy Promes but still had [Donny] Van de Beek and [Dusan] Tadic getting into areas near me and making my life difficult. The step up is crazy, not just their technical ability but their brain and how it works on the pitch.\u201d</p> <p>Todd Cantwell also had a spell at Fortuna before returning to Norwich, where he has proved himself in the Premier League. Cox\u2019s time in the Netherlands has seen him attract attention and numerous scouts have watched him. Given the very technical style of England\u2019s best academies, Cox feels more people in situations similar to his should consider broadening their horizons.</p> <p>\u201cIt can open so many doors and it shows people you have a brave personality, you\u2019re not afraid to go out of your comfort zone, going somewhere new. Todd Cantwell is absolutely flying now at Norwich and this move kickstarted his career. Moving abroad, I think, is the best option for 80% of under-23 players in England.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ae436679bb683d570c0f90d937f3d44b78112fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ae436679bb683d570c0f90d937f3d44b78112fe/0_88_1832_1099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Cox in discussions with Fortuna\u2019s assistant manager, Kevin Hofland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Cox in discussions with Fortuna\u2019s assistant manager, Kevin Hofland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANP Sport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within the Fortuna squad there are players on loan from clubs across Europe, including Valencia, Borussia Dortmund and Juventus, a sign they have a wide net and are trusted to develop youngsters. \u201cI think for many years ours is the best development league for young players,\u201d Hofland says. \u201cI felt this when I was a player, too. When I went abroad I saw different things. I learned things in the academies in Holland and then at 23 or 24, I went away.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you hear from players coming from abroad, especially from England \u2013 as we had Cantwell, we have Cox and [last season Cian] Harries [now of Bristol Rovers] from Swansea \u2013 what you feel and hear, especially in the tactical part, is that they have not had the education in this, especially the way we educate the players. This is different here and it is good for young players and it\u2019s good to deal with coaches who have had a different education. I think this is the main difference for us as coaches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou must see it as a school, that by going abroad you will learn something new with a new teacher. Maybe [in] one, three or six months you will improve but it will take time. They need to get used to the culture and we say this to the clubs but they trust us.\u201d</p> <p>The different perspective from Hofland has helped Cox in his understanding of the game.

      "bodyText": "\u201cComing out here is definitely the best thing I\u2019ve done,\u201d George Cox says. The Brighton left-back is enjoying an interrupted season on loan at Fortuna Sittard, one of many players taking advantage of the chance to develop in the Eredivisie. Fortuna are open about their transfer policy: they acquire young talent and give them the opportunity to play top-flight matches. The aim is to build up the players and sell them on. Loanees such as Cox have a clause allowing the club to sign them permanently and a chance regardless to show whether they are up to the rigours of the professional game. At the start of the season Cox could have dropped down the divisions in England or moved to the Netherlands. \u201cFor my development, I have learned so much over the year. League Two just isn\u2019t the best decision and sometimes it\u2019s sprung on people, as there is an attitude that you need to work your way up in England, but some people need to try something new and going abroad is definitely the best thing.\u201d Cox had a spell at Northampton in League Two last season during which he was limited to five appearances but he has played 21 games for Fortuna, becoming a regular under the manager, Sjors Ultee, and his assistant Kevin Hofland, a former Netherlands international who knows a thing or two about defending. \u201cThe standard is massive; Ajax are leaps and bounds above other teams,\u201d Cox says. \u201cI played against Ajax in my third game and the standard hits you straight away and I don\u2019t think people realise how clever they are. I was playing against Quincy Promes but still had [Donny] Van de Beek and [Dusan] Tadic getting into areas near me and making my life difficult. The step up is crazy, not just their technical ability but their brain and how it works on the pitch.\u201d Todd Cantwell also had a spell at Fortuna before returning to Norwich, where he has proved himself in the Premier League. Cox\u2019s time in the Netherlands has seen him attract attention and numerous scouts have watched him. Given the very technical style of England\u2019s best academies, Cox feels more people in situations similar to his should consider broadening their horizons. \u201cIt can open so many doors and it shows people you have a brave personality, you\u2019re not afraid to go out of your comfort zone, going somewhere new. Todd Cantwell is absolutely flying now at Norwich and this move kickstarted his career. Moving abroad, I think, is the best option for 80% of under-23 players in England.\u201d Within the Fortuna squad there are players on loan from clubs across Europe, including Valencia, Borussia Dortmund and Juventus, a sign they have a wide net and are trusted to develop youngsters. \u201cI think for many years ours is the best development league for young players,\u201d Hofland says. \u201cI felt this when I was a player, too. When I went abroad I saw different things. I learned things in the academies in Holland and then at 23 or 24, I went away. \u201cWhat you hear from players coming from abroad, especially from England \u2013 as we had Cantwell, we have Cox and [last season Cian] Harries [now of Bristol Rovers] from Swansea \u2013 what you feel and hear, especially in the tactical part, is that they have not had the education in this, especially the way we educate the players. This is different here and it is good for young players and it\u2019s good to deal with coaches who have had a different education. I think this is the main difference for us as coaches. \u201cYou must see it as a school, that by going abroad you will learn something new with a new teacher. Maybe [in] one, three or six months you will improve but it will take time. They need to get used to the culture and we say this to the clubs but they trust us.\u201d The different perspective from Hofland has helped Cox in his understanding of the game. When football returns after the coronavirus crisis, Fortuna are due to continue their fight against relegation. Cox appreciates the importance of every game but says that could apply in England\u2019s lower divisions, too. \u201cThe difference is that I get to play against top players most weeks, whereas in League Two it\u2019s not like that. The opportunity to go to Ajax and PSV away, I think that\u2019s what sold it to me mainly.\u201d The next steps for anyone in football are a uncertain. Cox is out of contract in the summer and is waiting to find out whether Fortuna will make his deal permanent. Alternatively, he could continue his career elsewhere whether in the UK or abroad. Whatever the next chapter, Cox is thankful for this season\u2019s experience: \u201cI have been at Brighton since I was 10 years old and I haven\u2019t stepped out of my comfort zone properly. It has been the perfect place for me to come and develop.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jesus Contreras tore into his breakfast sandwich after getting off a 24-hour shift as a paramedic in the Houston area of Texas. He had got maybe 15 minutes\u2019 sleep the night before. Contreras, 26, is on the frontline of the US response to the coronavirus pandemic, a health crisis of epic proportions. But he is also one of an estimated 29,000 people in healthcare occupations who rely on an Obama-era immigration policy to shield them from deportation, according to a forthcoming analysis from the Center for American Progress (Cap). Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, allows undocumented \u201cDreamers\u201d who came to the United States as kids to work legally and live without the constant looming threat of immigration enforcement officers knocking on their doors. As the supreme court considers whether to greenlight his and hundreds of thousands of other potential deportations during this global pandemic, Contreras believes that getting rid of so many healthcare workers and other talented individuals when the country desperately needs them doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201cFrom a heartfelt perspective, it\u2019s like, you know, betraying us despite all the things that we\u2019re doing. From a logical perspective, it\u2019s just counterintuitive,\u201d he said. Many of these roughly 650,000 young people have grown up almost entirely in the US and are deeply rooted in their communities. Contreras, for example, moved to Texas when he was six years old and has lived in the Houston area for two decades. Daca has allowed more than 3,000 registered nurses, almost 5,000 nursing and home health aides and about 4,000 medical assistants to enter their professions, among other healthcare fields, Cap found. Nearly 200 of the program\u2019s beneficiaries are medical students, residents or physicians, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). Donald Trump has been adamant about ending Daca, a goal that\u2019s been stalled for years because of drawn-out court battles that have finally landed in front of the supreme court. Now, the country\u2019s foremost justices are in the process of concluding whether the Trump administration can legally move forward with its plans to rescind the policy, or if that action is even judicially reviewable. Oral arguments took place in November. Their decision is due at any moment. Daniel, a 32-year-old registered nurse in New Jersey who asked to use only his first name because he feared retaliation at work, has sometimes worried about being able to financially support his loved ones if he could no longer renew Daca.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration is determined to withdraw from a 28-year-old treaty intended to reduce the risk of an accidental war between the west and Russia by allowing reconnaissance flights over each other\u2019s territory. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, which has put off a full national security council (NSC) meeting on the Open Skies Treaty (OST), the secretary of defence, Mark Esper, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have agreed to proceed with a US exit, according to two sources familiar with administration planning. A statement of intent is expected soon, with a formal notification of withdrawal issued a few months later, possibly at the end of the fiscal year in September. The US would cease to be a party to the treaty six months after that, so if a new president were elected in November, the decision could be reversed before taking effect. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, reconnaissance flights under the treaty have been suspended until 26 April. The US has complained about what it says are Russian infringements of the treaty, which was signed in 1992 and has been in force since 2002: limitations on flights over the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad to less than 500km and the creation of an exclusion corridor along the border of the Russian-occupied regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russia imposed the limitation over Kaliningrad after a prolonged zigzagging Polish overflight in 2014 closed down aviation for a day. Russia allowed an extended flight over Kaliningrad in February. One of the reasons Esper has cited for US withdrawal is to save money by not replacing the two Boeing OC-135B planes the US uses for its Open Skies reconnaissance flights. Congress appropriated $41.5m last year for the cost of replacement but the Pentagon spending request published in February contained no budget for the new planes. Esper told Congress he was awaiting a decision from the president. Three Republican hawks in the Senate, Richard Burr, Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz, sent a letter to the administration in March calling for withdrawal, for cost and security reasons. \u201cThe costs of the OST go far beyond wasteful spending, and directly erode our national security by enabling Russian espionage over the United States,\u201d the senators wrote. Supporters of the Open Skies Treaty say the US and its allies benefit from it more than Russia, with three times more overflights of Russian territory than Russian flights over US and allied territory. Furthermore, US withdrawal would not stop Russian reconnaissance flights over US bases in Europe. \u201cThe administration has yet to put forward any proposals on how to fix the two main issues that we\u2019re having with the treaty, and our allies have reiterated again and again, that they do not want us to leave the treaty,\u201d said Alexandra Bell, a former state department arms control official and now senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. \u201cThe administration doesn\u2019t seem to have any plan of what to do about US bases in Europe.\u201d The Democratic senators Bob Menendez and Jack Reed wrote to the administration in February, saying: \u201cThe Open Skies Treaty is an important multilateral agreement that operates as a critical transparency tool for the United States and our allied treaty partners. It provides the United States and our partners real-time, comprehensive images of Russian military facilities. \u201cIf this administration moves forward with a precipitous unilateral withdrawal from the treaty the United States will be less safe and secure,\u201d Last year, the US set out questionnaires to its allies about their views on the treaty\u2019s value. The UK and other Europeans sent emphatic appeals for the US to remain part of the agreement. Ukraine also publicly underlined the strategic importance it attaches to the treaty. But the administration has so far not shared the result of its survey with Congress. The NSC was due to conduct a \u201cprincipals meeting\u201d of top administration officials in February to discuss two options: immediate announcement of withdrawal, or a period of a few months consultation with allies pending a final decision, as a final warning to Russia. The principals meeting was put off until 11 March and then postponed again, in the face of the pandemic. But the absence of an NSC discussion does not appear to have stopped the momentum for US withdrawal. The Open Skies Treaty is the latest arms control agreement to be targeted by the Trump administration, which has walked out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said: \u201cAt a time when the need for international cooperation, couldn\u2019t be any more obvious, with respect to dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, it is foreign policy malpractice for the Donald J Trump administration to withdraw from a treaty that has been in effect for nearly 30 years against the wishes of the United States closest allies in Europe.\u201d",

Two other men, both said to be from Sudan, one of whom shared a flat with the suspect, are also being questioned in police custody.

Its intended run, from 13 February to 17 May, was curtailed by the coronavirus outbreak. Fortunately, we are left with a handsome and well-illustrated catalog from Yale University Press.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/wilmingtons-lie-review-david-zucchino\">Wilmington's Lie review: race, outrage and the roots of modern inequality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In eight chapters, leading authorities discuss aspects of a nearly decade-long collaboration between the two men. As each is <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/the-hidden-sargent-39/\">thought to have been gay</a>, the studies raise an unanswered question: were they involved intimately? The catalogue also examines McKeller\u2019s invisibility in light of long-term and widespread demeaning depictions or outright erasures of black people in American art and media, in the service of white supremacy.</p> <p>In 1916, at 60, renowned as a portrait painter, Sargent approached the close of his life. In Boston, he undertook the second of three civic mural commissions, hoping to gain immortal fame by decorating the entrance halls of the Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard\u2019s Widener Library.</p> <p>McKeller was 26 and had worked as a bellhop at Sargent\u2019s hotel. Possessed of a magnificent physique, he became the painter\u2019s preferred model.</p> <p>Sargent\u2019s projects were not without irony. Under Abbot Lawrence Lowell, Harvard was undergoing an <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Court_of_1920\">inquisition</a> to uncover and expel gays. The college president also wanted a <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/21/lowell-375-profile/\">quota for Jews</a>, while the university barred black students from campus housing. Harvard would even, for 70 years, credit the library <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/02/recognizing-architect-julian-abeles-contributions-to-harvard/\">not to its black architect</a> but to his white employer.</p> <p>Given all that, it is not surprising that in Sargent\u2019s finished work, McKeller was never depicted as himself.</p> <p>Among allegorical decorations, neither McKeller\u2019s kind eyes nor his placid face look back. Only his supple musculature is faithfully rendered. McKeller is sometimes older, he is intermittently younger, he is sometimes female and he is even divine. But he is always white.</p> <p>The sole exception is a remarkable portrait sketch, painted for the artist\u2019s pleasure over an unfinished image of a bird. Phantom wings make the man a superman. It is quite unlike anything else Sargent ever did.</p> <p>The Gardner is hardly unique in having few African Americans on its staff.

      "bodyText": "Boston\u2019s Apollo: Thomas McKeller and John Singer Sargent, an exhibition at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, was meant to examine a contradiction of race and visibility. Its intended run, from 13 February to 17 May, was curtailed by the coronavirus outbreak. Fortunately, we are left with a handsome and well-illustrated catalog from Yale University Press. In eight chapters, leading authorities discuss aspects of a nearly decade-long collaboration between the two men. As each is thought to have been gay, the studies raise an unanswered question: were they involved intimately? The catalogue also examines McKeller\u2019s invisibility in light of long-term and widespread demeaning depictions or outright erasures of black people in American art and media, in the service of white supremacy. In 1916, at 60, renowned as a portrait painter, Sargent approached the close of his life. In Boston, he undertook the second of three civic mural commissions, hoping to gain immortal fame by decorating the entrance halls of the Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard\u2019s Widener Library. McKeller was 26 and had worked as a bellhop at Sargent\u2019s hotel. Possessed of a magnificent physique, he became the painter\u2019s preferred model. Sargent\u2019s projects were not without irony. Under Abbot Lawrence Lowell, Harvard was undergoing an inquisition to uncover and expel gays. The college president also wanted a quota for Jews, while the university barred black students from campus housing. Harvard would even, for 70 years, credit the library not to its black architect but to his white employer. Given all that, it is not surprising that in Sargent\u2019s finished work, McKeller was never depicted as himself. Among allegorical decorations, neither McKeller\u2019s kind eyes nor his placid face look back. Only his supple musculature is faithfully rendered. McKeller is sometimes older, he is intermittently younger, he is sometimes female and he is even divine. But he is always white. The sole exception is a remarkable portrait sketch, painted for the artist\u2019s pleasure over an unfinished image of a bird. Phantom wings make the man a superman. It is quite unlike anything else Sargent ever did. The Gardner is hardly unique in having few African Americans on its staff. For the Sargent-McKeller project, Catherine Morris, a member of the museum\u2019s education department, convened community consultants who saw to black scholars\u2019 inclusion. Helga Davis, visiting curator, conducted interviews with McKeller\u2019s last living relation, Deirdre McKeller O\u2019Bryant. She elicited a crucial bit of family lore. Tom McKeller was suspected to have been gay, and had a greater reason than simple terror to leave Wilmington, North Carolina, the site of a notorious massacre in 1898, and travel north to Boston. Lead curator Nathaniel Silver\u2019s catalogue introduction, meanwhile, indicates how empathy can sometimes make a world of difference. Silver explains the Gardner project as originating from his \u201cdiscovery\u201d of a folio of signed sketches, some showing McKeller, which Sargent presented to his friend, patron and confidante Belle Gardner in 1922. Discerning that some showed the same black man, Silver became curious as to the model\u2019s identity. However, Trevor Fairbrother, an independent art historian who wrote the penultimate catalogue chapter, already knew it was McKeller \u2013 and more besides. He knew the Gardner had published selections from the folio twice before. He was aware that Sargent\u2019s ravishing oil sketch had a prominent position in the artist\u2019s studio but nonetheless spent 70 years in storage. In 1986, it was Fairbrother\u2019s unstinting work that convinced the Boston Museum of Fine Arts to purchase Sargent\u2019s Portrait of a Negro Nude. There it joined works by John Singleton Copley, William Sidney Mount and Winslow Homer, resonant of a conception of not just black humanity but of an African American nobility. Such works have echoes elsewhere, and not only on gallery walls. Not too many years after Sargent worked at Harvard and the Gardner, for example, African Americans in New York City were determined to promote public art espousing racial uplift. Much of the work they commissioned was more publicly visible. In 1937, at the Harlem Court House, murals celebrating American independence and emancipation were commenced by a Japanese American painter, Eitaro Ishigaki. Each portrayed black people pursuing freedom, led by Washington and Lincoln. Both, however, were found wanting. The \u201ccommunity\u201d, said local papers, felt Lincoln looked \u201ctoo Negroid\u201d and Washington \u201ctoo stern\u201d. A vain attempt was made to address the complaints but New York City aldermen ordered the murals destroyed. In 1938, two new scenes \u2013 Exploitation of Labor and The Hoarding of Wealth by David Karfunkle \u2013 were installed in place of the original murals. They are still there but they are now censored in their turn, obscured by a heavy curtain, Karfunkle\u2019s representation of history including slavery and nudity having offended a black court worker. I discovered Ishigaki\u2019s ill-fated contribution to the courthouse by accident, during a decade-long quest for the identity of the artist who created a 50ft pantheon of notable \u201cNegroes\u201d not far away, at the Joe Louis Bar and Restaurant on 125th Street near Fifth Avenue. That building was designed by a black architect, Vertner Woodson Tandy, and inside and out it was sleekly modernistic. I was eventually able to determine that the mural was painted by a Cuban-born Italian Mexican American, Robert Edward Borgatta, and completed in August 1946. Commissioned by the heroic \u201cBrown Bomber\u201d, including his unmistakable likeness, how different the Joe Louis Bar and Restaurant mural was from Sargent\u2019s hidden images of McKeller. And yet it too was barely seen. It lasted only a year. The restaurant failed, and became a grocery store. Such is the fragility of black nobility in art.

But there are prominent exceptions, such as the Florida pastor Rodney Howard-Browne, who has now decided to shutter his River at Tampa Bay church for this weekend\u2019s Palm Sunday services anyway, and the Life Tabernacle church in Louisiana. Dozens of cases of coronavirus have been reported at a California megachurch. \u201cThe ability to gather as people of faith is our first freedom. But as with other freedoms now cabined in the name of public safety, religious freedom must take a backseat, at least for now,\u201d is the view of an editorial by three Canopy analysts, Robin Fretwell Wilson, Brian Smith and Tanner Bean. \u201cNow is not the time to stand on our rights. It is not the time to pursue contentious religious freedom claims in the courthouse. Instead, it is a time to lead by example, as so many congregations and people of faith have done.\u201d",

In the mean time you can follow our rolling global coverage here. Goodnight, stay well, and stay at home. On ABC news, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews says that year 12 students will be able to sit their exams and get an Atar \u2014 a university entrance score \u2014 but possibly not until next year. Said Andrews: It is my aim that they can get an Atar, if not within this calendar year, then very soon thereafter. We\u2019ve got six or eight weeks at the end of the year that we can catch up with, if you like, when school was scheduled to finish. And when we get to that sort of Christmas holiday, we\u2019re in conversations with universities, with Tafe. We\u2019re talking to other states and territories and of course, the commonwealth. I know it\u2019s very frustrating, including in my own household. I can\u2019t give [my son] Noah who is in year 12 all the answers he wants, but as soon as we can, we will. The key point here is to get this right. Year 12 end-of-year exams are usually conducted in October and November, with results posted in early December. University offers flow from early of January, in time for the university semester to start in the first week of March. We will leave you there with a bit of cautious optimism that Australia is beginning to flatten the curve. You can follow our rolling global coverage here. To recap: Police in New South Wales have launched an investigation into the Ruby Princess cruise ship. The investigation will examine possible breaches of biosecurity laws and will be conducted alongside a coronial investigation into the deaths of 11 of the 662 passengers who tested positive to Covid-19. The deaths of four of the passengers of the Ruby Princess were confirmed on Sunday. They are three men from NSW and one 78-year-old man from Queensland. The death toll from Covid-19 in Australia sits at 35. NSW health minister Brad Hazard has again defended NSW Health staff who made the decision to allow the Ruby Princess passengers to disembark. The number of new daily cases in Australia has fallen to 139, and the total number of cases is 5,687. Of them, 91 people are in intensive care, 33 people are on ventilators, and about 2,000 have fully recovered. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the daily case numbers in Australia \u201cdoes tend to continue the trend we\u2019ve seen of flattening of the curve\u201d. However he said he was concerned that 10% of the cases recorded in Australia were from community transmission. The federal government may expand its jobkeeper package to allow more casual workers to access the payment, when parliament is recalled to debate that legislation this week. The Victorian government has offered free hotel rooms to health workers seeking to self-isolate to protect their families. Governments of all states have warned people against heading to regional towns for Easter holidays, saying that hospitals in those areas do not have the infrastructure to cope with a significant Covid-19 outbreak. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has warned she will close outdoor fresh food markets if crowds continue to congregate. Tasmania has closed two wards of the North West Regional Hospital after three health workers tested positive to Covid-19, prompting another 18 to go into self-isolation. The hard border between WA and the rest of the country comes into effect at 11.59pm tonight. You can read a summary of the day\u2019s news in Australia here. Stay at home, stay well, and we will be back in the morning. Police in Western Australia have arrested and detained a 35-year-old Victorian man for breaching mandatory quarantine \u201con several occasions\u201d and leaving his hotel to travel around the city. In a statement, WA police said the man arrived in WA on 28 March and was required under orders on the movement of interstate travellers to quarantine for 14 days, or until 13 April. The man was put up in a hotel in Perth for the duration of his quarantine. Said police: It is alleged during the quarantine period, the man breached the self-quarantine requirements that he was bounded by on a number of occasions. He wedged open a fire exit door at the hotel to enable him to leave and re-enter the property without being seen by staff. He utilised public transport to travel within the metropolitan area. The man has been charged with two counts of failing to comply with a direction under the Emergency Management Act s.86) 1A. Police added: The man remains in custody as he was refused bail on the basis that he will likely continue or repeat the offence, which endangers another person\u2019s safety. Carnival Australia responds to police investigation A spokesman from Carnival Australia, the company which operates the Ruby Princess cruise ship, just provided Guardian Australia with the following statement in response to police in NSW launching a criminal investigation. Carnival Australia said: We have seen the Police Commissioner\u2019s announcement. In addition to willingly participating in the investigation, Carnival Australia will vigorously respond to any allegations of which there must now be full disclosure and the basis for them. You can read Matilda Boseley\u2019s full report on this issue here. Here\u2019s some more information about that latest death in Queensland. Queensland Health just issued a statement saying that a 78-year-old man with underlying medical conditions died in the Prince Charles hospital in Brisbane, after testing positive to Covid-19. They said: The man contracted the disease after recently returning from a cruise. Queensland Health offers its sincere condolences to his family. Back on Sky, NSW health minister Brad Hazzard says NSW has done more testing for coronavirus than any other state or territory. That\u2019s true in terms of the raw numbers \u2014 it has conducted 140,000 tests to date while the next-biggest state, Victoria, has conducted about 56,000. But on a per-capita basis, South Australia has conducted the most tests. On the Ruby Princess issue, Hazzard says now is not the time for casting blame on public health staff. We have got to put our trust in the public health doctors and our frontline medical staff who are trying to look after us and are doing their best... it\u2019s not a time for blame. An eleventh passenger of the Ruby Princess cruise ship has died after testing positive to Covid-19. It brings the total number of deaths in Australia from Covid-19 to 35 and the number of deaths in Queensland to five. Brad Hazzard on Sky said NSW Health allowed the ship to come into the harbour in accordance with a federal government protocols. He said more than 40 people were swabbed for influenza \u2014 not Covid-19 \u2014 on the ship before it docked in Sydney. About 15 of those swabs were handed over to NSW Health. He said more than 100 people on the ship had flu-like symptoms before the ship landed. Hazzard said NSW health made the decision to allow passengers to disembark based on the information they had at the time, and said that neither he nor anyone who is not a doctor should question that decision. I think the community could be satisfied that we had the best of the best making those decisions. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard is on Sky News talking to Sharri Markson about the Ruby Princess cruise ship. He says he didn\u2019t know \u201cif you could say it\u2019s incompetence\u201d that allowed the ship to dock in Sydney, and 2,700 passengers to disembark. Hazzard: These cruise ships have sadly become crucibles of disease, of this disease. WA premier Mark McGowan mentioned earlier that the coastal town of Esperance, which is about 700km east of Perth on the south coast and 400km south of Kalgoorlie, will be subject to specific local border controls to prevent people going there for easter holidays. Police are already in place. The WA border will close at 11.59pm to anyone who does not have an essential purpose or meet one of the narrow categories for exemption. Details on the WA government website, here. In Tasmania, authorities have closed parts of the North West Regional hospital in Burnie, 330km northwest of Hobart, after three health workers tested positive. Two hospital staff tested positive on Friday, and a third overnight. A further 18 health workers based at the hospital have gone into self-isolation, after being identified as close contacts of the three who tested positive. This report is from The Examiner: Two major wards at the North West Regional Hospital have been closed to new admissions following a coronavirus outbreak. The medical and surgical wards have been locked down after three health workers were confirmed to have tested positive, Chief Medical Officer Professor Tony Lawler said. \u201cIn discussion with the acting director of public health yesterday, It was determined that appropriate measures would need to be put in place to limit the risk of further complications of the identification of infected individuals,\u201d Professor Lawler said. \u201cAs a result a determination was made that there would be no new admissions to the medical and surgical ward and appropriate hygiene and PPE measures would be put in place. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that this will have an impact not only on the capacity of the North West Regional Hospital, but a very real impact on the staff.\u201d The Ruby Princess cruise ship, which NSW police said today would be the subject of a criminal and coronial investigation, is currently sitting off the coast of Sydney. Between 100 and 200 \u2014 closer to 200, police said \u2014 crew members still aboard the ship are showing symptoms of the coronavirus. Some crew have been taken off the ship and taken to hospital. At least 662 people linked to the ship, mainly passengers, have tested positive to Covid-19, and 10 passengers have died. Consumer Protection WA has warned residential tenants to continue paying their rent unless they are genuinely experiencing severe financial hardship. It has also urged landlords and to show compassion and negotiate with tenants who have lost work due to Covid-19. Consumer Protection said it has received calls from \u201cconcerned landlords who claim that their tenant has stopped paying rent even when they are not facing financial difficulty\u201d. Consumer Protection commissioner Penny Lipscombe said she was concerned some may be exploiting the situation. While the national cabinet carefully considers the complex issue of implementing a proposed six-month moratorium on residential tenancy evictions, tenants are reminded that any moratorium will not apply to rental payments. There remains a legal obligation on the part of the tenant to pay their rent in accordance with their current lease agreement, but we are looking at ensuring that evictions are not carried out if the tenant no longer has the capacity to pay. Tenants should pay what they can \u2013 the proposed changes are about allowing time for tenants to get their financial situation sorted out so they can start paying rent again as soon as it is practical to do so. It is reasonable for a landlord to ask for proof of termination of employment or other evidence of financial distress, but should not ask to look at copies of bank statements. On Friday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission warned real estate agents that they could be jailed for up to five years if they advised tenants to draw on their superannuation to pay rent. Forty-seven Australian children remain trapped in the abject al-Hawl camp in north-east Syria, as the region braces for a potential Covid-19 outbreak. Syria has reported only a handful of cases, and there are none confirmed in the camp housing 68,000 women and children, most of them family of Islamic State fighters, but there has been little Covid-19 testing across the war-torn country. In neighbouring Turkey, more than 18,000 cases have been confirmed, and the rate of infection is on the steepest upward curve of any country in the world. Fabrizio Carboni, the regional director for the Near and Middle East for the International Committee of the Red Cross, tells the Guardian al-Hawl is \u201chell \u2026 this place really is hell\u201d, and acutely vulnerable to a Covid-19 outbreak. \u201cThe challenge for us is prevention, to avoid the virus getting into the camp, and to isolate any cases at all costs to stop the spread in the camp. But really, if this epidemic gets into the camp, forget about having medical supplies, it will be impossible to control.\u201d More details here: Meanwhile, in Queensland, police issued 58 infringement notices at a car rally in the Brisbane suburb of Rochedale last night. That\u2019s right, a car rally. Deputy Queensland police commissioner Steve Gollschewski, who is also the state disaster coordinator, has professed himself disappointed and frustrated and said the behaviour of people at the rally was \u201cinexcusable\u201d. Said Gollschewski: This is all about safety. About saving lives. About stopping the spread of Covid-19. We all, every single one of us, must do our bit. We are in this together. It is inexcusable what happened at Rochedale last night and such blatant disregard for the lives of Queenslanders will not be tolerated. Police said they received a tip-off at 10pm that about 150 cars and a \u201clarge number of people\u201d had congregated in the carpark of the Brickworks Place warehouse. From the police statement: Multiple police units responded with many of the cars attempting to flee the area, with some driving across grassland and becoming bogged in the process. The infringement notices carry a fine of $1,334, for failing to comply with a direction issued by the chief health officer. The 58 fines were issued to both drivers and passengers, male and female, aged between 17 and 30. If you\u2019re unclear about the rules in Queensland, you can read our explainer of the rules in each state here or the Queensland chief health officer\u2019s direction here. South Australian health minister Stephen Wade said it was \u201cfar too early to talk about easing restrictions\u201d. These figures are encouraging but they are early and we need to see a clear trend, particularly coming up to Easter ... We need to make sure that people follow through in the public health advice, stay at home for Easter, maintain social distancing, maintain high standards of personal hygiene. Michael Cusack was asked if the drop in daily numbers meant that SA would lift its border restrictions, or whether it would remain \u201clocked off\u201d from the rest of the country for six to 12 months. Cusack said he could not answer that question today, as it would depend on national health guidelines. He said SA was in a \u201cbetter position\u201d than the eastern states. He said that the lesson from countries which had managed the outbreak well was to do \u201ca lot of testing, large scale testing in the way we have done here, and then contract tracing of each of the persons who have the infection\u201d. That, he says, allows you to put \u201ca ring around infected people\u201d. That is how you keep numbers low and you effectively save lives. SA has, as of Sunday, conducted 38,863 tests. That\u2019s about 2% of the population, which is one of the highest per capita testing rates in the world. SA also has among the highest per-capita infection rates, and Cusack says the one follows the other. He said data from other countries showed that \u201ccountries that have done a lot of testing have had sort of relatively higher rates of infection, but that is because they know the size of the infections that they have got in their populations. I mean, there are some countries in Europe I guess where the level of testing has been quite low and although the quoted figures in terms of the number of people that they know have infection is low, what we see of the impacts on the hospitals in the health systems, the likelihood is there is an awful lot more people in the community, that they just do not know have infections. So I think the approach taken so far has been the right one in terms of a lot of testing, being really clear who has infection. [To] the people watching this: if you have symptoms or if you think you may have symptoms and you meet these testing criteria, you need to get tested quickly because what we do know about the virus, that people are infectious very early on and that is why we need to make the diagnosis early and then they can go into isolation and we can immediately get those contact traces made. Michael Cusack said a drop-off in cases was expected, because SA had put in place domestic border restrictions on top of the requirements for international travellers to quarantine. That means that the number of people coming to the state, both domestic and international travellers, has dropped. Cusack: Obviously once that kind of tap is switched off you would expect there would be a decline in imported disease. What the real anxiety has been and why social distancing is so important is that where the virus is in the community, there is a risk that we start to see some community spread, and that is why it has been so vitally important that we get the public to understand why they should distance themselves. And I would have to say in South Australia the public have been fantastic at actually buying into this and doing the social distancing, and I think it is very early days but that is perhaps starting to bleed through into the numbers. Like every other public health officer to speak today, Michael Cusack is cautiously optimistic about the ability of his team to get ahead of the spread in their jurisdiction. Cusack said they are \u201cobviously\u201d pleased with just two new cases recorded overnight, but added that they often see a \u201cslackening off\u201d of new cases recorded over the weekend, which suggested there could be fewer checks conducted. He said: So I wouldn\u2019t want to read too much into this, but we have seen a gradual decline in recent days. That leads to a question of if we should change our restrictions, and so forth. We are still in the early stages of this disease and we don\u2019t, as I say, we are keen that we don\u2019t read too much into this at an early stage. We may well see an increase in the coming days again, as we have done previously. South Australia records just two new cases in 24 hours SA\u2019s deputy chief Public Health Officer, Michael Cusack, says just two new cases of Covid-19 were recorded in that state overnight, bringing the total to 409. Neither of those new cases are from the Ruby Princess cruise ship. More than a quarter of all cases in SA \u2014 about 120 \u2014 have been traced back to cruise ships. Cusack says that the number of cases linked to the cluster among baggage handlers at Adelaide airport had increased by three, up to 28 cases, of which 17 are baggage handlers and 11 are secondary contacts, including family members. Those three cases are not included in the two new cases reported overnight \u2014 so they were reported earlier. Nineteen people are in the Royal Adelaide hospital with Covid-19, and nine are in ICU. Thanks to Luke Henriques-Gomes for keeping us all informed today. We\u2019ll go now to South Australia, where health minister Stephen Wade is giving an update. He begins by urging people not to travel for the Easter holidays. If you are planning to holiday beyond home, I would urge you to reconsider. The challenge is real and by staying apart, South Australia is truly united. Wade said SA was fast-tracking a plan to recruit 97 new ambulance officers. The ambulance SA chief executive, David Place, said they were also hiring more people to answer triple-0 calls, bringing the number of new employees to 100. They\u2019ve also contracted Toyota to sterilise ambulances that have carried confirmed or suspected cases. And with that, I might leave you in the hands of my excellent colleague Calla Wahlquist. A quick look at the main developments so far today: NSW police launch criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess deaths Another three deaths from the cruise ship, and four in total, pushed the death toll to 34 The CMO says the curve is continuing to flatten; 139 new cases Mark McGowan warns WA residents to come home before the border closes at midnight Asked if schools will reopen at the start of term two, McGowan says that education ministers are expected to present a plan to National Cabinet on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m keen that our schools have the very best of health advice but that we continue to provide ongoing education. What the model is? Not sure yet.\u201d McGowan is asked about a call to house homeless people in hotels now, rather than the government\u2019s trial that has put 20 people in a hotel. The Guardian reported on this issue here. McGowan is unmoved. I think it\u2019s best to continue with the trial and make sure that is a successful and workable way forward. I spoke to the manager of the hotel the other day. He was very excited and very pleased by the way it\u2019s progressing but I think it\u2019s worth watching and making sure that it works well before we expand it. McGowan says the government would be more likely to reopen cafes and restaurants before reopening the border. \u201cIf we can push the level of infection down and continue to have the low rates of infection, well, then the first thing I want to do is try and get our economy back up sooner, or as soon as possible. But I can\u2019t put any deadlines or timeframes on that. It might be months and months away. Clearly to me the inconvenience of someone from the east not being able to come here or people from here not being able to go on holidays in Bali is minor compared to someone losing their business or job. So getting the economy back up and running is my first priority. But we can\u2019t do any of that until we know we get the best health advice and know it\u2019s the right time to do it.\u201d How long will the state\u2019s hard border be in place? \u201cThat\u2019s the $64 million question,\u201d says McGowan. He admits he does not have \u201ceasy answers\u201d about when this will happen, but says that people should be prepared for \u201canywhere up to six months at this point in time\u201d. McGowan is asked about police in Kununurra who are now in self-quarantine. He says that there were three officers in self-isolation, although it may be more now, he says. He can\u2019t provide any more detail than that. McGowan is talking about the WA\u2019s new hard border. He manages to invoke Brexit. Sorry, Britain. What we have done in less than a week took Britain four years to work through. Brexit has taken four years and we put borders in place in the space of one week. That is testament to the people who have been working around the clock to get this done across the public sector, in particular our police commissioner. McGowan\u2019s message to people outside the state is \u201ccome home by midnight tonight\u201d. No one from over east will be allowed entry into Western Australia unless you\u2019re an approved exempt traveller. I can\u2019t stress this enough \u2013 you must be exempt, otherwise you\u2019ll be turned around. People can go to the government website to get the latest information and download the necessary forms. Checks will be occurring. If you\u2019ve lied on an exemption form to get into our state, there\u2019s every chance you\u2019ll get caught and be forced to face the consequences. McGowan is pleased with WA\u2019s progress, as you can see from this metaphor-heavy passage. I know we\u2019ve been asking a lot of you all over the past month. I\u2019m so proud that Western Australia has risen to the challenge. It\u2019s also reassuring to see our efforts are having a positive impact and encouraging to see the low number of new cases. But that\u2019s just all the more reason for us to stay on course. What we\u2019re doing is working but this is a marathon, not a sprint. We\u2019re still heading into the storm ... Our best weapon in this war is you. WA premier Mark McGowan tells reporters there have been 17 new cases in WA overnight. McGowan says those who tested positive since yesterday were aged between 26 and 78 years old. That brings the state\u2019s total to 453 cases. There are 302 active cases. There are 59 confirmed cases in Perth hospitals; 18 are in intensive care units. Just turning back to Mick Fuller\u2019s press conference, he was asked if police will be doing random checks to see that people have not gone on holidays. The question included a reference to checking IDs. Fuller says: \u201cWe will. I feel we\u2019re getting good levels of compliance. The exercise issue is a complex one because we want people to get out and manage their mental health. You look at the transmission rates around our beaches and the area is much, much higher than it is in other areas generally. We will be stopping people and if you don\u2019t have a good reason to be where you are, you could face a $1,000 fine. As I keep saying we would much rather work with the community than be issuing fines.\u201d A reporter presses Murphy on the modelling that the government has claimed it will release. Why is the modelling not ready for release, but good enough to use to make decisions from? \u201cNational cabinet will consider some of the modelling work in the coming week and I think that the national cabinet, my understanding is, are quite keen to share some of the modelling with the community. I think we\u2019ll wait and see what the national cabinet discusses on Tuesday. \u201cThe intention is to provide the modelling when it\u2019s in a fit form for publication. That\u2019s pretty close, I think.\u201d Murphy is asked if there is a point where asymptomatic people in the community will be tested. There wouldn\u2019t be an availability of testing kits to test the whole community. The whole world is very keenly acquiring testing kits. We\u2019re doing a lot. We\u2019ve managed to secure very large numbers of testing kits to meet our high testing rate. There is no evidence at the moment about testing asymptomatic people. The only situation where we think it might be valuable at the moment is in an aged care outbreak because we\u2019ve found some aged care residents can have asymptomatic measures. Brendan Murphy says Easter is \u201cgoing to be very different this year\u201d. People have been asked not to travel over the holiday. However, he says the Easter Bunny is exempt from this. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked about the Easter Bunny and I\u2019m told because he\u2019s a solo operator and an essential service, Easter Bunny, he or she, will be allowed to continue to operate. \u201cBut the rest of us will have to do things differently.\u201d The major concern continues to be community transmission. Murphy acknowledges he may sound like a \u201cbroken record\u201d on this. We all know just how infectious this virus can be. Just look at what it did on some cruise ships. Thirty-five people in one wedding. The Qantas and Jetstar baggage handlers in Adelaide. It spreads very quickly. So we\u2019re in a good place at the moment. We are achieving good control because the community has done what we have asked. Murphy says it\u2019s estimated that more than 2,000 people have \u201cfully recovered from the virus already in Australia\u201d. He says authorities are \u201cincreasingly confident\u201d that they can prevent a situation like that in New York if people \u201ccontinue to adhere to\u201d the social distancing measures. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, is now speaking in Canberra. He says there are: 5,687 cases, an increase of 139 cases over the past 24 hours 34 deaths 91 people in intensive care; 33 on ventilators \u201cThat is probably the lowest rise we\u2019ve had for a few days and it does tend to continue the trend we\u2019ve seen of flattening of the curve.\u201d Fuller is asked what laws are being considered as far as the criminal investigation goes. You have overarching biosecurity acts from a national or federal perspective and then you\u2019d have state legislation in terms of borders and then that criminal negligence-type crimes. But, as you said, we\u2019re at the beginning. I haven\u2019t even handed over the evidence I\u2019ve collected thus far and there\u2019s a lot more work to be done. Fuller says he has received a letter from Carnival that states that they will provide whatever documentation is requested through the investigation. He is also asked if he\u2019s disappointed that no agencies involved in the Ruby Princess issue have taken responsibility for what went wrong. \u201cI suppose the important thing is, from the New South Wales state perspective, this, the premier stood up, put police in charge of the ports and the airports in terms of border control and we haven\u2019t seen this happen again. I think that\u2019s the important thing. Because coronavirus is not over and we still have planes landing every day and hundreds of Australians returning, which is important that we manage that, with that same sort of humanitarian perspective. \u201cWe will continue from a police perspective and they\u2019ll look at all of those agencies. It\u2019s not just about finishing on Carnival or finishing on person X, we\u2019ll have to look at all the touch points to get to the bottom of it. There will be lessons learnt, I have no doubt.\u201d Fuller says there will also be coronial oversight of the police investigation. Fuller says that crew members who need medical assistance have been taken off the ship. Fuller says about 200 people who are still on board the cruise ship have symptoms. Authorities are looking at finding a safe place for the ship to dock. Fuller is asked whether cruise line operator Carnival was underplaying the symptoms of those on board. \u201cWe will only know by getting the ship\u2019s records, the records from the doctors on the ships and obviously there are over a couple of thousand people who were passengers on the ship who have come off. \u201cWell, there seems to be ... discrepancies between the information provided by Carnival and what I would see is the benchmark for the laws that the federal government and the state government put in place in terms of protecting Australians from cruise ships when coronavirus had started.\u201d Fuller also says that there has been another crew member taken off the Ruby Princess today. NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller confirms that there will be a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess debacle. \u201cThere is clear evidence that [Covid-19] has been brought off that ship,\u201d Fuller says. There\u2019s clear evidence now when it stopped in New Zealand Covid-19 has come off that ship and at least 10 people have died in Australia from COVID-19. The only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe investigation will look into the actions of every agency.\u201d Ten passengers who were on the cruise ship have now died. While we await those press conferences, I might point you to this excellent weekend feature by my colleague Lisa Cox. We are expecting press conferences from the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy, the WA premier Mark McGowan, and the NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller, after 3pm. Burke is asked how Labor will go in opposing aspects of the legislation. His key point is that the opposition wants the legislation to pass. They want it to pass \u201cin the best possible form\u201d. At the moment there is no existing legislation. They have not finished and we have not been presented with anything and I don\u2019t think the government is playing a game. This is genuinely complex legislation to deal with every circumstance as to how this would unfold in any workplace. So, it is complex. Once we see it they may have already made ... the amendments to the announcement if they haven\u2019t we would look at how we can use the parliament to be able to do with that. On the leave issue, Burke describes Labor\u2019s concerns like this: An employer at the moment, if they force someone to take leave that someone has built up over the last year and in some cases they would have built up over many years, that is a liability that the employer already owes a worker, it is already on the books. At the moment, the way the government has described it, the employer can register for JobKeeper, register that employee as part of the scheme and even though the employee is simply getting what they were already owed and entitled to long before anyone had ever heard of coronavirus, the employer will be getting $1,500 a fortnight and keep it to improve their balance sheet. That is not what this program was established for. Tony Burke, who is Labor\u2019s industrial relations spokesman, turns to the jobkeeper package. He says the government\u2019s jobkeeper package could be improved. Burke is concerned that some casuals will be left out of the package. \u201cWe get a whole lot of perverse outcomes with the 12 month rule that the government is currently imposing.\u201d He says that there will be casuals who only work a shift or two each fortnight, who will now get $1,500 a fortnight, while another worker who relies on regular casual shifts but has not been at the same company for 12 months will not be eligible for the wage subsidy. Labor frontbencher Tony Burke is addressing the media. He is saying that the parliament should be sitting more often than is scheduled. Parliament is set to return to next week on Wednesday, ostensibly to pass the jobkeeper package, but will then will not return until until 11 August. \u201cWhen you push $200 billion out the door in the space of six months with legislation drafted only days before it gets introduced and go through all of its stages, mistakes will happen. We need to have the parliament sitting regularly to be able to deal with those errors and we have found ways now so that we can be sitting with only one-third of the members of the House of Reps present, with similar arrangements in the Senate. We need to be there to make sure the legislation can be adapted, as is required, and also, with $200 billion going out the door and no scrutiny on the floor of the house on a regular basis?\u201d NZ prime minister Jacinda Ardern has codified social distancing laws that prevent people from seeing their partners if they do not live under the same roof, AAP reports. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, and police minister, Lisa Neville, briefly told residents that it had adopted a similar policy this week, before reversing that position. Not so in NZ, AAP reports. The country is currently in a four-week lockdown. Ardern had previously told people to \u201capply common sense\u201d and shrink down their social group to \u201ca small group of individuals who are part of your bubble ... the bubble you must maintain\u201d for the month. But a new Health Act order does not allow people to visit their partners unless there is shared custody of children or if at least one of the partners lives alone. NZ has gone further than Australia, closing all non-essential businesses \u2013 including all restaurants and educational facilities. The country has just passed 1,000 cases. Here is a primer from Paul Karp that will give you a sense of Labor and the union movement\u2019s concerns about the government\u2019s plans to change the Fair Work Act. This debate has played out today between Sally McManus and Christian Porter. Also just letting you now that the NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller will address the media at 3pm. There is currently a police investigation into the Ruby Princess fiasco. Sky News\u2019s Andrew Clennell has reported that this will proceed to a criminal investigation. However, it should be noted this has not been confirmed officially. No doubt Fuller will address this question later today. More from Christian Porter\u2019s press conference. Porter has a fairly colourful response when asked who he thinks is responsible for the Ruby Princess debacle. It\u2019s been busy few days in government and I have not gone through a PhD analysis of jurisdictional laws in regard to the Ruby Princess. Maybe one day I will go through that but I did find the explanation of the timing of events [by Michael Outram] to be utterly persuasive. Porter indicates that there will be room to move on the government\u2019s jobkeeper package as far as eligibility goes. On the issue of casuals, he suggests that the government is \u201cworking on that and listening\u201d and trying to be \u201cas inclusive as possible\u201d. The government\u2019s current definition means only casuals who\u2019ve worked at an employer for 12 months would be eligible. Asked about McManus\u2019s idea for a test that offers jobkeeper to anyone who would have been \u201creasonably\u201d expected to work, he says that he will consider the option, but considers it a bit \u201crubbery\u201d. Asked to respond to the ACTU\u2019s concerns about rorting, Porter says: \u201cI\u2019ll be sharing drafts with the ACTU, working through those line by line in a cooperative, open, frank and honest way with the ACTU. [We] want them to have comfort that this is time bound and has the requisite safeguards and mechanisms in it to ensure that there is not rorting of the system, but ultimately the laws need to change to allow people to receive $1,500 where they would otherwise receive nothing because the business was unviable.\u201d Porter makes the case that there needs to be changes to the Fair Work Act in order to make sure the jobkeeper package works. You\u2019ll remember we reported ACTU secretary Sally McManus\u2019s concerns about this earlier today. The issue is whether employers can direct their staff to take their leave. It would have a sunset date of six months. Porter suggests that the government does not intend to budge on this. They will be time bound and only last as long as the payment system lasted, but without the changes, even if it were the case that a business would face a situation where they would otherwise have to let an employee go, so that they have no job and no wage and no way to provide for their family, without changes to the IR system and employment relations system, that is what would happen, rather than the employee getting the $1,500 instead of getting the normal wage. We must change the system. I\u2019ve been working very cooperatively with Sally McManus and the ACTU and Greg Combet on the prime minister\u2019s commission and we\u2019ve had enormous progress in relation to the industrial relations systems. We will not be waiting or hoping that this change can be affected over the coming weeks or months by changing 121 awards and thousands of individual enterprise agreements. This change will be happening next Wednesday. No matter how late we have to sit, the change will be happening next Wednesday. Six million Australian jobs depend on it.\u201d Porter says jobkeeper legislation is being worked on by both Treasury and his department and a draft should be ready on Monday. The attorney general, Christian Porter, is addressing plans for next week\u2019s sitting of parliament on Wednesday. Porter says there will be 47 pairs granted in the House, meaning 37 members of the government and 21 members of the opposition. He says he\u2019s not checked with the crossbench but it\u2019s expected they will attend. Parliament will be dealing with the jobkeeper package. There will be a question time session at 2pm on Wednesday as per usual. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has indicated she will raise with the federal government the cramped conditions being experienced by refugees at a Brisbane detention centre. AAP reported on Saturday that dozens of refugees protested on the verandah of a Kangaroo Point hotel which houses refugees transferred from offshore detention to receive specialist medical treatment. The premier said on Sunday that she was \u201cnot happy\u201d with the situation. \u201cNo I\u2019m not happy with the situation and I will talk to the federal government,\u201d Palaszczuk said in comments reported by Nine Newspapers. \u201cThe refugee issue is an issue for the federal government and I am happy to raise it with them.\u201d The Guardian reported last month that an immigration guard at the hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. The refugees have called for better protections during the pandemic. \u201cThere\u2019s no distancing here which is really dangerous for us,\u201d a one refugee told AAP. \u201cIf one guy was infected here, then all of us would be infected.\u201d An ASRC spokeswoman told AAP on Saturday the refugees at Kangaroo Point live in cramped conditions and are \u201creally scared\u201d there will be a Covid-19 outbreak. There are about 1,400 people held in detention centres across Australia. Human rights lawyers are urging the government to reduce the number of people in these crammed spaces and release them into safer spaces, the ASRC said in a statement. The Tasmanian Legislative Council elections in Huon and Rosevears have been postponed. About 53,000 voters would have voted on 2 May, but new public health advice has forced the elections to be delayed. The Tasmanian attorney general, Elise Archer, says that the government still intends to hold the poll before 25 August, when the Tasmanian upper house will next convene. \u201cThe government will continue, of course, to seek public health advice over coming months to determine an exact polling date. Should public health circumstances require a further deferral of the election, then a further notice would need to be considered at that time.\u201d Gutwein says he was concerned yesterday to see groups of people \u201cbrowsing\u201d at the shops. There were still children in groups in the mall and walking through the city. Now, I know this is tough stuff. I know this is hard and I have had many discussions over the last 24 hours with my own family and children about the need for this to occur. It is important that we all take every step that we can to socially distance and ensure that we follow the rules. So if you are going to the supermarket, and yesterday I sat in the car with my children while my wife went in, only going to the supermarket, don\u2019t go with a family to browse and to shop. It is not a social outing. Go and buy what you need. Moving on from NSW, in Tasmania the premier, Peter Gutwein, has provided an update. Gutwein says there were two new cases confirmed overnight, taking the overall number of cases to 82. One of those who has tested positive was a health worker at the Northwest Regional hospital. Dr McAnulty has just confirmed three of the four people who died overnight likely acquired the coronavirus on board the Ruby Princess. McAnulty is cautiously optimistic that the curve is starting to flatten. We want to be hopeful, but not to over-egg the figures. The last few days we have seen numbers bounce around without escalating at the same level as we have seen before, so we are hopeful that we are starting to flatten the curve. But there is more work to be done, and it is important that we all heed those messages. But he does not want people to get ahead of themselves. Because we have seen internationally, where we think there is good news, people kind of relax the measures, and then that leads to an upswing in cases. NSW Health\u2019s director of health protection, Jeremy McAnulty, says that four people have died overnight, bringing the NSW death toll to 16. They were a 91-year-old man, who died at Port Macquarie hospital, a 80-year-old man and a 76-year-old who died at Westmead, and a 61-year-old who died at Hornsby. NSW Health Director of Health Protection Dr Jeremy McAnulty says there have been 87 new cases reported up until last night. While it is \u201cearly days\u201d, he says this suggests a \u201cstabilisation\u201d of the numbers. He is keen to see testing continue in places where community transmission has taken place, such as Bondi. There are 2,580 cases overall in NSW, with 578 acquired locally from a known confirmed case or cluster, and 380 locally acquired but without direct contact with a known case or cluster, and 56 remain under investigation. McAnulty notes that the \u201cbiggest single age group is people in their 20s\u201d. \u201cAnd in fact, we have seen also three people who were ventilated in intensive care in their 30s.\u201d Hazzard apologises that he did not confirm yesterday in newly issued public health orders that places of worship may have the staff they need to conduct livestreams. Brad Hazzard says some people are not heeding the message not to travel. He is not happy about large numbers of people entering the North Coast, Central Coast and the South Coast a few days out from Easter. \u201cI know Aussies like to thumb their nose at authority, but on this occasion, I would ask you to not thumb your nose, because the messages we are giving you are about keeping you alive, keeping your family alive, keeping your friends alive, and making sure the community stays safe. If you have headed off for a sneaky little holiday, my message to you is go home.\u201d Hazzard says he is \u201cappalled\u201d by news reports suggesting that doctors and nurses are being physically and verbally attacked. \u201cThat very same doctor, that very same nurse, when you see that person in a uniform in a hospital, and they might be putting a tube down your throat to keep you alive, you will wish you hadn\u2019t actually done what you did previously.\u201d The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, is speaking in Sydney. Hazzard says that there are now 39 people who are in intensive care units in the state, including 23 who are on ventilators. \u201cI want to say this is an extremely dangerous virus. It is still marching through our community, and people need to be on high alert. It has killed at this stage in New South Wales 16 people. I also want to say that, for those who don\u2019t know what it is like, if you have never had a severe bout of pneumonia, a severe bout of asthma, and I have had both those, the effect, whether or not you have a fever, normally there is a fever, is that you end up with a lack of oxygen.\u201d Hazzard claims that some young people still believe he virus cannot affect them. But he says of the 2,580 cases in the state, 565 relate to young people under 29. \u201cTake it seriously is my message to young people.\u201d The Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, is asked if the government has found the source of a cluster of cases at The Alfred hospital. The answer to that question is no. But Sutton says the \u201csolution is the same\u201d. We will protect our healthcare workers by not becoming patients ourselves. By not transmitting to other people in hospital and not turning up to hospital if we\u2019re well and following the rules around visitation. Andrews also points to a government announcement that the state will spend $20m to purchase hotel rooms that will be available to frontline healthcare works who test positive to Covid-19. \u201c... We\u2019ll put them up in a hotel room \u2013 no cost to them. This will be a matter of their choice. Many will choose to avail themselves of that hotel room option because they might live with older people. They might live in a share house with a range of other workers. They might have people at home in their household who are vulnerable for one reason or another. So we don\u2019t think that if you have Covid-19, or you have to isolate because you may have Covid-19, principally because of the work you\u2019re doing, we don\u2019t think that it\u2019s fair that you would have to go and self-isolate in a hotel room, and potentially, potentially incur very significant expense. This is exactly the right thing to do.\u201d Separately, the government has also announced $45m to ensure that kindergartens can stay open. Andrews says the announcement builds on the government\u2019s child care package, which he says was \u201cthe right thing\u201d. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is also speaking in Melbourne. Andrews says that the state has conducted around 56,000 tests so far. He says there has been \u201creally significant success\u201d flattening the curve, but there is still a \u201clong way to go\u201d. He thanks Victorians who are \u201cdoing the right\u201d thing. But he notes 142 fines have been issued over the past 24 hours for people flouting social distancing laws. And 751 checks over that same period. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has addressed reporters in Logan. She starts by saying that overnight cases are \u201ccoming down\u201d. Out of the 907 cases in Queensland, 119 are linked to cruise ships, she says. There have been nine new cases. But the premier is not happy about crowds that gathered at markets yesterday. Yesterday we saw crowds at markets and guys, it\u2019s not on. If I see that happen again, they\u2019re going to be shut down immediately. So I\u2019m going to be talking with the police commissioner and if that happens again, it\u2019s going to be shut down because people are not ... observing social distancing from each other. Now I want to try and keep fresh food markets open for people. It is not a chance to go down for an outing. You should only be going down there if you intend to purchase fresh produce and if you don\u2019t adhere to social distancing then we will have no choice but to shut those markets. I don\u2019t want to do that. So everyone needs to do the right thing and I\u2019m giving my last warning in relation to that. Aside from Daniel Andrews\u2019 scheduled press conference at 10.30am, we\u2019re told Annastacia Palaszczuk will give an update on Queensland shortly. AAP has filed this story reporting that an Australian has been rushed to hospital in Florida: An Australian is among four passengers rushed to hospital after the coronavirus struck the Coral Princess cruise ship docked in Miami, Florida. Two other passengers died before the ship arrived in Miami on Saturday. The Australian was taken to Larkin Community Hospital. \u201cThere are two people who will be transferred to Larkin,\u201d Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez told reporters on Saturday. \u201cOne is American. One is Australian.\u201d \u201cThere are two Americans who will be transferred to a hospital in Tampa. \u201cWe originally had six, but apparently two passed away on the way in.\u201d The Coral Princess, with 1,020 passengers and 878 crew, is the latest cruise to turn into a nightmare when people began falling ill with coronavirus symptoms and nations refused to let the ship dock. Princess Cruises said seven passengers and five crew members had tested positive. The ship was cruising around South America and was due to end in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 19 March. Gimenez agreed to allow the ship to dock at Port Miami as soon as Princess Cruises arranged for flights out of Miami International Airport for passengers deemed fit to fly. Strict protocols, including passengers wearing masks and separate waiting areas at the airport, would be in place. A similar predicament was endured by 133 Australians on the Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise ships that were initially blocked from stopping at South American ports. The two ships were cleared to dock at Florida\u2019s Port Everglades on Thursday with the Australians placed on charter flights for the US west coast and connecting flights back to Australia. The home affairs minister Peter Dutton has warned imported \u201chome\u201d Covid-19 test kits pose a serious risk to public health. Dutton said the Therapeutic Goods Administration has ruled the test kits were unapproved medical devices. \u201cInaccurate results could prevent people from seeking the medical help they need, or alternatively, discourage people who should be self-isolating from doing so,\u201d Dutton said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cOur ABF officers at the border are on alert for any unauthorised or homemade Covid-19 products and they will continue working day and night to ensure these dangerous goods don\u2019t make it into Australian households and communities.\u201d Authorities have intercepted a number of faulty keeps in recent weeks, including 200 units that arrived in Perth from China as air cargo in March. Similar detections have now been made in Perth (50 units) on 23 March and Melbourne (39 units) on 27 March, both originating in Hong Kong, AAP reports. Dutton said the only approved tests for Covid-19 in Australia are laboratory based tests or tests that can be used by health professionals at the point of care such as in hospitals or clinics. Speers asks what McManus thinks the workforce could look like after the pandemic is over. We\u2019ve got different experiences of this. On one hand, it\u2019s like a collective experience for everyone around the world, but at the moment, you\u2019ve got the frontline workers facing the virus, fighting the virus. You\u2019ve got the support workers. Those workers working from home. Some of them with kids as well and you\u2019ve got then people who have lost their jobs. I think that the biggest thing for us, as a country, is we\u2019ve got some strong institutions like our public health system, but casual work \u2013 too many insecure jobs. It\u2019s just been so exposed about how much risk has been shifted on to the individual. Coming out the other side, that\u2019s something we\u2019d really like to see changed. We need more permanent jobs for more Australians. And the interview is over. Speers turns to the minimum wage. Unions have been calling for a 4% increase. He tries to pin McManus down on whether or not she still supports an increase. Remember, minimum wage increases happen in the second-half of the year, so that\u2019s from 1 July onwards. We\u2019ve got it think, as the prime minister has talked about, about the snap back. If we want a snap back, we have to make sure that people have got money in their pockets. Because for a long time, we\u2019re going to depend on our domestic economy. All our small businesses will need money in their pockets to spend it. We think it\u2019s far too early to be saying that there should be any freezes on the minimum wage. In the end, the minimum wage has to be enough for people to live on, and at the moment, it\u2019s not. And we should look at the other side of this pandemic and making sure that people have got enough money in their pockets. Speers suggests that small businesses may not be able to cope. He notes a decision is needed before July. McManus says that the minimum wage should \u201cabsolutely\u201d still be increased, but says there is plenty of time to assess the scale of that rise. She notes the current minimum is only $39,000 a year. She says that the decision could be looked at closer to July, but of the 4% ask, she says: \u201cWe are going to be sensible, we want to save jobs.\u201d McManus is asked by David Speers whether Labor \u201cfight to the death on this ... or make the point and then let it pass?\u201d Her response is essentially, let\u2019s wait and see. Look, Labor and the Greens and the crossbenchers, we are saying to them that they should oppose changes to the Fair Work Act because we\u2019re just not necessary. We also haven\u2019t seen the changes that the government has proposed yet. So I imagine that things will develop over the next couple of days. Pressed on employers being able to instruct workers to take their leave, McManus reiterates that she does view that as reasonable in some cases. But she does not believe there should be a blanket provision for all to be able to do this. McManus says that many workers will choose to take their leave anyway, because it will entitle them to more than the $1,500 per fortnight jobkeeper allowance. We shouldn\u2019t have a situation where this money is used really to subsidise the leave entitlements. Rather, it\u2019s a wage subsidy. And we need to be clear about what it\u2019s for. What are McManus\u2019 specific concerns about changing the Fair Work Act? For example, we know that what\u2019s being considered is that an employer may be able to direct people just to take all their leave. Now, that is going to be sensible in some circumstances where an employer has shut down, and already, I mean, workers will make that decision to take leave rather than being on the jobkeeper allowance, because it\u2019s going to be more money. But a whole lot of other employers that aren\u2019t affected, well, should they be able to direct everyone to take their leave? That doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s a fair situation. McManus is opposed to plans to change the Fair Work Act with legislation in order to implement the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. Well, we want to see it happen by cooperation, not by legislation as we have been cooperating. And not every instrument needs to change, not every enterprise agreement. There are lots of industries that are doing well under the crisis because they\u2019ve got a lot more business. You think about all of the utilities still working. There\u2019s no need to change those agreements and if you have it imposed on worker, then some employers, unfortunately, might take advantage of it. So we believe that everything can be done without changing the current system. Remember, the Fair Work Act is workers\u2019 rights. Just don\u2019t tinker with the workers\u2019 rights, we can make this happen. McManus acknowledges that the Australian wage subsidy will mean some casuals are paid more ($1,500 a fortnight) than they would otherwise in normal circumstances. But she says, too, that the UK and Danish subsidies are more generous. It\u2019s a unique system they\u2019ve brought in, similar to the New Zealand one, a flat rate. There\u2019s swings and roundabouts. Yes, it is true that lower paid workers and people who aren\u2019t full time workers, some will get more than they would have got. But it also means that higher paid workers will be getting much, much less than they would have got under, say for example, the UK or the Danish system, where it\u2019s around 80% or 70% of wages. So you know, you\u2019ve got to take those swings and roundabouts, and trade unions are just willing to make this the best system we can. In saying that, McManus says that the union movement is concerns that there are 1.1 million casuals who will miss out on the jobkeeper allowance. (It is limited to those who have been on an employer\u2019s books for 12 months.) McManus would like the payment issued to all people who would be \u201creasonably expected\u201d to be working. I think it\u2019s reasonable to draw the line somewhere. I think that best way of thinking about it is \u2013 if you could have reasonably expected to be working if it were not for the coronavirus, then you should get the jobkeeper allowance. Unfortunately in our country, we\u2019ve become so dependant on casual work and so many employers would have had their casual workers working. Think about all of the universities \u2013 more than 50% of the workers there are casual workers and they won\u2019t get that allowance unless it changes. The ACTU secretary Sally McManus is on Insiders with David Speers. McManus is asked if she agrees with Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201cthere are no bosses or unions, just Australians\u201d comment. First she pays tribute to front line workers. McManus says \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s no unions\u201d. But she congratulates the government for the wage subsidy announcement. It was the right announcement, the wage subsidy as well as the childcare subsidy and the private hospitals. They made really good decisions. I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s no unions and I can assure the working people in Australia that the trade union movement in Australia is here and working in their corner. Having said that, the fact that we\u2019re now consulting with the government means that better decisions are being made because you\u2019re listening to more voices. Hundreds of thousands of NDIS participants will have access to priority delivery from supermarkets during the Covid-19 crisis, the government has announced. From Monday, all participants will receive a code via SMS or email that will allow them to access the priority delivery offer, the government said. \u201cThe Priority Home Delivery Service will help hundreds of thousands of NDIS participants across the country access everyday items through an option that removes personal health risks and great stress associated with going shopping in the current environment,\u201d government services minister Stuart Robert said. \u201cI thank those supermarkets for delivering this service as it will be a great help to hundreds of thousands of Australians and their families.\u201d Good morning. Thanks for joining our continuing coverage. We\u2019ll be with you all day. Just so you know what\u2019s coming up this morning: the ACTU secretary Sally McManus is the main interview on Insiders so we\u2019ll bring that to you in real time. And the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is scheduled to hold a press conference at 10.30am. The latest figures show 5,544 cases of Covid-19 across the country. The death toll stands at 30. There will be much more throughout the day \u2013 so stick with us if you can.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m going to tell you the single worst story I\u2019ve heard in these past few horrid months, a story that combines naked greed, political influence peddling, a willingness to endanger innocent human beings, utter blindness to one of the greatest calamities in human history and a complete disregard for the next crisis aiming for our planet. I\u2019m going to try to stay calm enough to tell it properly, but I confess it\u2019s hard.</p> <p>The background: a decade ago, beginning with indigenous activists in Canada and farmers and ranchers in the American west and midwest, opposition began to something called the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to carry filthy tar sands oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. It quickly became a flashpoint for the fast-growing climate movement, especially after Nasa scientist James Hansen explained that draining those tar sands deposits would be \u201cgame over\u201d for the climate system. And so thousands went to jail and millions rallied and eventually Barack Obama bent to that pressure and blocked the pipeline. Donald Trump, days after taking office, reversed that decision, but the pipeline has never been built, both because its builder, TC Energy, has had trouble arranging the <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/TC-Energy-sells-assets-to-help-fund-Keystone-XL-14069033.php\">financing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-keystone-pipeline-spill-permit/rare-permit-for-keystone-oil-pipeline-in-spotlight-after-spills-idUSKBN1XI0L0\">permits</a>, and because 30,000 people have trained to do nonviolent civil disobedience to block construction. It\u2019s been widely assumed that, should a Democrat win the White House in November, the project would finally be gone for good.</p> <p>And then came the coronavirus epidemic \u2013 and the oil industry saw its opening.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m going to tell you the single worst story I\u2019ve heard in these past few horrid months, a story that combines naked greed, political influence peddling, a willingness to endanger innocent human beings, utter blindness to one of the greatest calamities in human history and a complete disregard for the next crisis aiming for our planet. I\u2019m going to try to stay calm enough to tell it properly, but I confess it\u2019s hard. The background: a decade ago, beginning with indigenous activists in Canada and farmers and ranchers in the American west and midwest, opposition began to something called the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to carry filthy tar sands oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. It quickly became a flashpoint for the fast-growing climate movement, especially after Nasa scientist James Hansen explained that draining those tar sands deposits would be \u201cgame over\u201d for the climate system. And so thousands went to jail and millions rallied and eventually Barack Obama bent to that pressure and blocked the pipeline. Donald Trump, days after taking office, reversed that decision, but the pipeline has never been built, both because its builder, TC Energy, has had trouble arranging the financing and permits, and because 30,000 people have trained to do nonviolent civil disobedience to block construction. It\u2019s been widely assumed that, should a Democrat win the White House in November, the project would finally be gone for good. And then came the coronavirus epidemic \u2013 and the oil industry saw its opening. It moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of the moment. In Alberta, premier Jason Kenney, a pliant servant of the oil companies who had already set up a \u201cwar room\u201d to fight environmentalists, invested $1.1bn of taxpayers\u2019 money to TC Energy to fund construction through the year, and set aside another $6bn in a loan guarantee. Meanwhile, on the southern side of the border, a series of states quickly adopted laws making it a felony to protest \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d like pipelines. (Last week South Dakota, a crucial link on the KXL route, made it a felony even to \u201cincite\u201d such protest.) And the Department of Health and Human Services issued a memorandum exempting pipeline construction from stay-at-home orders because such work was \u201ccritical\u201d \u2013 that is, the department is asserting it is essential to build oil pipelines at the precise moment that the world is swimming in oil and that the Trump administration is boasting about getting Saudi and Russian autocrats to cut supply. On Tuesday, TC Energy announced it was moving workers from across America into place in states along the pipeline route \u2013 although local reporters in Montana discovered they\u2019d actually begun arriving 48 hours earlier, narrowly beating the state imposition of a quarantine. On Thursday, JP Morgan Chase announced that it was leading a $1.25bn bond issue for TC Energy. So here\u2019s how it shakes out: 1) The oil industry is flying in workers from across America to rural states with already strained health care systems, at a moment when all Americans have been asked to shelter in place, and pretending that they are \u201cessential\u201d employees in order to build a pipeline that would carry oil no one wants or needs, and which would go a long way toward wrecking the planet\u2019s climate system. 2) The work is being done on the edges of many Indian reservations \u2013 endangering a group of people who, over the centuries, have endured 90% population losses from introduced epidemics, and who are suffering horrible losses already from this one. As Faith Spotted Eagle of the Yankton Sioux put it on Wednesday, \u201cthis causes eerie memories for us [of] the infected smallpox blankets that were distributed to tribes intentionally\u201d. 3) It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the oil industry is acting decisively now because it knows this is the one moment when protesters can\u2019t make themselves heard. Those 30,000 trained volunteers represent one of the great nonviolent armies in American history, willing to suffer to protect the planet \u2013 but they are moral human beings who will not risk taking microbes into prisons with them, and endanger prisoners crowded together in impossible conditions. There are plenty of targets for anger \u2013 timid Democrats like Montana governor Steve Bullock, who could delay the construction, or like Joe Biden, who could have made it clear that the pipeline would be shut if he won, but who instead issued a statement to NPR which should be eligible for the mealy-mouthed hall of fame: \u201cVice-president Biden supports establishing a process requiring that for any significant infrastructure project \u2013 including all pipelines \u2013 there must be a full review and accounting of the impact on climate, local environmental health and climate justice before any project can proceed. Vice-president Biden believes that the approach Secretary Kerry applied in analyzing the costs and benefits of the Keystone XL pipeline and other cross-border pipelines \u2013 including to national security and diplomacy \u2013 is a model to build from in establishing this process.\u201d But let\u2019s be clear: the villains here are the oil industry and the big banks. And let\u2019s further be clear: their villainy is not new. The oil industry knew about and lied about climate change for 30 years: they\u2019ve prevented us from flattening the carbon curve, and set up a tragedy far greater even than coronavirus and one which will play out for decades to come.

Literally nothing matters to these people except money. Even in a moment when the rest of us are changing our every habit to try and protect each other, they are willing to sacrifice nothing. No \u2013 let\u2019s be clear again. In this moment they are using the cover of the pandemic to make yet more money, to do things they could not get away with at any other time.

So it is fitting that Danes appears to this interviewer not in person but via FaceTime.</p> <p>\u201cLet me just get on to my wifi,\u201d she says, as the signal flickers, \u201cI thought I was. OK, that should be better.\u201d</p> <p>Danes and her husband, the British actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/hugh-dancy\">Hugh Dancy</a>, who have two sons \u2013 a seven-year-old and an 18-month-old \u2013 are weathering the coronavirus storm at a country house two hours north of New York, by far the worst-hit US city. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of acclimatising to this crazy new reality where we FaceTime all the time with everybody.\u201d</p> <p>And like millions of other parents, the 40-year-old actor is suddenly dealing with the challenge of home-schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s full-on but I\u2019m trying to download math apps and order a bunch of workbooks and stuff from Amazon, hoping that\u2019ll keep them engaged.\u201d</p> <p>When the crisis erupted and brought daily life shuddering to a standstill, Danes had been enjoying her first few days back in \u201ccivilian\u201d life after a blitz of media interviews to mark the end of <em>Homeland </em>after eight seasons, 96 episodes and five Golden Globe awards. She had been looking forward to catching some theatre.</p> <p>In contrast with other art forms, pre-recorded television is immune to the virus (\u201cIt\u2019s a resilient medium, it turns out\u201d), and <em>Homeland\u2019s</em> last bow may get a ratings boost from a captive audience. They will be witnessing the end of a landmark of 21st-century television, a drama set in the world of espionage and counterterrorism that has thrilled, surprised, frustrated, courted controversy, disappointed and returned to form, swung between sublime and ridiculous and, above all, never been less than relevant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1bfd1a38af7d19add5229694f55822f153a2982d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bfd1a38af7d19add5229694f55822f153a2982d/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson and Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison in season eight of Homeland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson and Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison in season eight of Homeland: \u2018I think that\u2019s a wonderful and surprising love story,\u2019 Danes says of their on-screen relationship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is striking now that <em>Homeland</em> is often described as the first true post-9/11 drama when, in fact, it was born a full decade after the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington in 2001.

But it was always contemporary, urgent, looking outward and thinking big.

Its function was to mirror what was happening in the world and that\u2019s ever changing, so by definition it had places to move and grow, and it was never going to suffer too badly from stagnation. My character was so wildly dynamic there was always a new facet to start to explore.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Homeland's function was to mirror what was happening in the world\u2026 it was never going to suffer from stagnation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At its heart was a compelling relationship not, as first expected, between Mathison, a brilliant rule-breaker whose mind moves like jazz, and Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), a prisoner of war suspected of treason, but between Mathison and Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), who emerges as her mentor and father figure.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a wonderful and surprising love story,\u201d Danes reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s not one that we see depicted all that often in pop culture: mentor and mentee.\u201d </p> <p>The rapport with Patinkin was mirrored off screen \u201ckind of from the word go\u201d, Danes says. \u201cIn our first read-through the chemistry was really powerful and palpable. He looks uncannily like my best friend\u2019s dad, who kind of raised me and is a wonderful person but, if [he] got mad at you, you felt pretty shitty. I think that helped: very strong Pavlovian response already built in! And he\u2019s [Patinkin] just very good at what he does. Our partnership grew and deepened over time.\u201d</p> <p>When Danes and Patinkin filmed their final scene together, the end of <em>Homeland</em> truly sank in. She recalls: \u201cIt\u2019s not a casual scene. I think for me that was my cathartic moment when I realised it was over, because to say goodbye to it in its entirety is just too abstract and too huge.

While there, Mathison is confronted by multiple gravestones bearing the same date of death, the consequence of her own past actions. And she comes full circle to find herself in Brody\u2019s shoes, under suspicion for possibly having been turned by a foreign adversary.</p> <p><em>Homeland\u2019s</em> politics remains complex and problematic. Some argue that, in the later years, it sought redemption. Did Danes observe a conscious tilt to the left? \u201cI don\u2019t know if we were editorialising too much,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we were really just charting that curve. Our [America\u2019s] response to 9/11 was not great. We didn\u2019t identify the real source of danger and conflict and we were too reactionary and we betrayed a lot of our values because of the panic we were in.</p> <p>\u201cSo we kind of learned that as we went along. When I was talking to Alex [Gansa] about the final season, he framed it in a way that was helpful. He said when we first started telling our story, it was directly to do with our response to 9/11, and nearly a decade later we\u2019re wondering if we\u2019ve in fact learned anything, if we would react differently.</p> <p>\u201cHe simulated an event that would sort of be comparable in scale, as traumatising and as consequential, which is the president\u2019s helicopter going down. That was a litmus test. How do our characters in this story interpret that? Do they pause and judiciously consider their next move or do they go straight into offensive mode, a fear-based mode?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2015/oct/15/graffiti-artist-explains-why-he-daubed-homeland-is-racist-on-shows-set-videso\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4dbg8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2390102\"            data-video-name=\"Graffiti artist explains why he daubed \u2018Homeland is racist\u2019 on show\u2019s set \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC World Service / Outside Source\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/10/15/1444921887320/KP_545777_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-561fc22ae4b01867c5abe709\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/10/15/1444921887320/KP_545777_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_synd_768k_vp8-2.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2015/oct/15/graffiti-artist-explains-why-he-daubed-homeland-is-racist-on-shows-set-videso\">Graffiti artist explains why he daubed \u2018Homeland is racist\u2019 on show\u2019s set</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>One of the most enduring criticisms of the series is its portrayal of Muslims. Under the headline \u201cHomeland is the most bigoted show on television\u201d, writer and film-maker Laura Durkay wrote in the <em>Washington Post</em> in 2014: \u201cSince its first episode, <em>Homeland</em> has churned out Islamophobic stereotypes as if its writers were getting paid by the cliche.\u201d</p> <p>The following year, Arab graffiti artists who had been hired by the producers to add realism to the set of Syrian refugee camp wrote: \u201cHomeland is racist.\u201d No one noticed and translated it until the episode was broadcast. It was, one comedian observed, a major intelligence failure. Danes acknowledges: \u201cThat was a good stunt. All of our hats were off to them.\u201d</p> <p>On the broader issue, she says: \u201cI get it. I think it\u2019s tricky and kind of inherently problematic, right? There are a lot of brown people in our story who are doing really bad things, and there aren\u2019t enough opportunities to create a more balanced portrait of that demographic. That was always going to be a point of vulnerability for us, but I also think that our heroes are really problematic and really flawed. We\u2019re wrestling with some pretty challenging questions and ideas and those two sides of various arguments were personified by our characters.</p> <p>\u201cIn most cases I think both characters were right. Our writers were fairly responsible about that, creating a real debate. In the first episode of this season we have the Palestinian politician who\u2019s really challenging Saul and making credible, cogent points about the ways that America has failed. I was happy about that at least.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd256b073f6321f7f29ed6dc3ab69dc14d49cff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd256b073f6321f7f29ed6dc3ab69dc14d49cff1/0_0_1920_1153/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Danes in the final season of Homeland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danes in the final season of Homeland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sifeddine Elamine/Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another sensitive area has been <em>Homeland\u2019s</em> portrayal of bipolar disorder. But Danes received positive feedback from people with the disorder. \u201cThey\u2019ve been mostly appreciative, which I feel great relief about and gratitude for. That condition is not dramatised all that often so I think any conversation that\u2019s stimulated by it is welcome. I never wanted her being bipolar to be a gimmick or just a convenient plot device, and I tried to be as specific and informed as possible. It\u2019s a really fascinating human condition. I developed such respect for people who work as diligently as they do to just make it through a day.\u201d</p> <p>Actors sometimes talk about taking a while to shake off their last part, as if the character lingers like a ghost. Will Danes, who is now thinking about originating her own material, miss Carrie Mathison? \u201cOh my gosh, so much,\u201d she says via the FaceTime link, where there will be no farewell handshake. \u201cI loved her. It was just so nice to play the smartest person in the room, somebody who was so daring and unapologetically ambitious and such a badass.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps the defining image of Homeland, one of the most ambitious US drama series of the past decade, is Claire Danes\u2019s character, Carrie Mathison, a mercurial CIA officer, staring at a video screen and displaying a sixth sense for the vital clue. So it is fitting that Danes appears to this interviewer not in person but via FaceTime. \u201cLet me just get on to my wifi,\u201d she says, as the signal flickers, \u201cI thought I was. OK, that should be better.\u201d Danes and her husband, the British actor Hugh Dancy, who have two sons \u2013 a seven-year-old and an 18-month-old \u2013 are weathering the coronavirus storm at a country house two hours north of New York, by far the worst-hit US city. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of acclimatising to this crazy new reality where we FaceTime all the time with everybody.\u201d And like millions of other parents, the 40-year-old actor is suddenly dealing with the challenge of home-schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s full-on but I\u2019m trying to download math apps and order a bunch of workbooks and stuff from Amazon, hoping that\u2019ll keep them engaged.\u201d When the crisis erupted and brought daily life shuddering to a standstill, Danes had been enjoying her first few days back in \u201ccivilian\u201d life after a blitz of media interviews to mark the end of Homeland after eight seasons, 96 episodes and five Golden Globe awards. She had been looking forward to catching some theatre. In contrast with other art forms, pre-recorded television is immune to the virus (\u201cIt\u2019s a resilient medium, it turns out\u201d), and Homeland\u2019s last bow may get a ratings boost from a captive audience. They will be witnessing the end of a landmark of 21st-century television, a drama set in the world of espionage and counterterrorism that has thrilled, surprised, frustrated, courted controversy, disappointed and returned to form, swung between sublime and ridiculous and, above all, never been less than relevant. It is striking now that Homeland is often described as the first true post-9/11 drama when, in fact, it was born a full decade after the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. Perhaps events of such magnitude take that long to sink in, and we will have to wait 10 years for similarly rich drama reflecting the age of Donald Trump and the coronavirus. Created by Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon of 24 fame, Homeland never had the more writerly aspirations of Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Sopranos or The Wire. But it was always contemporary, urgent, looking outward and thinking big. It captured many Americans\u2019 ambivalence about the \u201cwar on terror\u201d and their role in the world and showed tremendous capacity for reinvention. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like origami,\u201d says Danes. \u201cYou just refold it and it becomes a slightly different creature. Its function was to mirror what was happening in the world and that\u2019s ever changing, so by definition it had places to move and grow, and it was never going to suffer too badly from stagnation. My character was so wildly dynamic there was always a new facet to start to explore.\u201d At its heart was a compelling relationship not, as first expected, between Mathison, a brilliant rule-breaker whose mind moves like jazz, and Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), a prisoner of war suspected of treason, but between Mathison and Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), who emerges as her mentor and father figure. \u201cI think that\u2019s a wonderful and surprising love story,\u201d Danes reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s not one that we see depicted all that often in pop culture: mentor and mentee.\u201d The rapport with Patinkin was mirrored off screen \u201ckind of from the word go\u201d, Danes says. \u201cIn our first read-through the chemistry was really powerful and palpable. He looks uncannily like my best friend\u2019s dad, who kind of raised me and is a wonderful person but, if [he] got mad at you, you felt pretty shitty. I think that helped: very strong Pavlovian response already built in! And he\u2019s [Patinkin] just very good at what he does. Our partnership grew and deepened over time.\u201d When Danes and Patinkin filmed their final scene together, the end of Homeland truly sank in. She recalls: \u201cIt\u2019s not a casual scene. I think for me that was my cathartic moment when I realised it was over, because to say goodbye to it in its entirety is just too abstract and too huge. There were some tears \u2013 many of them \u2013 and we just hugged each other for a really long time.\u201d Danes was born in New York to artistic parents \u2013 a photographer and painter \u2013 and began learning modern dance when she was four years old. She was studying acting and performing on stage and screen by the age of 10, and landed her breakthrough role in My So-Called Life at 14, which took her to Los Angeles. She starred opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 1996 Romeo + Juliet before studying for two years at Yale University. Her bohemian upbringing was not obvious preparation for playing a cog in the wheel of the national security apparatus and, at times, an agent of American imperialism. \u201cI grew up in downtown New York, surrounded by artists and deeply liberal folks who had a lot of scepticism about these organisations and institutions,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re suddenly playing somebody who is in that world you can\u2019t help but be moved by their efforts. I was really struck by their patriotism, that people make profound sacrifices on behalf of our country. I took that very seriously.\u201d Adapted for the US Showtime network from Gideon Raff\u2019s Israeli series Prisoners of War, Homeland exploded into life in 2011, when water-cooler television was still a thing and a company called Netflix was working on its first original programme, House of Cards. Presumed dead, US marine sergeant Brody turns out to have been held as a prisoner of war by al-Qaida for eight years. He returns to America and a hero\u2019s welcome. But CIA officer Mathison can see something no else does: that Brody has been turned and is now a double agent poised to attack America. She sounds the alarm but is not believed \u2013 in part, because of her bipolar disorder. And then she and Brody have a fling. The first series dazzled critics, gained fans including Barack Obama and won Emmy awards for best lead actress, lead actor, drama series and writing for drama series. Season two maintained the momentum, including an audacious, much-praised episode in which Mathison interrogates Brody at great length. But in a recent Los Angeles Times interview, Gansa said \u201cit became much more difficult to write the show\u201d after that episode. A subplot in which Brody again becomes a double agent was \u201cstrained\u201d. The series indulged twists and turns that stretched credulity, and was in danger of \u201cjumping the shark\u201d. \u201cWhere Did Homeland Go Wrong?\u201d demanded the New Yorker magazine. The radical solution, apparently against Showtime\u2019s wishes, was amputation: Brody was killed off, publicly hanged from a crane in Tehran as punishment for killing the head of Iranian intelligence, with Mathison watching in horror. It was a chance for Homeland to start over. The team began attending an annual \u201cspy camp\u201d at the City Tavern Club in Georgetown, Washington DC, absorbing the accumulated insights and knowledge of current and former intelligence agents, diplomatic old hands and, one year, National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden. Speaking by phone, one of the participants in these brainstorming events, Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and NSA, recalls: \u201cA lot of times it was, \u2018OK, what\u2019s happening now?\u2019 We talked about that and then they talked about whichever plot they were thinking about.

And she comes full circle to find herself in Brody\u2019s shoes, under suspicion for possibly having been turned by a foreign adversary. Homeland\u2019s politics remains complex and problematic. Some argue that, in the later years, it sought redemption. Did Danes observe a conscious tilt to the left? \u201cI don\u2019t know if we were editorialising too much,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we were really just charting that curve. Our [America\u2019s] response to 9/11 was not great. We didn\u2019t identify the real source of danger and conflict and we were too reactionary and we betrayed a lot of our values because of the panic we were in. \u201cSo we kind of learned that as we went along. When I was talking to Alex [Gansa] about the final season, he framed it in a way that was helpful. He said when we first started telling our story, it was directly to do with our response to 9/11, and nearly a decade later we\u2019re wondering if we\u2019ve in fact learned anything, if we would react differently. \u201cHe simulated an event that would sort of be comparable in scale, as traumatising and as consequential, which is the president\u2019s helicopter going down. That was a litmus test. How do our characters in this story interpret that? Do they pause and judiciously consider their next move or do they go straight into offensive mode, a fear-based mode?\u201d One of the most enduring criticisms of the series is its portrayal of Muslims. Under the headline \u201cHomeland is the most bigoted show on television\u201d, writer and film-maker Laura Durkay wrote in the Washington Post in 2014: \u201cSince its first episode, Homeland has churned out Islamophobic stereotypes as if its writers were getting paid by the cliche.\u201d The following year, Arab graffiti artists who had been hired by the producers to add realism to the set of Syrian refugee camp wrote: \u201cHomeland is racist.\u201d No one noticed and translated it until the episode was broadcast. It was, one comedian observed, a major intelligence failure. Danes acknowledges: \u201cThat was a good stunt. All of our hats were off to them.\u201d On the broader issue, she says: \u201cI get it. I think it\u2019s tricky and kind of inherently problematic, right? There are a lot of brown people in our story who are doing really bad things, and there aren\u2019t enough opportunities to create a more balanced portrait of that demographic. That was always going to be a point of vulnerability for us, but I also think that our heroes are really problematic and really flawed. We\u2019re wrestling with some pretty challenging questions and ideas and those two sides of various arguments were personified by our characters. \u201cIn most cases I think both characters were right. Our writers were fairly responsible about that, creating a real debate. In the first episode of this season we have the Palestinian politician who\u2019s really challenging Saul and making credible, cogent points about the ways that America has failed. I was happy about that at least.\u201d Another sensitive area has been Homeland\u2019s portrayal of bipolar disorder. But Danes received positive feedback from people with the disorder. \u201cThey\u2019ve been mostly appreciative, which I feel great relief about and gratitude for. That condition is not dramatised all that often so I think any conversation that\u2019s stimulated by it is welcome. I never wanted her being bipolar to be a gimmick or just a convenient plot device, and I tried to be as specific and informed as possible. It\u2019s a really fascinating human condition. I developed such respect for people who work as diligently as they do to just make it through a day.\u201d Actors sometimes talk about taking a while to shake off their last part, as if the character lingers like a ghost. Will Danes, who is now thinking about originating her own material, miss Carrie Mathison? \u201cOh my gosh, so much,\u201d she says via the FaceTime link, where there will be no farewell handshake. \u201cI loved her. It was just so nice to play the smartest person in the room, somebody who was so daring and unapologetically ambitious and such a badass. She\u2019s not really going away.\u201d Homeland season eight screens on Channel 4 at 9pm (UK) and at 9pm on Showtime in the US. The entire series concludes on 26 April (US) and 3 May (UK)",

      "bodyText": "The twist of fate that has cast Jared Kushner as a would-be savior in the greatest public health crisis to confront the United States in a century is a dramatic one. The moment of national peril has been compared to September 11. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said coronavirus was her country\u2019s greatest challenge since the second world war. As the leader of the federal government effort to distribute emergency equipment to the states, Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, has mostly shied from the public stage, but he now is working in history\u2019s spotlight. His vast responsibilities include weighing requests from governors for aid and coordinating with private companies to obtain medical equipment, work he carries out from a special post created for him inside the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where his team is called \u201cthe Slim Suit crowd\u201d for their distinctive tailoring, the New York Times has reported. Kushner\u2019s team was credited with coordinating a planeload of medical supplies that arrived in the US from China last week. But some of those familiar with Kushner\u2019s record at the White House and in his prior professional life question why the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus threat is being run by the president\u2019s 39-year-old son-in-law. \u201cIt scares the hell out of me,\u201d said David Pepper, the chair of the Ohio Democratic party, who offered bipartisan words of praise for the crisis response of his state\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine. \u201cKushner has terrible judgment, and I don\u2019t remember a decision he\u2019s been involved with that hasn\u2019t just been bad \u2013 they\u2019ve been horrible. And the idea that everything has to go through the very flawed judgment of Jared Kushner is downright scary, and I believe at this point is costing American lives.\u201d Early this year, Kushner reportedly advised Donald Trump that the coronavirus was not that dangerous \u2013 more a threat to public confidence, and the markets, than to public health. Trump stuck with that message for six tragic weeks, between the confirmation of the first US case and a belated federal decision to speed the development of test kits. And it was Kushner who helped write a disastrous Trump Oval Office speech on 12 March announcing a European travel ban that sent markets into a tailspin and travelers crowding into airports. It was Kushner who solicited help from the father of the fashion model Karlie Kloss, his sister-in-law, to ask a Facebook group of doctors what should be done about the virus. Pepper expressed concern that when a governor calls the White House, she has to talk to Kushner, who then decides, apparently unilaterally, what the state really needs. \u2018He runs a shadow taskforce\u2019 In a rare appearance in the White House briefing room Thursday, Kushner said some governors did not have precise knowledge of their state\u2019s inventory of ventilators and delivered a lecture on the art of management. \u201cThe way the federal government is trying to allocate is, they\u2019re trying to make sure you have your data right,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cDon\u2019t ask us for things when you don\u2019t know what you have in your own state, just because you\u2019re scared. \u201cWhat a lot of the voters are seeing now is that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or governor or president, you\u2019re trying to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is a time of crisis and you\u2019re seeing certain people are better managers than others.\u201d Walter Shaub, a former director of the Office of Government Ethics under Barack Obama, reacted strongly on Twitter, calling Kushner a \u201cfeckless nepotist who presumes to criticize governors striving to fill the void left by this previously unimaginable federal failure!\u201d Trump has placed top experts in public health and disaster response on his coronavirus taskforce, including Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s foremost infectious disease expert, and Dr Deborah Birx, the former head of global health at the state department. But the adviser with the most influence over what Trump says and does appears to be Kushner, the son of a billionaire New Jersey developer, who just two months ago asserted his expertise on the Middle East conflict by saying: \u201cI\u2019ve read 25 books on it.\u201d The precise dimensions of Kushner\u2019s emergency response role are difficult to pin down because his authority, which stems from his marriage, exists outside the mapped structure of government agencies. He seems to be inventing his role on the fly, and to have the power to do so. Asked on Thursday to reply to reports that he runs a \u201cshadow taskforce\u201d on the coronavirus, Kushner smiled and said Mike Pence had asked him to help out. \u201cI can assure that you I\u2019m speaking with Dr Birx, Dr Fauci, the vice-president and the president multiple times a day, to make sure that I\u2019m accomplishing and focusing on the objectives that the vice-president deems a priority,\u201d he said. \u2018Kushner urged Trump to open America up by Easter\u2019 Kushner, who before his White House stint ran a newspaper into the ground and a real estate company into the red, has already made mistakes in the coronavirus crisis that cannot be recovered, his critics say. It was Kushner who reportedly spread the word that Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, was being alarmist when Cuomo asked the federal government for 30,000 emergency ventilators for the state. \u201cI have all this data about ICU capacity,\u201d Kushner was quoted as telling Trump by a White House source speaking to Vanity Fair. \u201cI\u2019m doing my own projections, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot smarter about this. New York doesn\u2019t need all the ventilators.\u201d It\u2019s not clear why Kushner thinks that. Cuomo announced on Friday that the national guard would deploy across the state to seize ventilators from hospitals that do not currently need them to deliver to New York City and other areas in need. And it was Kushner who urged Trump to overrule the health experts on staff and declare that America would be \u201copen for business\u201d on Easter with \u201cpacked churches all over our country\u201d, in Trump\u2019s words. Easter is one week away. The White House has since pushed the date back. The White House did not reply to a request for comment for this story. Kushner on Thursday asserted that the administration was turning in a strong performance. \u201cWe\u2019ve done things that the government has never done before, quicker than they\u2019ve ever done it before,\u201d he said, without specifying what, exactly. A month ago, Trump said the country would perform 4m tests a week. As of Thursday, the total tests conducted in the United States so far was 1.3m, Birx said. \u2018He surrounds himself with yes men\u2019 Elizabeth Spiers, one of a carousel of editors Kushner appointed during his ill-fated tenure as publisher of the New York Observer newspaper, recently described her horror at the prospect of her former boss as coronavirus czar. \u201cThe short version is that Jared Kushner is incurious, not inclined to defer to experts, and surrounds himself with yes men, so he is unaccustomed to being told that his decision-making is bad,\u201d Spiers wrote. \u201cHe believes his capabilities far exceed what they are, and his assessment is reinforced by the people around him who are paid to tell him that. In this sense, he is not unlike his father-in-law.\u201d Kushner grew up in New Jersey and matriculated at Harvard after his father, Charles Kushner, gave the school $2.5m. He took over the family\u2019s real estate business when his father went to prison for tax evasion and witness tampering. He married Ivanka Trump in 2009. He has an infamously broad portfolio in the White House. In addition to being in charge of bringing peace to the Middle East, Kushner is or was in charge of Trump\u2019s impeachment strategy; the Trump 2020 campaign budget; diplomacy with Saudi Arabia and Beijing, which both have targeted him as an asset, according to US intelligence assessments; solving the opioid crisis; developing internet infrastructure; running an \u201cOffice of American Innovation\u201d building a border wall, and more. \u201cHopefully my results speak for themselves,\u201d Kushner told Time magazine for a January profile. \u201cI think that I\u2019ve accomplished a lot. I think the president trusts me, and he knows I\u2019ve had his back, and he knows that I\u2019ve been able to execute for him on a lot of different objectives.\u201d Kushner has occasionally delivered for the administration, steering a criminal justice reform bill into law in late 2018. The problem with Kushner is ultimately a problem with Trump, Pepper said. \u201cIt\u2019s a case study for the problem with nepotism,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen [Ohio governor] DeWine is standing up there, even though his own kids are involved in politics \u2013 they\u2019re not the ones standing next to him. Who\u2019s leading the Ohio response? Amy Acton, the state health director, who has studied and taught this her whole life. \u201cThe biggest difference between DeWine and Trump is, one is relying on experts who have prepared for this for years. \u201cAnd the other is relying on Jared Kushner.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "If predictions about the spread of Covid-19 are correct, the new NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCel centre in London\u2019s Docklands could soon see a \u201ctsunami\u201d of coronavirus patients. Many will have pneumonia and require ventilators, which is why cubicles in the new 4,000-bed facility all have oxygen equipment. It is to hoped this onslaught never comes and infections spread less rapidly than projections show. But if the worst happens, what can doctors and nurses expect? NHS workers could do worse than examine the experience of another London hospital during the Spanish influenza pandemic just over 100 years ago. Today, that hospital is named St Charles and offers walk-in care at the northern end of Ladbroke Grove, Kensington. But in 1918 it was known as St Marylebone Infirmary and had 744 beds for the \u201csick poor\u201d, many of whom had tuberculosis and other chronic lung conditions. In October 1918, as a second wave of Spanish influenza spread across Britain, its wards were inundated with pneumonia cases. According to the infirmary\u2019s medical superintendent, Basil Hood, the hospital \u201cliterally reeled\u201d. Hood\u2019s harrowing frontline account is the centerpiece of an online exhibition and animation created by created by Viralanimation for London\u2019s Florence Nightingale Museum (temporarily closed). \u201cAll training, and indeed every sort of trimming, went by the board,\u201d Hood recalled in his notebook 30 years later. \u201cThe staff fought like Trojans to feed the patients, scramble as best they could through the most elementary nursing and keep the delirious in bed!\u201d In normal circumstances, St Marylebone Infirmary ought to have been able to cope, but 1918 was not a normal time: by November, when the first world war came to an end, around half of the hospital\u2019s nurses had been called to military service. Having been decorated for bravery under fire, many nurses now fell victim to influenza. \u201cEach day the difficulties became more pronounced as the patients increased and the nurses decreased, going down like ninepins themselves,\u201d Hood wrote. \u201cSad to relate some of these gallant girls lost their lives in this never-to-be-forgotten scourge and as I write I can see some of them now literally fighting to save their friends then going down and dying themselves.\u201d Hood made the nurses wear lint masks and advised them \u201cnot to interpose their faces too near the blast of those coughing\u201d. But when it came to tending to a fellow nurse, many refused to wear the masks for fear of distressing their colleague. In the case of one nurse, Hood noted: \u201cNothing I could do or say had the slightest effect in influencing her to diminish the risks to herself. She was consumed with a burning desire to save her \u2026 inevitably, the nurse developed a lung infection, dying soon after the woman she had been nursing.\u201d By December, Hood was exhausted and went on sick leave. When he returned in February, the epidemic was still raging and two more nurses had died, bringing the fatalities to nine. \u201cOne poor nurse, I remember, with a terribly acute influenzal pneumonia, became so distressed she could not stay in bed and insisted on being propped up against the wall by her bed until she was finally drowned in her profuse, thin blood-stained sputum.\u201d Revisiting his notes in retirement, Hood called the epidemic \u201cthe worst and most distressing occurrence of my professional life\u201d. In all, the hospital had admitted 850 influenza patients. In an era before vaccines and antibiotics, nearly half had developed pneumonia, many due to secondary bacterial infections, and 197 had died. By the time the pandemic ended in April 1919, 250,000 Britons had perished. Of course, coronavirus is a very different pathogen from influenza. Unlike the Spanish flu, which was most threatening to adults aged 20 to 40, Covid-19 is most deadly for over-70s and those with underlying medical conditions.

By contrast, no one had immunity to the new coronavirus, which is why it is estimated that 80% of the British population could be infected by the time the pandemic is over. Writing shortly after the establishment of the NHS in 1948, Hood worried that despite the arrival of vaccines and new drugs such as penicillin, the hospital system would struggle to cope with a virus as destructive as Spanish flu. \u201cOur helplessness now,\u201d Hood wrote, \u201cwould be nearly as great.\u201d But that was then. At the ExCel centre, contractors have been working night and day to fit out the NHS Nightingale hospital. More field hospitals are planned at the NEC in Birmingham, the Principality stadium in Cardiff, the Manchester Central complex, the University of the West of England and the Harrogate convention centre. Doctors and nurses working at the Nightingale and other field hospitals will have modern personal protection equipment including, for use when intubating patients or performing bronchoscopies, FFP3 respirator masks, providing the highest available level of protection. Following the recent deaths of two British hospital consultants from Covid-19, it is to be hoped that \u2013 unlike the tragic nurse in 1918 \u2013 this time no one will choose not to use them.

But in these neighbourhoods, the idea of protecting oneself from coronavirus must seem as miraculous as clean water.</p> <p>Last week, tens of thousands of Indian workers, suddenly deprived of the possibility of pay, and with most public transport having been shut down, decided to walk back to their home villages, often hundreds of miles away, in the greatest mass exodus since partition. <a href=\"https://thewire.in/labour/nearly-81-of-the-employed-in-india-are-in-the-informal-sector-ilo\">Four out of five</a> Indians work in the informal sector. Almost 140 million, more than a quarter of India\u2019s working population, are <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/india-has-139-million-internal-migrants-we-must-not-forget-them/\">migrants from elsewhere in the country</a>. Yet their needs had barely figured in the thinking of policymakers, who seemed shocked by the actions of the workers.</p> <p>India\u2019s great exodus shows that \u201cmigration\u201d is not, as we imagine in the west, merely external migration, but internal migration, too. Internal migrants, whether in India, Nigeria or South Africa, are often treated as poorly as external ones and often for the same reason \u2013 they are not seen as \u201cone of us\u201d and so denied basic rights and dignities. In one particularly shocking incident, hundreds of migrants returning to the town of Bareilly, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/covid-19-outbreak-migrant-workers-sprayed-with-disinfectant-in-ups-bareilly/articleshow/74888857.cms\">were sprayed</a> by officials with chemicals usually used to sanitise buses. They might as well have been vermin, not just metaphorically but physically, too.</p> <p>All this should make us think harder about what we mean by \u201ccommunity\u201d. In Britain, the pandemic has led to a flowering of social-mindedness and community solidarity. Where I live in south London, a mutual aid group has sprung up to help self-isolating older people. The food bank has gained a new throng of volunteers. Such welcome developments have been replicated in hundreds of places around the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1564a24686b5d26af0a16d752301ac1e55988c88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1564a24686b5d26af0a16d752301ac1e55988c88/0_208_3543_2126/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Armed soldiers enforce lockdown in Johannesburg\u2019s Alexandra township\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South African National Defence Force soldiers enforce lockdown in Johannesburg\u2019s Alexandra township on 28 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luca Sola/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the idea of a community is neither as straightforward nor as straightforwardly good as we might imagine. When Donald Trump reportedly offers billions of dollars to a German company to create a vaccine to be used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal\">exclusively for Americans</a>, when Germany <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3bc25ea-652c-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5\">blocks the export</a> of medical equipment to Italy, when Britain, unlike <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-portugal/portugal-to-treat-migrants-as-residents-during-coronavirus-crisis-idUKKBN21F0MC\">Portugal</a>, refuses to extend to asylum seekers the right to access benefits and healthcare during the coronavirus crisis, each does so in the name of protecting a particular community or nation.</p> <p>The rhetoric of community and nation can become a means not just to discount those deemed not to belong but also to obscure divisions within. In India, Narendra Modi\u2019s BJP government constantly plays to nationalist themes, eulogising Mother India, or Bh\u0101rat Mata. But it\u2019s a nationalism that excludes many groups, from Muslims to the poor. In Dharavi and Alexandra and Makoko, and many similar places, it will not simply be coronavirus but also the willingness of the rich, both in poor countries and in wealthier nations, to ignore gross inequalities that will kill.</p> <p>In Britain in recent weeks, there has been a welcome, belated recognition of the importance of low-paid workers. Yet in the decade before that, their needs were sacrificed to the demands of austerity, under the mantra of \u201cwe\u2019re all in it together\u201d. We need to beware of the same happening after the pandemic, too, of the rhetoric of community and nation being deployed to protect the interests of privileged groups. We need to beware, too, that in a world that many insist will be more nationalist, and less global, we don\u2019t simply ignore what exists in places such as Alexandra and Makoko and Dharavi.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all at risk from the virus,\u201d observed Gove. That\u2019s true. It is also true that societies, both nationally and globally, are structured in ways that ensure that some face far more risk than others \u2013 and not just from coronavirus. </p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

They might as well have been vermin, not just metaphorically but physically, too. All this should make us think harder about what we mean by \u201ccommunity\u201d. In Britain, the pandemic has led to a flowering of social-mindedness and community solidarity. Where I live in south London, a mutual aid group has sprung up to help self-isolating older people. The food bank has gained a new throng of volunteers. Such welcome developments have been replicated in hundreds of places around the country. But the idea of a community is neither as straightforward nor as straightforwardly good as we might imagine. When Donald Trump reportedly offers billions of dollars to a German company to create a vaccine to be used exclusively for Americans, when Germany blocks the export of medical equipment to Italy, when Britain, unlike Portugal, refuses to extend to asylum seekers the right to access benefits and healthcare during the coronavirus crisis, each does so in the name of protecting a particular community or nation. The rhetoric of community and nation can become a means not just to discount those deemed not to belong but also to obscure divisions within. In India, Narendra Modi\u2019s BJP government constantly plays to nationalist themes, eulogising Mother India, or Bh\u0101rat Mata. But it\u2019s a nationalism that excludes many groups, from Muslims to the poor. In Dharavi and Alexandra and Makoko, and many similar places, it will not simply be coronavirus but also the willingness of the rich, both in poor countries and in wealthier nations, to ignore gross inequalities that will kill. In Britain in recent weeks, there has been a welcome, belated recognition of the importance of low-paid workers. Yet in the decade before that, their needs were sacrificed to the demands of austerity, under the mantra of \u201cwe\u2019re all in it together\u201d. We need to beware of the same happening after the pandemic, too, of the rhetoric of community and nation being deployed to protect the interests of privileged groups. We need to beware, too, that in a world that many insist will be more nationalist, and less global, we don\u2019t simply ignore what exists in places such as Alexandra and Makoko and Dharavi. \u201cWe\u2019re all at risk from the virus,\u201d observed Gove. That\u2019s true. It is also true that societies, both nationally and globally, are structured in ways that ensure that some face far more risk than others \u2013 and not just from coronavirus. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>I am a man who wears women\u2019s clothes. The first time it happened was in the mid-70s. I\u2019d recently left school and was a couple of months into an art foundation course at Manchester Polytechnic. I found myself on my own for a weekend in the flat I shared with two fellow students. Bored, I started rummaging down the back of the sofa to see what curiosities \u2013 or money \u2013 I might find. A moment later I pulled out a single stocking, which I immediately put on. Instinctively. Transgressively. It triggered years of guilt, self-disgust and confusion.</p> <p>So why did I put that stocking on?</p> <p>In the early 1960s, as a little kid, I\u2019d watched my mother dress and, I think, just expected to grow up to be like her. However, I soon came to realise I was a boy, which I accepted\u2026 Until in my teens I came across an article in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2016/mar/06/return-oz-most-controversial-magazine-60s-goes-online\" title=\"\">Oz</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2016/mar/06/return-oz-most-controversial-magazine-60s-goes-online\" title=\"\"> magazine</a>.</p> <p><em>Oz</em> was a notorious alternative magazine and, as a rebellious, middle-class school kid, I sought out weird music, strange books and publications like <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2009/jul/17/international-times-underground-newspaper\" title=\"\">International Times</a></em> and the comics of underground cartoonists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/robert-crumb\" title=\"\">Robert Crumb</a> and Gilbert Shelton. The piece in <em>Oz</em> was about a boy who wakes one morning to find himself transformed into a girl. In reality, it was an excuse to publish some titillating erotic photographs, but still\u2026 An idea had been planted and from that moment on I wasn\u2019t content to be a boy.</p> <p>After the stocking incident, I started collecting items of girls\u2019 clothing. I remember having a pair of tights and a pink one-piece swimsuit I\u2019d rescued one holiday when my sister was having a clear-out. I kept them hidden at the back of a drawer and, when the compulsion became too strong, I\u2019d wait until my flatmates were out and slip into them. All the while listening for a key in the front door and the creak of feet on the stairs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were no role models for a boy who wanted to cross-dress</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For years I agonised over why I was obsessed with dressing as a girl. Maybe there\u2019d been a mess-up in my genes, or something had happened during my upbringing? Perhaps, God had made me like this\u2026 or maybe I even, somehow or other, decided it for myself. Whatever the reason \u2013 and eventually I decided the reason didn\u2019t matter \u2013 I found myself floating through my late teens and 20s wishing I\u2019d been born a girl and dressing as one in secret whenever the urge became irresistible. Afterwards, I\u2019d be filled with feelings of sadness, fear and guilt. Sadness at being back in the real world of my male self; fear of being discovered, and guilt at doing something I thought \u2013 no, I knew \u2013 was perverted and abnormal. I was clearly sick in the head.</p> <p>Back in the 60s and 70s transvestism was on a very long alphabetical list of sexual deviations. There were certainly no role models for a teenage boy obsessed with dressing as a girl. The only cross-dressers I ever saw were men playing women for laughs in films or on television \u2013 female impersonators such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jun/01/danny-la-rue-obituary\" title=\"\">Danny La Rue</a>, comedians in the <em>Carry On</em> films or <em>Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus</em>. I was convinced that, dressed as a woman, I must look utterly ridiculous. A joke.</p> <p>Then, in 1981, something amazing happened. I moved to London and one day in a remainder bookshop found a copy of <em>Dressing Up</em>, Peter Ackroyd\u2019s 1979 history of transvestism and drag. I learned that, for centuries, in almost every country in the world, men and women had worn each other\u2019s clothes. I also saw Richard O\u2019Brien\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/04/how-we-made-rocky-horror\" title=\"\">Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></em> \u2013 a glorious celebration of dressing up in women\u2019s lingerie. It seemed I wasn\u2019t quite as weird and alone as I\u2019d thought.</p> <p>By the mid-80s my artwork was being published in newspapers and magazines and I couldn\u2019t resist slipping my secret dressing-up obsession into my comic strips \u2013 disguised, of course. I peopled my cartoons with humans who feel compelled to dress as plants or fish; aliens who camouflage themselves as coat hangers; dissatisfied items of furniture \u2013 chairs, for example \u2013 who yearn to be tables. In my drawings, as in the real world, things weren\u2019t always quite what they seemed.</p> <p>When the internet arrived in the 90s, one idle evening it occurred to me to type the word \u201ctransvestite\u201d into an early search engine \u2013 and everything changed. Hundreds and thousands of pages of hits came down the wires and filled my computer screen. Millions of men, just like me, were wearing women\u2019s clothes behind closed curtains and locked doors. I was not alone, I was one of many. If I was a pervert, then I was in the company of countless numbers of other perverts.</p> <p>Slowly, I started seeing cross-dressing as a positive, magical thing rather than a curse. In my arty way I began thinking of myself as transforming from a man into an exotic, mythical creature, like a faun, perhaps, except I was part boy and part girl, rather than part boy and part goat. In my head, putting on the clothes of the opposite sex gradually shifted from a sickness to feeling more like a delightfully naughty blessing. Dressing up was a way of stepping through a wardrobe from one world into another. It was liberating \u2013 and <em>fun</em>!</p> <p>I soon discovered there were clubs and events I could go to, from huge, all night dress-up parties where everyone with every possible kind of kink was welcome, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/27/torture-garden-mass-brixton-hill\" title=\"\">Torture Garden</a>, to more specifically trans-orientated clubs, like the <a href=\"http://www.thewayoutclub.com/\" title=\"\">WayOut</a> \u2013 the first trans nightclub I ever went to.</p> <p>I remember my first visit vividly. The hours spent carefully applying makeup and trying on outfits; the waiting until it got dark before daring to slip out of the house in case one of the neighbours saw me; driving to the address convinced that everyone in the other cars could spot that I was a man; sitting in the parked car until the street was deserted before opening the door and tottering, in unfamiliar shoes and skirt, to the club entrance. It was utterly terrifying and completely exhilarating at the same time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was utterly terrifying and completely exhilarating at the same time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Transvestites began making appearances in my books and comic strips.

      "body": "<p>In a curious quirk of timing, my son has chosen the middle of a hygiene apocalypse to start kissing things. Having desired his affection for so long, we find ourselves having to navigate his performative affection with a lot more care and discomfort than we expected.</p> <p>He kisses terribly, and with little discernment. Planting his mouth on surfaces we can clean is one thing, but random objects when we are out taking our exercise, or passing dogs is quite another. Now that we\u2019re barred from even rubbing elbows with pals, it\u2019s strange to think I ever found kissed greetings awkward. Prior to social distancing, my Irish friends and I would kiss each other hello, but we\u2019ve still inherited some of our ancestors\u2019 awkwardness.</p> <p>One time my sister Orla hugged our auntie Alice around her waist and she recoiled as if she\u2019d been stabbed. I don\u2019t know that my grandparents\u2019 generation ever kissed anyone. Weddings ended with handshakes. Newborn babies were given a pinch of snuff and a military salute.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He kisses with little discernment. Surfaces we can clean are one thing, but passing dogs are quite another</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How much easier to have grown up in a culture of kissing hello, like the Mediterraneans. Not that some don\u2019t take it too far, of course. In Corsica they traditionally kiss five times on first meeting someone. Five times! You\u2019d be there all day. I\u2019ve never forgotten that fact,not least because it features in my favourite of all those jokes that need brackets in order to work.</p> <p>Q: Can you name a nationality that kisses five times?</p> <p>A: A Corsican! (Of course I can).</p> <p>It\u2019s clear my son hasn\u2019t yet worked out the function of kissing, but then neither have I. This week, perhaps nostalgic for basic affection, I found myself Googling \u2018history of kissing\u2019 and discovered it\u2019s not an innate human instinct at all. Dr Vaughn Bryant of Texas A&amp;M University \u2013 pleasingly referred to as \u2018an anthropologist who specialises in the history of the kiss\u2019 \u2013 says it\u2019s entirely learned. According to the world\u2019s premier smooch boffin, the habit was first mentioned only 3,500 years ago, and has simply spread, virus-like, since then.</p> <p>The idea that kissing is a learned behaviour seems odd until you watch someone learn it. Then it seems bewildering that we ever manage it at all. The difference between platonic and romantic kissing is an early hurdle, since some instinct for symmetry means my little Lothario always aims for my mouth until I redirect him to my cheek. There, his lips are as airtight as Dr Bryant\u2019s credentials for presenting a slinky Saturday night slot on Heart FM.</p> <p>I hope his enthusiasm prevails, undimmed by the temporary cessation of affection in which we all find ourselves. At least he has time to hone his skills until our friends and family meet lips-first once again. Can I hold on until then? A Corsican.</p> <p><em>Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In a curious quirk of timing, my son has chosen the middle of a hygiene apocalypse to start kissing things. Having desired his affection for so long, we find ourselves having to navigate his performative affection with a lot more care and discomfort than we expected. He kisses terribly, and with little discernment. Planting his mouth on surfaces we can clean is one thing, but random objects when we are out taking our exercise, or passing dogs is quite another. Now that we\u2019re barred from even rubbing elbows with pals, it\u2019s strange to think I ever found kissed greetings awkward. Prior to social distancing, my Irish friends and I would kiss each other hello, but we\u2019ve still inherited some of our ancestors\u2019 awkwardness. One time my sister Orla hugged our auntie Alice around her waist and she recoiled as if she\u2019d been stabbed. I don\u2019t know that my grandparents\u2019 generation ever kissed anyone. Weddings ended with handshakes. Newborn babies were given a pinch of snuff and a military salute. How much easier to have grown up in a culture of kissing hello, like the Mediterraneans. Not that some don\u2019t take it too far, of course. In Corsica they traditionally kiss five times on first meeting someone. Five times! You\u2019d be there all day. I\u2019ve never forgotten that fact,not least because it features in my favourite of all those jokes that need brackets in order to work. Q: Can you name a nationality that kisses five times? A: A Corsican! (Of course I can). It\u2019s clear my son hasn\u2019t yet worked out the function of kissing, but then neither have I. This week, perhaps nostalgic for basic affection, I found myself Googling \u2018history of kissing\u2019 and discovered it\u2019s not an innate human instinct at all. Dr Vaughn Bryant of Texas A&amp;M University \u2013 pleasingly referred to as \u2018an anthropologist who specialises in the history of the kiss\u2019 \u2013 says it\u2019s entirely learned. According to the world\u2019s premier smooch boffin, the habit was first mentioned only 3,500 years ago, and has simply spread, virus-like, since then. The idea that kissing is a learned behaviour seems odd until you watch someone learn it. Then it seems bewildering that we ever manage it at all. The difference between platonic and romantic kissing is an early hurdle, since some instinct for symmetry means my little Lothario always aims for my mouth until I redirect him to my cheek. There, his lips are as airtight as Dr Bryant\u2019s credentials for presenting a slinky Saturday night slot on Heart FM. I hope his enthusiasm prevails, undimmed by the temporary cessation of affection in which we all find ourselves. At least he has time to hone his skills until our friends and family meet lips-first once again. Can I hold on until then? A Corsican. Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats",

At the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, such a highly devolved system of governance made the woman nominally in charge of the country look oddly powerless: even when Angela Merkel announced the first raft of social-distancing measures, she could only make recommendations that the federal states were free to implement or ignore.

Federalism is useful for creating a dynamic business environment between different regions, but it can make it hard for an entire country to move in sync. States in the formerly socialist east, less severely hit by the virus, were reluctant to close their schools, drawing ire from southern states who feared their students would then be put at a disadvantage.

The country suddenly finds itself being held up as the model to be emulated for its high rates of testing \u2013 seen by many as the only strategy for being able to navigate a route out of lockdown measures. German public health services are provided not by one central authority but by approximately 400 public health offices, run by municipality and rural district administrations. Such an environment allows for a variety of laboratories \u2013 some attached to universities or hospitals, others privately run, medium-sized businesses \u2013 which act largely autonomously of central control. \u201cI don\u2019t have to wait to get a call from the health minister before I can go ahead with a test,\u201d said Matthias Orth, of the Institute of Laboratory Medicine at Stuttgart\u2019s Marienhospital.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s unlikely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/07/polly-samson-books-interview-the-kindness\">Polly Samson</a> knew that her fifth novel would be launched into a world teetering on the edge of the abyss, but there is something calculated about a book this sun-drenched coming out in early spring. Sitting in the shutdown, watching a grey mizzle of a day fade outside, <em>A Theatre for Dreamers</em> feels at once like a gift and an escape route. It\u2019s set on the dreamy Greek island of Hydra in 1960, focusing on the international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/dec/04/hydra-greece-leonard-cohen\">bohemian set that surrounded the authors Charmian Clift and George Johnston</a>. Prominent among the artists, poets and scroungers are a Norwegian couple \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/30/leonard-cohen-marianne-ihlen-love-affair-of-a-lifetime-nick-broomfield-documentary-words-of-love\">Axel Jensen</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/30/leonard-cohen-marianne-ihlen-love-affair-of-a-lifetime-nick-broomfield-documentary-words-of-love\"> and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/30/leonard-cohen-marianne-ihlen-love-affair-of-a-lifetime-nick-broomfield-documentary-words-of-love\">Marianne Ihlen</a> \u2013 and a young, charismatic Canadian by the name of Leonard Cohen.</p> <p>With such a vivid, atmospheric setup, the book almost writes itself, but Samson has done something more than just wallow in the loveliness of it all. This novel will be a surefire summer hit, but it has a darkness and complexity that reward careful reading. Cohen and Marianne operate at tangents to the central story of the novel, which is narrated by the likable ingenue Erica, a novitiate novelist in her late teens whose mother\u2019s dying wish was for her daughter to go off on an adventure. Erica\u2019s mother lived under the heel of a primly dictatorial husband, although there is evidence of a secret life in her friendship with Clift and a squirrelled-away bequest that permits Erica, her brother Bobby and her boyfriend Jimmy to escape drab London for Greece. They come, as the irate and tubercular George Johnston puts it, \u201clured by our fantastically blue water and cheap rent to live out their carefree immorality away from prying city eyes\u201d.</p> <p>Partly, the novel does exactly what one would expect, giving us a kind of sexed-up <em>The Durrells</em> of bougainvillea and thyme-scented hillsides, sunbathing and skinny-dipping in coves of crystalline water. There\u2019s a lot of high-flown prose, sentences that Lawrence Durrell himself would be proud of, for instance: \u201cThis evening has been born from one of those murmuring sundowns, our bodies molten as the sea and the sky turned to honey.\u201d More than this, though, it asks us to interrogate the mores of the 60s generation, which spoke so much about emancipation for women, but practised it hardly at all. Axel is a rotter, ignoring his wife and baby to waltz off with a host of younger women, while George and Charmian bicker and snipe at each other in person and in print. What could be paradise swiftly turns into something like a nightmare for Marianne, at least until Leonard arrives.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s unlikely Polly Samson knew that her fifth novel would be launched into a world teetering on the edge of the abyss, but there is something calculated about a book this sun-drenched coming out in early spring. Sitting in the shutdown, watching a grey mizzle of a day fade outside, A Theatre for Dreamers feels at once like a gift and an escape route. It\u2019s set on the dreamy Greek island of Hydra in 1960, focusing on the international bohemian set that surrounded the authors Charmian Clift and George Johnston. Prominent among the artists, poets and scroungers are a Norwegian couple \u2013 Axel Jensen and Marianne Ihlen \u2013 and a young, charismatic Canadian by the name of Leonard Cohen. With such a vivid, atmospheric setup, the book almost writes itself, but Samson has done something more than just wallow in the loveliness of it all. This novel will be a surefire summer hit, but it has a darkness and complexity that reward careful reading. Cohen and Marianne operate at tangents to the central story of the novel, which is narrated by the likable ingenue Erica, a novitiate novelist in her late teens whose mother\u2019s dying wish was for her daughter to go off on an adventure. Erica\u2019s mother lived under the heel of a primly dictatorial husband, although there is evidence of a secret life in her friendship with Clift and a squirrelled-away bequest that permits Erica, her brother Bobby and her boyfriend Jimmy to escape drab London for Greece. They come, as the irate and tubercular George Johnston puts it, \u201clured by our fantastically blue water and cheap rent to live out their carefree immorality away from prying city eyes\u201d. Partly, the novel does exactly what one would expect, giving us a kind of sexed-up The Durrells of bougainvillea and thyme-scented hillsides, sunbathing and skinny-dipping in coves of crystalline water. There\u2019s a lot of high-flown prose, sentences that Lawrence Durrell himself would be proud of, for instance: \u201cThis evening has been born from one of those murmuring sundowns, our bodies molten as the sea and the sky turned to honey.\u201d More than this, though, it asks us to interrogate the mores of the 60s generation, which spoke so much about emancipation for women, but practised it hardly at all. Axel is a rotter, ignoring his wife and baby to waltz off with a host of younger women, while George and Charmian bicker and snipe at each other in person and in print. What could be paradise swiftly turns into something like a nightmare for Marianne, at least until Leonard arrives. At one point Charmian asks Erica: \u201cWhere would these male writers be without their ministering angels?\u201d But the novel\u2019s message seems to question and problematise the role of muse. Erica is a kind of Nick Carraway-figure, largely on the outside of events, observing and learning from the more experienced, glamorous people she has fallen in with. Her first-person narrative \u2013 in a breathless present tense \u2013 lingers almost painfully over descriptions of Cohen, so that he does to the text what it was said he did to a room, dazzling everything in sight. Samson has decided to use Cohen\u2019s own words whenever he speaks, which means we get some passages of slightly stilted lyricism that jar with the otherwise note-perfect dialogue. The novel is bookended by Erica\u2019s later visits to the island, where she drops down through time to those halcyon days before Leonard and Marianne became a kind of shorthand for the artist and his muse, and everything is melancholy and nostalgic. A Theatre for Dreamers is at once a blissful piece of escapism and a powerful meditation on art and sexuality \u2013 just the book to bring light into these dark days. \u2022 A Theatre for Dreamers by Polly Samson is published by Bloomsbury Circus (\u00a314.99)",

      "body": "<p>Arguments between parents and children about screen time and online gaming are set to escalate with UK schools closed for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Concern was already growing among parents and children\u2019s charities about the increasing monetisation of popular computer, console and video games. Almost half of parents of children aged 12 to 15 who play online games, such as <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Fifa</em> and <em>Minecraft</em>, are worried about the pressure on children to make in-game purchases (up from four in 10 parents a year ago). This is according to Ofcom\u2019s adults\u2019 media use and attitudes report last month.</p> <p>There has been an explosion of in-game purchasing over the past few years. The online gaming market, which is worth around \u00a36bn in the UK, centres on games that players download, meaning the software can be updated at any time \u2013 and new content added during gameplay \u2013 at extra cost (known as \u201cmicro-transactions\u201d). The games and apps are linked to the customer\u2019s (parent\u2019s) bank account. Even supposedly \u201cfree\u201d apps and downloaded games have incentives for players to make in-game purchases.</p> <p>But the danger is that children can easily notch up a big bill on a parent\u2019s debit or credit card \u2013 in some cases without their knowledge. It can be difficult, if not impossible, to claim back the cash and there is no arbitrator or regulator for complaints.</p> <p>But who is at fault? Gaming companies point to the fact there are a wide range of parental and technological controls to block unauthorised transactions. Yet an NSPCC survey last year found just one in five parents use them.</p> <p>The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (Ukie), which represents the industry, launched its Get Smart About Play campaign in January this year after concerns were raised about the number of parents failing to use parental controls on internet-connected devices.</p> <p>\u201cGames companies do not want children racking up bills \u2013 especially without parental permission,\u201d Ukie says. \u2018The aim of our campaign is to inform parents of the parental controls available and give guidance on how to use them, and also help them have the common-sense conversations with their children about games.\u201d</p> <p>But Justine Roberts, founder of the parenting website Mumsnet, says many parents will continue to fall foul of micro-transactions. She says: \u201cParents know game and app developers are not altruistic; it is often made very easy for children to get sucked into games and then spend a fortune on in-game currencies, such as \u2018coins\u2019, \u2018berries\u2019 or \u2018doughnuts.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The social enterprise ParentZone, which provides support and information to parents, children and schools about safe internet use, has called for clearer signposting.</p> <p>It found three-quarters of children felt online video games tried to make them pay out as much as possible and about half said games were only fun when they spent money.</p> <p>Its \u201cRip-Off Games\u201d report highlighted so-called \u201cloot boxes\u201d as an area of big concern. Sometimes known as crates, bundles, packs or cartons) they are offered for players to buy during an online game but often the player does not know what they contain before they buy them \u2013 fuelling concerns that they are akin to gambling. There is peer pressure, too, says ParentZone, when several players are in the same game, and children feel the need to purchase the loot to \u201cfit in\u201d and \u201cmeasure up\u201d. It wants the government to commission further research into the overlap between gaming and gambling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5be41172d44a9b7ebbf0bc44a9c29cf4e18a26c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5be41172d44a9b7ebbf0bc44a9c29cf4e18a26c/810_185_3614_2168/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A loot box from the game Overwatch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A loot box from the game Overwatch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blizzard Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Google, Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony have agreed to provide the odds of receiving in-game items from \u201cloot boxes\u201d in all future releases, and Apple has done so since 2017, they remain a lucrative area for the industry \u2013 worth about \u00a3700m in the UK each year.</p> <p>Research by the Children\u2019s Commissioner, the public body to protect children, echoes the concerns raised by ParentZone.

But she contacted Apple, which was sympathetic. </p> <p>\u201cIt could see it was unusual spending for my account and agreed to refund in full. But I was not expecting it,\u201d says Juliet. \u201cNoah was mortifiedand very remorseful. It has been a good learning process for the family and we expect the boys to be open with us. We have a PlayStation and the boys have their own phones, but I have alerts set up so I get a message if they try to spend on the account. In any case, Noah always asks me now!\u201d</p> <p>Ukie says it encourages game developers and platforms to give a refund where it is clear a purchase was made without parental permission. But many parents will not so it pays to discuss boundaries and rules from the outset and use parental tech controls (see below).</p> <p>Pete Lewin, a lawyer with Purewal &amp; Partners, which offers legal advice to the tech and gaming industry, says: \u201cResponsibility lies on all sides to ensure children are gaming safely.

Help children learn how to protect themselves. Remind them not to share personal information and keep \u201cgaming friends\u201d in the game only and not add to social networks.</p> <p>\u2022 Do not disclose passcodes or passwords to children if they are using your devices, such as your phone or tablet. </p> <p>\u2022 Set up the maximum parental controls on your phone, tablets and games consoles. Information should be available online and from your phone, tablet or console provider. For example, Apple offers its \u201cFamily Sharing\u201d and \u201cAsk to Buy\u201d tools \u2013 which mean parents get an alert if a child asks to make a purchase. Turn on \u201cScreen Time\u201d in settings to disable in-app purchases. To set up family settings on an Xbox you will need to open a child account and link it to the parent\u2019s Microsoft account.

While Ethan is trying to escape a life of crime, <a href=\"http://nemesismodels.com/model/jordan-backhouse/\">Jordan is hoping to get out of his life of grime</a>. His nine-to-five as a labourer involved shovelling rubble and gutting soon-to-be gentrified properties that the likes of him would never be able affordon their current wages.</p> <p>Jordan shows his mother pictures that Nemesis\u2019s photographers have taken of him to establish his credentials for potential clients. \u201cManchester look, chavvy, know what I mean?\u201d he explains. \u201cYou can be called worse things, can\u2019t ya?\u201d she tells him as she scrolls.</p> <p>Jordan was scouted one night while walking around town. \u201cHe typifies everything we\u2019re looking for right now,\u201d says Nigel. \u201cWe want you to look like that, to be a lad, a scally, but we actually want you to be professional about it.\u201d Jordan\u2019s problem is that, in trial photo shoots, he didn\u2019t project himself with the verve he had displayed in his natural habitat. \u201cHe\u2019s a Manchester lad. He\u2019s got that gritty northern look, if you like.\u201d</p> <p>Ethan and Jordan are the success stories, the pair who are selected from a waiting room of 20 possibles. Some of the 18 rejects, though, were more handsome. But that is not the point. What Nemesis wants is not looks. It is a look. An attitude. If you are to be persuaded to purchase trackie bottoms and a no-less-flammable top, you won\u2019t want to buy them just because the model is gorgeous. You will want to buy into the lifestyle inscribed on the model\u2019s body and clobber. You must be made to believe that their badass strut, thousand-yard stare and ostensibly antinomian persona can be yours for the price of a hoodie.</p> <p>The day before Jordan\u2019s first assignment, his mum texts him: \u201cBed at 9pm for you gotta look after that face get your bum hole waxed.\u201d Some mothers hope their sons will be doctors, others that they will be cosmetically enhanced where the sun don\u2019t shine. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be getting many shots of my bum hole, Mum.\u201d Well, probably not for his first client, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jd-sports\">JD Sports</a>. But you never know, Jordan, what future clients may require. Best be, like the Scouts, prepared.</p> <p>I would have liked more on what it is like to be a man and to be objectified by photographers for a living, but neither Ethan nor Jordan reflect on that aspect of their chosen profession. But both nail what it means to them. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit easier staying still taking pictures than robbing people and selling their stuff \u2013 and at least it\u2019s legit,\u201d says Ethan.</p> <p>Jordan\u2019s first day as a model pays more than a week\u2019s labouring. Like boxing or football for previous Ethans and Jordans of this world, modelling could be an escape from the streets. Fingers crossed they will emulate another success story, 23-year-old Ruby, who has been modelling for less than a year and already earns more than \u00a310,000 a month. If she cracks the US, she could triple that. \u201cShe\u2019s got the badass look,\u201d explains a Nemesis functionary. \u201cWe know she will sell for us.\u201d We see her shooting in a Welsh quarry, the grey slate rhyming with her tough-girl check strides and black quilted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/apr/02/how-the-puffer-jacket-took-over-the-world\">puffer jacket</a>. If I wanted to look like a badass young woman, I would definitely buy what Ruby is modelling.</p>",

Jordan was scouted one night while walking around town. \u201cHe typifies everything we\u2019re looking for right now,\u201d says Nigel. \u201cWe want you to look like that, to be a lad, a scally, but we actually want you to be professional about it.\u201d Jordan\u2019s problem is that, in trial photo shoots, he didn\u2019t project himself with the verve he had displayed in his natural habitat. \u201cHe\u2019s a Manchester lad. He\u2019s got that gritty northern look, if you like.\u201d Ethan and Jordan are the success stories, the pair who are selected from a waiting room of 20 possibles. Some of the 18 rejects, though, were more handsome. But that is not the point. What Nemesis wants is not looks. It is a look. An attitude. If you are to be persuaded to purchase trackie bottoms and a no-less-flammable top, you won\u2019t want to buy them just because the model is gorgeous. You will want to buy into the lifestyle inscribed on the model\u2019s body and clobber. You must be made to believe that their badass strut, thousand-yard stare and ostensibly antinomian persona can be yours for the price of a hoodie. The day before Jordan\u2019s first assignment, his mum texts him: \u201cBed at 9pm for you gotta look after that face get your bum hole waxed.\u201d Some mothers hope their sons will be doctors, others that they will be cosmetically enhanced where the sun don\u2019t shine. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be getting many shots of my bum hole, Mum.\u201d Well, probably not for his first client, JD Sports. But you never know, Jordan, what future clients may require. Best be, like the Scouts, prepared. I would have liked more on what it is like to be a man and to be objectified by photographers for a living, but neither Ethan nor Jordan reflect on that aspect of their chosen profession. But both nail what it means to them. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit easier staying still taking pictures than robbing people and selling their stuff \u2013 and at least it\u2019s legit,\u201d says Ethan. Jordan\u2019s first day as a model pays more than a week\u2019s labouring. Like boxing or football for previous Ethans and Jordans of this world, modelling could be an escape from the streets. Fingers crossed they will emulate another success story, 23-year-old Ruby, who has been modelling for less than a year and already earns more than \u00a310,000 a month. If she cracks the US, she could triple that. \u201cShe\u2019s got the badass look,\u201d explains a Nemesis functionary. \u201cWe know she will sell for us.\u201d We see her shooting in a Welsh quarry, the grey slate rhyming with her tough-girl check strides and black quilted puffer jacket. If I wanted to look like a badass young woman, I would definitely buy what Ruby is modelling.",

      "body": "<p>Talking about Keir Starmer, one Labour MP recently asked a colleague: \u201cIs he another Ed Miliband?\u201d The question was the more pointed because the person posing it was none other than Ed Miliband himself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/03/undoing-of-ed-miliband-and-how-labour-lost-election\">the ex-leader</a> responsible for one of the quadruple election defeats suffered by Labour in the last decade.</p> <p>Miliband Mark II, a closet Blairite and a 21st-century version of Harold Wilson: a variety of labels have been applied to Mr Starmer. He has become irritated by it, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ridgeonsunday/status/1228970663504990211\">protesting</a> that \u201cI don\u2019t need someone else\u2019s name tattooed to my head\u201d. Yet he has invited these speculative attempts to define him by spending the long months of the leadership campaign deliberately eluding a precise ideological identity.</p> <p>That was based on the calculation that keeping it vague was the way to maximise his support. The cautiously calibrated route that he chose to take to the Labour leadership largely eschewed taking any positions that would divide party opinion. This pleased activists who wanted to draw a line under the bitter factionalism of the Corbyn years. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/apr/04/keir-starmer-labour-leadership-acceptance-speech-in-full-video\">victory statement</a> on Saturday morning, echoing the relentless mantra of his campaign speeches, again called for unity.</p> <p>Unity around what? He says he wants Labour to be both \u201cradical\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d. Who among them is going to say that they want to be \u201creactionary\u201d and \u201cirrelevant\u201d? He has spoken warmly about the legacy of the Corbyn years, while also saying that the party should rehabilitate the New Labour era. \u201cDon\u2019t trash the last Labour government and don\u2019t trash the last four years.\u201d He has suggested that the last manifesto was \u201coverloaded\u201d with too many promises, while at the same time issuing \u201c10 pledges\u201d that committed himself to a lot of Corbynite policy. The reward for this face-all-ways approach was to be swept into the leadership with a majority of first preference votes in every section of the electoral college and a very wide spectrum of support. He had the backing of people intimately associated with New Labour as well as those who were fervent admirers of Mr Corbyn. The downside of such a sprawling coalition is that this leaves a lot of potential scope for disappointment.</p> <p>The leftwingers who supported Mr Starmer are generally assuming he will put a more credible face on a Corbynite programme. They will be expecting him to stay faithful to its central tenets and are likely to react with angry cries of betrayal if he doesn\u2019t. He also attracted a lot of backing from the centre-left, including New Labour luminaries such as Charlie Falconer and Andrew Adonis. Mr Starmer took their support for granted during the contest, while he concentrated on wooing the left with activist-soothing pieties about the superiority of socialist values. The Labour centrists are assuming that he will reorient the party towards what they would call more sensible positions. \u201cHe\u2019s got two very different kinds of supporters,\u201d notes one very senior Labour figure. \u201cThey can\u2019t both be right about him.\u201d</p> <p>He starts with some clear advantages. One is that it will be hard to be worse than Jeremy Corbyn, author of such a dreadful defeat that Labour\u2019s parliamentary representation is crushed down to its lowest level <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/election-2019-50768605/general-election-2019-worst-night-for-labour-since-1935\">since 1935</a>. Mr Starmer can harvest some early credits by restoring professionalism to Labour as an opposition. Labour MPs expect, and Tories agree, that he will do a much better job of holding the government to account. As the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, he comes to the task of leadership with senior experience of running a complex organisation. It can be an advantage that he came into the Commons just five years ago. Having become an MP later in life than most, he is not encumbered by an accumulation of historical<strong> </strong>obligations and debts to colleagues. \u201cKeir is a loner really, not at all clubbable. He is one of the least cronyistic people I know,\u201d comments a fellow Labour lawyer. That ought to leave him free to make frontbench appointments based on merit. The shadow cabinet will be recast to remove Corbyn-loyalist duds and make better use of the talent pool on the Labour benches that has been under used in recent years. He will have a fight, which he must win, to remove the Corbyn acolytes at party headquarters. A leader is never properly in charge of a party unless he can count on the loyalty of the general secretary and other key officials.</p> <p>An early test of his mettle will be how he tackles antisemitism. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/inquiries-and-investigations/investigation-labour-party\">due to report</a> on whether Labour became an institutionally racist party during its calamitous experiment with Corbynism. A damning report will suit Mr Starmer if he uses it to make good on the promise in his victory statement to \u201ctear out this poison by its roots\u201d. He has indicated that he would support the automatic expulsion of any member found guilty of antisemitism, a position that will meet resistance among those on the left who will condemn it as a purge. Taking a robust, no-tolerance approach to antisemitism would allow the new leader to demonstrate to the public that Labour is now under a very different kind of management.</p> <p>Ah, yes, the electorate. Remember them, Labour? The party has been talking to itself rather than the country during the many months of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-jess-phillips-clarifies-brexit-stance-saying-she-cant-see-party-backing-remain-at-next-election-live-news\">leadership contest</a> so interminable that Britain was still a member of the EU when nominations opened. Yet voters will ultimately be the arbiters of whether Mr Starmer can put his party on the road to recovery or merely adds his name to the lengthening roster of failed Labour leaders.</p> <p>He won the leadership in part on the grounds of \u201celectability\u201d, which is a way of saying that he meets conventional expectations of what a potential prime minister ought to look and sound like. \u201cKeir passes the \u2018shut your eyes\u2019 test,\u201d says one supporter. \u201cYou can shut your eyes and imagine him standing outside Number 10.\u201d</p> <p>That is a necessary quality in someone who aspires to be prime minister, but it is not an entirely sufficient one. Successful political leaders also require a capacity to grab the attention and capture the imagination of voters. Tony Blair and David Cameron are the last two leaders to take their respective parties from opposition into power. Both had a talent for persuading the public that they had changed their parties for the better. Both combined that skill with an ability to convince the country that they had a plausible plan for national renewal.</p> <p>In this critical respect, Mr Starmer has yet to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/27/keir-starmer-profile-labours-non-aligned-leadership-frontrunner\">prove himself</a>. The words most often used when admirers describe him are decent, pleasant, diligent, forensic, moral, sensible, clever, collaborative and credible. You never hear him called exciting, captivating, entertaining, rousing, surprising or inspirational. He has yet to mint a cut-through zinger such as \u201ctough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Talking about Keir Starmer, one Labour MP recently asked a colleague: \u201cIs he another Ed Miliband?\u201d The question was the more pointed because the person posing it was none other than Ed Miliband himself, the ex-leader responsible for one of the quadruple election defeats suffered by Labour in the last decade. Miliband Mark II, a closet Blairite and a 21st-century version of Harold Wilson: a variety of labels have been applied to Mr Starmer. He has become irritated by it, protesting that \u201cI don\u2019t need someone else\u2019s name tattooed to my head\u201d. Yet he has invited these speculative attempts to define him by spending the long months of the leadership campaign deliberately eluding a precise ideological identity. That was based on the calculation that keeping it vague was the way to maximise his support. The cautiously calibrated route that he chose to take to the Labour leadership largely eschewed taking any positions that would divide party opinion. This pleased activists who wanted to draw a line under the bitter factionalism of the Corbyn years. His victory statement on Saturday morning, echoing the relentless mantra of his campaign speeches, again called for unity. Unity around what? He says he wants Labour to be both \u201cradical\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d. Who among them is going to say that they want to be \u201creactionary\u201d and \u201cirrelevant\u201d? He has spoken warmly about the legacy of the Corbyn years, while also saying that the party should rehabilitate the New Labour era. \u201cDon\u2019t trash the last Labour government and don\u2019t trash the last four years.\u201d He has suggested that the last manifesto was \u201coverloaded\u201d with too many promises, while at the same time issuing \u201c10 pledges\u201d that committed himself to a lot of Corbynite policy. The reward for this face-all-ways approach was to be swept into the leadership with a majority of first preference votes in every section of the electoral college and a very wide spectrum of support. He had the backing of people intimately associated with New Labour as well as those who were fervent admirers of Mr Corbyn. The downside of such a sprawling coalition is that this leaves a lot of potential scope for disappointment. The leftwingers who supported Mr Starmer are generally assuming he will put a more credible face on a Corbynite programme. They will be expecting him to stay faithful to its central tenets and are likely to react with angry cries of betrayal if he doesn\u2019t. He also attracted a lot of backing from the centre-left, including New Labour luminaries such as Charlie Falconer and Andrew Adonis. Mr Starmer took their support for granted during the contest, while he concentrated on wooing the left with activist-soothing pieties about the superiority of socialist values. The Labour centrists are assuming that he will reorient the party towards what they would call more sensible positions. \u201cHe\u2019s got two very different kinds of supporters,\u201d notes one very senior Labour figure. \u201cThey can\u2019t both be right about him.\u201d He starts with some clear advantages. One is that it will be hard to be worse than Jeremy Corbyn, author of such a dreadful defeat that Labour\u2019s parliamentary representation is crushed down to its lowest level since 1935. Mr Starmer can harvest some early credits by restoring professionalism to Labour as an opposition. Labour MPs expect, and Tories agree, that he will do a much better job of holding the government to account. As the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, he comes to the task of leadership with senior experience of running a complex organisation. It can be an advantage that he came into the Commons just five years ago. Having become an MP later in life than most, he is not encumbered by an accumulation of historical obligations and debts to colleagues. \u201cKeir is a loner really, not at all clubbable. He is one of the least cronyistic people I know,\u201d comments a fellow Labour lawyer. That ought to leave him free to make frontbench appointments based on merit. The shadow cabinet will be recast to remove Corbyn-loyalist duds and make better use of the talent pool on the Labour benches that has been under used in recent years. He will have a fight, which he must win, to remove the Corbyn acolytes at party headquarters. A leader is never properly in charge of a party unless he can count on the loyalty of the general secretary and other key officials. An early test of his mettle will be how he tackles antisemitism. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is due to report on whether Labour became an institutionally racist party during its calamitous experiment with Corbynism. A damning report will suit Mr Starmer if he uses it to make good on the promise in his victory statement to \u201ctear out this poison by its roots\u201d. He has indicated that he would support the automatic expulsion of any member found guilty of antisemitism, a position that will meet resistance among those on the left who will condemn it as a purge. Taking a robust, no-tolerance approach to antisemitism would allow the new leader to demonstrate to the public that Labour is now under a very different kind of management. Ah, yes, the electorate. Remember them, Labour? The party has been talking to itself rather than the country during the many months of a leadership contest so interminable that Britain was still a member of the EU when nominations opened. Yet voters will ultimately be the arbiters of whether Mr Starmer can put his party on the road to recovery or merely adds his name to the lengthening roster of failed Labour leaders. He won the leadership in part on the grounds of \u201celectability\u201d, which is a way of saying that he meets conventional expectations of what a potential prime minister ought to look and sound like. \u201cKeir passes the \u2018shut your eyes\u2019 test,\u201d says one supporter. \u201cYou can shut your eyes and imagine him standing outside Number 10.\u201d That is a necessary quality in someone who aspires to be prime minister, but it is not an entirely sufficient one. Successful political leaders also require a capacity to grab the attention and capture the imagination of voters. Tony Blair and David Cameron are the last two leaders to take their respective parties from opposition into power. Both had a talent for persuading the public that they had changed their parties for the better. Both combined that skill with an ability to convince the country that they had a plausible plan for national renewal. In this critical respect, Mr Starmer has yet to prove himself. The words most often used when admirers describe him are decent, pleasant, diligent, forensic, moral, sensible, clever, collaborative and credible. You never hear him called exciting, captivating, entertaining, rousing, surprising or inspirational. He has yet to mint a cut-through zinger such as \u201ctough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\u201d. There\u2019s no memorable phrase associated with his name. Some of his allies think an unflamboyant style will commend him to voters as they grow tired of what a Starmer-supporting Labour MP calls \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s histrionic blustering\u201d. Other Labour parliamentarians, and this includes some who are broadly hopeful about his leadership, reckon this is complacent. One former member of the shadow cabinet recently remarked to me: \u201cI worry that Keir and his team are underestimating just how difficult it can be to get yourself a hearing as the opposition.\u201d That challenge will be even tougher for as long as the coronavirus crisis is so all-consuming that it eats the rest of the news. A first test of his leadership will be how he calibrates scrutiny of ministerial handling of the pandemic.

The service will be available to healthcare professionals and other workers such as cooks and cleaners who directly engage with patients.</p> <h2>People warned against travelling over Easter holidays</h2> <p>Authorities in several states have warned people against travelling over the coming Easter holiday period, urging them to adhere to social distancing rules.

About saving lives. About stopping the spread of Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is inexcusable what happened at Rochedale last night and such blatant disregard for the lives of Queenslanders will not be tolerated.\u201d</p> <p>A man was also charged in Tasmania for allegedly disobeying isolation requirements after returning to the state from Victoria, police said. The man had been staying at a government facility for his period of isolation but had breached conditions, police say.</p> <h2><strong>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

The state government will provide $20m to buy hotel rooms, enabling up to 8,000 frontline workers who may test positive for Covid-19 or have unexpected and unprotected contact with a suspected patient, to self-isolate, away from family and flatmates, at no cost. The service will be available to healthcare professionals and other workers such as cooks and cleaners who directly engage with patients. People warned against travelling over Easter holidays Authorities in several states have warned people against travelling over the coming Easter holiday period, urging them to adhere to social distancing rules. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, was asked if police will be doing random checks on IDs to see that people have not gone on holidays and responded, \u201cwe will be stopping people and if you don\u2019t have a good reason to be where you are, you could face a $1,000 fine.\u201d Tasmania will toughen restrictions to stop people heading to their holiday homes or taking boating trips over the Easter break, the state\u2019s premier said on Sunday. Peter Gutwein said many elderly people lived in these areas, and they needed to be protected, as the state\u2019s confirmed cases rose to 82. Police issue scores of fines at Queensland car rally Police issued 58 infringement notices at a car rally in the Brisbane suburb of Rochedale last night where people were flouting social distancing directives. Deputy Queensland police commissioner Steve Gollschewski, who is also the state disaster coordinator, has professed himself disappointed and frustrated and said the behaviour of people at the rally was \u201cinexcusable\u201d. \u201cThis is all about safety. About saving lives. About stopping the spread of Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is inexcusable what happened at Rochedale last night and such blatant disregard for the lives of Queenslanders will not be tolerated.\u201d A man was also charged in Tasmania for allegedly disobeying isolation requirements after returning to the state from Victoria, police said. The man had been staying at a government facility for his period of isolation but had breached conditions, police say.

Its involving drama invites readers to look back again at any treasured youthful memories they may harbour of a past relationship with an older lover and ask: was it really all so pure and so romantic?</p> <p>But her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/13/kate-elizabeth-russell-my-dark-vanessa-interview\">provocative book has also caused a stir</a>, first in America and now in Britain, for a different reason. Like Jeanine Cummins, author of this year\u2019s <em>American Dirt</em>, Russell has been repeatedly asked to defend her right to tell a story that is not her own.</p> <p>Dropped abruptly from a line-up on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s influential television show, the author spoke last week of being ambushed not by questions about whether her feminist work was actually a \u201cthinly veiled\u201d personal account, but instead querying the strength of her connection to its disturbing content about an exploited teenager\u2019s affair with an older teacher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b03d41a3feaf22ff1ae57cf44d8627906ba97faf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b03d41a3feaf22ff1ae57cf44d8627906ba97faf/0_0_400_644/311..jpg\" alt=\"My Dark Vanessa is about a teenager\u2019s affair with an older teacher.\" width=\"311\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">My Dark Vanessa is about a teenager\u2019s affair with an older teacher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is interesting because I expected questions about this novel to come from a place of assuming it was autobiographical\u2026 and those questions are still coming, but they are also coming from the other angle of \u2018are you the one to tell this story?\u2019\u201d Russell told BBC radio\u2019s <em>Woman\u2019s Hour</em> last week.</p> <p>In a literary climate in which some readers now explicitly value creative authenticity in a writer above imaginative impulse, publishers are having to carry out stringent new levels of due diligence on all submitted fiction. If a narrative follows a character who is battling social injustice, or if it has an ethnically disadvantaged protagonist, like <em>American Dirt</em>\u2019s Mexican immigrant mother, and the author does not share that experience, a cultural row looms on the horizon.</p> <p>Cummins has had to answer accusations of cultural appropriation for some months. Dubbed as \u201cstereotypical\u201d in her attitudes, to say nothing of \u201cselfish and parasitic\u201d, she fell back on pointing out that she is at least of Puerto Rican heritage.</p> <p>Since then, the Irish writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/colum-mccann\">Colum McCann</a> has been called upon to explain his latest work,<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/12/apeirogon-by-colum-mccann-review\"> Apierogon</a></em>, an acclaimed fictional account of a real-life friendship between two bereaved fathers, one Palestinian and one Israeli. In his responses, McCann has argued that it was his serious, researched approach to the factual subject, coupled with his own memories of sectarian conflict in Ireland, that gave him the confidence to tackle the Middle East.</p> <p>Meanwhile, last Thursday, author Anne Tyler, that revered voice of comfortable, parochial America, made her position on cultural appropriation clear when she spoke from her Baltimore home to the BBC\u2019s Rebecca Jones about her new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/30/anne-tyler-redhead-by-the-side-of-the-road-review\">Redhead by the Side of the Road</a></em>. \u201cI would be very presumptuous to write from the viewpoint of, let\u2019s say, an inner-city African-American, because there\u2019s so much I would get wrong. I would be entitled to do it if I wanted, but I think I would be laughed out of the literary world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c71d30120ba17e46bf94b7ecc0d09e618ec22fec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c71d30120ba17e46bf94b7ecc0d09e618ec22fec/0_676_4560_2735/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Author Colum McCann\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colum McCann has come under scrutiny for his novel Apierogon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Philippe Baltel/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Many publishers, including Virago co-founder Carmen Callil, rail against the limitations being imposed on writers. The new orthodoxy based on the identity of the creative voice can only stand in the way of good literature, she says: \u201cIf Shakespeare can imagine he was Caliban, then any human being who has suffered can write about other people\u2019s suffering and make it about all of us. That is the point.\u201d</p> <p>For other authors, including Sara Collins, a British novelist of Jamaican descent, the problem cuts both ways. If only black writers are allowed to write books examining black experience, she argues, the unintended and unwelcome consequence is an added onus on those few established black writers to stick to that subject.</p> <p>Collins\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/04/the-confessions-of-frannie-langton-by-sara-collins-review\">The Confessions of Frannie Langton</a> won the 2019 Costa first book award and has been shortlisted for a British Book Award. It centres on the life of a black servant working in London in the 19th century, but deliberately avoids focusing on exploitation or pain. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s <em>Front Row</em> that the only whipping she wanted in her story was that carried out in the fetish parlours frequented by the English aristocracy.</p> <p>\u201cIt seemed to me, as a young reader, that there was a kind of de facto segregation in the publishing industry,\u201d Collins said, with a handful of black writers allowed to write, but chiefly about the \u201cblack experience\u201d. Every white writer was \u201cdeemed instead to be writing about the human experience. I wonder whether it will ever be possible to write without feeling constrained by these fixed categories.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I would be very presumptuous to write from the viewpoint of an African American - there\u2019s so much I would get wrong</p> <footer> <cite>Anne Tyler</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Novelist Lydia Syson is equally suspicious of the fuss around authorial authenticity. She approached her well-received 2018 novel, <em>Mr Peacock\u2019s Possessions</em>, with special care because it opens in the first-person voice of a young, male Pacific islander. \u201cI resisted self-censorship and braced myself for backlash,\u201d she said this weekend. \u201cI could easily have been accused of \u2018dipping my pen in someone else\u2019s blood\u2019, as fellow novelist Kit de Waal has eloquently framed this kind of cultural appropriation.\u201d</p> <p>Syson\u2019s fears proved unfounded, but she believes that as long as the pool of English language writers of literary fiction is dominated by a privileged, white band, then some caution among writers is fair enough. \u201cI had prepared myself for a battle and was ready to defend myself. In the end I was disappointed: not because I wanted a fight, but because most reviewers simply ignored that side of the story. It was still perceived as a book about a white girl and her father.\u201d</p> <p>The real issue, Syson contends, is not about a particular book, but about the wider industry. \u201cIf these rows make visible the really huge inequalities that divide the world, it is well worth airing them. But there\u2019s a danger such spats end up hiding bigger injustices, muting more writers than they enable and taking up literary coverage that could be used to draw attention to all the brilliant, overlooked writing that has not come from the usual suspects.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Billed as the big page-turner of the season, My Dark Vanessa, American author Kate Elizabeth Russell\u2019s first novel, is a tale for the Time\u2019s Up generation. Its involving drama invites readers to look back again at any treasured youthful memories they may harbour of a past relationship with an older lover and ask: was it really all so pure and so romantic? But her provocative book has also caused a stir, first in America and now in Britain, for a different reason. Like Jeanine Cummins, author of this year\u2019s American Dirt, Russell has been repeatedly asked to defend her right to tell a story that is not her own. Dropped abruptly from a line-up on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s influential television show, the author spoke last week of being ambushed not by questions about whether her feminist work was actually a \u201cthinly veiled\u201d personal account, but instead querying the strength of her connection to its disturbing content about an exploited teenager\u2019s affair with an older teacher. \u201cIt is interesting because I expected questions about this novel to come from a place of assuming it was autobiographical\u2026 and those questions are still coming, but they are also coming from the other angle of \u2018are you the one to tell this story?\u2019\u201d Russell told BBC radio\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour last week. In a literary climate in which some readers now explicitly value creative authenticity in a writer above imaginative impulse, publishers are having to carry out stringent new levels of due diligence on all submitted fiction. If a narrative follows a character who is battling social injustice, or if it has an ethnically disadvantaged protagonist, like American Dirt\u2019s Mexican immigrant mother, and the author does not share that experience, a cultural row looms on the horizon. Cummins has had to answer accusations of cultural appropriation for some months. Dubbed as \u201cstereotypical\u201d in her attitudes, to say nothing of \u201cselfish and parasitic\u201d, she fell back on pointing out that she is at least of Puerto Rican heritage. Since then, the Irish writer Colum McCann has been called upon to explain his latest work, Apierogon, an acclaimed fictional account of a real-life friendship between two bereaved fathers, one Palestinian and one Israeli. In his responses, McCann has argued that it was his serious, researched approach to the factual subject, coupled with his own memories of sectarian conflict in Ireland, that gave him the confidence to tackle the Middle East. Meanwhile, last Thursday, author Anne Tyler, that revered voice of comfortable, parochial America, made her position on cultural appropriation clear when she spoke from her Baltimore home to the BBC\u2019s Rebecca Jones about her new book, Redhead by the Side of the Road. \u201cI would be very presumptuous to write from the viewpoint of, let\u2019s say, an inner-city African-American, because there\u2019s so much I would get wrong. I would be entitled to do it if I wanted, but I think I would be laughed out of the literary world.\u201d Many publishers, including Virago co-founder Carmen Callil, rail against the limitations being imposed on writers. The new orthodoxy based on the identity of the creative voice can only stand in the way of good literature, she says: \u201cIf Shakespeare can imagine he was Caliban, then any human being who has suffered can write about other people\u2019s suffering and make it about all of us. That is the point.\u201d For other authors, including Sara Collins, a British novelist of Jamaican descent, the problem cuts both ways. If only black writers are allowed to write books examining black experience, she argues, the unintended and unwelcome consequence is an added onus on those few established black writers to stick to that subject. Collins\u2019s book The Confessions of Frannie Langton won the 2019 Costa first book award and has been shortlisted for a British Book Award. It centres on the life of a black servant working in London in the 19th century, but deliberately avoids focusing on exploitation or pain. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Front Row that the only whipping she wanted in her story was that carried out in the fetish parlours frequented by the English aristocracy. \u201cIt seemed to me, as a young reader, that there was a kind of de facto segregation in the publishing industry,\u201d Collins said, with a handful of black writers allowed to write, but chiefly about the \u201cblack experience\u201d. Every white writer was \u201cdeemed instead to be writing about the human experience. I wonder whether it will ever be possible to write without feeling constrained by these fixed categories.\u201d Novelist Lydia Syson is equally suspicious of the fuss around authorial authenticity. She approached her well-received 2018 novel, Mr Peacock\u2019s Possessions, with special care because it opens in the first-person voice of a young, male Pacific islander. \u201cI resisted self-censorship and braced myself for backlash,\u201d she said this weekend. \u201cI could easily have been accused of \u2018dipping my pen in someone else\u2019s blood\u2019, as fellow novelist Kit de Waal has eloquently framed this kind of cultural appropriation.\u201d Syson\u2019s fears proved unfounded, but she believes that as long as the pool of English language writers of literary fiction is dominated by a privileged, white band, then some caution among writers is fair enough. \u201cI had prepared myself for a battle and was ready to defend myself. In the end I was disappointed: not because I wanted a fight, but because most reviewers simply ignored that side of the story. It was still perceived as a book about a white girl and her father.\u201d The real issue, Syson contends, is not about a particular book, but about the wider industry. \u201cIf these rows make visible the really huge inequalities that divide the world, it is well worth airing them. But there\u2019s a danger such spats end up hiding bigger injustices, muting more writers than they enable and taking up literary coverage that could be used to draw attention to all the brilliant, overlooked writing that has not come from the usual suspects.\u201d",

The message came as police, health officials and local authorities issued pleas to the public to stay at home this weekend and not be tempted by good weather to go outside. Among them was the CEO of NHS Providers, Chris Hopson, who said today: \u201cYou can\u2019t clap for carers one day and flout the stay at home rules three days later\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The number of deaths in UK hospitals saw a record daily rise, increasing by 708 from 3,605 to 4,313 \u2013 a rise of 20%. </strong>Among the dead was a five-year-old child, thought to be the UK\u2019s youngest victim so far, who had underlying health conditions.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/04/up-to-4000-inmates-to-be-temporarily-released-in-england-and-wales\">Up to 4,000 low-risk offenders are to be temporarily released</a></strong> as part of measures to try to contain the spread of Covid-19 in prisons in England and Wales.

The deceased had not been diagnosed with Covid-19 though two members of staff had tested positive and are being treated in hospitals.</li> \n   <li><strong>Carrie Symonds</strong>, the prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson\u2019</strong>s fianc\u00e9e, who is pregnant, said she had spent the last week in bed with coronavirus symptoms. Symonds shared that she was \u201con the mend\u201d and had not been tested for Covid-19. The prime minister continues to self-isolate.</li> \n   <li>The national medical director for England, <strong>Stephen Powis</strong>, condemned the actions of people acting on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/uk-phone-masts-attacked-amid-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the pandemic</a>.

This compares with just 19% of children in households with income of more than \u00a370,000 a year.</p> \n  <p>The findings come after the tutoring industry reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/27/school-closures-prompt-boom-in-private-tuition-online-isolation\">a boom in demand due to the Covid-19 outbreak</a>, and a number of agencies said they were offering lower cost or <a href=\"https://coronavirustutoring.co.uk/\">free tutoring</a> to less-affluent schoolchildren. </p> \n  <p>Milburn, a former Labour cabinet minister, said the findings showed lower-income families were less able to offset the detrimental impact of the pandemic on their children\u2019s education. He said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Access to a private tutor, even at a reduced rate, is well beyond the means of most families and will be impossible for families who do not have internet access and who live in crowded accommodation. </p> \n   <p>Tutors offer parents a break and children the opportunity to learn from an experienced adult, their appeal is clear. But not all children will have access to this resource, indeed, they are a pipe dream for families living on low income. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Milburn called on universities to recognise that the school shutdown could magnify the huge educational disparity between children from richer and poorer backgrounds, and to take that into account when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/03/gcse-a-level-grades-coronavirus-crisis-teacher-assessment-ofqual\">deciding who would get a university place</a>.<br></p> \n  <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research has said the shift to school lessons being delivered online during the pandemic made it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/children-must-not-become-unseen-victims-of-coronavirus-says-thinktank\">difficult for those children without suitable technology to keep up with their studies</a>.

      "bodyText": "The Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said there was \u201cno fixed point\u201d at which the government could say the lockdown will end \u2013 it will depend on compliance from the public. The message came as police, health officials and local authorities issued pleas to the public to stay at home this weekend and not be tempted by good weather to go outside. Among them was the CEO of NHS Providers, Chris Hopson, who said today: \u201cYou can\u2019t clap for carers one day and flout the stay at home rules three days later\u201d. The number of deaths in UK hospitals saw a record daily rise, increasing by 708 from 3,605 to 4,313 \u2013 a rise of 20%. Among the dead was a five-year-old child, thought to be the UK\u2019s youngest victim so far, who had underlying health conditions. Up to 4,000 low-risk offenders are to be temporarily released as part of measures to try to contain the spread of Covid-19 in prisons in England and Wales. So far, 88 prisoners and 15 staff have already tested positive for Covid-19. Three prisoners have died. Thirteen people died in the space of a week after a suspected Covid-19 outbreak at a care home in Glasgow. The deceased had not been diagnosed with Covid-19 though two members of staff had tested positive and are being treated in hospitals. Carrie Symonds, the prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, who is pregnant, said she had spent the last week in bed with coronavirus symptoms. Symonds shared that she was \u201con the mend\u201d and had not been tested for Covid-19. The prime minister continues to self-isolate. The national medical director for England, Stephen Powis, condemned the actions of people acting on a conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the pandemic. He said \u201cit is absolute and utter rubbish and I can\u2019t condemn it in stronger terms than that\u201d. Watford general hospital closed its A&amp;E department to all new patients and visitors, even in an emergency, until further notice. The hospital is known to be under significant strain from the coronavirus pandemic. Boris Johnson has written to all opposition party leaders to invite them to a briefing next week and insisting \u201cwe have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency\u201d. That brings us to the end of another day of coverage here on the UK side. If you would like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, head over to our global live blog. Carrie Symonds, the prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, who is pregnant, has said she has been self-isolating for the past week with coronavirus symptoms. She wrote on Twitter: I\u2019ve spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of coronavirus. I haven\u2019t needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I\u2019m on the mend. Symonds described being pregnant with symptoms as \u201cobviously worrying\u201d and encouraged other pregnant women to consult the latest guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Blood Cancer UK has written to the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, and to six major supermarkets, calling on them to take urgent action to make sure people with blood cancer can get food deliveries. The charity said it has been contacted by people with blood cancer, of whom there are some 115,000 in the UK, who are struggling to access food, after being told not to leave their home for a minimum of 12 weeks as they are classed as \u201cvery high risk\u201d. Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, said: We are now at the point where some people are being forced to choose between going hungry and making a trip to the supermarket that could be fatal if they pick up the coronavirus there. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve written to the supermarkets and the government today. We need them to work together to fix this now. The blood cancer community is going through the most difficult time it has ever faced \u2013 we urgently need their help. One woman was told by a supermarket that she could not be prioritised because it was her daughter, not her, who had blood cancer. Another man said he had tried unsuccessfully for many hours to get a supermarket delivery slot. Helen Payne, a former NHS physio from Wokingham, has leukaemia and has been struggling to order food. She said: I am on chemotherapy and have had my NHS letter but it\u2019s absolutely impossible to get any food. I am seriously thinking of going shopping myself. God knows what I have left for tonight. Gove said there were now more than 8,000 ventilators in the NHS and the aim was to produce and secure more. Powis called the 5G story \u201crubbish\u201d and \u201cthe worst kind of fake news\u201d. He said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d and \u201coutraged\u201d at reports of people taking out 5G masts at this time of national crisis. He stressed that phone networks were crucial for people staying in touch with loved ones at this difficult time, but also vital for the emergency services. It is absolute and utter rubbish and I can\u2019t condemn it stronger terms than that. Gove said he would talk to the health secretary about reports of NHS staff being turned away from testing sites and report on progress on Monday. Powis said it was likely the virus would become established in countries across the world, so a long-term strategy as opposed to an \u201cexit strategy\u201d was needed. Gove said there was \u201cno fixed point\u201d at which we could say the lockdown will end \u2013 it depended on compliance from the public. The prime minister will review the measures next week. Powis said it was clear deaths happen in the community. The figures reported by the NHS were those in hospitals, the ONS figures reflected those in the community. He expects deaths will be higher but it will only be in the days and weeks ahead and as that data comes through the ONS it will become clear how much higher. Powis said a reduction in transmission would, over a number of days and weeks, be reflected in a reduction in infections, hospitalisations and then in deaths. He said there was reason to be hopeful that physical distancing was having an effect, but it would take time for it to have a maximum effect. If we take our foot off the pedal, those charts will start to go in the wrong direction again. Stay at home and then we will see the benefits of those actions. Powis said we were learning about the virus all the time and more would become clear over the next few months. It is too early to outline what the exit strategy will be \u2013 the priority and critical objective now is to reduce transmission in order to get on top of it. Only then can we discuss what the next steps are. They are taking questions from the press now. Gove said everyone should ask themselves: What am I doing to relieve pressure on the NHS? He acknowledged that lockdown is challenging but people must, at every stage, respect the guidelines as it is the only way to restrict the spread of the disease. If people deliberately flout the guidelines, police have the powers to enforce the rules. If we weight up an hour or two outside and weight it against the lives of those we love and the lives of those on the NHS frontline, then it should be clear, I hope to all, that we should follow the advice. Powis said the NHS workers on the frontline would \u201cabsolutely plead\u201d with the public to follow the measures \u2013 \u201ctheir safety, their lives, depend on that\u201d. We absolutely know that this can work. This is everybody\u2019s chance to save a life. Stephen Powis is speaking now. He reiterates that the key to slowing the spread is reducing contact with others. Transport use remains \u201cextremely low\u201d. The sun might be out, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be out. The number of new cases has stabilised in the last few days. We mustn\u2019t read too much into a day\u2019s or a few days\u2019 data. It will be a week or two before the measures in place translate into lower hospitalisation rates. In London there has been a plateau, but this is not the time to be complacent, he says. The number of deaths continues to be high, unfortunately that is likely to continue for the next week or two until we get on top of the virus and see a reduction in the number of deaths, he says. Gove says the government welcomes robust scrutiny \u2013 \u201cit is the duty of the media\u201d \u2013 and aims to communicate more clearly and effectively in guiding the public through the pandemic. Gove said invasive ventilators had been purchased from partners abroad including Germany and Switzerland. Today 300 new ventilators arrived from China. He thanked the Chinese government for their support. New sources of supply here in the UK would come on-stream soon, he said. The first models that have been scaled up will be coming off production lines this weekend, more are to come into operation in the coming weeks, subject to safety and regulatory approvals. He added the first of the ventilators the government has ordered from Penlon would begin arriving in hospitals this week for final clinical checks. The first devices from Smiths Group have also been received at MoD Donnington, which have been approved by the regulator. Gove said new non-invasive ventilator capacity had been secured with the help of UK manufacturers. A team from UCL working with Mercedes-Benz have produced a new device which has been clinically approved. 200 were produced yesterday, the same will be produced today and tomorrow, rising to 1,000 a day next week, he said. Gove said 10,984 tests of NHS staff were administered yesterday. Michael Gove is speaking now. 183,190 people have been tested, 41,903 of whom have tested positive. 15,073 people in England have been admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms. The pattern of hospital admissions has regional differences. In London, admissions fell slightly between 1-2 April. Admissions are steady in Wales. They have gone up 35% in Yorkshire and the north-east. In the Midlands, they have gone up by 47%. 708 have died, the highest daily total recorded, bringing the total to 4,313. These numbers emphasise the importance of maintaining physical distancing measures to contain the spread. This afternoon\u2019s news conference, due to begin shortly, will be fronted by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister. He will be joined by NHS England\u2019s national medical director Stephen Powis. There have been a further 13 deaths in Wales bringing the total number of to people to have died after tested positive for Covid-19 to 154, health officials have said. Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Covid-19 response at Public Health Wales, said the number of confirmed cases had risen by 387 to a total of 2,853 as of 2pm on Saturday. A group of volunteers have set up a public database to help people find farmers so people can source fresh vegetables and fruit, as well as other goods during the coronavirus outbreak. The database \u2013 which includes links to local farms and where they operate \u2013 includes a page explaining the mission. It says: In light of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK, we decided to create a database of smaller scale farmers, growers, dairies, wineries, bakeries and independent shops that will now sell directly to consumers. Many of them sold exclusively to wholesalers or restaurants in the past. It added that for those who want to add a farmer, fisher or food producer to the database, they can submit a request via the online form. We chose to share this database as an online spreadsheet in the first instance, as it\u2019s a quick and easy way for many people to access it. Link to the database here. Tesco has just given an update on its efforts to boost the capacity of its online delivery service in order to help its most vulnerable customers. The Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, said: On Thursday we were given an initial list of 110,000 clinically and socially isolated people. From these, we were able to match 75,000 existing customers and we\u2019ve already contacted them to let them know we\u2019re making home delivery slots immediately available to them. As we receive more data from government, we\u2019ll make even more slots available. We have increased our online delivery slots by 145,000 in the last two weeks with hundreds of thousands more due to become available shortly; but we know it\u2019s still difficult to get an online delivery slot at the moment due to high demand, and we ask those who are able to safely come to stores to do so, instead of shopping online, so we can start to free up more slots for the more vulnerable. Britons who were trapped on board two cruise liners embroiled in a bitter coronavirus dispute are flying back to the UK, the PA news agency reports. Holland America Line guests disembarked the Zaandam and its sister ship the Rotterdam in Florida, US, on Friday following a battle between federal and state authorities. Many of the 200 UK nationals caught up in the saga boarded a charter flight which departed Fort Lauderdale airport shortly after 3am on Saturday (local time). The flight is due to land at London Heathrow at 4.11pm (BST), the British Consulate General in Miami said. Messages posted on a Facebook group created for passengers to share updates state that some people have not been allowed to fly home yet. Holland America Line had previously said guests with coronavirus symptoms \u201cwill remain on board and disembark at a later date\u201d. More than a dozen Covid-19 cases were reported on the Zaandam, plus some 190 people with flu symptoms. Four people have died aboard the liner, including two officially diagnosed with the virus. Earlier this week, the ship offloaded its healthy passengers onto the Rotterdam. Florida officials were reluctant to allow the ships to dock - for fear that taking more Covid-19 patients would further burden the state\u2019s already-stretched hospitals - until US president Donald Trump intervened to approve the docking on humanitarian grounds. The four included 75-year-old Briton John Carter, who died on 22 March. The cause of death has yet to be officially revealed, but he was reported to have been on a ventilator in his last days. On Friday, passengers from both ships were finally allowed to touch dry land in Fort Lauderdale. Fourteen critically-ill patients were wheeled off the Zaandam on stretchers to be taken to local hospitals before their fellow passengers disembarked. Asymptomatic patients, after being screened and cleared by paramedics, were taken by bus directly to the local airport, escorted by police officers on motorcycles. Before disembarking from the ships, passengers received instructions to wear face masks at all times when travelling and to go immediately into 14 days of self-quarantine when they arrived home. Five London bus workers who tested positive for Covid-19 have now died, the Unite union said. the Unite regional secretary, Peter Kavanagh, said: Each of these deaths is a terrible tragedy and the thoughts of everyone at Unite go to the families of the bus workers who have died of coronavirus. Unite will assist the families of our members in every possible way during this terrible time. Unite has been working continuously with Transport for London (TfL) and the operators to ensure the safety of drivers and others in the industry who are performing a heroic job in getting NHS and care workers to their places of work. Measures include deep cleaning of buses, additional cleaning of touch points, the sealing of screens around the driver, the provision of hand sanitiser for all and placing the passenger seating closest to the driver out of bounds. The union is also calling on the government to make provisions for transport workers in terms of PPE. Borough market, London\u2019s famous produce market and foodie haven, is spearheading a national campaign to provide free fruit and vegetables to frontline workers battling coronavirus. The Feed the Frontline campaign is being funded for the rest of April by private businesses and aims to run throughout the peak of the crisis. The initiative aims to provide regular deliveries of fruit and vegetables to frontline workers at three NHS hospitals in London; St Thomas\u2019, Kings College hospital and the Maudsley. An estimated 4,000 bags of seasonal fruit and vegetables are being packed and delivered by the Borough market trader Turnips each week. Once at the hospitals, the bags will be distributed to frontline staff by NHS volunteers. The food is accompanied by recipe cards from Borough market chefs to inspire easy, healthy, home cooking. The market is now calling for more companies to help fund the expansion across the UK, with the help of food markets and fruit and vegetable wholesalers. Bradford St James\u2019s wholesale market is already following suit by delivering 1,000 fruit and vegetable bags to Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust each week, with more hospitals in Leeds and Bradford set to follow. Darren Henaghan, managing director of Borough market, said: With the UK in lockdown, we owe an enormous debt to the fantastic people of the NHS and other frontline workers battling Covid-19. They are working around the clock to save lives, care for the sick and control the spread of coronavirus. With London at the heart of the UK epidemic we want to play our part in the national effort against Covid-19 by caring for the carers \u2013 giving them fresh, high quality food to help them stay healthy and feed themselves and their families. A further 637 people in England who tested positive for the Covid-19 have died, including England\u2019s youngest victim \u2013 a five-year-old child \u2013 bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 3,939, NHS England said. Patients were aged between five and 104 years old. Forty of the 637 patients had no known underlying health condition; they were aged between 48 and 93 years old. NHS England said 212 of the deaths were in the Midlands, 127 in London, 97 in the north-west, 73 in the north-east and Yorkshire, 70 in the east of England, 41 in the south-east and 17 in the south-west. The number of people who have died in Northern Ireland after contracting coronavirus has risen by eight to 56, health officials said. Testing has resulted in 94 new positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases there to 998. Watford general hospital has closed its A&amp;E to new patients and visitors \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, West Hertfordshire hospitals NHS trust announced. People have been instructed to go to their \u201cnext nearest hospital with an emergency department\u201d or to seek advice via 111 in a non-urgent situation. Though no reason has yet been provided, the hospital is known to be under significant strain from the pandemic. The Watford Observer reports that several wards are dedicated to Covid-19 patients and, as of Friday, 29 patients at West Herts trust hospitals have died after testing positive. In a post on Twitter, the trust wrote: Please DO NOT attend Watford General\u2019s emergency department until further notice, even in an emergency. Go to your next nearest hospital with an emergency department. Anyone with non-urgent issues should seek advice via https://111.nhs.uk The Watford Observer has more on this story. The number of people who have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus is 218, up by 46 from 172 on Friday, the Scottish government confirmed. A total of 3,345 people across Scotland have now tested positive for the virus, up from 3,001 on the previous day, according to the latest figures. In total, 20,798 patients have been tested across the country. With anger growing toward \u201cselfish\u201d people who continue to flout physical distancing rules during the crisis, NHS Providers, the main organisation representing hospitals in England, has joined calls for people to \u201cstay at home this weekend\u201d. Chief executive Chris Hopson\u2019s words are worth quoting in full: This weekend\u2019s warmer weather, though normally welcome, poses a significant threat. It is absolutely vital that people heed the government\u2019s instructions and stay home. We\u2019ve been struck by how many times trust leaders have told us over the last 24 hours that they and frontline NHS staff are getting increasingly angry with the \u2018selfish\u2019 people who are not obeying the rules about staying at home. They can\u2019t see why any member of the public would want to make the job of frontline staff more difficult and risk other people\u2019s lives. NHS staff are absolutely bowled over by the huge amount of public appreciation and affection they are receiving, but their number one message to every single member of the public is to stay at home. The more people stick to the clear rules, the fewer infections, the fewer deaths, the easier their job. They have a very simple message: you can\u2019t clap for carers one day and then flout the stay at home rules three days later. The UK\u2019s coronavirus death toll has risen to 4,313 in the deadliest day since the outbreak began. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that 708 people have died in UK hospitals since 5pm on Thursday, when the total was 3,605. John Lewis has become the latest shop to reward its staff working through the coronavirus pandemic. All frontline workers at the department store and Waitrose supermarkets will get an extra \u00a325 for each week they work in April and May. The discount at Waitrose for all employees across both shops has also been increased from 15% to 25% and will remain at 20% after Covid-19 has peaked, the company said. These new rewards follow a 2% bonus that was handed to all staff last month. John Lewis has closed its high-street shops, but is still operating online. Sharon White, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said staff had made \u201csignificant sacrifices to ensure that we are able to continue to serve and support our customers\u201d. She said: The measures that we have announced today are in recognition of their hard work and commitment and are part of a wider package of support available to help partners during this extraordinary time. Staff at Morrisons have also been told to expect a \u00a31,000 bonus, as their earnings will be topped up by 6% over the next 12 months. This means an extra \u00a31,050 for full time employees, including those who have been sick or are self-isolating, and new hires who have been taken on to deal with the extraordinary demand. Ocado has said that staff would be given a 10% bonus on all hours they work from 23 March \u201cwhile the crisis continues\u201d. Aldi, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco have all echoed the 10% pledge and Asda has promised an extra week\u2019s pay in June. A spate of mobile phone mast fires around the UK are being investigated as possible arson, amid concerns that people are attacking telecoms infrastructure because of a conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the spread of coronavirus. The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, also revealed he had received threats relating to the \u201cbizarre\u201d theory, which has gained traction on social media. My colleagues Nazia Parven and Jim Waterson have the full story: The death rate of those admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 has topped 50%, according to the latest figures. The figures come from data compiled by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) based on a sample of 2,249 coronavirus patients. The data showed that 50.1% (346) of the 690 patients in the sample whose care outcomes were known, had died. The other 344 had been discharged. The remaining patients, 1,559, were reported still to be in critical care. By way of comparison, just 22.4% of patients admitted to intensive care with non-Covid-19 viral pneumonia between 2017 and 2019 died of the disease. The Covid-19 figures come from 286 NHS intensive care and combined intensive care and high-dependency units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as of midday on Friday. Some specialist and non-NHS critical care units also submitted data. A reader who works at a care home has been in touch to ask people to spare a thought for those working in the care sector, whose work is equally essential to that of the NHS in keeping vulnerable people safe and has so far been neglected in terms of PPE. The nursing home employee, who wished to remain anonymous, described working in close contact with numerous vulnerable residents \u201cwith no masks, nothing more than our usual gloves and plastic aprons\u201d and how the home was struggling to minimise the risk of infection. She told the Guardian: It is stressful knowing that we are a potential risk to our residents, and they to us. We are letting them down by not having the masks we need to protect them, and we are being let down too. I take pride in doing a valuable job that most people wouldn\u2019t want to do. I accept the insulting minimum wage but I don\u2019t accept that I should have to risk my health, and even my life, to do this job. We should have masks for all close contact care. We deserve that protection. The lack of adequate PPE for all health care workers \u2013 NHS or otherwise \u2013 is a shameful scandal. Her words come as Sky News reports that 13 residents at a care home in Glasgow have died in the space of a week after a suspected coronavirus outbreak. Two members of staff are being treated in separate hospitals after testing positive for Covid-19. As tests are currently only carried out for people admitted to hospital, it is not known whether the residents who died, who all had underlying health condition, also had coronavirus. More on that story here. With Sunday set to be UK\u2019s warmest day in six months, police forces around the country have issued new warnings to people not to travel and to stay at home. Going on holiday is not an excuse to travel and second homeowners are being told to keep away, as police said they would issue fines and punishments if they see people making non-essential journeys this weekend. Gloucestershire police issued the warning on holidays, saying officers would be stopping people who looked like they may be heading away for a few days. The force said \u201cthere has been particular concern among some communities that people who own second homes in the area will be visiting over the Easter holiday\u201d and visitors would put extra pressure on the local NHS. Meanwhile, in Hampshire, officers and paramedics have told people to stick to physical distancing after three ambulances were called on a \u201cselfish and avoidable deployment\u201d to a man having a bad acid trip after a house party. Authorities in Wales have closed beachside car parks to deter people from \u201cusing the weather to treat what is a national crisis like a national holiday,\u201d as has Dorset council, which closed seafront parking bays and stopped the RNLI patrol in an attempt to prevent people from gathering at the seaside. Chief constable Shaun Sawyer, from Devon and Cornwall police, told BBC Breakfast officers would explain and encourage people to stick to the rules, but would enforce them with fines and punishments if people were not listening: When we come to enforcement, that really is a last resort because, in a way, if we come to enforcement, then everybody has failed to understand the significance of this endeavour. It\u2019s not just visitors, even within my 4,000 sq miles I\u2019ve got my own population that really just want to jump in the car and travel. They want to go to the moors, they want to go to the beaches. He described this weekend as \u201ca time to remember the importance of stay at home and save lives\u201d. There have been many joyous sights of animals taking advantage of quieter roads and exploring new spaces as people stay at home during the lockdown, but this could be my favourite. From BBC Breakfast this morning: Burnley FC have underlined the dire financial consequences of the coronavirus crisis on the Premier League by announcing they stand to lose around \u00a350m from the continued suspension of the season. The Premier League confirmed on Friday that the 2019-20 season \u201cwill only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so\u201d and will only be resumed with the full support of the government. Burnley\u2019s estimated losses of \u00a350m, it believes, are only half of what other Premier League clubs stand to lose this season. The full story is here. Addison Lee has launched a Donate a Ride campaign by which London\u2019s largest private hire vehicle operator will partner with its corporate clients to offer free rides to and from hospital for NHS workers at trusts within the M25. The British public matched Addison Lee\u2019s contribution of \u00a350,000 in just over 12 hours, with the fund breaking through the \u00a3100,000 mark as donations continued to rise. For members of the public who still want to contribute, Addison Lee has established a GoFundMe page. Over the coming days, Addison Lee will work with NHS trusts to distribute the donations and allow their workers to access the free rides. As more partners join the scheme, more free rides will be offered. The capital\u2019s key workers can also claim a 25% discount on rides. Two Best Western hotels in the south-west are believed to be the first in the country to be turned into discharge hospitals to help the NHS cope with the Covid-19 crisis, by accommodating low-risk patients and care workers. The hotels are the Grange hotel at Oborne, run by husband and wife team Jon and Jenny Fletcher and the Rembrandt hotel in Weymouth, run by the general manager Massimo Menin. The Grange will initially accommodate 12 patients and six carers and the Rembrandt 31 patients and 13 carers. Both have worked closely with Dorset countycCouncil and four local hospitals to start taking patients as early as Monday. The patients are recovering from conditions that have required hospitalisation and would ordinarily be able to go home to continue rehabilitation with the support of home visits. Under the hotel support scheme, patients and carers will live into together to reduce the risk of care workers travelling the country and becoming infected, and to give the patients the daily care they need. Rob Paterson, the chief executive of Best Western Great Britain, said: We are so proud of these two amazing hotels. These are unprecedented times and so as a hotel group we are taking unprecedented steps to support the NHS. We want to help free up urgent bed space in the NHS by taking low risk patients and carers and being part of the solution. These two hotels are proof we can do it, we have 230 other hotels prepared to reopen their doors and help the nation fight this terrible disease. A fifth coronavirus drive-in test centre has opened for NHS workers as the Department of Health and Social Care discloses plans to run 50 centres nationwide and the Swiss healthcare company Roche says it is on track to open 10 laboratories in the UK. NHS Wales confirmed on Saturday that the Dragons rugby stadium in Newport had been turned into a drive-in site but asked that non-NHS workers do not visit. The other sites, also for NHS workers exclusively, are at Boot\u2019s headquarters in Beeston in Nottinghamshire, the Ikea carpark in Wembley in London, North Greenwich in London and Chessington theme park in Greater London. Overnight, the DHSC disclosed it was planning to have 50 sites up and running in the coming weeks as part of the health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s plan for 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. It said: We are establishing these centres around the UK, starting in the main hotspots of the disease, such as London, the Midlands, growing to around 50 across the country. Most will be drive-throughs, set up in car parks, with trained staff taking nose and throat swabs. On the laboratory side, Roche, the company credited with enabling Germany to test 500,000 a week, has revealed it is \u201ccurrently on track to have more than 10 sites up and running before the end this month\u201d. It said in a statement its new diagnostics test is already being used in labs in London, Manchester and Gateshead, with a new lab opening in Wales on Monday followed by other facilities in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The first three opened last week after successful pilots were completed. The company said its polymerise chain reaction (PCR) test to detect current infection could determine \u201cif a person has Covid-19 in less than three and a half hours\u201d. The indefinite school closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic threaten to widen the attainment gap between rich and poor children, the former chair of the government\u2019s social mobility commission has warned. The increased use of private tuition by well-off middle class families during the pandemic lockdown will further disadvantage pupils from deprived backgrounds, said Alan Milburn, who now chairs the Social Mobility Foundation. A fifth of better-off households are either already using private tutors or are likely to do so during the school shutdown, compared with just 7% of low-income households, according to research for the charity, which organises mentoring and work experience for underprivileged 16- to 17-year-olds. A quarter (24%) of those considering private tuition said they were willing to spend more than \u00a3100 a week, according to the YouGov poll of 2,215 young people for the foundation\u2019s campaigning arm, the Department for Opportunities. The survey also found that 40% of children from households with income of less than \u00a320,000 a year lack a quiet room in which they can study during the lockdown. This compares with just 19% of children in households with income of more than \u00a370,000 a year. The findings come after the tutoring industry reported a boom in demand due to the Covid-19 outbreak, and a number of agencies said they were offering lower cost or free tutoring to less-affluent schoolchildren. Milburn, a former Labour cabinet minister, said the findings showed lower-income families were less able to offset the detrimental impact of the pandemic on their children\u2019s education. He said: Access to a private tutor, even at a reduced rate, is well beyond the means of most families and will be impossible for families who do not have internet access and who live in crowded accommodation. Tutors offer parents a break and children the opportunity to learn from an experienced adult, their appeal is clear. But not all children will have access to this resource, indeed, they are a pipe dream for families living on low income. Milburn called on universities to recognise that the school shutdown could magnify the huge educational disparity between children from richer and poorer backgrounds, and to take that into account when deciding who would get a university place. The Institute for Public Policy Research has said the shift to school lessons being delivered online during the pandemic made it difficult for those children without suitable technology to keep up with their studies. Around a million children do not have access to a device suitable for online lessons, or do not have an internet connection, according to the thinktank. Rosamund McNeil, assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, said the SMF poll showed \u201cjust how unequal families\u2019 home learning environments are\u201d: There is just not the same access to internet access, tutors, gardens, spare room, books, bikes and musical instruments \u2013 and the opportunities for wellbeing that they provide. Smokers face a greater risk from coronavirus and may also be jeopardising the welfare of their loved ones, Public Health England has warned. Prof John Newton, PHE\u2019s director of health, said that in light of the \u201cunprecedented\u201d pandemic sweeping the globe: There has never been a more important time to stop smoking, not only for your own health but to protect those around you. PHE said that smoking can cause damage to the lungs and airways, and Covid-19 attacks the respiratory system. Officials also point to a \u201csmall but highly impactful\u201d survey from China which finds that smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe disease. More information on the campaign to help people quit smoking can be found here. The prime minister Boris Johnson has written to opposition party leaders inviting them to a briefing next week and insisting \u201cwe have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency\u201d. An extract from the letter reads: As party leaders, we have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency. Therefore, I would like to invite all leaders of opposition parties in Parliament to a briefing with myself, the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser next week. I want to listen to your views and update you on the measures we have taken so far, such as rapidly expanding testing and providing economic support to businesses and individuals across the country. The government I lead will act in the national interest at all times and be guided by the best scientific evidence, and of course we will continue to engage constructively with all political parties on the national effort to defeat this pandemic. Risk-assessed prisoners within two months of their release date are to be temporarily released from jail in an effort to try and control the spread of coronavirus, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has announced. The move follows campaigners\u2019 calls for early release to avoid thousands of prisoners, many of whom share cells, becoming infected after a total of 88 inmates so far have tested positive for Covid-19. Buckland said: This government is committed to ensuring that justice is served to those who break the law. But this is an unprecedented situation because if coronavirus takes hold in our prisons, the NHS could be overwhelmed and more lives put at risk. All prisoners will face a tough risk assessment and must comply with strict conditions, including an electronic tag, while they are closely monitored. Those that do not will be recalled to prison. No high-risk criminals such as those who have been convicted of violent or sexual offences, anyone who is a national security concern or a danger to children, will be considered for release. Prisoners who have not served at least half their custodial term will also not be among those who are released. The Ministry of Justice added that no offender convicted of Covid-19-related offences, including coughing at emergency workers or stealing personal protective equipment, will be eligible. In addition, the MoJ said no prisoner would be released if they have symptoms of coronavirus or without housing and health support being in place. Northern Ireland is to release 200 of its 1,500 prisoners early while the authorities in Scotland are considering taking similar action. Good morning. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest UK coronavirus news throughout the day. This morning, Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London and author of a report which warned of mass deaths if the UK did not introduce strict controls, said the lockdown could be relaxed in weeks \u2013 but only if Britons abide by physical distancing restrictions in the meantime. He said a high level of coronavirus infections could last for \u201cweeks\u201d if people broke physical distancing rules this weekend. He told BBC Radio 4 that the epidemic was expected to plateau in the next week to 10 days, but said people\u2019s behaviour was critical to determining what happens next. Asked what would happen if people flouted physical distancing rules this weekend, he said: That moves us to a slightly more pessimistic scenario. We still think things will plateau but we\u2019ll be at quite high levels of infection for weeks and weeks rather than seeing quite a rapid decline as the type seen in China. We want to move to a situation where at least by the end of May that we\u2019re able to substitute some less intensive measures, more based on technology and testing, for the complete lockdown we have now. His warning echoes the heartfelt plea issued yesterday by the chief nurse Ruth May that anyone thinking of gathering outdoors when the weather is sunny this weekend should remember the two nurses, Areema Nasreen and Aimee O\u2019Rourke, who died after contracting Covid-19. She said: Please stay home, for them.

      "body": "<p>The chancellor<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/uk-banks-banned-from-requesting-personal-guarantees-for-loans\" title=\"\"> has revamped his first effort at a loan scheme</a> for businesses to tide them over the worst of the lockdown. Gone are restrictions that meant small companies needed to find collateral to back the loans, putting their homes at risk. Larger firms, discouraged by demands that they first seek commercial loans, found the new scheme allowed them to approach lenders for an interest free 12-month loan with an 80% government guarantee. Rishi Sunak believes all firms should be able to benefit from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/130k-inquiries-1k-loans-why-uk-government-had-to-tweak-help-for-small-firms\" title=\"\">his freshened-up range of loan schemes</a>, but not everyone is so sure.</p> <h2>Package travel operator</h2> <p><strong>Newmarket Holidays</strong><br>Marc Vincent, finance director of Newmarket Holidays, says the firm sells 80,000 holidays a year and around a third are sold online. Now he is deluged by customer inquiries. That has meant he cannot furlough staff: it\u2019s all hands to the pumps.</p> <p>\u201cIf tour operators are allowed to go under, it will be like a run on a bank, with a long chain of suppliers also affected,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the government will need to bail out customers anyway, so much better to do it now.\u201d</p> <p>With no money coming in and unable to take advantage of the furlough scheme \u2013 which allows firms to send workers home while the government covers 80% of their salary up to \u00a325,000, capped at \u00a32,500 a month \u2013 the business is suffering. Of 148 staff, only 52 have been furloughed.</p> <p>To benefit from a VAT holiday until the summer, staff have spent the last week delving through payments, though he says the savings are limited.</p> <p>Regulations that give customers the right to demand their money back on package holidays within 14 days of cancellation should be changed, he says. Instead, travel firms should be allowed to offer credit notes that can be redeemed after two years if they are not spent. \u201cOther EU countries are doing this and so should we.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Manufacturer</strong></h2> <p><strong> Princess Yachts</strong><br>Princess employs 3,000 people in Plymouth. Last year it posted a \u00a330m operating profit for 2018 on turnover of \u00a3340m. Today its \u00a3600m order book is effectively frozen. The factory where some of the most spectacular yachts in the world are constructed is shut down and 70% of staff are at home.</p> <p>Chairman and chief executive Antony Sheriff was disappointed with Sunak\u2019s first effort at a loan scheme for medium-sized companies like his when it insisted they must access commercial loans \u2013 a costly and cumbersome procedure. The reforms mean the company will now examine them favourably. \u201cI think he has done a good job,\u201d says Sheriff.</p> <p>The 55-year-old company has cash in the bank and could withstand several months of a lockdown, he says, but he is concerned about the costs of starting up again in the summer or autumn, which could mean outlays for materials would be prohibitively expensive.</p> <p>\u201cWe make everything on our boats, from the hull to the furniture. It all happens here. We account for about 15,000 jobs in the Plymouth area and the ease of getting back into production is key,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Any thought of profits this year have evaporated. \u201cEverybody will look back at 2020 and say what a shame, but I hope not too many people will focus on the financials in a year that is pretty much a write-off,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87b8a7c87237eaebecb38fb38c732c249f761298\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87b8a7c87237eaebecb38fb38c732c249f761298/0_518_4577_2745/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Newcastle University buildings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newcastle University is concerned about the loss of income from overseas students.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Washington Imaging/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>University</h2> <p> <strong>Newcastle University</strong><br>There are officials inside the Treasury who consider universities the linchpin and economic driving force of many towns and cities in Britain. Huge employers, they are also tied into the local economy through relationships with businesses and state agencies, including the NHS.</p> <p>Richard Dale, the finance director at Newcastle University, says it has paused building work to save cash and switched to remote working and remote teaching to keep students on track. But he expects a big drop in the \u00a390m a year the university receives from foreign students. They make up 17% of the current university population, excluding EU students, who will be considered foreign from next year should a Brexit deal be completed.</p> <p>Some staff on fixed-term contracts have had their status paused, he says, while the university looks to place them in other roles. But his main concern is bridging the likely two-to-three-year gap before foreign student numbers return to current levels. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources to keep research going with financial help from our funders. We don\u2019t get the full economic cost of research paid for other than by cross-subsidy from foreign student income. It has always been an unstable situation that the pandemic forces us to address,\u201d he says.</p> <h2><strong>Cruise line</strong></h2> <p><strong> Fred Olsen</strong><br>\u201cI have been talking to our management team about government funding and how the travel industry has reacted passively while airline businesses like Virgin Atlantic have said a subsidy is desperately needed,\u201d says Peter Deer, managing director of Fred Olsen Cruise Lines.</p> <p>Virgin has called on the government to give the industry up to \u00a37.5bn in state support. The chancellor rebuffed the call, saying he would only consider support on a case-by-case basis. Despite this setback, Deer thinks the travel industry should be making more noise.</p> <p>The company, which has a turnover of \u00a3200m-\u00a3250m, has four ships laying up in the Firth of Forth and a fifth, the Braemar, about to leave Southampton to join them. About 300 of the firm\u2019s 500 staff in Ipswich are home-working while they deal with customer inquiries, many of them about lost bookings. The rest are at home not working.</p> <p>\u201cWe are using the furlough scheme, and that is great, but there are many other costs we face,\u201d he says, adding that the government should be working harder to prevent the industry shrinking.</p> <p>\u201cThe drop in cruise-ship business has come as a huge shock to our suppliers, the majority of which are in the UK. There are 40,000 people in the industry and they are being completely overlooked.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor has revamped his first effort at a loan scheme for businesses to tide them over the worst of the lockdown. Gone are restrictions that meant small companies needed to find collateral to back the loans, putting their homes at risk. Larger firms, discouraged by demands that they first seek commercial loans, found the new scheme allowed them to approach lenders for an interest free 12-month loan with an 80% government guarantee. Rishi Sunak believes all firms should be able to benefit from his freshened-up range of loan schemes, but not everyone is so sure. Package travel operator Newmarket Holidays Marc Vincent, finance director of Newmarket Holidays, says the firm sells 80,000 holidays a year and around a third are sold online. Now he is deluged by customer inquiries. That has meant he cannot furlough staff: it\u2019s all hands to the pumps. \u201cIf tour operators are allowed to go under, it will be like a run on a bank, with a long chain of suppliers also affected,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the government will need to bail out customers anyway, so much better to do it now.\u201d With no money coming in and unable to take advantage of the furlough scheme \u2013 which allows firms to send workers home while the government covers 80% of their salary up to \u00a325,000, capped at \u00a32,500 a month \u2013 the business is suffering. Of 148 staff, only 52 have been furloughed. To benefit from a VAT holiday until the summer, staff have spent the last week delving through payments, though he says the savings are limited. Regulations that give customers the right to demand their money back on package holidays within 14 days of cancellation should be changed, he says. Instead, travel firms should be allowed to offer credit notes that can be redeemed after two years if they are not spent. \u201cOther EU countries are doing this and so should we.\u201d Manufacturer Princess Yachts Princess employs 3,000 people in Plymouth. Last year it posted a \u00a330m operating profit for 2018 on turnover of \u00a3340m. Today its \u00a3600m order book is effectively frozen. The factory where some of the most spectacular yachts in the world are constructed is shut down and 70% of staff are at home. Chairman and chief executive Antony Sheriff was disappointed with Sunak\u2019s first effort at a loan scheme for medium-sized companies like his when it insisted they must access commercial loans \u2013 a costly and cumbersome procedure. The reforms mean the company will now examine them favourably. \u201cI think he has done a good job,\u201d says Sheriff. The 55-year-old company has cash in the bank and could withstand several months of a lockdown, he says, but he is concerned about the costs of starting up again in the summer or autumn, which could mean outlays for materials would be prohibitively expensive. \u201cWe make everything on our boats, from the hull to the furniture. It all happens here. We account for about 15,000 jobs in the Plymouth area and the ease of getting back into production is key,\u201d he says. Any thought of profits this year have evaporated. \u201cEverybody will look back at 2020 and say what a shame, but I hope not too many people will focus on the financials in a year that is pretty much a write-off,\u201d he says. University Newcastle University There are officials inside the Treasury who consider universities the linchpin and economic driving force of many towns and cities in Britain. Huge employers, they are also tied into the local economy through relationships with businesses and state agencies, including the NHS. Richard Dale, the finance director at Newcastle University, says it has paused building work to save cash and switched to remote working and remote teaching to keep students on track. But he expects a big drop in the \u00a390m a year the university receives from foreign students. They make up 17% of the current university population, excluding EU students, who will be considered foreign from next year should a Brexit deal be completed. Some staff on fixed-term contracts have had their status paused, he says, while the university looks to place them in other roles. But his main concern is bridging the likely two-to-three-year gap before foreign student numbers return to current levels. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources to keep research going with financial help from our funders. We don\u2019t get the full economic cost of research paid for other than by cross-subsidy from foreign student income. It has always been an unstable situation that the pandemic forces us to address,\u201d he says. Cruise line Fred Olsen \u201cI have been talking to our management team about government funding and how the travel industry has reacted passively while airline businesses like Virgin Atlantic have said a subsidy is desperately needed,\u201d says Peter Deer, managing director of Fred Olsen Cruise Lines. Virgin has called on the government to give the industry up to \u00a37.5bn in state support. The chancellor rebuffed the call, saying he would only consider support on a case-by-case basis. Despite this setback, Deer thinks the travel industry should be making more noise. The company, which has a turnover of \u00a3200m-\u00a3250m, has four ships laying up in the Firth of Forth and a fifth, the Braemar, about to leave Southampton to join them. About 300 of the firm\u2019s 500 staff in Ipswich are home-working while they deal with customer inquiries, many of them about lost bookings. The rest are at home not working. \u201cWe are using the furlough scheme, and that is great, but there are many other costs we face,\u201d he says, adding that the government should be working harder to prevent the industry shrinking. \u201cThe drop in cruise-ship business has come as a huge shock to our suppliers, the majority of which are in the UK. There are 40,000 people in the industry and they are being completely overlooked.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cLittle China girl.\u201d \u201cPaki doctor.\u201d \u201cBlack bitch.\u201d These are just some of the racist slurs directed at NHS nurses and doctors as they work on the frontline. I remember feeling sick when I first read <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-10-31/can-i-have-a-white-doctor-for-the-operation-racist-abuse-against-nhs-staff-almost-triples-itv-news-finds/\">an ITV report detailing these incidents</a> at the end of last year. And it was at the front of my mind as I whooped in support of our carers on Thursday night.</p> <p>I returned to that report last week after posting what I thought was an uncontroversial tweet, noting the fact that all four doctors who had tragically lost their lives to coronavirus at that point were people of colour, and that it was a reminder of how much the NHS relies on BAME and migrant doctors and nurses. Just <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">over four in </a><a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">10 NHS medical staff are BAME</a>, and almost <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/blogs/immigration-and-the-nhs-the-evidence\">one in three doctors are not from the UK</a>. From the first Caribbean nurses who arrived after the second world war, the NHS has been built on the backs of both migrant and British workers; in the <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/articles/WyjPPScAALyZnoX7\">late 1960s, half of all doctors</a> below consultant level were non-British.</p> <p>So I was surprised when a prominent broadcaster weighed in to lecture me on the irrelevance of my comment, then simply ignored efforts made to highlight to her the racism experienced by some NHS staff in the line of duty. And I was left pretty shaken by the 48-hour deluge of racist diatribe that ensued, a chunk of which came from her fans and followers.</p> <p>It was an effective, if painful, reminder of how racism manifests itself: not just in words such as \u201cPaki\u201d but in the self-appointed white gatekeepers who see it as their business to police celebrations of the contributions made, sometimes in the face of appalling racism, by people of colour. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve been called a racist simply for acknowledging the ethnicity of the medical professionals who gave their lives to keep us safe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These anti-immigrant signalling devices are more reflective of a nastiness at the heart of government than society</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So it\u2019s worth reiterating why the skin colour of our fallen NHS heroes matters. It\u2019s not just that outright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/22/anti-muslim-hate-crimes-soar-in-uk-after-christchurch-shootings\">racism and rising levels of Islamophobia</a> affect the wellbeing of NHS workers willingly risking their lives to keep us all safe, it is that, as the General Medical Council has acknowledged, BAME medics face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/nhs-treating-minority-ethnic-doctors-as-outsiders\">structural racism</a>. And the government\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric continues to legitimise discrimination at the frontline.</p> <p>While I was happy to hear health secretary Matt Hancock paying particular thanks to the migrant NHS workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus, years of racist government policy give his words a hollow ring. The <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6207031/gretel-gocan-windrush-exile-return-uk/\">81-year-old Windrush nurse kept out of the UK</a> and separated from her children and grandchildren for nine years after taking a holiday to Jamaica; the \u201cright to rent\u201d policy that requires landlords to perform immigrant status checks that the high court has now ruled racially discriminatory; the punitive NHS levy \u2013 \u00a32,200 a year for a family of four \u2013 that all migrants, including NHS staff, <a href=\"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-fiscal-impact-of-immigration-in-the-uk/\">have to pay on top of the taxes they contribute</a> which already more than cover on average their use of public services.</p> <p>What\u2019s heartening is that these anti-immigrant signalling devices are more reflective of a nastiness at the heart of government than they are of society in general. There are far fewer people today whose hostility to immigration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/observer-view-uk-immigration-policy\">driven by racism</a> than there were 10 years ago; rising levels of hate crime are more likely to be a product of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/15/hate-crimes-double-england-wales\">racists feeling newly emboldened</a> and legitimised than a significant swelling of their ranks. I hope Hancock\u2019s welcome shift in tone will be matched by a shift in policy: an offer of citizenship to migrant health and care workers in recognition of their extraordinary contribution.</p> <p>But while racism still exists, it will always remain vital to pay special tribute to the contributions of people of colour. I would encourage my critics to watch this video made last year where <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-10-31/can-i-have-a-white-doctor-for-the-operation-racist-abuse-against-nhs-staff-almost-triples-itv-news-finds/\">surgeon Radhakrishna Shanbag</a> describes how it feels to be asked, \u201ccan I have a white doctor to do the operation?\u201d and reflect on why those tributes feel so triggering.</p> <p>In the meantime, the bullies and gatekeepers will never silence me from saying this: Amged el-Hawrani, Adil El Tayar, Areema Nasreen, Alfa Saadu, Habib Zaidi, you are all heroes, and your sacrifice will not be forgotten. You\u2019ll be in my heart next Thursday evening, and for many Thursdays to come.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cLittle China girl.\u201d \u201cPaki doctor.\u201d \u201cBlack bitch.\u201d These are just some of the racist slurs directed at NHS nurses and doctors as they work on the frontline. I remember feeling sick when I first read an ITV report detailing these incidents at the end of last year. And it was at the front of my mind as I whooped in support of our carers on Thursday night. I returned to that report last week after posting what I thought was an uncontroversial tweet, noting the fact that all four doctors who had tragically lost their lives to coronavirus at that point were people of colour, and that it was a reminder of how much the NHS relies on BAME and migrant doctors and nurses. Just over four in 10 NHS medical staff are BAME, and almost one in three doctors are not from the UK. From the first Caribbean nurses who arrived after the second world war, the NHS has been built on the backs of both migrant and British workers; in the late 1960s, half of all doctors below consultant level were non-British. So I was surprised when a prominent broadcaster weighed in to lecture me on the irrelevance of my comment, then simply ignored efforts made to highlight to her the racism experienced by some NHS staff in the line of duty. And I was left pretty shaken by the 48-hour deluge of racist diatribe that ensued, a chunk of which came from her fans and followers. It was an effective, if painful, reminder of how racism manifests itself: not just in words such as \u201cPaki\u201d but in the self-appointed white gatekeepers who see it as their business to police celebrations of the contributions made, sometimes in the face of appalling racism, by people of colour. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve been called a racist simply for acknowledging the ethnicity of the medical professionals who gave their lives to keep us safe. So it\u2019s worth reiterating why the skin colour of our fallen NHS heroes matters. It\u2019s not just that outright racism and rising levels of Islamophobia affect the wellbeing of NHS workers willingly risking their lives to keep us all safe, it is that, as the General Medical Council has acknowledged, BAME medics face structural racism. And the government\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric continues to legitimise discrimination at the frontline. While I was happy to hear health secretary Matt Hancock paying particular thanks to the migrant NHS workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus, years of racist government policy give his words a hollow ring. The 81-year-old Windrush nurse kept out of the UK and separated from her children and grandchildren for nine years after taking a holiday to Jamaica; the \u201cright to rent\u201d policy that requires landlords to perform immigrant status checks that the high court has now ruled racially discriminatory; the punitive NHS levy \u2013 \u00a32,200 a year for a family of four \u2013 that all migrants, including NHS staff, have to pay on top of the taxes they contribute which already more than cover on average their use of public services. What\u2019s heartening is that these anti-immigrant signalling devices are more reflective of a nastiness at the heart of government than they are of society in general. There are far fewer people today whose hostility to immigration is driven by racism than there were 10 years ago; rising levels of hate crime are more likely to be a product of racists feeling newly emboldened and legitimised than a significant swelling of their ranks. I hope Hancock\u2019s welcome shift in tone will be matched by a shift in policy: an offer of citizenship to migrant health and care workers in recognition of their extraordinary contribution. But while racism still exists, it will always remain vital to pay special tribute to the contributions of people of colour. I would encourage my critics to watch this video made last year where surgeon Radhakrishna Shanbag describes how it feels to be asked, \u201ccan I have a white doctor to do the operation?\u201d and reflect on why those tributes feel so triggering. In the meantime, the bullies and gatekeepers will never silence me from saying this: Amged el-Hawrani, Adil El Tayar, Areema Nasreen, Alfa Saadu, Habib Zaidi, you are all heroes, and your sacrifice will not be forgotten. You\u2019ll be in my heart next Thursday evening, and for many Thursdays to come.",

      "body": "<p>A groundbreaking survey of more than 400 British and US elite athletes and coaches has found that fewer than half feel their sport actively encourages them to report doping, the <em>Observer</em> can reveal. The study, conducted by Leeds Beckett University on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency, also discovered that nearly a quarter of athletes surveyed feared they would be labelled as a \u201csnitch\u201d if they expressed their suspicions.</p> <p>The report, the first of its kind to be conducted among elite athletes and coaches in the UK and US, also found that the vast majority of respondents admitted the negative reaction towards whistleblowers could discourage them to come forward if they saw evidence of wrongdoing.</p> <p>A total of 301 athletes from 54 sports \u2013 all of whom had represented their country at international level \u2013 along with 139 coaches were questioned for the 140-page study, \u201cBlowing the whistle on doping in sport through evidence-informed policy making\u201d.</p> <p>Dr Kelsey Erickson, the lead researcher, said her work showed that changes needed to be made to encourage more people to come forward if they had suspicions of wrongdoing. \u201cIn recent years we have seen a huge increase in the number of reporting mechanisms available for athletes and coaches to blow the whistle,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cYet while we found they often want to come forward, they often don\u2019t know who to voice their concerns to, and they don\u2019t necessarily trust action will be taken.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/27/ukad-needs-more-powers-british-athletics-doping\">Yes, Ukad needs more powers \u2013 but it also needs to catch more drugs cheats | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Erickson said most coaches (93%) and athletes (83%) felt that reporting doping was their responsibility, but barriers to reporting were evident throughout the research. Just 45% of coaches and 38% of athletes surveyed felt their sport actively encourages them to report doping, for instance, while fewer than half were aware of Wada\u2019s whistleblower programme.<br><br>The report makes clear that establishing a culture of feeling able to speak up and have confidence that concerns will be listened to \u2013 and acted upon \u2013 is the most important element of whistleblowing.</p> <p>As Erickson pointed out, fewer than a quarter of coaches (23%) and athletes (19%) surveyed felt that the public reaction to those who have reported doping in sport would encourage them to do the same.</p> <p>\u201cWhat really stood out for me was the incredible courage, strength and determination it takes to come forward and report misconduct in sport,\u201d added Eriksson, who is now director of safe sport at USA Cycling.</p> <p>\u201cOften people feel they should only report their suspicions if they have hard evidence. But the message to them should be that they don\u2019t have to do the investigation themselves. And that little piece of information they provide could be the last bit in the jigsaw.\u201d</p> <p>To raise awareness of the research, a video detailing the experiences of courageous individuals who blew the whistle on doping will be released this month. Produced by the Northern Film School at Leeds Beckett University, the research team hopes the video will help remove the barriers to speaking up to protect the integrity of sport.</p> <p>Professor Sue Backhouse, director of research at the Carnegie School of Sport at Leeds Beckett, also hoped the study would lay the foundations for Wada to develop better policies to encourage the reporting of doping.</p> <p>\u201cOur findings underscore the need to celebrate those who show courage by coming forward with information of rule violations,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to recognise the vulnerability of those who do so within global policies and procedures.</p> <p>\u201cGiven this vulnerability and the uncertainty felt by those who do report, Wada needs to emphasise the positive difference individuals and groups can make when they come forward with information on wrongdoing.</p> <p>\u201cWada and their broader community now need to work together to establish a culture where people feel able to speak up and have confidence that their concerns will be listened to \u2013 and acted upon.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A groundbreaking survey of more than 400 British and US elite athletes and coaches has found that fewer than half feel their sport actively encourages them to report doping, the Observer can reveal. The study, conducted by Leeds Beckett University on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency, also discovered that nearly a quarter of athletes surveyed feared they would be labelled as a \u201csnitch\u201d if they expressed their suspicions. The report, the first of its kind to be conducted among elite athletes and coaches in the UK and US, also found that the vast majority of respondents admitted the negative reaction towards whistleblowers could discourage them to come forward if they saw evidence of wrongdoing. A total of 301 athletes from 54 sports \u2013 all of whom had represented their country at international level \u2013 along with 139 coaches were questioned for the 140-page study, \u201cBlowing the whistle on doping in sport through evidence-informed policy making\u201d. Dr Kelsey Erickson, the lead researcher, said her work showed that changes needed to be made to encourage more people to come forward if they had suspicions of wrongdoing. \u201cIn recent years we have seen a huge increase in the number of reporting mechanisms available for athletes and coaches to blow the whistle,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cYet while we found they often want to come forward, they often don\u2019t know who to voice their concerns to, and they don\u2019t necessarily trust action will be taken.\u201d Erickson said most coaches (93%) and athletes (83%) felt that reporting doping was their responsibility, but barriers to reporting were evident throughout the research. Just 45% of coaches and 38% of athletes surveyed felt their sport actively encourages them to report doping, for instance, while fewer than half were aware of Wada\u2019s whistleblower programme. The report makes clear that establishing a culture of feeling able to speak up and have confidence that concerns will be listened to \u2013 and acted upon \u2013 is the most important element of whistleblowing. As Erickson pointed out, fewer than a quarter of coaches (23%) and athletes (19%) surveyed felt that the public reaction to those who have reported doping in sport would encourage them to do the same. \u201cWhat really stood out for me was the incredible courage, strength and determination it takes to come forward and report misconduct in sport,\u201d added Eriksson, who is now director of safe sport at USA Cycling. \u201cOften people feel they should only report their suspicions if they have hard evidence. But the message to them should be that they don\u2019t have to do the investigation themselves. And that little piece of information they provide could be the last bit in the jigsaw.\u201d To raise awareness of the research, a video detailing the experiences of courageous individuals who blew the whistle on doping will be released this month. Produced by the Northern Film School at Leeds Beckett University, the research team hopes the video will help remove the barriers to speaking up to protect the integrity of sport. Professor Sue Backhouse, director of research at the Carnegie School of Sport at Leeds Beckett, also hoped the study would lay the foundations for Wada to develop better policies to encourage the reporting of doping. \u201cOur findings underscore the need to celebrate those who show courage by coming forward with information of rule violations,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to recognise the vulnerability of those who do so within global policies and procedures. \u201cGiven this vulnerability and the uncertainty felt by those who do report, Wada needs to emphasise the positive difference individuals and groups can make when they come forward with information on wrongdoing. \u201cWada and their broader community now need to work together to establish a culture where people feel able to speak up and have confidence that their concerns will be listened to \u2013 and acted upon.\u201d",

According to a popular meme going around at the moment, intentions matter more than actions. \u201cYour grandparents were called to war,\u201d it says. \u201cYou\u2019re being called to sit on the couch.\u201d In a way, sitting around and doing nothing is a new type of heroism, because going out and living life as normal makes you a passive bystander to a global threat. But in ordinary times, the difference between a hero and a bystander is far more clear-cut. What makes some of us the former, and some of us the latter?</p> <p>As she was boarding the tube in London on an otherwise ordinary Friday morning last November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/23/man-arrested-after-jewish-children-were-targeted-on-the-tube\" title=\"\">Asma Shuweikh</a> felt a man rush past her. He made a beeline for an orthodox Jewish family sitting by the doors\u2013 a father and two sons in kippah. Brandishing a bible, the man began to hurl antisemitic abuse at the family; as Shuweikh stood in shocked silence, she noticed he had highlighted passages in his book. When the man turned his attention to the children, she decided she could not remain silent any longer: it was time to speak up. In a video that subsequently went viral on social media, the 36-year-old can be seen calmly telling the aggressor: \u201cCome on, man, there\u2019s children here\u2026 You\u2019re on public transport.\u201d</p> <p>What made Shuweikh speak out and put herself in the firing line? The abuser later began berating her for being a Muslim woman wearing trousers. She says that faith and motherhood helped inform her actions. \u201cWhen I see something wrong,\u201d she says, \u201cI have to say it.\u201d</p> <p>According to Catherine A Sanderson, a psychology professor at Amherst College in Massachusetts and the author of <em>The Bystander Effect</em>, myriad complex factors make some of us bystanders and some of us heroes. These range from our self-identity to the pressure of social norms.</p> <p>Sanderson says she was inspired to write the book by both \u201cpersonal and global\u201d events: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/harvey-weinstein-sentencing-rape-conviction\" title=\"\">Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex offences</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/usa-gymnastics-larry-nassar-scandal\" title=\"\">USA Gymnastics</a> sex abuse scandal, and the fact that a student at her son\u2019s college died just two weeks into his very first semester. The student had been drinking heavily and had fallen and hit his head. Although fellow students watched over him, they didn\u2019t call emergency services for nearly 20 hours. By which time it was too late to save him. Her book answers the question at the heart of this incident: why?</p> <p>You may already know about the \u201cbystander effect\u201d. For more than 50 years, newspaper articles and textbooks have recounted the story of Kitty Genovese \u2013 a young woman who was murdered outside her apartment in New York in 1964. It was claimed almost 40 people heard or saw Genovese\u2019s murder, yet none of them spoke out. The term bystander effect was coined to explain the fact that individuals are less likely to help people in need when other people are present.</p> <p>The Genovese story is largely apocryphal \u2013 later research revealed that no witnesses actually saw the attack in its entirety and two people did in fact call the police. Yet this doesn\u2019t mean the bystander effect isn\u2019t without some truth. In her book, Sanderson shares a number of scientific and real-life case studies that prove the presence of others makes it more difficult for us to speak out.</p> <p>In one New York University study carried out shortly after the Genovese case, 85% of participants sought help for a man who was slurring his words when they believed only they could hear him. When they thought others could hear him, too, only 31% went to get help.</p> <p>Sanderson isn\u2019t interested in easy explanations about fearless heroes and callous bystanders. \u201cThe question of why some people act badly and others don\u2019t is not really about good and bad,\u201d she says. She notes that many of the participants in the New York study were physically distressed and argues they didn\u2019t choose not to act but were rather paralysed by a \u201cstate of indecision\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fbb2eeebf95b3db1725feff7896d292833f9df6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fbb2eeebf95b3db1725feff7896d292833f9df6/0_5187_5792_3473/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration of a group of around 35-40 people standing in a rough semi-circle, each going their own way\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Bystanders aren\u2019t just people who fail to run at terrorists. They\u2019re people who let sexist or racist jokes pass, too.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Franck Allais/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout her book, Sanderson references a number of neurological studies that explain our inaction. She shows that working with others reduces our feeling of control and that as the number of observers to an incident increases, the parts of our brains that prepare us to take action actually become less active. \u201cMany of the processes that drive inaction occur not through a careful deliberative process, but at an automatic level in the brain.\u201d </p> <p>Sanderson is a psychologist not a neuroscientist, so I ask why she chose to focus so much on brain activity in the book. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for people to understand that what they\u2019re doing is natural and probably even adaptive from an evolutionary point,\u201d she says. \u201cBut neuroscience lets us be aware of our pre-existing unconscious biases. It gives us the power to say: \u2018This is normal and it\u2019s natural, but I still have some agency and I can act.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The third section of Sanderson\u2019s book is more of a guide to how we can all change our behaviour to ensure we speak out, whether that be about discrimination on public transport, workplace fraud, sexual harassment or school bullies. Sanderson\u2019s research shows many of us often believe we would act in certain scenarios. Who among us hasn\u2019t had a casual fantasy about heroically saving the day by whistleblowing at work, saving an infant and/or granny from traffic, or karate chopping a pervert in the park? But in that fantasy, we\u2019re thinking about ourselves alone. In the real world, Sanderson says, we are often bystanders as part of a group and because of that we experience \u201cdeindividuation\u201d.</p> <p>Can we be \u201cre-individualised\u201d to ensure that we act as we hope we might? A study Sanderson references seems to suggest we can. In 2012, academics from Harvard asked people to take a maths test and offered them $1 for every correct answer. The twist? Participants scored themselves. The study\u2019s participants were divided into groups that included those who signed an honesty declaration at the end of the test after they\u2019d written down their score; and those who signed a declaration at the top of the sheet before scoring themselves.</p> <p>In the end, 79% of people who signed their name at the bottom of the page cheated by inflating their score, compared to only 37% of those who signed their name before scoring themselves. \u201cWhen we are reminded of who we are \u2013 which signing our name surely does \u2013 we are also reminded of our intentions to be a good person who does the right thing,\u201d Sanderson writes.</p> <p>By remarkable coincidence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/21/man-tells-of-using-narwhal-tusk-during-london-bridge-attack\" title=\"\">Darryn Frost</a> was reminded of who he was shortly before he ran at a terrorist with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/30/narwhal-tusk-and-fire-extinguisher-used-to-tackle-london-bridge-attacker\" title=\"\">narwhal tusk</a> during the London Bridge attack of November 2019. \u201cI was at a conference directly before the attack and an American woman was talking about where we learn our behaviours,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe started our session asking us for three positive and negative traits about ourselves.\u201d After this, Frost says, she prompted the audience to think about their earliest memory where they learned these traits. \u201cIt was literally just after that that everything kicked off, so my emotions at the time were really raw and on the surface.\u201d</p> <p>In general, Frost\u2019s experiences tally with Sanderson\u2019s optimism that we can overcome our inaction. Frost says he taught himself to speak out and conquer fear \u2013 he assists those in need and confronts people who are disrespectful to others when he is out in public. \u201cIt mostly comes from my schooling\u2026 My school motto was: \u2018For the brave, nothing is too difficult\u2019. They teach you to be a good citizen and to look out for your fellow man.\u201d Of his response to the attack, he says: \u201cIt did feel instinctive to an extent, but that instinct has been taught and nurtured and built over years.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In some cases you can diffuse a situation by making a simple joke</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One thing Sanderson says we all must nurture, and build in ourselves is the ability to overcome social awkwardness. Time and time again, she notes how social pressures facilitate inaction. Put simply: if we are around others, we base how we act on how they\u2019re acting. Many of us might avoid speaking out for fear that we\u2019ve misjudged a situation \u2013 after all, if it really was that bad, wouldn\u2019t others be speaking up, too? Psychologists call these worries \u201cevaluation apprehension\u201d. We\u2019re concerned we\u2019ll look stupid or sensitive or strange if we speak out. Sanderson notes that people find it easier to intervene if they are less concerned about fitting in, yet also notes those who are worried about fitting in feel social ostracisation more strongly. The neuroscience shows that for these people, rejection feels like physical pain \u2013 \u201cas if you\u2019ve twisted your ankle or burned yourself with coffee\u201d.</p> <p>Sanderson also argues it\u2019s more difficult to act when situations are ambiguous and less dramatic, noting that empirical evidence shows that in obvious emergencies such as terror attacks, people are just as likely to help whether alone or in a crowd. While Shuweikh had little doubt what was happening when she saw that man brandishing a highlighted bible, I spoke to someone who failed to act when they saw harassment on another train. Carla, 30, says she was travelling in west London when she heard some Muslim teenagers chatting. Suddenly, a trans woman stood up and shouted at the teens. Carla realised later that they had insulted the woman in a language they both spoke, but which Carla couldn\u2019t understand.</p> <p>\u201cIt took a long time to even realise that something bad had happened, so I only started weighing up whether to say something when the trans woman began telling the carriage what had happened,\u201d Carla explains. She says she felt stressed, ashamed and conflicted as she weighed up what to do \u2013 she felt as though her face went red. \u201cI felt awful for this woman, because I know how much discrimination trans people face\u2026 but I was afraid, I didn\u2019t want to be seen shouting at a group of young, visibly Muslim people in case it appeared racist.\u201d Carla also says it was late and she was in a part of town she didn\u2019t know, which fed her inhibitions. In the end, she didn\u2019t speak out except to shout \u201cgood for you!\u201d to the woman as she stood up for herself. Describing the story now, Carla apologises for being \u201ccowardly\u201d.</p> <p>Sanderson emphasises that Carla isn\u2019t cowardly \u2013 the difference between a hero and a bystander is heavily situational. In another incident, Carla was the only person to call an ambulance when someone was run over by a bus, while Frost says he was uncomfortable at being labelled a \u201chero\u201d after the London Bridge attack. He says he is \u201chaunted\u201d by the times in his adult life when he didn\u2019t speak out or take action. \u201cPeople seem to glorify my actions and yes I\u2019m proud of them, but there\u2019s a lot of times in life I regret not being a better person.\u201d</p> <p>Despite her insistence that we can\u2019t divide the world into neat dichotomies, Sanderson would be remiss not to document what makes it easier for certain people to speak out. She explains the concept of \u201cmoral rebels\u201d \u2013 people who show courage in speaking out and overcoming social pressure. These people tend to have higher self-esteem and also believe their actions will make a difference (though there are no official figures, Sanderson estimates between five and 10% of the population can be categorised this way). She is at pains, however, to make it clear that anyone can speak out. \u201cIt\u2019s not one-size-fits all,\u201d Sanderson says. She argues that not everyone has to be a knight in shining armour. \u201cYou can find a friend if you don\u2019t have the ability to do it alone\u201d or \u201cin some cases you might diffuse the situation by creating a joke\u201d. As well as social skills, learning more traditional skills also helps \u2013 early in the book, Sanderson notes that people trained in first aid are more likely to intervene in dangerous situations. \u201cThey weren\u2019t different in personality, but they were equipped with different skills.\u201d</p> <p>Yet it isn\u2019t just dangerous situations that concern Sanderson \u2013 much of her work is dedicated to how you can speak out about sexual harassment or workplace fraud. According to Sanderson, bystanders aren\u2019t just people who fail to run at terrorists with narwhal tusks, they\u2019re people who let sexist or racist jokes pass, too. She documents how silence perpetuates poor behaviour, citing a report that found men who have committed sexual assault believe other men accept their behaviour. Or as Martin Luther King Jr said: \u201cHistory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamour of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy hope is that reading this book will help people understand that they have a choice and they can act,\u201d Sanderson says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a courageous act, it doesn\u2019t have to be confronting the person shouting slurs on public transport, it can be going over and sitting with the victim and pretending that you know them to interrupt the situation.\u201d</p> <p>There is no doubt that Asma Shuweikh chose the courageous path. She recalls being bullied at 12 because she wore a hijab. One girl threw Shuweikh\u2019s lunch on the ground while others laughed \u2013 later that night, she went home and cried. \u201cMy mum and my brother said to me: \u2018Never, ever, ever be quiet when someone does something wrong to you.\u2019\u201d In the past, she has been targeted by Islamophobic abuse in public and felt hurt when no one spoke up on her behalf. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that situation, you just don\u2019t think about yourself,\u201d she says of witnessing the antisemitic abuse on the tube. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the discrimination, don\u2019t like the injustice, you have to say something.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008361648/the-bystander-effect-understanding-the-psychology-of-courage-and-inaction/\" title=\"\">The Bystander Effect</a> by Catherine A Sanderson (</em><em>Harper Collins, \u00a320) is published 16 April.

She shows that working with others reduces our feeling of control and that as the number of observers to an incident increases, the parts of our brains that prepare us to take action actually become less active. \u201cMany of the processes that drive inaction occur not through a careful deliberative process, but at an automatic level in the brain.\u201d Sanderson is a psychologist not a neuroscientist, so I ask why she chose to focus so much on brain activity in the book. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for people to understand that what they\u2019re doing is natural and probably even adaptive from an evolutionary point,\u201d she says. \u201cBut neuroscience lets us be aware of our pre-existing unconscious biases. It gives us the power to say: \u2018This is normal and it\u2019s natural, but I still have some agency and I can act.\u2019\u201d The third section of Sanderson\u2019s book is more of a guide to how we can all change our behaviour to ensure we speak out, whether that be about discrimination on public transport, workplace fraud, sexual harassment or school bullies. Sanderson\u2019s research shows many of us often believe we would act in certain scenarios. Who among us hasn\u2019t had a casual fantasy about heroically saving the day by whistleblowing at work, saving an infant and/or granny from traffic, or karate chopping a pervert in the park? But in that fantasy, we\u2019re thinking about ourselves alone. In the real world, Sanderson says, we are often bystanders as part of a group and because of that we experience \u201cdeindividuation\u201d. Can we be \u201cre-individualised\u201d to ensure that we act as we hope we might? A study Sanderson references seems to suggest we can. In 2012, academics from Harvard asked people to take a maths test and offered them $1 for every correct answer. The twist? Participants scored themselves. The study\u2019s participants were divided into groups that included those who signed an honesty declaration at the end of the test after they\u2019d written down their score; and those who signed a declaration at the top of the sheet before scoring themselves. In the end, 79% of people who signed their name at the bottom of the page cheated by inflating their score, compared to only 37% of those who signed their name before scoring themselves. \u201cWhen we are reminded of who we are \u2013 which signing our name surely does \u2013 we are also reminded of our intentions to be a good person who does the right thing,\u201d Sanderson writes. By remarkable coincidence, Darryn Frost was reminded of who he was shortly before he ran at a terrorist with a narwhal tusk during the London Bridge attack of November 2019. \u201cI was at a conference directly before the attack and an American woman was talking about where we learn our behaviours,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe started our session asking us for three positive and negative traits about ourselves.\u201d After this, Frost says, she prompted the audience to think about their earliest memory where they learned these traits. \u201cIt was literally just after that that everything kicked off, so my emotions at the time were really raw and on the surface.\u201d In general, Frost\u2019s experiences tally with Sanderson\u2019s optimism that we can overcome our inaction. Frost says he taught himself to speak out and conquer fear \u2013 he assists those in need and confronts people who are disrespectful to others when he is out in public. \u201cIt mostly comes from my schooling\u2026 My school motto was: \u2018For the brave, nothing is too difficult\u2019. They teach you to be a good citizen and to look out for your fellow man.\u201d Of his response to the attack, he says: \u201cIt did feel instinctive to an extent, but that instinct has been taught and nurtured and built over years.\u201d One thing Sanderson says we all must nurture, and build in ourselves is the ability to overcome social awkwardness. Time and time again, she notes how social pressures facilitate inaction. Put simply: if we are around others, we base how we act on how they\u2019re acting. Many of us might avoid speaking out for fear that we\u2019ve misjudged a situation \u2013 after all, if it really was that bad, wouldn\u2019t others be speaking up, too? Psychologists call these worries \u201cevaluation apprehension\u201d. We\u2019re concerned we\u2019ll look stupid or sensitive or strange if we speak out. Sanderson notes that people find it easier to intervene if they are less concerned about fitting in, yet also notes those who are worried about fitting in feel social ostracisation more strongly. The neuroscience shows that for these people, rejection feels like physical pain \u2013 \u201cas if you\u2019ve twisted your ankle or burned yourself with coffee\u201d. Sanderson also argues it\u2019s more difficult to act when situations are ambiguous and less dramatic, noting that empirical evidence shows that in obvious emergencies such as terror attacks, people are just as likely to help whether alone or in a crowd. While Shuweikh had little doubt what was happening when she saw that man brandishing a highlighted bible, I spoke to someone who failed to act when they saw harassment on another train. Carla, 30, says she was travelling in west London when she heard some Muslim teenagers chatting. Suddenly, a trans woman stood up and shouted at the teens. Carla realised later that they had insulted the woman in a language they both spoke, but which Carla couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cIt took a long time to even realise that something bad had happened, so I only started weighing up whether to say something when the trans woman began telling the carriage what had happened,\u201d Carla explains. She says she felt stressed, ashamed and conflicted as she weighed up what to do \u2013 she felt as though her face went red. \u201cI felt awful for this woman, because I know how much discrimination trans people face\u2026 but I was afraid, I didn\u2019t want to be seen shouting at a group of young, visibly Muslim people in case it appeared racist.\u201d Carla also says it was late and she was in a part of town she didn\u2019t know, which fed her inhibitions. In the end, she didn\u2019t speak out except to shout \u201cgood for you!\u201d to the woman as she stood up for herself. Describing the story now, Carla apologises for being \u201ccowardly\u201d. Sanderson emphasises that Carla isn\u2019t cowardly \u2013 the difference between a hero and a bystander is heavily situational. In another incident, Carla was the only person to call an ambulance when someone was run over by a bus, while Frost says he was uncomfortable at being labelled a \u201chero\u201d after the London Bridge attack. He says he is \u201chaunted\u201d by the times in his adult life when he didn\u2019t speak out or take action. \u201cPeople seem to glorify my actions and yes I\u2019m proud of them, but there\u2019s a lot of times in life I regret not being a better person.\u201d Despite her insistence that we can\u2019t divide the world into neat dichotomies, Sanderson would be remiss not to document what makes it easier for certain people to speak out. She explains the concept of \u201cmoral rebels\u201d \u2013 people who show courage in speaking out and overcoming social pressure. These people tend to have higher self-esteem and also believe their actions will make a difference (though there are no official figures, Sanderson estimates between five and 10% of the population can be categorised this way). She is at pains, however, to make it clear that anyone can speak out. \u201cIt\u2019s not one-size-fits all,\u201d Sanderson says. She argues that not everyone has to be a knight in shining armour. \u201cYou can find a friend if you don\u2019t have the ability to do it alone\u201d or \u201cin some cases you might diffuse the situation by creating a joke\u201d. As well as social skills, learning more traditional skills also helps \u2013 early in the book, Sanderson notes that people trained in first aid are more likely to intervene in dangerous situations. \u201cThey weren\u2019t different in personality, but they were equipped with different skills.\u201d Yet it isn\u2019t just dangerous situations that concern Sanderson \u2013 much of her work is dedicated to how you can speak out about sexual harassment or workplace fraud. According to Sanderson, bystanders aren\u2019t just people who fail to run at terrorists with narwhal tusks, they\u2019re people who let sexist or racist jokes pass, too. She documents how silence perpetuates poor behaviour, citing a report that found men who have committed sexual assault believe other men accept their behaviour. Or as Martin Luther King Jr said: \u201cHistory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamour of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.\u201d \u201cMy hope is that reading this book will help people understand that they have a choice and they can act,\u201d Sanderson says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a courageous act, it doesn\u2019t have to be confronting the person shouting slurs on public transport, it can be going over and sitting with the victim and pretending that you know them to interrupt the situation.\u201d There is no doubt that Asma Shuweikh chose the courageous path. She recalls being bullied at 12 because she wore a hijab. One girl threw Shuweikh\u2019s lunch on the ground while others laughed \u2013 later that night, she went home and cried. \u201cMy mum and my brother said to me: \u2018Never, ever, ever be quiet when someone does something wrong to you.\u2019\u201d In the past, she has been targeted by Islamophobic abuse in public and felt hurt when no one spoke up on her behalf. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that situation, you just don\u2019t think about yourself,\u201d she says of witnessing the antisemitic abuse on the tube. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the discrimination, don\u2019t like the injustice, you have to say something.\u201d The Bystander Effect by Catherine A Sanderson (Harper Collins, \u00a320) is published 16 April.

In the bidding to host the 2024 Games, three out of the five bidders \u2013 Boston, Budapest and Hamburg \u2013 withdrew, largely on grounds of cost. But new research suggests that, for London at least, hosting the 2012 games was worth the \u00a39.3bn price tag, thanks to the temporary feelgood factor it bestowed on the capital\u2019s residents and, to a lesser extent, on the rest of Britain. Work by a team at the Centre for Economic Performance, based at the London School of Economics, suggests the average Londoner would have been prepared to pay almost \u00a3900 to host the games, such was the boost it gave their mental wellbeing. The research suggests that the decision by the organisers of this year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics to push the games back to next year, rather than cancel them altogether, may be justified, if it gives a similar fillip to the city and Japan as a whole. The team reached its conclusion after studying the mental outlook of 26,000 residents living in three cities \u2013 London, Paris and Berlin \u2013 before, during and after the 2012 games. The team found a significant increase in life satisfaction among Londoners over the course of summer 2012 which, after stripping out everything else, they attribute to the hosting of the games. Christian Krekel, research fellow at the CEP, said there was evidence the feelgood factor extended beyond Britain. \u201cAlthough we find clear evidence that the subjective wellbeing effects are larger in the host city, there is also evidence for positive spillover effects to other countries,\u201d Krekel said. External factors such as the weather and political events were taken into account. The wellbeing of Londoners was found to change little as the medal count rose, suggesting the increase came from their pride in hosting the event rather than Britain\u2019s sporting success. The large volume of wellbeing data now available allows economists to put a price on a potential boost to someone\u2019s positive outlook. In the case of the 2012 games, the economists suggest that the increase in wellbeing was was worth up to \u00a3892 to the average Londoner \u2013 the equivalent of London paying \u00a37.4bn to host the games.

      "body": "<p>He was one of the most celebrated English playwrights of the 16th century, yet none of his plays survived, and today the name of Thomas Watson is virtually unknown. Now the writer, poet and <a href=\"https://repository.royalholloway.ac.uk/items/7582c48a-462a-df85-827f-914592d83052/1/\">pioneer of the English madrigal</a> \u2013 who also saved the life of the playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/marlowe\">Christopher Marlowe</a> in a street brawl \u2013 is being seen in a new light.</p> <p>Watson has been identified as the most likely primary author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/07/arden-of-faversham-swan-theatre-review\">Arden of Faversham</a></em>, the first domestic tragedy in English, which was published anonymously in 1592. Many scholars believe that five of the play\u2019s scenes were co-authored with William Shakespeare.</p> <p>Based on a notorious murder of 1551, <em>Arden </em>is about a woman from Faversham, Kent, who conspires with her lover to kill her husband and struggles to \u201cwash away this blood\u201d, just like Lady Macbeth.</p> <p>Over five years of research, Professor Gary Taylor, a leading Shakespeare scholar, has found stylistic, biographical and historical links to Watson in almost every scene. He concludes that there is \u201cstrong and consistent evidence\u201d for his authorship.</p> <p>Watson was a polymath whose talents extended from writing poetry in Latin to creating the first published set of English madrigals. In 1595, Shakespeare was described as \u201cWatson\u2019s heire\u201d by William Clerke, in a work titled <em>Polimanteia</em>, but only recently have scholars even realised that Watson was a playwright.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Watson was greatly admired at the time, celebrated for tragic plays before Marlowe or Shakespeare became famous</p> <footer> <cite>Gary Taylor, Shakespeare scholar</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAlmost everything Watson did was original,\u201d said Taylor, professor of literature at Florida State University and general editor of <em>The New Oxford Shakespeare</em>. \u201cEven specialists only know one tiny aspect of his work, instead of putting it all together.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s new research will be published in <em>The Review of English Studies</em> later this year. He is also among leading contributors to <em>Early Shakespeare, 1588-1594,</em><em> </em> a major reappraisal of Shakespeare\u2019s early career, to be published this month by <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/early-shakespeare-15881594/5C75B3FBFE840F89CC8C9477E5A8D650\">Cambridge University Press</a>. This will contain essays on <em>Arden </em>by other scholars.</p> <p>Dr Rory Loughnane, its co-editor and a senior lecturer at the University of Kent, said: \u201cTaylor\u2019s identification of Watson\u2019s hand in <em>Arden</em> \u2026 is a major finding, not least for our understanding of Shakespeare\u2019s early career. Though obscure now, Watson was a polymath and, like his close friend Marlowe, a celebrated poet, translator and dramatist.

      "bodyText": "He was one of the most celebrated English playwrights of the 16th century, yet none of his plays survived, and today the name of Thomas Watson is virtually unknown. Now the writer, poet and pioneer of the English madrigal \u2013 who also saved the life of the playwright Christopher Marlowe in a street brawl \u2013 is being seen in a new light. Watson has been identified as the most likely primary author of Arden of Faversham, the first domestic tragedy in English, which was published anonymously in 1592. Many scholars believe that five of the play\u2019s scenes were co-authored with William Shakespeare. Based on a notorious murder of 1551, Arden is about a woman from Faversham, Kent, who conspires with her lover to kill her husband and struggles to \u201cwash away this blood\u201d, just like Lady Macbeth. Over five years of research, Professor Gary Taylor, a leading Shakespeare scholar, has found stylistic, biographical and historical links to Watson in almost every scene. He concludes that there is \u201cstrong and consistent evidence\u201d for his authorship. Watson was a polymath whose talents extended from writing poetry in Latin to creating the first published set of English madrigals. In 1595, Shakespeare was described as \u201cWatson\u2019s heire\u201d by William Clerke, in a work titled Polimanteia, but only recently have scholars even realised that Watson was a playwright. \u201cAlmost everything Watson did was original,\u201d said Taylor, professor of literature at Florida State University and general editor of The New Oxford Shakespeare. \u201cEven specialists only know one tiny aspect of his work, instead of putting it all together.\u201d Taylor\u2019s new research will be published in The Review of English Studies later this year. He is also among leading contributors to Early Shakespeare, 1588-1594, a major reappraisal of Shakespeare\u2019s early career, to be published this month by Cambridge University Press. This will contain essays on Arden by other scholars. Dr Rory Loughnane, its co-editor and a senior lecturer at the University of Kent, said: \u201cTaylor\u2019s identification of Watson\u2019s hand in Arden \u2026 is a major finding, not least for our understanding of Shakespeare\u2019s early career. Though obscure now, Watson was a polymath and, like his close friend Marlowe, a celebrated poet, translator and dramatist. Watson was also extremely well-connected within London\u2019s literary scene; that he collaborated with Shakespeare, who was then in his mid-20s, reveals the sorts of influential circles the ambitious Stratford man moved in at the very beginning of his career.\u201d Taylor said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a writer who is capable of writing a great play. Watson was greatly admired at the time, celebrated for tragic plays before Marlowe or Shakespeare became famous.\u201d Arden authorship contenders have included Thomas Kyd, who wrote The Spanish Tragedy. Taylor said: \u201cWatson looks more likely than any other writer of the 1580s or early 1590s. As a native Londoner with legal training, born in the 1550s and praised by his contemporaries as an early master of tragedy in the commercial theatres, Watson shares the biographical profile that first led critics to suspect Kyd\u2019s hand in the play.\u201d He added: \u201cA lot of the material is funny, and Watson \u2026 was also famously funny. In 1596, one writer remembered \u2018the froth of witty Tom Watson\u2019s jests\u2019.\u201d Among other biographical evidence, Taylor draws parallels between Arden and Watson\u2019s defence of Marlowe when he was attacked in the street in 1589: \u201cThe husband who would be famously murdered is defended by a friend in an earlier attack. That incident in the play is not in the historical sources. It\u2019s totally made up by the playwright. The friend is also totally made up.\u201d Taylor has compared Arden with Watson\u2019s surviving literary prose and poetry, using databases of playwrights working between 1585 and 1595. The study revealed that \u201csome features of Arden are shared with no one but Watson\u201d.

It included much of the soft left of the party, and a large number of members who wanted to end austerity and break decisively from New Labour but whose politics didn\u2019t go much further. The big majority opposed Brexit, and most of them get their perspective on internal party politics in broad brushstrokes from reading the news, not in granular detail from attending meetings.

After some early moments of hope, Corbyn\u2019s leadership came to be run not by \u201ca new kind of politics\u201d but by the left wing of the old politics. Momentum\u2019s role as a brilliantly effective mobilising tool masked a lack of internal democracy that rotted its grassroots potential. The party management machine, familiar to long-suffering party activists of any era, shut down attempts to bring in open selections for MPs and ensured that key decisions were taken by professionals behind closed doors, not by members.

This meant that the grassroots energy on which the left always relies simply was not there. In 2016, I worked 12-hour days on the campaign to get Corbyn re-elected. In 2020, I grudgingly, passively, lent Long-Bailey my vote in order to increase the left\u2019s perceived strength after the result. I don\u2019t think I was alone.</p> <p>Keir Starmer enters the leadership at a pivotal moment, and he will need the left in more ways than one. With the left out of power, Starmer must be held to his commitment to honour Corbyn\u2019s radical and popular economic policies. And with a failing government coronavirus strategy likely to leave people destitute and cause thousands of unnecessary deaths, Starmer\u2019s response has so far been too cautious and lacking in bite.</p> <p>We badly need an opposition that can pull no punches in holding the government to account, breaking with any false idea of national unity and putting unprecedented progressive social measures on the table. In that task, the spirit of Corbynism may well be kept alive.</p> <p><em>Michael Chessum was a former member of the Momentum steering committee</em></p> <p><br></p>",

This meant that the grassroots energy on which the left always relies simply was not there. In 2016, I worked 12-hour days on the campaign to get Corbyn re-elected. In 2020, I grudgingly, passively, lent Long-Bailey my vote in order to increase the left\u2019s perceived strength after the result. I don\u2019t think I was alone. Keir Starmer enters the leadership at a pivotal moment, and he will need the left in more ways than one. With the left out of power, Starmer must be held to his commitment to honour Corbyn\u2019s radical and popular economic policies. And with a failing government coronavirus strategy likely to leave people destitute and cause thousands of unnecessary deaths, Starmer\u2019s response has so far been too cautious and lacking in bite. We badly need an opposition that can pull no punches in holding the government to account, breaking with any false idea of national unity and putting unprecedented progressive social measures on the table. In that task, the spirit of Corbynism may well be kept alive. Michael Chessum was a former member of the Momentum steering committee",

Even under the influence of intense cabin fever, I\u2019m not quite daft enough to think we can recreate the missing joys of spring with a glass of wine. But some wines do at least seem to offer a sense, however fleeting, of spring\u2019s scents and energy. The sauvignon blancs of France\u2019s Central Loire Valley certainly have this effect on me: that combination of sappy grassy greenness, with notes of blossomy white flowers, and an intense freshness and silvery liveliness all very much present in Domaine de la Rablais\u2019 example.</p> <p><strong>Andr\u00e9 Dezat Sancerre Blanc 2018 (from \u00a316.95, <a href=\"https://www.tanners-wines.co.uk/\">tanners-wines.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.bbr.com/\">bbr.com</a>; <a href=\"https://www.uncorked.co.uk/\">uncorked.co.uk</a>) </strong>Touraine sauvignon, drawn from a wide area of vineyards across the central Loire, is undoubtedly among the best value white wines around right now, with tonic-bringing, bright, zesty own-label expressions available from <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/\">Aldi</a> (\u00a35.79), <a href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/\">Sainsbury\u2019s</a> (\u00a37) and <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/\">Waitrose</a> (\u00a37.99) all hitting the Loire\u2019s spring source. For extra-levels of graceful, evocative charm, it\u2019s worth seeking out the individual villages, of which Sancerre is the most celebrated. You have to be careful with Sancerre: the vineyards that fan out from the town on its lofty perch are beautiful but the quality is not always as good as the elevated price tag suggests. Like chateauneuf-du-pape down in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, this is an appellation with rather too many producers trading on the famous name.

I\u2019ve never been entirely convinced by this: from time to time I do pick up smoky notes in Pouilly-Fum\u00e9, but no more often than I do in other Loire (or indeed, global) sauvignon blancs. Mostly the big differences between the wines of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 seem to come down more to winemaking style and the precise patch of vineyard the producer is working with.

General Motors plans to begin producing 10,000 ventilators per month by mid-April, and Ford hopes to produce 50,000 of the devices in the next 100 days.</p> <p>But producing ventilators and automobiles are two very different processes, and retooling auto factories to make ventilators presents a daunting logistical challenge.

But, in fact, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Dziczek said.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, success hinges on the automakers\u2019 addressing four challenges:</p> <ul> <li><p>Retooling plants</p></li> <li><p>Developing a supply chain</p></li> <li><p>Pulling together a workforce </p></li> <li><p>Clearing regulatory hurdles</p></li> </ul> <p>And they need to solve those issues immediately.

      "bodyText": "Detroit is planning a rapid mobilization of its engineering and manufacturing might unseen since the second world war, switching from making cars to making ventilators as the Covid-19 pandemic brings the US to breaking point. With coronavirus cases surging, not least in Detroit, demand for ventilators is outpacing hospitals\u2019 supply and people are dying without the machines. Now the US\u2019s largest car manufacturers are stepping in. General Motors plans to begin producing 10,000 ventilators per month by mid-April, and Ford hopes to produce 50,000 of the devices in the next 100 days. But producing ventilators and automobiles are two very different processes, and retooling auto factories to make ventilators presents a daunting logistical challenge. Can Detroit really save the nation from its growing ventilator crisis? Kristin Dziczek, vice-president of research with the Center for Automotive Research, said she was initially skeptical. Automakers have already had success producing personal protection equipment like face shields and surgical masks, Dziczek noted, but she\u2019s been \u201camazed\u201d that they seem to be successfully gearing up to produce far more complex ventilators. \u201cI knew the industry had something to offer, though I never thought it could actually produce ventilators. But, in fact, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Dziczek said. Broadly speaking, success hinges on the automakers\u2019 addressing four challenges: Retooling plants Developing a supply chain Pulling together a workforce Clearing regulatory hurdles And they need to solve those issues immediately. American hospitals have about 160,000 ventilators, and only about 65,000 of the machines designed for the most severe cases. Critical care units in hotspots like New York City and Detroit already have a shortage. Eventually, up to 740,000 ventilators could be needed, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Ventilators are designed to push air through a tube and into the lungs. They are in high demand because Covid-19 attacks the lungs, and people with severe cases need extra oxygen to survive. Once in production, the devices won\u2019t roll off the lines at Ford or GM\u2019s behemoth, robot-filled plants that produce F-150 pickups and Sierras. Instead, the machines will be assembled largely by hand at Ford\u2019s Rawsonville Plant in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, and GM\u2019s Kokomo, Indiana, facility. The latter is a relatively trim 2.6m-sq-ft plant resembling a clean office building more than a gritty factory, and it is where GM produces small electrical components for cars. Similarly, when it isn\u2019t idled, Ford\u2019s 1.7m-sq-ft Rawsonville plant produces components such as transmission oil pumps, battery packs, and air induction systems. The companies are utilizing those facilities because they are where \u201ca bunch of smaller parts arrive, then are assembled into larger parts\u201d, said Mark Schirmer, public relations director with Cox Automotive. \u201cThey\u2019re then shipped to the assembly plants to be installed in vehicles on the large assembly lines.\u201d The process for manufacturing ventilators is similar, he added. \u201cImagine someone at a desk putting together a complex puzzle or model by hand \u2013 lots of small-part assembly,\u201d Schirmer said, adding that the real challenge was \u201cgetting all the necessary parts together in one place for workers to assemble them\u201d. More than 700 parts compose the VOCSN critical care ventilators that GM is partnering with Seattle-based Ventec Life Systems to produce in Kokomo, and the automaker has tapped more than 100 suppliers to feed components. The ventilators are sought after by hospitals because they are five-in-one, portable machines with critical care ventilators, oxygen concentrators, cough assistance, suction and nebulizers. By contrast, Ford is producing a simple ventilator design, which will be licensed by GE Healthcare from Florida-based Airon and operate on air pressure instead of electricity. Ford and GE designers have essentially stripped down a machine used for anesthesia that functions as a ventilator. Aside from sourcing components from suppliers, Ford is repurposing parts that are \u201cuseful in production of other items\u201d, its chief executive, Jim Hackett, recently told CBS This Morning. \u201cWe\u2019re going into our parts bins to see what can be done,\u201d he added. Concurrently, the automakers are helping boost production at their partners\u2019 facilities \u2013 Ventec currently produces about 200 ventilators monthly, and GM is using its suppliers and logistical team to help the company push out about 10 times that figure. Meanwhile, Ford said it was helping ramp up GE\u2019s capacity. Labor is perhaps the easiest challenge for the companies to solve, partly because ventilator production is not a labor-intensive job. Cox said it had found one of the nation\u2019s largest ventilator manufacturers only had about 10,000 employees worldwide. Automakers are asking United Auto Workers employees to volunteer to work in three shifts. Ford said it would need about 500 employees, while GM is staffing Kokomo with about 1,000. \u201cIf this does move forward as promoted, it won\u2019t be like world war two when automotive plants were changed over to produce tanks, planes and plane engines,\u201d Schirmer said. The effort got a boost when Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act \u2013 wartime legislation that will allow automakers to avoid certain patent issues and provides the president with the ability to compel companies to prioritize government orders over those of other clients. As he announced the measure, Trump also criticized GM over the ventilators\u2019 price. However, both automakers have said they won\u2019t profit off of the project. Ventec\u2019s ventilators can cost about $18,000 each, far cheaper than the more sophisticated models, which can run up to $50,000. The federal government is also accommodating automakers by waiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules to allow non-medical manufacturers to quickly produce the devices. Among other changes, it is not enforcing rules that require ventilator manufacturers to gain FDA approval before making slight changes to their devices. \u201cIf you want to help expand production of ventilators to save American lives in this pandemic, we are going to work with you to sweep every possible barrier out of your way,\u201d the FDA wrote in a 22 March statement. Sadly, many of those ventilators will be needed in Detroit. As of Saturday, the city had recorded more than 3,550 confirmed cases and more than 117 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic. Michigan had seen close to 13,000 cases and close to 500 deaths. For those with the disease, Motor City\u2019s ventilators can\u2019t come soon enough.",

But the requirement to assess firms\u2019 eligibility for conventional finance meant Cbils wasn\u2019t having an impact. By Thursday night, only \u00a390m of loans had been approved to 983 businesses \u2013 barely scratching the surface of the problem.</p> <p>A similar point can be made about the contentious issue of personal guarantees on loans under \u00a3250,000. Some banks were asking for guarantees at launch; some weren\u2019t, or were doing so in different circumstances. No wonder borrowers were angry. But the banks themselves were confused because the Treasury hadn\u2019t made clear what it wanted. Friday brought the clear instruction not to ask for guarantees. It could have been given on day one.</p> <p>Sunak has also had to acknowledge his original design had a large hole in the middle. Cbils loans were limited to firms with an annual turnover of \u00a345m or less, with other would-be borrowers directed to the scheme for larger companies overseen by the Bank of England. That didn\u2019t work because mid-sized companies thought they needed a credit rating, which most don\u2019t have. Thus Cbils has now been extended, in effect, to firms with \u00a3500m of turnover, albeit that they\u2019ll pay interest on loans.</p> <p>Business groups have applauded the Treasury for listening to feedback. They\u2019re being polite. Many of the design flaws could surely have been anticipated if the Treasury had had a better feel for how small businesses think and act.</p> <p>Sunak, it should be said, deserves praise for his \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">underwrite 80% of wages at affected companies</a>. That is a genuinely big \u2013 and necessarily expensive \u2013 intervention that will save thousands of jobs.</p> <p>Nor should we pretend that designing a loan scheme is easy. The current crisis, unlike the 2008 financial crisis, extends almost to the entire economy. And, to repeat, the banks still need to move. But it also needs to be stated: Cbils required urgent improvement because its original design was poor.</p> <h2>Billionaires benefit from the furlough. They don\u2019t need more</h2> <p>The bill for supporting British business through the crisis will be enormous. It could not be otherwise. The government is paying 80% of the wages of millions of workers across the UK to minimise job losses and ensure the economy is fit to recover when lockdown ends.</p> <p>There will still be corporate failures \u2013 indeed, the destruction has started already on the high street with the collapse of Carluccio\u2019s and Laura Ashley. The only certainty is that action, in the form of the vast \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme, will be cheaper than inaction in the long run.</p> <p>Not all beneficiaries are alike, however. When clothing retailer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/philip-green-asks-for-taxpayer-support-to-prop-up-arcadia\" title=\"\">Arcadia put 14,500 employees into furlough last week</a>, Philip Green became an indirect beneficiary of the public purse. Or, strictly speaking, his wife, Monaco-based Lady Green, got lucky since she is the owner of the struggling fashion empire that includes Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins.</p> <p>This, to put it mildly, feels appalling. The Greens banked a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005 but are under no obligation to return a single penny to the business in the circumstances. And there\u2019s no point asking politely for a contribution. As we saw with the BHS pension scheme, the Greens had to be chased by parliamentarians and watchdogs before agreeing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/28/philip-green-agrees-pay-363m-bhs-pension-fund\" title=\"\">\u00a3363m payment</a>.</p> <p>There is little, unfortunately, the government can do. It is virtually impossible to design a furlough scheme that does not apply equally to all companies.</p> <p>Ministers can, though, take a tough line when overseas-based billionaires beg for help beyond the generous furlough scheme. Virgin Atlantic, 51% owned by Richard Branson, is reportedly asking for a \u00a3500m package of soft loans and credit guarantees. The response to that should be simple: it\u2019s your turn to put your hand in your pocket.</p> <h2>In time, we must devote huge resources to restarting the economy</h2> <p>There has never been a crisis like the current one. The onset of coronavirus has crippled the advanced world, as governments effectively shut down economic and social life as we know it. Unemployment is now starting to soar as companies run out of money amid the enforced lockdowns, with early indications that joblessness in the US and UK could surpass the depths of the 1930s Great Depression.</p> <p>The jobs crisis is of our own making, an exercise in protecting the health of a nation at the expense of material wealth. It is entirely correct that a compassionate society should take such an approach. But the impact of the lockdown ought not to be overlooked: millions are facing unemployment and hardship.</p> <p>Comparisons with the second world war and the Great Depression are overwrought. Rather than attempting full-scale mobilisation, Covid-19 is overcome by suppressing the economy as much as possible. And, unlike the Depression, hope still remains that this crisis will prove shorter than any other severe economic downturn in history.</p> <p>But two historical comparisons ought to be kept in mind: the need for a New Deal akin to Roosevelt\u2019s in the 1930s, or the Marshall Plan of the 1940s, to reboot economic activity once the economy awakens from hibernation.</p> <p>When the dust finally settles on the emergency phase of the Covid-19 crisis \u2013 a moment hoped for sooner rather than later \u2013 the government must throw as much weight behind reopening the economy as it did to shut it down.</p> <p>In the short term, support packages are welcome, despite shortcomings that mean many are still left without adequate financial aid, as the Conservative government temporarily ditches political dogma dating back decades.</p> <p>Failure to support those who lose their jobs in this crisis will only cost Britain even more in the long run, from weaker economic growth and lost tax revenues.</p>",

Sunak, it should be said, deserves praise for his \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme that will underwrite 80% of wages at affected companies. That is a genuinely big \u2013 and necessarily expensive \u2013 intervention that will save thousands of jobs. Nor should we pretend that designing a loan scheme is easy. The current crisis, unlike the 2008 financial crisis, extends almost to the entire economy. And, to repeat, the banks still need to move. But it also needs to be stated: Cbils required urgent improvement because its original design was poor. Billionaires benefit from the furlough. They don\u2019t need more The bill for supporting British business through the crisis will be enormous. It could not be otherwise. The government is paying 80% of the wages of millions of workers across the UK to minimise job losses and ensure the economy is fit to recover when lockdown ends. There will still be corporate failures \u2013 indeed, the destruction has started already on the high street with the collapse of Carluccio\u2019s and Laura Ashley. The only certainty is that action, in the form of the vast \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme, will be cheaper than inaction in the long run. Not all beneficiaries are alike, however. When clothing retailer Arcadia put 14,500 employees into furlough last week, Philip Green became an indirect beneficiary of the public purse. Or, strictly speaking, his wife, Monaco-based Lady Green, got lucky since she is the owner of the struggling fashion empire that includes Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins. This, to put it mildly, feels appalling. The Greens banked a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005 but are under no obligation to return a single penny to the business in the circumstances. And there\u2019s no point asking politely for a contribution. As we saw with the BHS pension scheme, the Greens had to be chased by parliamentarians and watchdogs before agreeing a \u00a3363m payment. There is little, unfortunately, the government can do. It is virtually impossible to design a furlough scheme that does not apply equally to all companies. Ministers can, though, take a tough line when overseas-based billionaires beg for help beyond the generous furlough scheme. Virgin Atlantic, 51% owned by Richard Branson, is reportedly asking for a \u00a3500m package of soft loans and credit guarantees. The response to that should be simple: it\u2019s your turn to put your hand in your pocket. In time, we must devote huge resources to restarting the economy There has never been a crisis like the current one. The onset of coronavirus has crippled the advanced world, as governments effectively shut down economic and social life as we know it. Unemployment is now starting to soar as companies run out of money amid the enforced lockdowns, with early indications that joblessness in the US and UK could surpass the depths of the 1930s Great Depression. The jobs crisis is of our own making, an exercise in protecting the health of a nation at the expense of material wealth. It is entirely correct that a compassionate society should take such an approach. But the impact of the lockdown ought not to be overlooked: millions are facing unemployment and hardship. Comparisons with the second world war and the Great Depression are overwrought. Rather than attempting full-scale mobilisation, Covid-19 is overcome by suppressing the economy as much as possible. And, unlike the Depression, hope still remains that this crisis will prove shorter than any other severe economic downturn in history. But two historical comparisons ought to be kept in mind: the need for a New Deal akin to Roosevelt\u2019s in the 1930s, or the Marshall Plan of the 1940s, to reboot economic activity once the economy awakens from hibernation. When the dust finally settles on the emergency phase of the Covid-19 crisis \u2013 a moment hoped for sooner rather than later \u2013 the government must throw as much weight behind reopening the economy as it did to shut it down. In the short term, support packages are welcome, despite shortcomings that mean many are still left without adequate financial aid, as the Conservative government temporarily ditches political dogma dating back decades. Failure to support those who lose their jobs in this crisis will only cost Britain even more in the long run, from weaker economic growth and lost tax revenues.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has warned the US the worst is yet to come in the coronavirus crisis, as global cases of Covid-19 passed 1.2m and the governor of New York thanked China for donating 1,000 ventilators. The state recorded 630 deaths on Saturday in its worst day. \u201cThis is a big deal and it\u2019s going to make a significant difference for us,\u201d said Andrew Cuomo, who has repeatedly warned that the state\u2019s supply of the vital machines would be exhausted in days if current trends continued. Donald Trump used a Saturday press conference to blame shortages on state governors asking for more supplies than they needed, and urged Americans to take a little-studied anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as a preventative despite his health expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, stating there was only \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d it was of use. Trump also warned the next two weeks would be the \u201ctoughest\u201d and that there would be \u201ca lot of death\u201d. He would deploy thousands of military personnel to support the states, the president said. Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio have repeatedly implored the federal government for more help. Meanwhile, China saw a slight rise in cases despite tough restrictions and a ban on foreign arrivals. In Europe, Italy passed 15,000 deaths, while Spain overtook Italy in terms of cases, recording a total of more than 126,000, to become the second-worst affected. The US has by far the most cases, with more than 311,000. Globally, the death toll is approaching 65,000. New York state is the centre of the outbreak in the US, with more than 113,700 confirmed cases as of Saturday morning. More than 3,500 people statewide have died, and about 15,000 coronavirus patients are in hospital. More than 4,100 are in intensive care where many, if not all, need ventilators. The situation is particularly worrying on Long Island, east of Manhattan, where the number of cases \u201cis like a fire spreading\u201d, Cuomo told a news conference. The New York donation was facilitated by Beijing from billionaires Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai, the co-founders of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Health experts calculate that New York might be around a week away from the worst point in the health crisis. Cuomo said: \u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the apex, we\u2019re getting closer \u2026 Our reading of the projections is we\u2019re somewhere in the seven-day range.\u201d On Friday, Cuomo said he would have the National Guard collect and redeploy ventilators that some hospitals weren\u2019t using, and again alluded to the plan on Saturday, but details remained unclear. China registered 30 new cases for Saturday, as opposed to 19 the day before. Twenty-five of the latest cases involved people who had entered from abroad, said the National Health Commission. The remaining five were new locally transmitted infections, all in the southern coastal province of Guangdong. The commission said 47 new asymptomatic cases were reported in the mainland on Saturday, compared with 64 a day earlier. The mainland has now reported a total of 81,669 cases, while the death toll has risen by three to 3,329. In other developments: Mexico\u2019s president announced the country was seeking to make its own ventilators as cases reached 1,890. Prototypes were being tested now, said Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Seventy-nine deaths have been reported so far. In Hong Kong, about 130 riot police were placed in quarantine for two weeks after an officer who carried out mass arrests at a recent protest tested positive, the South China Morning Post reported. Australians were warned that \u201cunauthorised or homemade\u201d virus testing kits were arriving in the country. Two hundred arrived in Perth last month, and dozens more have turned up in Melbourne, all from mainland China or Hong Kong. However, there is cautious optimism that lockdown efforts are having an effect. Japan is hoping to triple production of anti-flu drug Avignan, the drug China is testing as a Covid-19 treatment, Reuters reports. The increase would mean the drug, owned by Fujifilm Holding Corp and also known as Favipiravir, could treat 2 million people this fiscal year.

Will history be kind to those in power? \u201cWhen we did the Chilcot inquiry, people wanted some accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting out a reliable account was the best thing we did. A proper account of what has happened is important. You can then draw lessons from the same knowledge base. You have to ask what is reasonable given what was known at the time, rather than what people think they knew. There\u2019s a lot of hindsight at the moment.\u201d",

But in a deeply divided party he managed to sweep up 56.2% of the vote, leaving Long-Bailey and Nandy way behind, on 27.6% and 16.2% respectively. Importantly, Starmer won a mandate across the board, winning the biggest share of the vote among MPs, members and affiliates.</p> <p>Many among Starmer\u2019s own supporters and within his campaign team, who tied him ruthlessly and repetitively to messages about unity during more than 40 hustings, had thought early on that it would be a much closer fight.</p> <p>Some believed he would appear too \u201clawyerly\u201d and wooden, while others feared that the left\u2019s candidate Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles, would be propelled to victory by the pro-Corbyn organisation Momentum, which had the vital data on many of the 500,000 party members from the last two contests in 2015 and 2016. Another danger, his backers believed, was that Starmer, a London MP and star barrister with a square jaw and smart suits, would be seen in the Labour heartlands as another Blairite in left-wing clothing.</p> <p>But as it turned out, the left who had wanted Long-Bailey to win, including her union backers, fell out among themselves about how to carry Corbynism forward amid the post-general election acrimony, and her campaign never really took off. It was also not entirely clear how much she wanted the job and whether she felt forced against her better instincts to carry the torch for the Corbynistas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People wanted someone who could win,  someone professional \u2013 this came up a lot \u2013 and capable of governing</p> <footer> <cite>Starmer supporter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe went missing for the first four weeks of the campaign, which made everyone think she was wobbling, and when it started it was pretty much a disaster. By that time Starmer was miles ahead,\u201d said one of her early backers. While Nandy impressed and won admirers, the MP for Wigan started too far behind, and was viewed as less tried and tested than Starmer.</p> <p>With the party shattered by its worst defeat since 1935, when the rebuilding process began, it was not ideological purity, flamboyance, or someone young and new that members across the Labour divide wanted \u2013 but someone reassuring and competent who they could see taking on and outshining Boris Johnson. And Starmer fitted the bill.</p> <p>Prominent names on the left such as Laura Parker, a former senior official in Corbyn\u2019s office and a former national organiser of Momentum, chose Starmer and was followed by many other Momentumites.</p> <p>Parker, who had seen him operate in Labour\u2019s Brexit sub-committee, said Starmer was \u201ctenacious, forensic, diligent, intelligent\u201d. His focus, determination and mastery of detail is something everyone who knows him observes. Importantly for Parker he had also, since the election, put forward a left-wing programme that for her was entirely credible, allowing her to feel it was a natural switch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/from-attlee-to-blair-what-starmer-can-learn-from-four-labour-leaders\">From Attlee to Blair: what Starmer can learn from four Labour leaders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe can seem cautious but the other side of that is that you feel you can believe the words that come out of his mouth,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHe has said there will be no rolling back from a radical programme \u2013 and I, like others who supported Corbyn, backed him on the basis of the policy commitments he had in his 10 pledges.\u201d</p> <p>One of Starmer\u2019s supporters who manned phone banks for him said Momentum members came over in droves. \u201cYou could just hear them peeling off on the phone. They wanted someone who could win, people wanted someone professional \u2013 this came up a lot \u2013 and capable of governing as well as leading an effective opposition.

There is only a relatively small hardcore of the membership who think that ideological purity is more important than winning.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s supporters deny that his campaign had been long in the planning. But he has been very careful in his five years in parliament not to make political enemies either at Westminster or in his Holborn and St Pancras constituency party \u2013 and to shore up support against potential challenges from the local left.</p> <p>Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, suggests Starmer deliberately avoided being associated with trouble-making factions in the parliamentary party, even when it was riven by disagreements over Brexit policy, which he was in charge of from 2016 until the election. \u201cI am not aware that he had allegiances really, other than ones for temporary convenience.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13d4e5b85c6604ee57c069f4a737b8bbe51b28dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13d4e5b85c6604ee57c069f4a737b8bbe51b28dd/0_0_3955_2644/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Starmer with leadership rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey, left, and Lisa Nandy, centre, at SEC in Glasgow in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starmer with leadership rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey, left, and Lisa Nandy, centre, at SEC in Glasgow in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Perry/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact his energy seems to have been spent on avoiding factionalism at every turn.

The move comes as Labor steps up its call for parliament to sit regularly during the coronavirus crisis, saying it is inevitable mistakes have been made in the rush to draw up a raft of economic stimulus and support measures. Australia has had 5,687 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 35 deaths, according to the latest figures released on Sunday. Christian Porter, the attorney general, opened the door to allowing more of the casual workforce to access the wage subsidies \u2013 an issue that has been raised by unions, business groups and various MPs. Porter said the government was aiming to be \u201cas inclusive and reasonable as possible\u201d on the issue of casuals and he hoped to have draft legislation ready on Monday. The government is poised to reach out to the secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, over the draft legislation, which will then go to parliament on Wednesday. Porter and McManus have spoken regularly in recent weeks. In a bid to reassure the union movement over the broader legislation, Porter told reporters on Sunday the changes to workplace relations laws would be subject to a six-month expiry date, which could only be changed in future with parliament\u2019s backing. He said the preparation of this legislation was \u201cone of the most important drafting exercises post-World War II\u201d because it would facilitate $130bn of \u201ceconomy-saving and job-saving expenditure\u201d over the next six months. \u201cThere is a lot of progress; it is occurring under enormous time pressure,\u201d he said in Canberra on Sunday. Parliament is due to return on Wednesday \u2013 with limited numbers of MPs attending - to consider legislation to enable as many as 6m workers to access wage subsidies of $1,500 per fortnight, which the Australian Tax Office would pay directly to businesses and not-for-profit organisations that have suffered sharp drops in turnover during the coronavirus pandemic. McManus said the union movement had been raising concerns publicly and privately with the government about how it planned to implement the plan. McManus said 1.1m casuals would miss out on the payment because they had not reached the test of at least 12 months of continuous employment with their employer. Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program, McManus suggested an alternative test, saying \u201cif you could have reasonably expected to be working if it were not for the coronavirus, then you should get the jobkeeper allowance\u201d. This would include casuals who had shifts already booked or received a promise of work. Porter acknowledged on Sunday that many people were regularly employed casually but may move from employer to employer. \u201cWe\u2019re working on that and listening and so when you see the final draft you will see we are trying to be as inclusive and reasonable as possible,\u201d he said. McManus also raised the plight of work visa holders who would miss out on the payments. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that they\u2019re not let to starve as well,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other concern we\u2019ve got is a push by the government to change the Fair Work Act. We do not believe that this is necessary. We\u2019ve demonstrated that it is not necessary.\u201d McManus pointed to recent changes to modern awards that had been put through the Fair Work Commission over the last couple of weeks, and covered millions of workers, as an example of how measures could be reached through cooperation rather than legislation. She noted that not every award or enterprise agreement needed to change because some industries were doing well at the current time because of increased demand. McManus raised concern that in some sectors, employers might \u201cabuse\u201d or \u201ctake advantage\u201d of changes to the Fair Work Act and called on Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers to oppose such provisions. Unions are worried that some employers may take advantage of provisions allowing them to direct workers to run down their existing leave entitlements. Labor raised similar concerns last week, saying if employees were forced to exhaust their leave entitlements, the new $1,500 fortnightly payment may be transformed from a \u201cwage subsidy\u201d for employees into a \u201cbalance sheet subsidy\u201d that benefits employers. Porter said he would share drafts of the legislation with the ACTU and work through the details \u201cin a cooperative, open, frank and honest way\u201d. But he argued that failing to provide certainty through changes to the Fair Work Act could lead to additional job losses. \u201cWe will not be waiting or hoping that this change can be effected over the coming weeks or months by changing 121 awards and thousands of individual enterprise agreements,\u201d Porter said. \u201cNo matter how late we have to sit, the change will be happening next Wednesday: 6m Australian jobs depend on it.

The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre report on which the article\u2019s calculations were based is early in the Covid-19 outbreak.

      "bodyText": "An article last week (\u201cShock new figures on intensive care deaths\u201d, page 1) said the mortality rate for patients admitted to ICU with Covid-19 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland was \u201crunning at close to 50%\u201d. Calculations of case fatality rates are complex while an outbreak is ongoing and, although one method can be to divide the number of deaths by the number of deaths plus recovered patients (ie to look only at those patients for whom an outcome is known), its reliability depends on the extent to which the outcome for patients still in treatment can be assumed to be similar. The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre report on which the article\u2019s calculations were based is early in the Covid-19 outbreak. As such, given the small sample of 165 patients, which could be biased towards the most and least severe cases, it was too soon to suggest the outcome may be indicative for all those admitted to critical care. An article said that Singapore \u201crequires citizens to download an app that allows the authorities to learn of their contacts\u201d. Downloading the app is not compulsory but the government is encouraging its citizens to do so (\u201cWe must take drastic action but let\u2019s not turn into a nation of tyrants\u201d, 29 March, page 46).

      "bodyText": "Health authorities in Australia have expressed cautious optimism that Australia may be able to limit the domestic coronavirus outbreak, as the death toll reaches 34 including three more deaths linked to the Ruby Princess cruise ship. However, senior officials have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said the number of cases in Australia rose by 139 on Sunday, to a total of 5,687 cases. About 2,000 of those cases are of people who have completely recovered. \u201cThat is probably the lowest rise we\u2019ve had for a few days and it does tend to continue the trend we\u2019ve seen of flattening of the curve,\u201d Murphy said. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re increasingly confident that if people continue to adhere to what we\u2019ve been asking them to do we can prevent a situation like we\u2019ve seen in many other country of the world.\u201d However Murphy said he remained concerned about community transmission, which accounted for 10% of cases in Australia. The deputy chief medical officer, Nick Coatsworth, meanwhile said Australia appeared to be on the right path. \u201cIf we do stop these measures too early, then we have seen graphs in the media showing there could be a resurgence in cases so we have to be careful on those grounds,\u201d Coatsworth told Sky News on Sunday. Dr Jeremy McAnulty, NSW Health\u2019s director of health protection, said the rate of daily infections in that state was \u201cstabilising\u201d but it was too early to say if this trend would continue. \u201cIt is pleasing to see early signs of stabilisation, which is down to a number of important factors,\u201d McAnulty said. He attributed that stabilisation to an early detection of cases, allowing for early contact tracing and isolation of all known contacts, as well as adherence to social distancing measures. \u201cWe want to be hopeful, but not to over-egg the figures,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last few days we have seen numbers bounce around without escalating at the same level as we have seen before, so we are hopeful that we are starting to flatten the curve. But there is more work to be done and it is important that we all heed those messages.\u201d New South Wales reported 87 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total number of cases in that state to 2,580. Some 39 people with Covid-19 are in intensive care in that state, 23 of whom require ventilators. NSW has the highest rates of untraced community transmission in the country, with 380 cases recorded as having been acquired locally with no known source of infection and 58 more under investigation. About 118,863 people have tested negative to the virus . The federal government has said it will release modelling on the coronavirus outlook in Australia on Tuesday, after it is approved by the national cabinet. Modelling by the University of Sydney showed that the number of active cases in Australia, assuming continued adherence to the current social distancing laws, could peak mid-April and the spread could be controlled by July. That modelling suggested the total number of people who would contract Covid-19 in Australia over the course of the pandemic was between 8,000 and 10,000. The current number is 5,635. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said he for the first time had \u201ca little bit of optimism that we can actually beat this\u201d. \u201cThat we can take a different course than most of Europe and North America has taken,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThat we can avoid literally the millions of cases that will occur in North America and Europe and the tens of thousands of deaths that, unfortunately, will occur in those continents \u2026 It means staying the course in Australia, and the things that we\u2019ve asked people to do can make a difference, and this is the very early sign of it.\u201d Victoria recorded 20 new cases of Covid-19 overnight, bringing the total to 1,135 of which 75 were acquired through untraced community transmission. Sutton said the new cases recorded on Sunday were \u201clikely to be a mix\u201d of returned travellers and known contacts, and community acquired cases. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a greater proportion of community transmission as our international travel proportion goes down, because those individuals are smaller and smaller in number as every day goes by,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd their secondary contacts are fewer and fewer because we\u2019ve got people in hotel quarantine, therefore protecting others around them.\u201d Queensland recorded just nine new cases overnight \u2013 its smallest one day rise in weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go, but these signs are very encouraging to have only nine positive cases overnight,\u201d Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said. Palaszczuk said that more than 92% of the 907 cases confirmed to date in Queensland were either acquired overseas, or were caught from a person who had acquired the disease overseas. The Northern Territory has no confirmed cases of community transmission. It recorded 27 new cases overnight, including a child who was a close contact of a person who had travelled overseas.",

The nerdish, music snobbery of the original novel prevails; alongside jokes about Creed and soliloquies about getting rid of Michael Jackson\u2019s entire oeuvre, vintage music T-shirts are a battleground.</p> <p>A Cheap Trick tee gets ridiculed, a <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/14/miseducation-lauryn-hill\" title=\"\">Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</a></em> one becomes shorthand for Rob\u2019s co-worker\u2019s tastes and ambitions, and an accidentally destroyed vintage Joy Division T-shirt becomes a metaphor for a toxic relationship. Rob herself mixes achingly cool girl grams (cardigans, DM boots, Matrix jackets) with Wu-Tang Clan and Beastie Boys (<em>Licensed to Ill</em> era) tops. Why those bands? \u201cThey\u2019re both awesome and represent going your own way whether it\u2019s deemed cool or not,\u201d says the show\u2019s costume designer Sarah Laux.</p> <p>A vintage rock T-shirt obsessive herself (she\u2019s been collecting them for 20 years), she sees the unspoken meaning behind the T-shirt: \u201cThey show a level of commitment to the history of music,\u201d she says. \u201cRob is no different.

In the show they are used both as an expression of the characters\u2019 personalities and a narrative wink to what\u2019s going on in the plot.</p> <p>\u201cEarly on during the pilot process, we talked about Issa\u2019s style feeling nostalgic,\u201d says Ayanna James, the show\u2019s costume designer. \u201cI purchased a few vintage band tees for Issa to wear at the end of the first episode.\u201d James wanted the show to have the T-shirts articulate what Issa was going through. \u201cSpecifically during season 2, I would plug in shirts that matched Issa\u2019s mood.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People want a feeling of belonging to a movement or an era</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As well as being a fashion talking point, it\u2019s also big business. Pre-loved T-shirts from Wu-Tang or Backstreet Boys can go for \u00a3500 or more on resale sites. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of $1,500 band T-shirts out there,\u201d Laux says. She\u2019s seen a Sonic Youth T-shirt go for $2,000. \u201cPeople are interested in having items of clothing that have lived a life and that are essentially one-of-a-kind pieces.\u201d</p> <p>In 2011, HMV started making extra space for their vintage tee selection, clocking the growing nostalgia market and that music fans would pick up a T-shirt, mug and possibly badge along with the commemorative reissue of their favourite album. \u201cWe were seeing a massive increase,\u201d says chief buyer Gary Williamson. In a world lived through screens, there\u2019s more value in the \u201cnostalgia economy\u201d where the connection to the past is of a high premium. Going analogue also plays out in a physical way. \u201cI actually think that the vinyl renaissance is the older sibling of the current T-shirt trend,\u201d says James Goodhead, co-founder of <a href=\"https://unifiedgoods.com/collections/t-shirts\" title=\"\">Unified Goods</a> \u2013 a bespoke vintage T-shirt company. He says that the visual appeal of vintage T-shirts has a unique quality. \u201cThe way cotton and screen-printed graphics can age over the decades can be mesmerising \u2013 it really draws you in,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"51bd253b5a645586e87b72c280a9da5d54b1f6a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51bd253b5a645586e87b72c280a9da5d54b1f6a8/651_163_1826_2711/674.jpg\" alt=\"Unified Goods\u2019 Andy Warhol collaboration with Tate Modern T-shirt\" width=\"674\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Classic print: Unified Goods\u2019 Andy Warhol collaboration with Tate Modern</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vintage T-shirts from the 1970s and 80s feature a mix of polyester and cotton, they feel extra soft and will probably look a bit depleted due to age and having been washed lots.

      "bodyText": "In the new, rebooted TV version of High Fidelity, Nick Hornby\u2019s Rob, previously played by John Cusack, is a queer woman of colour played by Zo\u00eb Kravitz. The nerdish, music snobbery of the original novel prevails; alongside jokes about Creed and soliloquies about getting rid of Michael Jackson\u2019s entire oeuvre, vintage music T-shirts are a battleground. A Cheap Trick tee gets ridiculed, a Miseducation of Lauryn Hill one becomes shorthand for Rob\u2019s co-worker\u2019s tastes and ambitions, and an accidentally destroyed vintage Joy Division T-shirt becomes a metaphor for a toxic relationship. Rob herself mixes achingly cool girl grams (cardigans, DM boots, Matrix jackets) with Wu-Tang Clan and Beastie Boys (Licensed to Ill era) tops. Why those bands? \u201cThey\u2019re both awesome and represent going your own way whether it\u2019s deemed cool or not,\u201d says the show\u2019s costume designer Sarah Laux. A vintage rock T-shirt obsessive herself (she\u2019s been collecting them for 20 years), she sees the unspoken meaning behind the T-shirt: \u201cThey show a level of commitment to the history of music,\u201d she says. \u201cRob is no different. Having a vintage T-shirt from a classic band is like having a piece of history.\u201d Similarly on HBO\u2019s Insecure, Issa Rae\u2019s character, Issa, has an equally enviable wardrobe of vintage tees: Public Enemy, Nina Simone and Prince. In the show they are used both as an expression of the characters\u2019 personalities and a narrative wink to what\u2019s going on in the plot. \u201cEarly on during the pilot process, we talked about Issa\u2019s style feeling nostalgic,\u201d says Ayanna James, the show\u2019s costume designer. \u201cI purchased a few vintage band tees for Issa to wear at the end of the first episode.\u201d James wanted the show to have the T-shirts articulate what Issa was going through. \u201cSpecifically during season 2, I would plug in shirts that matched Issa\u2019s mood.\u201d As well as being a fashion talking point, it\u2019s also big business. Pre-loved T-shirts from Wu-Tang or Backstreet Boys can go for \u00a3500 or more on resale sites. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of $1,500 band T-shirts out there,\u201d Laux says. She\u2019s seen a Sonic Youth T-shirt go for $2,000. \u201cPeople are interested in having items of clothing that have lived a life and that are essentially one-of-a-kind pieces.\u201d In 2011, HMV started making extra space for their vintage tee selection, clocking the growing nostalgia market and that music fans would pick up a T-shirt, mug and possibly badge along with the commemorative reissue of their favourite album. \u201cWe were seeing a massive increase,\u201d says chief buyer Gary Williamson. In a world lived through screens, there\u2019s more value in the \u201cnostalgia economy\u201d where the connection to the past is of a high premium. Going analogue also plays out in a physical way. \u201cI actually think that the vinyl renaissance is the older sibling of the current T-shirt trend,\u201d says James Goodhead, co-founder of Unified Goods \u2013 a bespoke vintage T-shirt company. He says that the visual appeal of vintage T-shirts has a unique quality. \u201cThe way cotton and screen-printed graphics can age over the decades can be mesmerising \u2013 it really draws you in,\u201d he says. Vintage T-shirts from the 1970s and 80s feature a mix of polyester and cotton, they feel extra soft and will probably look a bit depleted due to age and having been washed lots. Cut to the 1990s and T-shirts were made in 100% cotton, they look a bit baggier and feel a bit more robust than their historical T-shirt cousins. \u201cThere\u2019s a new level of detail that people are really investigating,\u201d Goodhead says. Unlike other vintage fashion items, there is a place for the more \u201clived in\u201d look; little imperfections can make the garment feel filled with personality. A cracked graphic or a cigarette hole in the arm \u2013 in the case of the vintage T-shirt it can feel like this look gives it personality rather than making it feel moth-eaten and not really resellable.

      "body": "<p><strong>Flying Frenchman La Canteen, 11 Albion Road, London N16 9PS (020 7923 9828). Starters \u00a36; mains \u00a39-\u00a314; desserts \u00a36; and wines from \u00a326</strong></p> <p>It is a few days before the end of things: before the Prime Minister will tell us not to visit restaurants without telling the restaurants to close; before he bows to the inevitable and orders them to do just that. Here at the <a href=\"https://www.flyingfrenchman.com/la-canteen\" title=\"\">Flying Frenchman La Canteen</a> in north London the end seems already to have begun. This dining room overflows with appetite and greedy enthusiasm, but is less full of people. I don\u2019t yet know I am one of the last to eat here; that within a few days the chef-owner Guillaume Desmurs will be looking to repurpose his business.</p> <p>What you need to know at a time like this is what underpins such a venture. It\u2019s summed up by a conversation I have with Desmurs after my meal. One of his desserts involved a pear, poached to that point where the spoon glides gently through it without meeting resistance, on a thick chocolate chip cookie, glazed with a chocolate sauce and surrounded by whorls of whipped cream. Was it, I asked, his take on the Escoffier classic poire belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne? \u201cI dunno, mate,\u201d Desmurs said cheerfully, in a French accent mangled sweetly by 15 years in New Zealand and now London, that last word landing like a comedy mallet thud. \u201cI\u2019m not a chef. I\u2019m a cook. I don\u2019t really look at the recipes. I use my own.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c36ed754cd879bb4f3fea8bbabb403cda0336d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c36ed754cd879bb4f3fea8bbabb403cda0336d0/367_389_6022_3613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bowl of cassoulet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018White beans, a soft slab of pork belly and a mighty Toulouse sausage full of garlic, pepper and bravado\u2019: cassoulet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed he does, but it\u2019s all underpinned by the fundamentals. He is cooking from a recipe book that just happens to be in his head. Every plate is a statement of who he is and where he comes from. He makes his own rugged sausages and terrines from scratch, and serves them up in magnificent portions at magnificent prices. He has a bright red tuk-tuk van which has worked the London street food circuit for a while now.</p> <p>Five months ago he opened this small restaurant on a corner site. It\u2019s the curving ground floor of a new build, softened by lots of raw wood, bare brick and the occasional scaffolding pole. It\u2019s all a little wonky. Many of the tables appear to be knocked up from planks. It\u2019s dinner in Wallace and Gromit\u2019s shed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32f8bab3b77a2d5024528084e01bc479d63cc480\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32f8bab3b77a2d5024528084e01bc479d63cc480/479_646_5527_3316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A white bowl of French onion soup with grated cheese on top\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Ripe with soft, gently caramelised onions and a profound, nurtured stock\u2019: French onion soup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Desmurs\u2019s website carries <a href=\"https://www.flyingfrenchman.com/le-manifesto\" title=\"\">Le Manifesto</a>, in which he wears his non-genetically modified, free-range heart on his artisanally woven sleeve. He stands, apparently, for \u201cquality, sustainability, good practice and honesty\u201d. Given that the opposite \u2013 shoddiness, non-sustainable methods, bad practice and criminality \u2013 could put you off your dinner, this is something we can all get behind. The menu, which comes scribbled on a sizeable blackboard propped up next to each table in turn, tells us the antibiotic-free meat comes from Mount Grace Farm in Yorkshire and so on. Usually this sort of blather sets my teeth on edge. All kitchens should be using quality ingredients. But the Flying Frenchman does it with such a louche, easy charm, my jaw relaxes.</p> <p>There are half a dozen choices for starters and mains. The coarse pork terrine for \u00a36 comes studded with the brilliant green of pistachios in a slab the thickness of a Jackie Collins novel. It\u2019s surrounded by rings of pickled red onions and splodges of what they call a \u201ccornichon pesto\u201d, to cut through the soft, melting nuggets of pork fat. The basket of toasted sourdough is up to the job.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"828be8fe8e773cf55c157067f82e0bbeaf64b5f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/828be8fe8e773cf55c157067f82e0bbeaf64b5f4/196_348_5953_3572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A round white plate with an oblong of terrine in the middle and a scattering of pickled red onion rings around it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A masterclass in the charcutier\u2019s art\u2019: pork terrine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That terrine is a masterclass in the charcutier\u2019s art and the most straight-up of the dishes we are served. Traditionally, for example, French onion soup comes topped by a huge raft of a cro\u00fbton, under a ballast of melted cheese. It\u2019s something you have to get through before you\u2019re allowed at the liquor below, if you have any appetite left with which to push on. Here, it\u2019s broken up across the surface in a bunch of small, crisped croutons, topped with aged, grated and toasted Emmental. Usually, I think of the latter as a dull, rubbery thing; as appetising as one of Michael Gove\u2019s blushed cheeks. Here it has heft, as does the soup, which is ripe with soft, gently caramelised onions and a profound, nurtured stock.</p> <p>Desmurs\u2019s version of cassoulet is an assembly, rather than a set of ingredients that have lounged around in each other\u2019s company for the best part of a day, but they\u2019re still very good friends. There are white beans, with more bite than is usual for a long-cooked stew, a soft slab of fat-striated pork belly, duck confit slipping casually from the bone and a mighty Toulouse sausage full of garlic, pepper and bravado. All of this sits in a winningly insistent broth. It\u2019s both comforting and a significant amount of food for \u00a313.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1347518bac7808235cbb7c756f8d66308a8c685c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1347518bac7808235cbb7c756f8d66308a8c685c/121_421_6087_3652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A round terracotta dish of shepherd's pie on a round white plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The edible equivalent of a pair of Uggs\u2019: merguez shepherd\u2019s pie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We share this, alongside the bold, culinary mashup (literally) that is the merguez shepherd\u2019s pie: pieces of his honking merguez, punchy with cumin, lie under a blanket of soft, whipped mash into which melted cheese appears to have gene-spliced itself. It\u2019s the edible equivalent of a pair of Uggs: not a looker, but definitely built for comfort. (And yes, a shepherd\u2019s pie can be made with beef; just ask the food historian Dr <a href=\"http://www.anniegray.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Annie Gray</a>.)</p> <p>Alongside the poached pear, there\u2019s a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, because not to have one at a restaurant like this would be an arrestable offence. The grilling is a little uneven, so that the custard has slackened at the edges, but it is still a crisp sugared surface over a set cream and if that doesn\u2019t make you nod approvingly, you have no business reading this column. There is also a cheerily tart fontainebleau with a sweetened set yogurt under a raspberry coulis. The single waiter and occasionally Desmurs himself, playing rush goalie from the semi-open kitchen, deliver all these dishes with a charming casualness. In truth, he could have called the place the Laidback Frenchman, but I can see that doesn\u2019t quite have the same ring about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc40921c098aa2fc184118d09efa0d7f19342f5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc40921c098aa2fc184118d09efa0d7f19342f5b/131_395_6134_3681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A round terracotta pot of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e on a round white plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Crisp sugared surface\u2019: cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few days after my dinner, with the restaurant world moving from despair to survival mode, I get an email from Desmurs. He will, like so many others, move to a delivery model: roast honey duck leg with confit red cabbage; Toulouse sausages with butter beans; ratatouille pie. Think \u00a38 for a dish, plus a small delivery charge. \u201cI don\u2019t really believe this could cover the operating costs, because we are not known enough yet,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut by nature I fight back, I never give up.\u201d Please order his food if you live nearby. Indeed, support as many of your locals as you can. From next week this will be a rather different sort of restaurant column.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>More serious French action: the marvellous Otto\u2019s on London\u2019s Gray\u2019s Inn Road, famed for its canard \u00e0 la presse among many other things, has repurposed itself to cook meals for delivery to NHS staff at St Thomas\u2019s Hospital. But to make this happen they need financial support. To donate, visit <a href=\"http://ottos-restaurant.com/\">ottos-restaurant.com</a></p> <p>There are obviously a lot of people in the restaurant business in need of work right now. Harri, the recruitment website that works across the hospitality sector, has launched a not-for-profit web portal to help those people find jobs across retail, delivery and the care sector. Jobs are currently being offered nationwide at a variety of employers including Morrisons, Waitrose and Just Eat. Visit <a href=\"http://harri.com/hospitalityunite\">harri.com/hospitalityunite</a></p> <p>Many businesses have set up delivery models at great speed. The issue has been finding a clear list of what is happening, where. Londoners now have access to Dishpatch, a detailed and growing list of restaurants, one-time restaurant suppliers now looking for a new outlet, and retailers all offering to deliver within the capital. Included on the site so far are the likes of Pale Green Dot, fresh produce supplier to the catering business, butchers Turner and George, and Spanish produce group Brindisa (<a href=\"http://dishpatch.co.uk/\">dishpatch.co.uk</a>).</p> <p><em>Email Jay at <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Flying Frenchman La Canteen, 11 Albion Road, London N16 9PS (020 7923 9828). Starters \u00a36; mains \u00a39-\u00a314; desserts \u00a36; and wines from \u00a326 It is a few days before the end of things: before the Prime Minister will tell us not to visit restaurants without telling the restaurants to close; before he bows to the inevitable and orders them to do just that. Here at the Flying Frenchman La Canteen in north London the end seems already to have begun. This dining room overflows with appetite and greedy enthusiasm, but is less full of people. I don\u2019t yet know I am one of the last to eat here; that within a few days the chef-owner Guillaume Desmurs will be looking to repurpose his business. What you need to know at a time like this is what underpins such a venture. It\u2019s summed up by a conversation I have with Desmurs after my meal. One of his desserts involved a pear, poached to that point where the spoon glides gently through it without meeting resistance, on a thick chocolate chip cookie, glazed with a chocolate sauce and surrounded by whorls of whipped cream. Was it, I asked, his take on the Escoffier classic poire belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne? \u201cI dunno, mate,\u201d Desmurs said cheerfully, in a French accent mangled sweetly by 15 years in New Zealand and now London, that last word landing like a comedy mallet thud. \u201cI\u2019m not a chef. I\u2019m a cook. I don\u2019t really look at the recipes. I use my own.\u201d Indeed he does, but it\u2019s all underpinned by the fundamentals. He is cooking from a recipe book that just happens to be in his head. Every plate is a statement of who he is and where he comes from. He makes his own rugged sausages and terrines from scratch, and serves them up in magnificent portions at magnificent prices. He has a bright red tuk-tuk van which has worked the London street food circuit for a while now. Five months ago he opened this small restaurant on a corner site. It\u2019s the curving ground floor of a new build, softened by lots of raw wood, bare brick and the occasional scaffolding pole. It\u2019s all a little wonky. Many of the tables appear to be knocked up from planks. It\u2019s dinner in Wallace and Gromit\u2019s shed. Desmurs\u2019s website carries Le Manifesto, in which he wears his non-genetically modified, free-range heart on his artisanally woven sleeve. He stands, apparently, for \u201cquality, sustainability, good practice and honesty\u201d. Given that the opposite \u2013 shoddiness, non-sustainable methods, bad practice and criminality \u2013 could put you off your dinner, this is something we can all get behind. The menu, which comes scribbled on a sizeable blackboard propped up next to each table in turn, tells us the antibiotic-free meat comes from Mount Grace Farm in Yorkshire and so on. Usually this sort of blather sets my teeth on edge. All kitchens should be using quality ingredients. But the Flying Frenchman does it with such a louche, easy charm, my jaw relaxes. There are half a dozen choices for starters and mains. The coarse pork terrine for \u00a36 comes studded with the brilliant green of pistachios in a slab the thickness of a Jackie Collins novel. It\u2019s surrounded by rings of pickled red onions and splodges of what they call a \u201ccornichon pesto\u201d, to cut through the soft, melting nuggets of pork fat. The basket of toasted sourdough is up to the job. That terrine is a masterclass in the charcutier\u2019s art and the most straight-up of the dishes we are served. Traditionally, for example, French onion soup comes topped by a huge raft of a cro\u00fbton, under a ballast of melted cheese. It\u2019s something you have to get through before you\u2019re allowed at the liquor below, if you have any appetite left with which to push on. Here, it\u2019s broken up across the surface in a bunch of small, crisped croutons, topped with aged, grated and toasted Emmental. Usually, I think of the latter as a dull, rubbery thing; as appetising as one of Michael Gove\u2019s blushed cheeks. Here it has heft, as does the soup, which is ripe with soft, gently caramelised onions and a profound, nurtured stock. Desmurs\u2019s version of cassoulet is an assembly, rather than a set of ingredients that have lounged around in each other\u2019s company for the best part of a day, but they\u2019re still very good friends. There are white beans, with more bite than is usual for a long-cooked stew, a soft slab of fat-striated pork belly, duck confit slipping casually from the bone and a mighty Toulouse sausage full of garlic, pepper and bravado. All of this sits in a winningly insistent broth. It\u2019s both comforting and a significant amount of food for \u00a313. We share this, alongside the bold, culinary mashup (literally) that is the merguez shepherd\u2019s pie: pieces of his honking merguez, punchy with cumin, lie under a blanket of soft, whipped mash into which melted cheese appears to have gene-spliced itself. It\u2019s the edible equivalent of a pair of Uggs: not a looker, but definitely built for comfort. (And yes, a shepherd\u2019s pie can be made with beef; just ask the food historian Dr Annie Gray.) Alongside the poached pear, there\u2019s a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, because not to have one at a restaurant like this would be an arrestable offence. The grilling is a little uneven, so that the custard has slackened at the edges, but it is still a crisp sugared surface over a set cream and if that doesn\u2019t make you nod approvingly, you have no business reading this column. There is also a cheerily tart fontainebleau with a sweetened set yogurt under a raspberry coulis. The single waiter and occasionally Desmurs himself, playing rush goalie from the semi-open kitchen, deliver all these dishes with a charming casualness. In truth, he could have called the place the Laidback Frenchman, but I can see that doesn\u2019t quite have the same ring about it. A few days after my dinner, with the restaurant world moving from despair to survival mode, I get an email from Desmurs. He will, like so many others, move to a delivery model: roast honey duck leg with confit red cabbage; Toulouse sausages with butter beans; ratatouille pie. Think \u00a38 for a dish, plus a small delivery charge. \u201cI don\u2019t really believe this could cover the operating costs, because we are not known enough yet,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut by nature I fight back, I never give up.\u201d Please order his food if you live nearby. Indeed, support as many of your locals as you can. From next week this will be a rather different sort of restaurant column. News bites More serious French action: the marvellous Otto\u2019s on London\u2019s Gray\u2019s Inn Road, famed for its canard \u00e0 la presse among many other things, has repurposed itself to cook meals for delivery to NHS staff at St Thomas\u2019s Hospital. But to make this happen they need financial support. To donate, visit ottos-restaurant.com There are obviously a lot of people in the restaurant business in need of work right now. Harri, the recruitment website that works across the hospitality sector, has launched a not-for-profit web portal to help those people find jobs across retail, delivery and the care sector. Jobs are currently being offered nationwide at a variety of employers including Morrisons, Waitrose and Just Eat. Visit harri.com/hospitalityunite Many businesses have set up delivery models at great speed. The issue has been finding a clear list of what is happening, where. Londoners now have access to Dishpatch, a detailed and growing list of restaurants, one-time restaurant suppliers now looking for a new outlet, and retailers all offering to deliver within the capital. Included on the site so far are the likes of Pale Green Dot, fresh produce supplier to the catering business, butchers Turner and George, and Spanish produce group Brindisa (dishpatch.co.uk).

The death toll could be horrific,\u201d the ICG said last week.</p> <p>The potential economic impact on the developing world is also a matter of huge concern. Low- and middle-income countries have already been hurt by falling export demand, lower oil prices and a collapse in tourism.

Lasting, possibly permanent pandemic-related damage increases the risk of social disorder and state violence, as seen in South Africa.</p> <p>The incidence of Covid-19 in large swaths of Africa, south Asia and Latin America remains limited for now. But there is every reason to believe a virus that has ravaged and humbled the world\u2019s two biggest economies - the US and China - will eventually spread infection to all corners of the globe.</p> <p>It is not entirely true to say there is nothing we can do but watch. Governments and individuals should support the UN and its agencies; boost foreign aid budgets; donate to international charities; share expertise; offer refuge and succour; and, wherever possible, provide vital medical equipment \u2013 all this and more can and must be done. Covid-19 is a universal nightmare, a truly global crisis. All its victims without exception deserve help, wherever they live. If efforts to control the virus in the developing world fail, the human toll could be indescribable. And the disease could become endemic, repeatedly rebounding and recycling through migration, human contacts and second- or third-wave pandemics. It does not bear thinking about.</p>",

If the disease takes hold there, the World Food Programme says, vital humanitarian supply chains in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger could be further disrupted at a time when millions already face summer food shortages caused by drought and jihadist violence. From war-scarred Afghanistan to the impoverished Central African Republic, where the Norwegian Refugee Council says there are three ventilators for five million people, fear of imminent disaster is compounded by a chronic lack of resources. And any responses to Covid-19 will be further hampered by unresolved political and security issues left to fester for years. Gaza is a case in point. Two million Palestinians are crammed into an area of 365 sq km. According to the International Crisis Group, cases of coronavirus have been identified. Now Gaza is preparing for the worst. \u201cA major outbreak would swiftly overwhelm Gaza\u2019s healthcare system, which has been devastated by years of war and Israeli blockade. The death toll could be horrific,\u201d the ICG said last week. The potential economic impact on the developing world is also a matter of huge concern. Low- and middle-income countries have already been hurt by falling export demand, lower oil prices and a collapse in tourism. Nearly 80 governments have asked for emergency IMF funding, with one estimate suggesting a total bailout of at least \u00a32tn may be necessary. The resilience of vulnerable states suffering anticipated shocks of such unprecedented social and economic severity is greatly limited when compared, for example, with wealthier nations such as Britain that can call on unlimited borrowing. Lasting, possibly permanent pandemic-related damage increases the risk of social disorder and state violence, as seen in South Africa. The incidence of Covid-19 in large swaths of Africa, south Asia and Latin America remains limited for now. But there is every reason to believe a virus that has ravaged and humbled the world\u2019s two biggest economies - the US and China - will eventually spread infection to all corners of the globe. It is not entirely true to say there is nothing we can do but watch. Governments and individuals should support the UN and its agencies; boost foreign aid budgets; donate to international charities; share expertise; offer refuge and succour; and, wherever possible, provide vital medical equipment \u2013 all this and more can and must be done. Covid-19 is a universal nightmare, a truly global crisis. All its victims without exception deserve help, wherever they live. If efforts to control the virus in the developing world fail, the human toll could be indescribable. And the disease could become endemic, repeatedly rebounding and recycling through migration, human contacts and second- or third-wave pandemics. It does not bear thinking about.",

As part of the real estate mogul\u2019s perpetual circus, he granted Karl an interview about Michael Jackson\u2019s honeymoon in Trump Tower. Meditate on that.</p> <p>Now Karl has written a book. It is an attempt to capture the madness that is the Trump presidency and the danger to democracy it poses. Aided by measured prose and healthy skepticism, Karl succeeds.</p> <p>Well-organized and respectfully written before the pandemic, Front Row at the Trump Show conveys the chaos and the characters that inhabit the president\u2019s universe.</p> <p>Also on display are Trump\u2019s preternatural disregard for the truth \u2013 \u201cTrump was a serial exaggerator long before he ran for president\u201d \u2013 and his curious soft spot for the Confederacy, the losing and slave-holding side in the American civil war.</p> <p>Front Row tells of a previously unreported White House meeting in the aftermath of the infamous 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/23/charlottesville-white-supremacist-james-alex-fields-heather-heyer\">the murder</a> of counter-protester Heather Heyer. Trump heaped hosannas on Robert E Lee, the defeated Confederate general, expressed sympathy for white nationalist grievance and compared himself to Abraham Lincoln.</p> <p>Relying on three sources and contemporaneous notes taken by one participant, Karl writes that Trump told the meeting the Charlottesville protesters were unfairly treated and most had \u201cgood\u201d intentions, driven to the streets by opposition to the removal of a statue of Lee. The infamous tiki torch parade \u2013 and its chants of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/charlottesville-neo-nazis-vice-news-hbo\">Jews will not replace us</a>\u201d \u2013 never really registered on his radar.</p> <p>Instead, sitting at a conference table first used by Ulysses Grant, the Union general who won the war and became the 18th president, Trump opined that Lee was \u201cthe greatest strategic military mind perhaps ever\u201d and also praised Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, another Confederate general.</p> <p>Karl also delivers his take on the White House staff. It is generally damning.</p> <p>Sean Spicer, for example, never had any business working near the Oval Office. In Karl\u2019s telling, the first Trump press secretary\u2019s rage was not limited to the briefing room podium.<strong> </strong>In a pique, Spicer slammed his office door on Karl and his daughter. He later apologized.</p> <p>Sarah Sanders, the president\u2019s second press secretary, possessed a similar affection for \u201calternative facts\u201d. She fabricated a tale about non-existent disdain within the FBI toward James Comey, which the special counsel\u2019s report <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Muelller-Report-Redacted-Vol-II-Released-04.18.2019-Word-Searchable.-Reduced-Size.pdf\">examined in detail</a>.</p> <p>And then there is Anthony Scaramucci, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/26/reel-history-lady-jane-grey\">Lady Jane Grey</a> of White House communications directors. Karl presents Scaramucci drawing a phallic-shaped organization chart with him on top. In Karl\u2019s words: \u201cScaramucci\u2019s diagram looked like a penis. Not a propitious start for the new communications director.\u201d</p> <p>Those in attendance \u201cstruggled to keep from laughing\u201d. Scaramucci lasted 10 days. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/03/anthony-scaramucci-post-media-company\">Maybe 11</a>.</p> <p>Karl expresses sympathy for Trump over leaked conversations with foreign leaders but reminds the president his anger should be aimed at his staff, not the press. Likewise, Karl raps Jim Acosta of CNN for his confrontational style. In Karl\u2019s view the media should not be the story.</p> <p>Parenthetically, Karl worked at CNN before joining ABC. But Karl is also the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association and in that role he vigorously supported Acosta in the face of White House attempts to strip his press pass.</p> <p>Underscoring the senselessness of Trump\u2019s efforts, Karl reminds us that immediately after Acosta\u2019s credentials were restored, Trump called on him. It\u2019s not that bygones were bygones. Rather, the president can\u2019t live without a sparring partner.</p> <p>In the Age of Trump, being a reporter means having a target on your back. Karl describes <a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/journalist-recounts-the-moment-in-the-2016-campaign-where-trump-took-a-dark-turn/\">Trump\u2019s attempts to use the media as a foil and the resultant danger</a>.</p> <p>Angered by Karl during a pre-rally interview in November 2015, Trump stormed out and unleashed an obscenity-laced tirade. As a coda, the candidate enlisted the live audience by name-checking ABC, though not Karl himself.</p> <p>\u201cWe were the villains,\u201d writes Karl. \u201cHis crowds loved the attacks on the press, and he was about to give them more of what they wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Trump continued to pour gasoline on the fire, labeling the press the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d, a phrase embraced by dictators and tyrants. Karl fears \u201cTrump\u2019s war on truth may do lasting damage to American democracy\u201d.</p> <p>And this was before a global pandemic and the real possibility of economic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/1245675889884626945\">depression</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f2004491b13ab002851e1ad21a8a112b8cdfd47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f2004491b13ab002851e1ad21a8a112b8cdfd47/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A White House aide attempts to take the microphone from Yamiche Alcindor of PBS as she questions Trump in the Rose Garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A White House aide attempts to take the microphone from Yamiche Alcindor of PBS as she questions Trump in the Rose Garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefani Reynolds/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The US leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases, its death toll has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest\">exploded</a> at a rate surpassing that of Italy.

It is an attempt to capture the madness that is the Trump presidency and the danger to democracy it poses. Aided by measured prose and healthy skepticism, Karl succeeds. Well-organized and respectfully written before the pandemic, Front Row at the Trump Show conveys the chaos and the characters that inhabit the president\u2019s universe. Also on display are Trump\u2019s preternatural disregard for the truth \u2013 \u201cTrump was a serial exaggerator long before he ran for president\u201d \u2013 and his curious soft spot for the Confederacy, the losing and slave-holding side in the American civil war. Front Row tells of a previously unreported White House meeting in the aftermath of the infamous 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the murder of counter-protester Heather Heyer. Trump heaped hosannas on Robert E Lee, the defeated Confederate general, expressed sympathy for white nationalist grievance and compared himself to Abraham Lincoln. Relying on three sources and contemporaneous notes taken by one participant, Karl writes that Trump told the meeting the Charlottesville protesters were unfairly treated and most had \u201cgood\u201d intentions, driven to the streets by opposition to the removal of a statue of Lee. The infamous tiki torch parade \u2013 and its chants of \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d \u2013 never really registered on his radar. Instead, sitting at a conference table first used by Ulysses Grant, the Union general who won the war and became the 18th president, Trump opined that Lee was \u201cthe greatest strategic military mind perhaps ever\u201d and also praised Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, another Confederate general. Karl also delivers his take on the White House staff. It is generally damning. Sean Spicer, for example, never had any business working near the Oval Office. In Karl\u2019s telling, the first Trump press secretary\u2019s rage was not limited to the briefing room podium. In a pique, Spicer slammed his office door on Karl and his daughter. He later apologized. Sarah Sanders, the president\u2019s second press secretary, possessed a similar affection for \u201calternative facts\u201d. She fabricated a tale about non-existent disdain within the FBI toward James Comey, which the special counsel\u2019s report examined in detail. And then there is Anthony Scaramucci, the Lady Jane Grey of White House communications directors. Karl presents Scaramucci drawing a phallic-shaped organization chart with him on top. In Karl\u2019s words: \u201cScaramucci\u2019s diagram looked like a penis. Not a propitious start for the new communications director.\u201d Those in attendance \u201cstruggled to keep from laughing\u201d. Scaramucci lasted 10 days. Maybe 11. Karl expresses sympathy for Trump over leaked conversations with foreign leaders but reminds the president his anger should be aimed at his staff, not the press. Likewise, Karl raps Jim Acosta of CNN for his confrontational style. In Karl\u2019s view the media should not be the story. Parenthetically, Karl worked at CNN before joining ABC. But Karl is also the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association and in that role he vigorously supported Acosta in the face of White House attempts to strip his press pass. Underscoring the senselessness of Trump\u2019s efforts, Karl reminds us that immediately after Acosta\u2019s credentials were restored, Trump called on him. It\u2019s not that bygones were bygones. Rather, the president can\u2019t live without a sparring partner. In the Age of Trump, being a reporter means having a target on your back. Karl describes Trump\u2019s attempts to use the media as a foil and the resultant danger. Angered by Karl during a pre-rally interview in November 2015, Trump stormed out and unleashed an obscenity-laced tirade. As a coda, the candidate enlisted the live audience by name-checking ABC, though not Karl himself. \u201cWe were the villains,\u201d writes Karl. \u201cHis crowds loved the attacks on the press, and he was about to give them more of what they wanted.\u201d Trump continued to pour gasoline on the fire, labeling the press the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d, a phrase embraced by dictators and tyrants. Karl fears \u201cTrump\u2019s war on truth may do lasting damage to American democracy\u201d. And this was before a global pandemic and the real possibility of economic depression. The US leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases, its death toll has exploded at a rate surpassing that of Italy. Unemployment has rocketed. In only two weeks, 10m jobs have been shed. They are not coming back anytime soon. Not exactly Maga. This is American carnage. Yet Trump\u2019s self-reverence remains. The president has proclaimed that he alone can save the nation. The press must ignore his lethal neglect. Likewise, Trump expects us to forget that his administration undermined our national response and dithered over providing essential equipment to hospitals. To top it off, Trump denies personal responsibility. In Gladiator, Ridley Scott\u2019s Oscar-winning movie about ancient Rome, Gracchus, a senator, posits that the Emperor Commodus will offer the people bread and circuses even as he tramples on their lives and freedom. \u201cHe will give them death,\u201d Gracchus says. \u201cAnd they will love him for it.\u201d These days, the sun is setting later. But darkness will be casting its broad shadow earlier. The president trails Joe Biden in trial heats but his poll numbers have risen. The election is seven months away: plenty of time for the president to rule and ruin. Karl\u2019s trepidation is not misplaced.",

The end result is the criminalisation of most relationships between Kiwis who don\u2019t live together. New Zealand police have been contacted for comment on how they intend to enforce the ban. At a briefing on Sunday afternoon, Ardern praised those who had complied with the lockdown but said there were \u201cstill some people I would charitably describe as idiots\u201d, citing a man in Christchurch who filmed himself coughing on people. Ardern said no decisions had been made about extending the country\u2019s four-week lockdown, but there were signs that it was having an effect. Modelling had suggested that without the restrictions the country would have seen 4,000 cases by this weekend, instead of the 1,000 it had actually recorded, Ardern said. And while she didn\u2019t want to \u201cdraw too many conclusions\u201d, New Zealand had not seen the exponential growth experienced by other countries. \u201cGoing hard and going early appears to be paying off for us,\u201d she said. \u201cNo decisions have been made at the point at which we will be exiting level four. The more people comply, the more likely we can come out of [lockdown] at the time we\u2019ve said. Be proud of your efforts that you have all made. It is making a difference. Now is the time though to remain focused, to not let up,\u201d she said. Over Friday and Saturday, Ardern said police had carried out 795 prevention patrols and 990 reassurance checks at essential services. Google data showed that New Zealanders had taken the lockdown seriously, Ardern said, with retail and recreational movements down 91%, visits to essential services down 50%, and trips to parks down 80%. By closing borders 25 days after the first case, New Zealand had acted much quicker than other countries, she said, and the government\u2019s first economic rescue package was similarly swift. Witnessing the trajectories overseas had helped the government to decide to \u201cgo hard and go early\u201d, Ardern said. AAP contributed to this report",
