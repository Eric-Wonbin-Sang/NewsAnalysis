The second thing was salivating at the sights of the bakeries packed with fresh baguettes, pastries and desserts (almost) too perfect to eat. Soon added to the favourite bakery list is L\u2019Atelier Gourmand, in beachside Anse Vata. A quick queue and it\u2019s time to pick the treat of the day - a buttery croissant at breakfast, fresh baguettes for lunch, or a mouth-watering dessert (the cream filled choux pastries are best bought by the box). New Caledonia may be laid back, but it retains a fair bit of French influence \u2013 lunch is strictly at midday, and it is not a meal the locals miss. Banks close, shops shut, and roads will bustle as workers and students head home for a meal, or to their local \u2018snack\u2019 \u2013 a restaurant serving up anything from tuna tartare to steak frites. Even beachgoers dutifully set out their picnic when the clock strikes 12. It\u2019s easy to get into the rhythm here \u2013 New Caledonians rise early, and head to work early. But that also means knocking off work early, with enough time for a snorkel at Baie des Citrons, or a walk around the stunning Promenade Pierre Vernier \u2013 a local favourite \u2013 and still have enough time to sneak in a sunset cocktail. There\u2019s no shortage of vantage points to spot a good sunset here, but the beach-side cocktails MV Lounge are hard to beat. Bodega\u2019s another favourite \u2013 sitting out over the water it\u2019s the perfect spot to graze on tapas, take in some live music, and watch the sea cucumbers and stingrays below \u2013 or a dugong, if lucky.

      "body": "<p>On one of the several tumultuous days at this Australian Open, Chris Evert, perhaps the most perceptive of the former champions with access to a TV microphone, said: \u201cCoco has arrived. We need that shot in the arm and we need some new blood in the women\u2019s game.\u201d</p> <p>The American, who won 18 of her 34 grand slam singles finals, was talking about her 15-year-old compatriot, Coco Gauff, who had already put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/20/coco-gauff-beats-venus-williams-again-in-stunning-australian-open-debut\" title=\"\">Venus Williams out of a slam in the first round</a> for the second time in seven months, and had then beaten <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/24/coco-gauff-shocks-naomi-osaka-reach-last-16-australian-open-tennis\" title=\"\">the defending champion, Naomi Osaka</a>.

The 21-year-old American, seeded 14th, might have reckoned there would be more noise attending her own progress, as she worked her way into the fourth round past two qualifiers and the unseeded Shuai Zhang without dropping a set.</p> <p>There she looked across the net at Gauff, the player nearly everyone wanted to embrace as the next big prospect, an articulate and thoughtful teenager, respectful of her peers and the history of the game, and owner of a game that combined exquisite touch and growing power.</p> <p>Kenin, it was said, lacked pop on her serve, especially if her first effort did not land, and her volleying needed work. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/26/coco-gauffs-fairytale-run-ended-by-sofia-kenin\" title=\"\">she beat Gauff</a>, whom she likes, in three sets, the last without conceding a game. She found a way. Now they began to talk about the daughter of impoverished immigrants, about her father and coach, Alex, who had arrived in the United States from Russia with just $300 in his pocket, three months after she was born, and occupied the front row of her players\u2019 box all fortnight like some knowing old party apparatchik.</p> <p>Now Sofia \u2013 or Sonia, as he calls her \u2013 was going to pay him back, big time. In the quarters, she beat the unheralded Tunisian, Ons Jabeur, who had done some giant-killing of her own in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/21/johanna-konta-bundled-out-of-australian-open-by-ons-jabeur\" title=\"\">beating Johanna Konta</a>, the two Carolines \u2013 Garcia and Wozniacki \u2013 and the 27th seed, Wang Qiang.

She is moving comfortably in space occupied by Gauff, Osaka, Barty, Bianca Andreescu and Simona Halep. She is a threat to all of them.</p> <p>Evert said on ESPN: \u201cWe saw it in her semi-final against Ash Barty, the same thing. When she was in trouble, when her back was against the wall, she came up with these shots. Champions do that and she has it. It is innate and I think a lot of it is just the hunger to win.

      "bodyText": "On one of the several tumultuous days at this Australian Open, Chris Evert, perhaps the most perceptive of the former champions with access to a TV microphone, said: \u201cCoco has arrived. We need that shot in the arm and we need some new blood in the women\u2019s game.\u201d The American, who won 18 of her 34 grand slam singles finals, was talking about her 15-year-old compatriot, Coco Gauff, who had already put Venus Williams out of a slam in the first round for the second time in seven months, and had then beaten the defending champion, Naomi Osaka. Tennis was ready to crown its new princess. Sofia Kenin was not quite so ready. The 21-year-old American, seeded 14th, might have reckoned there would be more noise attending her own progress, as she worked her way into the fourth round past two qualifiers and the unseeded Shuai Zhang without dropping a set. There she looked across the net at Gauff, the player nearly everyone wanted to embrace as the next big prospect, an articulate and thoughtful teenager, respectful of her peers and the history of the game, and owner of a game that combined exquisite touch and growing power. Kenin, it was said, lacked pop on her serve, especially if her first effort did not land, and her volleying needed work. But she beat Gauff, whom she likes, in three sets, the last without conceding a game. She found a way. Now they began to talk about the daughter of impoverished immigrants, about her father and coach, Alex, who had arrived in the United States from Russia with just $300 in his pocket, three months after she was born, and occupied the front row of her players\u2019 box all fortnight like some knowing old party apparatchik. Now Sofia \u2013 or Sonia, as he calls her \u2013 was going to pay him back, big time. In the quarters, she beat the unheralded Tunisian, Ons Jabeur, who had done some giant-killing of her own in beating Johanna Konta, the two Carolines \u2013 Garcia and Wozniacki \u2013 and the 27th seed, Wang Qiang. She fell to Kenin in straight sets. As did the world No 1 and home favourite, Ashleigh Barty. The clamour for the American with no discernibly big weapons but a huge fighting spirit began to grow. On Saturday, it appeared her run to glory, in her first slam final, might shudder to a halt when Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza, the double-slam champion, won the first set. Yet again, Kenin found a way. In just over two hours on Rod Laver Arena she ground down the experienced Spaniard 4-6, 6-2, 6-2. Evert, who has known Kenin since she was six and watched her grow up in Florida, a shy but determined young player, said: \u201cSofia has been undervalued and she has been overshadowed by a lot of the American power players. But now America knows her and what she has. They know she is a champion.\u201d She is also the new American No 1 \u2013 eclipsing Serena Williams \u2013 and the world No 7. She is moving comfortably in space occupied by Gauff, Osaka, Barty, Bianca Andreescu and Simona Halep. She is a threat to all of them. Evert said on ESPN: \u201cWe saw it in her semi-final against Ash Barty, the same thing. When she was in trouble, when her back was against the wall, she came up with these shots. Champions do that and she has it. It is innate and I think a lot of it is just the hunger to win. It wasn\u2019t about the power. It was how she hit the corners and her choice of shots. And her variety of shot, her drop shots. She served really well. She can still improve. She can still volley [better]. She can still improve that serve. A little bit of fitness. She is going to keep going up in the rankings.\u201d Kenin, who beat Serena Williams in the third round of the 2019 French Open and has twice reached round two at Wimbledon, will look towards Europe when the dust settles. \u201cWimbledon is such a tradition,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really feel it there. I love coming back, I love the people; the crowd is so fun.\u201d She appreciated that her parents struggled in Russia. \u201cMy dad has told me that it was a tough time for them. They didn\u2019t have that much when they came to the States. They wanted to give me the American dream. I am really thankful. Without them, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. \u201cSome people didn\u2019t really believe in me. They turned me down and said I wouldn\u2019t make it or I was too small. We never took that seriously. I had a goal, I had a dream and we achieved it. \u201cA lot of youngsters are coming up and winning grand slams. I think it\u2019s great for women\u2019s tennis.

He has begun to make a corresponding impact on the race and the polls.</p> <p>He is not competing in Iowa, which votes on Monday, or New Hampshire which follows.

Bloomberg has not divested from his businesses and questions about how his media company will cover his campaign have swirled from the off.</p> <p>\u201cThey are all working together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn fact, Bloomberg isn\u2019t covering himself (too boring to do), or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! It\u2019s all the Fake News Media, and that\u2019s why nobody believes in them any more.\u201d</p> <p>After Bloomberg declared his White House run, the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/25/michael-bloomberg-news-service-investigate-backlash\">said the company would not investigate Bloomberg or any other Democrat</a> but would still investigate Trump. The decision met with widespread criticism.</p> <p>Trump also said: \u201cMany of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere, just wasting his money.\u201d</p> <p>The former mayor clapped back, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeBloomberg/status/1223976701086126081\">tweeting</a>: \u201cLooks like our ads are keeping you up at night. We\u2019ve got one in particular you should watch today.\u201d</p> <p>That was a reference to an ad that will run during the Super Bowl, focusing on Bloomberg\u2019s push for gun safety reform.

      "bodyText": "Michael Bloomberg traded insults with Donald Trump on Sunday, calling the president \u201ca pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan\u201d. The comment, made through the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s press secretary, came in response to abusive tweets and remarks the president made in a Super Bowl interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity. In a quickfire section of the interview, Trump was asked what he thought of when he heard the names of various political rivals. \u201cVery little,\u201d he said of Bloomberg. \u201cI just think of little.\u201d Bloomberg, 77, is 5ft 8in tall. Trump, 73, is 6ft 3in. Trump then repeated an evidence-free claim, also made on Twitter earlier, about Bloomberg demanding special treatment in the Democratic presidential primary because of his height. \u201cNow he wants a box for the debates to stand on. OK, it\u2019s OK, there\u2019s nothing wrong, you can be short. Why he should he get a box to stand on, OK? He wants a box for the debates. Why should he be entitled to that, really? Does that mean everyone else gets a box?\u201d The president also said he would \u201clove to run against Bloomberg. I would love it.\u201d Bloomberg told reporters in Los Angeles he would \u201cstand twice as tall as he does on the stage that matters\u201d and said Trump \u201cknows that I can beat him\u201d . An undignified exchange with Trump can be a sign of a candidate gaining credibility, at least with a president notoriously prone to lash out under pressure. Since declaring his run for the Democratic nomination in late November, Bloomberg has spent liberally on advertising and campaign infrastructure. He has begun to make a corresponding impact on the race and the polls. He is not competing in Iowa, which votes on Monday, or New Hampshire which follows. But he is now fourth in the realclearpolitics.com national polling average and this week the Democratic National Committee (DNC) changed debate qualification rules which had kept his self-financed campaign out of the TV spotlight. As a result, Bloomberg looks set to appear in the first debate under the new rules, in Nevada on 19 February. Trump broadened his attack on Twitter. \u201cMini Mike is part of the Fake News,\u201d the president wrote early on Sunday, using his nickname for the owner of Bloomberg News. Trump regularly complains about mainstream coverage of his administration. Bloomberg has not divested from his businesses and questions about how his media company will cover his campaign have swirled from the off. \u201cThey are all working together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn fact, Bloomberg isn\u2019t covering himself (too boring to do), or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! It\u2019s all the Fake News Media, and that\u2019s why nobody believes in them any more.\u201d After Bloomberg declared his White House run, the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News said the company would not investigate Bloomberg or any other Democrat but would still investigate Trump. The decision met with widespread criticism. Trump also said: \u201cMany of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere, just wasting his money.\u201d The former mayor clapped back, tweeting: \u201cLooks like our ads are keeping you up at night. We\u2019ve got one in particular you should watch today.\u201d That was a reference to an ad that will run during the Super Bowl, focusing on Bloomberg\u2019s push for gun safety reform. Trump will also run an ad during the game, which attracts a massive TV audience. Trump also claimed Bloomberg was \u201cgetting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie [Sanders], something they wouldn\u2019t do for \u2026 others. They are doing it to Bernie again, 2016.\u201d Sanders challenged Hillary Clinton unexpectedly strongly four years ago, in many eyes damaging her before her defeat by Trump. Many Sanders supporters claimed the primary was rigged. The issue raised its head again this week when Politico reported that \u201ca small group of DNC members has privately begun gauging support for a plan to potentially weaken Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign\u201d. Many party figures question the desirability of a Sanders nomination, in part because the Vermont senator is not a registered Democrat, a point which can rebound on Bloomberg given he switched from Democrat to Republican to run for mayor in New York. Bloomberg\u2019s national press secretary, Julie Wood, issued the insulting response to Trump\u2019s tweets. The candidate himself told reporters: \u201cThe president lies, he lies about everything, so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that he said things like that. \u201cI will stand on my accomplishments of what I\u2019ve done to bring this country together and get things done.

All of a sudden the other candidates get scared and I think Donald Trump knows that I can beat him.\u201d Bloomberg has previously needled the president about their respective fortunes. According to Forbes, Bloomberg is worth around $60bn, 17 times as much as Trump.",

We had two players ill [on Saturday morning], a couple of players injured.\u201d</p> <p>Hogg\u2019s howler, committed after some smart approach play worked him free into the corner, came early in the second half with Scotland trailing 13-6. It was not as expensive a mistake as it could have been, because the referee brought play back for a penalty that Adam Hastings converted. But the sense of despair at another chance missed by the Scots must have felt crippling, as their quest goes on to win in Dublin 4 (they did win in this city in 2010, but across the Liffey at Croke Park).</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t judge players on one mistake in the game,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cThere\u2019s hundreds of mistakes in any game, and we did get three points from that. We had other opportunities to score five and seven points. He\u2019ll be fine and will bounce back. I think he\u2019s a real driving force as captain of this side.\u201d</p> <p>For all Scotland\u2019s promise in attack, the familiarity of the failure to make it tell on the scoreboard might incline Scots to feel as if nothing has changed, despite the fresh faces in the lineup on Saturday. There were changes, too, in Ireland\u2019s setup but their doggedness and refusal to yield, no matter the cuts inflicted on them by Scotland\u2019s flashing blades, felt just as familiar.</p> <p>Johnny Sexton, assuming the captaincy from Rory Best, scored all of Ireland\u2019s 19 points, including a nicely worked try in the 10th minute that promised more in the way of technical excellence than Ireland would go on to deliver. Sexton\u2019s brilliance was surpassed only by that of Ireland\u2019s back row, who stole ball time and again just as the visitors seemed certain to score.</p> <p>Opposite them, however, Scotland boasted fine performances from their own back row, as well as the man who stepped up for his first Six Nations start under controversial circumstances.

      "bodyText": "Gregor Townsend leaped to the defence of his new captain, Stuart Hogg, after the full\u2011back lost control of the ball in the act of touching down. In so doing, he missed a simple try for Scotland at what felt a crucial juncture of a match Ireland won 19-12. Townsend, the Scotland head coach, was optimistic in the lead\u2011up to the Calcutta Cup match in Edinburgh on Saturday, backing Hogg to continue an otherwise promising start to his captaincy. \u201cThe way Stuart has led the team with so many challenges in front of him gives me great encouragement for how great a captain he can be over the next few years,\u201d Townsend said after Scotland\u2019s latest defeat in Dublin. \u201cHe was ill and in bed on Thursday and missed training. We had two players ill [on Saturday morning], a couple of players injured.\u201d Hogg\u2019s howler, committed after some smart approach play worked him free into the corner, came early in the second half with Scotland trailing 13-6. It was not as expensive a mistake as it could have been, because the referee brought play back for a penalty that Adam Hastings converted. But the sense of despair at another chance missed by the Scots must have felt crippling, as their quest goes on to win in Dublin 4 (they did win in this city in 2010, but across the Liffey at Croke Park). \u201cWe don\u2019t judge players on one mistake in the game,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cThere\u2019s hundreds of mistakes in any game, and we did get three points from that. We had other opportunities to score five and seven points. He\u2019ll be fine and will bounce back. I think he\u2019s a real driving force as captain of this side.\u201d For all Scotland\u2019s promise in attack, the familiarity of the failure to make it tell on the scoreboard might incline Scots to feel as if nothing has changed, despite the fresh faces in the lineup on Saturday. There were changes, too, in Ireland\u2019s setup but their doggedness and refusal to yield, no matter the cuts inflicted on them by Scotland\u2019s flashing blades, felt just as familiar. Johnny Sexton, assuming the captaincy from Rory Best, scored all of Ireland\u2019s 19 points, including a nicely worked try in the 10th minute that promised more in the way of technical excellence than Ireland would go on to deliver. Sexton\u2019s brilliance was surpassed only by that of Ireland\u2019s back row, who stole ball time and again just as the visitors seemed certain to score. Opposite them, however, Scotland boasted fine performances from their own back row, as well as the man who stepped up for his first Six Nations start under controversial circumstances. Hastings looked the part at fly-half, landing all but one of his five kicks at goal, his one miss from a long way out on the angle. He will go into the match against England on Saturday with confidence. The last time the Calcutta Cup was contested on Scottish soil, Scotland ran rings round England courtesy of a masterclass by Finn Russell. After his controversial departure from the squad a fortnight ago for disciplinary reasons, there seems little hope of a rapprochement in time for Saturday. \u201cIt is not something I have thought about,\u201d said Townsend. \u201cWe had two weeks\u2019 training and cohesion was very important in our selection this week.

      "body": "<p>So the 2020 Baftas were a mixed bag, reviled in advance for their dull Dulux uniformity, with some pretty mediocre product being bewilderingly promoted and great directors overlooked. But there were some great films getting rewarded too.</p> <p>For me, it is wonderful to see best film, director and outstanding British film go to Sam Mendes for 1917, co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. This drama from the first world war\u2019s western front has passion and sweep, and its director of photography Roger Deakins was always going to be a shoo-in for the cinematography Bafta for his amazing camerawork, fabricating the illusion of a continuous unbroken shot following the ordeal of two terrified British soldiers as they journey through no man\u2019s land and across vacated German lines on a desperate mission to warn their comrades of an enemy trap.</p> <p>For some, its sheer technical achievement was held against it, as if it were just flashiness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/25/1917-review-sam-mendess-turns-western-front-horror-into-a-single-shot-masterpiece\">I couldn\u2019t disagree more</a>. Of course, it is part of the spectacle and sheer delirious shock that the film delivers, but it also cleverly enfolds narrative and character-arc within that flow. The writer Daniel Maier made the interesting point that the film does not, in fact, take place in real time \u2013 so part of the single-shot\u2019s eerie effect is that time speeds up and slows down within it.</p> <p>The Baftas for foreign language film and original screenplay typically go to the film that has dominated the connoisseur conversation for months, and has become a virtual totem for people who yearn for awards to be given to something that isn\u2019t reeking of establishment mediocrity. And so it has proved. Parasite, by the Korean director Bong Joon-ho (which he co-wrote with Han Jin Won), is a brilliant and scabrous social satire about wealth, hypocrisy, family values, the servant class and the master class. It is indeed superbly written and acted, and it\u2019s exhilarating to see Parasite continue its triumphal progress at the Baftas.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/03/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-todd-phillips\">Joker</a> has been a global box office smash and a critical hit \u2013 the backstory of Batman\u2019s cackling arch enemy, given an indie-arthouse makeover of towering seriousness and a shrieking performance from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as the Pagliacci of dysfunctional crime \u2013 which duly won Phoenix the best actor Bafta. This was a firework display of ultra-acting, but he\u2019s done similar stuff in other, better films. (And Phoenix\u2019s critical superlatives more properly belonged to Adam Sandler for the utterly unrewarded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/09/uncut-gems-review-adam-sandler-idina-menzel\">Uncut Gems</a>.)

      "bodyText": "So the 2020 Baftas were a mixed bag, reviled in advance for their dull Dulux uniformity, with some pretty mediocre product being bewilderingly promoted and great directors overlooked. But there were some great films getting rewarded too. For me, it is wonderful to see best film, director and outstanding British film go to Sam Mendes for 1917, co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. This drama from the first world war\u2019s western front has passion and sweep, and its director of photography Roger Deakins was always going to be a shoo-in for the cinematography Bafta for his amazing camerawork, fabricating the illusion of a continuous unbroken shot following the ordeal of two terrified British soldiers as they journey through no man\u2019s land and across vacated German lines on a desperate mission to warn their comrades of an enemy trap. For some, its sheer technical achievement was held against it, as if it were just flashiness. I couldn\u2019t disagree more. Of course, it is part of the spectacle and sheer delirious shock that the film delivers, but it also cleverly enfolds narrative and character-arc within that flow. The writer Daniel Maier made the interesting point that the film does not, in fact, take place in real time \u2013 so part of the single-shot\u2019s eerie effect is that time speeds up and slows down within it. The Baftas for foreign language film and original screenplay typically go to the film that has dominated the connoisseur conversation for months, and has become a virtual totem for people who yearn for awards to be given to something that isn\u2019t reeking of establishment mediocrity. And so it has proved. Parasite, by the Korean director Bong Joon-ho (which he co-wrote with Han Jin Won), is a brilliant and scabrous social satire about wealth, hypocrisy, family values, the servant class and the master class. It is indeed superbly written and acted, and it\u2019s exhilarating to see Parasite continue its triumphal progress at the Baftas. Joker has been a global box office smash and a critical hit \u2013 the backstory of Batman\u2019s cackling arch enemy, given an indie-arthouse makeover of towering seriousness and a shrieking performance from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as the Pagliacci of dysfunctional crime \u2013 which duly won Phoenix the best actor Bafta. This was a firework display of ultra-acting, but he\u2019s done similar stuff in other, better films. (And Phoenix\u2019s critical superlatives more properly belonged to Adam Sandler for the utterly unrewarded Uncut Gems.) It was a big flashy turn in a big flashy film, but I am in the minority who found it disappointing and overblown, with no second or third act. But we Joker refuseniks know that this film\u2019s fiercely committed fanbase are not shy of letting you have their opinion of your opinion. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is a very popular best actress winner for her compassionate and utterly committed recreation of the unhappy Judy Garland in the final years of her life as she attempted to play the Talk of the Town club in London in the late 1960s. It was Zellweger\u2019s most relaxed and engaging performance in years and, although I liked Saoirse Ronan better, no one could begrudge Zellweger this award Brad Pitt winning best supporting actor, for playing an amiable stuntman in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, is a victory I should have predicted but didn\u2019t \u2013 I wrongly figured it would go to Anthony Hopkins or Joe Pesci. But Pitt\u2019s is a performance that looks easy but isn\u2019t \u2013 the kind of laidback, untroubled address to the camera that only great screen actors can bring off. Pitt is becoming the Gary Cooper of his generation. Laura Dern was a very worthy winner of best supporting actress as a tough, canny divorce lawyer in Noah Baumbach\u2019s marital-breakdown tragedy Marriage Story. Dern is pure charisma in the film, and clearly entering a golden age of screen performance. For Sama, Waad al-Kateab\u2019s searing chronicle of life in the Syrian town of Aleppo, was a thoroughly worthy winner of best documentary, though I had my fingers crossed for The Great Hack, about the great data-theft scandal. Taika Waititi got best adapted screenplay for his anti-war comedy Jojo Rabbit, in which a scared German boy during the second world war is visited by his imaginary best friend: a zany version of the f\u00fchrer. It is a film with many critical admirers and it is beloved by many smart, thoughtful people. But, at the risk of further enraging its battalions of Twitter fantroll enforcers \u2013 always ready with a pass-agg telling-off and a feline insult \u2013 I have to stick to my view that this is a bafflingly weak, twee, bland, unfunny and misjudged film, nowhere near the standard of Waititi\u2019s brilliant previous work. One of the purest pleasures of the night was the outstanding British debut award going to Mark Jenkin for his amazing 16mm black-and-white film Bait, an adventure in the style of early cinema, which is also a piercingly emotional story of two Cornish brothers. What a triumph for Jenkin: a terrifically distinctive talent. I take an immodest pleasure in pointing out that I was the first critic to evangelise for this film. I also let out a cheer to see that best animated short went to Maryam Mohajer\u2019s excellent Grandad Was a Romantic. It has the best and funniest punchline of any movie at the Baftas.",

      "bodyText": "The man shot dead by police after he stabbed two people in London on Sunday left prison only days ago and had previously been noted by police as having a \u201cfascination with dying in the name of terrorism\u201d, it has emerged. Sudesh Amman, whose attack on Streatham High Road left one person initially in a life-threatening condition, was under active police surveillance at the time of the attack. He had been freed after serving half of his sentence of more than three years for the possession and distribution of extremist material. Jailed aged 18 in December 2018, Amman had been released after serving part of his three year and four month sentence, but was deemed sufficiently high risk that he was under special monitoring by police. Mobile phone footage of the incident showed officers wearing plain clothes arriving on the scene at high speed, firing about five gunshots and killing Amman outside a branch of the chemist Boots. They used pistols that are normally used by surveillance officers. Amid questions over how Amman was able to carry out the attack so soon after his release when he was being monitored so closely, a Whitehall source said: \u201cHe was under surveillance, that is what allowed police to do their job so quickly. It could have been much worse than it was. \u201cThere had been concerns when he was in prison but there were no powers for any authority to keep him behind bars. The attack is the second terror incident in the British capital in the past three months, coming soon after former terrorist prisoner Usman Khan stabbed and killed two people in the London Bridge terror attack in late November. Like Khan\u2019s attack it will prompt further political debate about sentencing for terrorists. After an emergency meeting in Downing Street with Priti Patel, the home secretary, and senior police officers, Boris Johnson said: \u201c[On Monday] we will announce further plans for fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences.\u201d Amman, 20, pledged allegiance to Islamic State in messages to his girlfriend at the time he was jailed, and said that he wanted to carry out terrorist attacks. At the time, he wrote to her: \u201cIf you can\u2019t make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, molotov, sound bombs or a car at night and attack \u2026\u201d Comments from police officers at the time suggested that there were serious concerns about the level of Amman\u2019s determination to die as a martyr. At the time of his conviction, Acting Commander Alexis Boon, then head of the Metropolitan police counter terrorism command, said he had a \u201cfierce interest in violence and martyrdom\u201d. In remarks reported in 2018 Boon said: \u201cHis fascination with dying in the name of terrorism was clear in a notepad we recovered from his home. Amman had scrawled his \u2018life goals\u2019 in the notepad and top of the list, above family activities, was dying a martyr and going to \u2018Jannah\u2019 \u2013 the afterlife.\u201d Boon continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear how Amman became radicalised but it is apparent from his messages that it had been at least a year in development. Whatever the circumstances, this case is a reminder of the need to be vigilant to signs of radicalisation and report it.\u201d A Whitehall source claimed that the attack was evidence that the prime minister should be able to enact harsher anti-terror laws. \u201cThere was nothing that could be done to keep him behind bars under existing laws, hence why he was under surveillance and strict licensing conditions,\u201d the source said. In another echo of Khan\u2019s attack, Amman was wearing a fake suicide vest, described by some eyewitnesses as containing canister-like objects. Police said they were able to establish quickly it was a hoax device after the attacker had been shot. Police and intelligence agencies only have resources to monitor a handful of individuals at one time, indicating that anybody under active surveillance will have been deemed to be a serious threat. Investigators\u2019 inquiries will now focus on Amman\u2019s associations, whether he was a lone actor or was directed by others, and, if they were being monitored, how the attacker managed to launch a stabbing spree in broad daylight. Investigators cautioned that it remained very difficult to establish exactly when a suspect\u2019s intention turned into violent action. Eyewitnesses said they saw police fire several shots at the attacker. Karker Tahir, who worked in a nearby shop, said he saw \u201ctwo or three police officers undercover with guns\u201d telling the suspect to stop. \u201cThen I saw them shoot him three times,\u201d he added. Nardos Mulugeta, 52, a mechanical engineer who lives in Streatham, said he heard one shot, then a gap before three or four shots were fired.

He said he was appreciative but conflicted, \u201cbecause so many of my fellow actors that are deserving don\u2019t have that same privilege\u201d. He added: \u201cI think we send a very clear message to people of colour that you are not welcome here, people who have contributed so much to our medium and our industry.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"aa0f299d-eef5-4e09-8fd8-fd909e9b24bb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/chsD0PJf3R0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Prince William, Bafta\u2019s president, also alluded to the controversy in his closing remarks, saying that, not for the first time, \u201cwe find ourselves talking again about the need to do more to ensure diversity in the sector and the awards process. That simply cannot be right in this day and age.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said Bafta officials shared his frustration and continue to work \u201ctirelessly\u201d to make sure creative talent is discovered and supported. He added that a full review of the awards process would take place.</p> \n<p>Before that, the closest anyone got to anything approaching controversy was Taika Waititi, accepting the best adapted screenplay award for Jojo Rabbit. \u201cComing from the colonies,\u201d it was good, he said, to \u201ctake a little bit of your gold back home where it belongs.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rebel Wilson, presenting the best director award, acidly remarked she could just not do what the nominees did. \u201cHonestly, I just don\u2019t have the balls.\u201d</p> \n<p>The awards by and large went to the people predicted by pundits and bookies. 1917 was the biggest winner, but the Bafta record of nine, for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in 1971, remains intact.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"207df1090d5f6b6bc7321f39e016872ce96a2590\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/207df1090d5f6b6bc7321f39e016872ce96a2590/0_58_3152_3139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joaquin Phoenix takes Leading Actor and Renee Zellweger takes Leading Actress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"996\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Best actor award winner Joaquin Phoenix and best actress winner Ren\u00e9e Zellweger with their awards.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fisher/Bafta/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Phoenix was a shoo-in for best actor, with William Hill offering unappealing odds of 1/25 on.

That delighted many but left some baffled, with the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw describing it as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/13/oscars-2020-shallow-joker-squats-on-top-of-patchy-and-infuriating-nominations\">\u201ca mediocre and overrated film\u2026 which has less interest than the viral video of the Portsmouth kebab shop fight.\u201d</a> In the end, Joker came away with three awards, including best original score and the first ever Bafta for casting.</p> \n<p>Zellweger, who returned to acting in 2016 after a six-year break, was also odds-on favourite to win for Judy.

Wishing you the best with the divorce settlement.\u201d Pitt, she said, would name the Bafta \u201cHarry \u2026 because he is really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Netflix film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/marriage-story\">Marriage Story</a> won one Bafta: best supporting actress for Laura Dern, who plays the tough-talking and brilliant divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw. The Irishman, also backed by Netflix, had been nominated for 10 prizes but left empty-handed.</p> \n<p>The ceremony was presented for the first time by Graham Norton, a safe pair of hands enlisted after Joanna Lumley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2019/feb/11/is-joanna-lumley-worst-baftas-host-all-time\">much criticised</a> spell in the role. He went down well on the whole \u2013 though he was not to all tastes. Norton said he was proof that there was more than one Irishman there who \u201cseems to go on and on\u201d. Cut to a stony-faced Al Pacino.</p> \n<p>As part of Bafta\u2019s efforts to be a more sustainable organisation, single-use plastic was banned and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/02/baftas-2020-red-carpet-stars-sustainable-fashion\">guests were asked to think harder about what they wore</a>.

He said he was appreciative but conflicted, \u201cbecause so many of my fellow actors that are deserving don\u2019t have that same privilege\u201d. He added: \u201cI think we send a very clear message to people of colour that you are not welcome here, people who have contributed so much to our medium and our industry.\u201d Prince William, Bafta\u2019s president, also alluded to the controversy in his closing remarks, saying that, not for the first time, \u201cwe find ourselves talking again about the need to do more to ensure diversity in the sector and the awards process. That simply cannot be right in this day and age.\u201d He said Bafta officials shared his frustration and continue to work \u201ctirelessly\u201d to make sure creative talent is discovered and supported. He added that a full review of the awards process would take place. Before that, the closest anyone got to anything approaching controversy was Taika Waititi, accepting the best adapted screenplay award for Jojo Rabbit. \u201cComing from the colonies,\u201d it was good, he said, to \u201ctake a little bit of your gold back home where it belongs.\u201d Rebel Wilson, presenting the best director award, acidly remarked she could just not do what the nominees did. \u201cHonestly, I just don\u2019t have the balls.\u201d The awards by and large went to the people predicted by pundits and bookies. 1917 was the biggest winner, but the Bafta record of nine, for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in 1971, remains intact. Phoenix was a shoo-in for best actor, with William Hill offering unappealing odds of 1/25 on. Bafta voters obliged, choosing him from the all-white shortlist that also contained Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Driver, Taron Egerton and Jonathan Pryce. Joker, a supervillain origins story, had led the pack going in to the ceremony, with 11 nominations. That delighted many but left some baffled, with the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw describing it as \u201ca mediocre and overrated film\u2026 which has less interest than the viral video of the Portsmouth kebab shop fight.\u201d In the end, Joker came away with three awards, including best original score and the first ever Bafta for casting. Zellweger, who returned to acting in 2016 after a six-year break, was also odds-on favourite to win for Judy. Her portrayal of Judy Garland, in the final, calamitous year of her life, had been widely praised. Brad Pitt continued his awards season success, winning best supporting actor for his role in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood \u2013 although he was unable to continue his run of well-scripted, funny and modest acceptance speeches, as \u201cfamily obligations\u201d kept him away from the London ceremony. Instead, Margot Robbie read his speech: \u201cHey Britain, heard you just became single \u2026 welcome to the club. Wishing you the best with the divorce settlement.\u201d Pitt, she said, would name the Bafta \u201cHarry \u2026 because he is really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.\u201d The Netflix film Marriage Story won one Bafta: best supporting actress for Laura Dern, who plays the tough-talking and brilliant divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw. The Irishman, also backed by Netflix, had been nominated for 10 prizes but left empty-handed. The ceremony was presented for the first time by Graham Norton, a safe pair of hands enlisted after Joanna Lumley\u2019s much criticised spell in the role. He went down well on the whole \u2013 though he was not to all tastes. Norton said he was proof that there was more than one Irishman there who \u201cseems to go on and on\u201d. Cut to a stony-faced Al Pacino. As part of Bafta\u2019s efforts to be a more sustainable organisation, single-use plastic was banned and guests were asked to think harder about what they wore. That could mean wearing something they had worn before, going down the clothes-hire route, or choosing a designer with green credentials. Andy Serkis received an award for outstanding British contribution to cinema for his pioneering performance motion-capture work creating characters such as Gollum in Lord of the Rings, Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboots and the big gorilla in King Kong. Bafta\u2019s highest award, the fellowship, went to the producer Kathleen Kennedy whose stellar roster of films spans from ET to last year\u2019s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.",

      "bodyText": "As a growing number of Republican senators confirmed they will vote to acquit Donald Trump at the conclusion of his impeachment trial on Wednesday, the saga threatened to overshadow the first contest of the Democratic primary season in Iowa on Monday. On Friday, the Senate voted 51-49 to block testimony from new witnesses and the admission of new documentation in Trump\u2019s trial, the first time the body has elected to block such evidence in history. Just two Republicans, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, broke ranks in the vote. Although neither has publicly stated how they will vote next week, a super majority of 67 would be required to remove Trump from office \u2013 a figure that appears all but impossible in a hyper-partisan era. On Sunday, in an interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity broadcast as part of coverage of the Super Bowl, Trump said impeachment proceedings, in which state and intelligence officials provided firsthand testimony of the president\u2019s attempts to secure foreign investigations of his political rivals, had been hurtful to his family. He also suggested the process would make it harder for his administration to cooperate with Democrats in passing legislation. \u201cThey [Democrats] don\u2019t care about fairness,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 You look at the lies, you look at the reports that were done that were so false. The level of hypocrisy. So I\u2019m not sure if they can do it to be honest. I think they just want to win. It doesn\u2019t matter how they win.\u201d Some senior GOP senators predicted on Sunday every Republican in the chamber would vote to acquit Trump on Wednesday, and suggested a handful of Democrats up for re-election in swing states might also vote to acquit. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who last week briefly wavered on whether the former national security adviser John Bolton should provide potentially damning testimony, confirmed to NBC\u2019s Meet the Press he would vote to acquit. Despite that, Alexander labelled Trump\u2019s behaviour in the Ukraine scandal, in which the president pressured Kyiv to investigate the Biden family and other political rivals, as \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d. \u201cI think he shouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI think it was wrong. Inappropriate was the way I\u2019d say \u2013 improper, crossing the line.\u201d The Democratic-controlled House sent two articles of impeachment to the Senate, one concerning abuse of power and the other obstruction of Congress. Bolton has reportedly detailed direct interactions with Trump over Ukraine in a book which the White House is seeking to block. Few observers doubt that even without Bolton\u2019s testimony, the case against Trump was proved. But Republicans have said that does not mean the president should be removed. Like other members of his party, Alexander said his vote to acquit was linked to the fact that removing Trump would mean he could not run in the election in November. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cit struck me, really for the first time, early last week, that we\u2019re not just being asked to remove the president from office. We\u2019re saying, \u2018Tell him he can\u2019t run in the 2020 election which begins Monday in Iowa.\u2019\u201d Joni Ernst of Iowa, who faces re-election, also confirmed she would vote to acquit, despite meekly criticising the president\u2019s behaviour. \u201cI think ferreting out corruption [in Ukraine] is absolutely the right thing to do,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cNow if he was tying it to other things, that\u2019s the president. It\u2019s probably something that I wouldn\u2019t have done.\u201d Adam Schiff, the Democrats\u2019 lead impeachment manager, said Republicans\u2019 acknowledgment of wrongdoing but decisions to acquit were \u201cremarkable\u201d. \u201cThe House proved the corrupt scheme that they charged in the articles of impeachment,\u201d Schiff told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, adding it was \u201cpretty remarkable when you now have senators on both sides of the aisle admitting the House made its case and the only question is, should the president be removed for office because he\u2019s been found guilty of these offences?\u201d Polling released by NBC and the Wall Street Journal on Sunday indicated that the country remains split over Trump\u2019s impeachment, with 46% of registered voters supporting his removal and 49% believing he should remain. Although Iowa holds the first vote for the Democratic nomination on Monday, many of the candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, will be forced to return to Washington to hear closing arguments in the Senate trial. Trump is scheduled to deliver his state of the union address on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, giving him a primetime platform. Though his likely acquittal will be on Wednesday, many observers expect him to claim exoneration anyway, as he did, inaccurately, after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian election interference last year. Democrats are looking to turn the Senate trial to their favour, branding it a cover-up and mobilising grassroots organisations to punish Republicans at the polls. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigeg, polling in third place in Iowa, told CNN on Sunday: \u201cThe Senate is the jury today, but we are the jury tomorrow. \u201cAnd we get to send a message at the ballot box that cheating, lying, involving a foreign country in our own domestic politics, not to mention abuse of power more broadly and bad administration, that\u2019s not OK, that we can do better.\u201d Senate Republicans also plan to capitalise on Trump\u2019s likely acquittal. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on Sunday urged colleagues to commence investigations of the Bidens\u2019 activities in Ukraine and to examine the start of the FBI investigation into Russian election meddling, which led to Mueller\u2019s appointment. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get to the bottom of this to make sure it never happens again,\u201d Graham said on Fox News Sunday. Addressing Republican voters, he added: \u201cYou should expect us to do this. If we don\u2019t do it, we\u2019re letting you down.\u201d",

But one company is hoping fine diners from London to LA to Tokyo will devour enough <em>uni sushi</em> \u2013 sea urchin roe \u2013 to help restore the planet\u2019s kelp forests.</p> <p>From the North Sea to Tasmania, large parts of these underwater carbon stores \u2013 crucial for biodiversity \u2013 have vanished, leaving vast \u201curchin barrens\u201d on the sea floor in their place. In Norway, the expanses of bizarre, prickly orbs are green. In California, they are purple. But wherever the urchins linger, the problems are the same.</p> <p>Once the voracious echinoderms run out of kelp to eat, they do not simply die. Instead, they can stay in stasis for years, billions of them starving in their shells. This makes it impossible for the kelp forests to recover, unless the urchins are removed entirely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed4e2d987c9b1a633f33d2789d38b6642368d7cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed4e2d987c9b1a633f33d2789d38b6642368d7cf/0_1222_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Purple sea urchins helped lay waste to over 90% of California\u2019s vast bull kelp forests between 2014 and 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Purple sea urchins helped lay waste to over 90% of California\u2019s vast bull kelp forests between 2014 and 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Urchinonics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.urchinomics.com/\">Urchinomics</a> has a plan for that. Their idea is to turn the hordes of urchins around the world into a business opportunity by collecting them, feeding them up on sustainably harvested, umami-rich kombu seaweed and selling the lucrative roe to high-end sushi restaurants.</p> <p>\u201cMy first \u2018a-ha\u2019 moment was a year after the tsunami in eastern Japan,\u201d says Urchinomics CEO Brian Tsuyoshi Takeda, remembering conversations with Japanese fishermen in the aftermath of the 2011 disaster.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the tsunami hit, it washed away all the predator species that used to be in the water. When the predators disappeared, the urchins exploded in population. The scientists told us it was about seven times the original biomass in a year or two. They literally ate all of the giant kelp forests which were the foundation of the north-east fisheries in Japan.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"389841c7ae326302502d2f5532a2600e06e2b8e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/389841c7ae326302502d2f5532a2600e06e2b8e3/0_2000_4000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uni sushi, made with sea urchin roe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uni sushi, made with sea urchin roe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cody Chan/Courtesy of Urchinonics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Takeda, who is based in Norway but has operations in Japan, Canada and the US, Urchinomics has ambitions to make urchin removal and restoration self-sustaining around the world. Demand for uni, the Japanese name for urchins, is rising, and they were <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/ba25-restaurant-trends-2018\">named </a><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/ba25-restaurant-trends-2018\">one of the top food trends in 2018</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe more you eat urchins, the better it is for the kelp forests. That\u2019s kind of unique, I think \u2026 It has to be about looking towards these win-win situations where you\u2019re creating some sort of economic incentive to help drive the restoration work.\u201d</p> <p>The company has just announced it has signed a lease to open its first urchin ranch in Norway, where 80 billion of the creatures are estimated to have ravaged kelp forests along the country\u2019s coastline. Takeda hopes the site in Stavanger, the oil capital of Norway, will supply Michelin-starred sushi restaurants in in London, Amsterdam and Brussels this summer.</p> <p>The ability of kelp forests to recover once urchins are removed is impressive, taking mere months. But the problem of urchin barrens is not restricted to Norway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fc75c8d99c4759edeba3787b9e34110317e17a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fc75c8d99c4759edeba3787b9e34110317e17a0/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The stumpy remains of a kelp forest \u2013 and the sea urchins that destroyed it \u2013 off the Oregon coast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The stumpy remains of a kelp forest \u2013 and the sea urchins that destroyed it \u2013 off the Oregon coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Groth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In northern California, the collapse of the once abundant bull kelp forests took just two years. Along large stretches of the 350km coastline from the north of San Francisco to the Oregon border, a combination of intense ocean heating fuelled by the climate crisis and armies of ravenous purple sea urchins laid waste to over 90% of the vast underwater carbon stores between 2014 and 2016.</p> <p>The disintegration of these vital underwater ecosystems caught researchers by surprise, and left a trail of economic destruction. In 2018, a $44m (\u00a333m) recreational red abalone fishery closed after the kelp deforestation triggered mass mortality in the sea snail.</p> <p>\u201cOur kelps are very productive ecosystems but they rely on the cool. We know that they are at risk in a warming ocean in a warming globe,\u201d explains Dr Laura Rogers-Bennett from University of California, Davis, who recently published <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51114-y\">a study</a> on how a sea-star wasting disease, a marine heatwave and sea urchin boom combined to collapse the bull kelp forests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"19958235a52b79786db2392c6d679fd9e4068376\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19958235a52b79786db2392c6d679fd9e4068376/0_0_3040_1008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recovery of a California kelp forest.

Yet the presence of sea otters might be helping the resilience of kelp forests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/16/mekong-basins-vanishing-fish-signal-ill-times-ahead-for-cambodia-aoe\">Mekong basin's vanishing fish signal tough times ahead in Cambodia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAbout half of the sites we monitor have lost the kelp, the other sites are remaining strong. More recently, some have recovered,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cOne big difference between Monterey Bay and northern California is that we have sea otters. The sea otters are one of the keystone predators. They can keep the sea urchins in check.

      "bodyText": "Eating as much sushi as humanly possible seems an unlikely way to help save the planet. But one company is hoping fine diners from London to LA to Tokyo will devour enough uni sushi \u2013 sea urchin roe \u2013 to help restore the planet\u2019s kelp forests. From the North Sea to Tasmania, large parts of these underwater carbon stores \u2013 crucial for biodiversity \u2013 have vanished, leaving vast \u201curchin barrens\u201d on the sea floor in their place. In Norway, the expanses of bizarre, prickly orbs are green. In California, they are purple. But wherever the urchins linger, the problems are the same. Once the voracious echinoderms run out of kelp to eat, they do not simply die. Instead, they can stay in stasis for years, billions of them starving in their shells. This makes it impossible for the kelp forests to recover, unless the urchins are removed entirely. Urchinomics has a plan for that. Their idea is to turn the hordes of urchins around the world into a business opportunity by collecting them, feeding them up on sustainably harvested, umami-rich kombu seaweed and selling the lucrative roe to high-end sushi restaurants. \u201cMy first \u2018a-ha\u2019 moment was a year after the tsunami in eastern Japan,\u201d says Urchinomics CEO Brian Tsuyoshi Takeda, remembering conversations with Japanese fishermen in the aftermath of the 2011 disaster. \u201cWhen the tsunami hit, it washed away all the predator species that used to be in the water. When the predators disappeared, the urchins exploded in population. The scientists told us it was about seven times the original biomass in a year or two. They literally ate all of the giant kelp forests which were the foundation of the north-east fisheries in Japan.\u201d According to Takeda, who is based in Norway but has operations in Japan, Canada and the US, Urchinomics has ambitions to make urchin removal and restoration self-sustaining around the world. Demand for uni, the Japanese name for urchins, is rising, and they were named one of the top food trends in 2018. \u201cThe more you eat urchins, the better it is for the kelp forests. That\u2019s kind of unique, I think \u2026 It has to be about looking towards these win-win situations where you\u2019re creating some sort of economic incentive to help drive the restoration work.\u201d The company has just announced it has signed a lease to open its first urchin ranch in Norway, where 80 billion of the creatures are estimated to have ravaged kelp forests along the country\u2019s coastline. Takeda hopes the site in Stavanger, the oil capital of Norway, will supply Michelin-starred sushi restaurants in in London, Amsterdam and Brussels this summer. The ability of kelp forests to recover once urchins are removed is impressive, taking mere months. But the problem of urchin barrens is not restricted to Norway. In northern California, the collapse of the once abundant bull kelp forests took just two years. Along large stretches of the 350km coastline from the north of San Francisco to the Oregon border, a combination of intense ocean heating fuelled by the climate crisis and armies of ravenous purple sea urchins laid waste to over 90% of the vast underwater carbon stores between 2014 and 2016. The disintegration of these vital underwater ecosystems caught researchers by surprise, and left a trail of economic destruction. In 2018, a $44m (\u00a333m) recreational red abalone fishery closed after the kelp deforestation triggered mass mortality in the sea snail. \u201cOur kelps are very productive ecosystems but they rely on the cool. We know that they are at risk in a warming ocean in a warming globe,\u201d explains Dr Laura Rogers-Bennett from University of California, Davis, who recently published a study on how a sea-star wasting disease, a marine heatwave and sea urchin boom combined to collapse the bull kelp forests. \u201cMany parts of the world are experiencing kelp forest declines. Frequently they\u2019re being replaced by huge populations of sea urchins,\u201d she continues. \u201cThey\u2019ve been seeing this in Japan, Norway; it\u2019s happening in Australia in the southern state [of] Tasmania.\u201d In central California, the destructive armies of purple sea urchins have spread south to Monterey Bay, according to Jan Freiwald, head of the Reef Check Foundation, which has been training recreational divers to perform scientific surveys on ecosystems for over two decades. Yet the presence of sea otters might be helping the resilience of kelp forests. \u201cAbout half of the sites we monitor have lost the kelp, the other sites are remaining strong. More recently, some have recovered,\u201d he says. \u201cOne big difference between Monterey Bay and northern California is that we have sea otters. The sea otters are one of the keystone predators. They can keep the sea urchins in check. And so, actually in the kelp forests around Monterey, we see increases in sea urchins but also see the sea otters beginning to forage more on them. So that might sustain some reefs, rather than the northern coast where we don\u2019t have sea otters.\u201d Previous research has found that where otters are present, kelp forests tend to store more carbon and are healthier. But simply introducing otters into urchin barrens would not work as the starving shells are of little calorific value to the mammals. Whether or not Urchinomics manages to make it as a viable business, researchers warn that vast stretches of kelp forests along the Pacific coast are disappearing and the urchins must be cleared.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 3 February. Top stories Australians stranded in the Chinese city of Wuhan were expected to fly out of the city on Monday morning as they make their way towards Christmas Island. It is understood the flight was due to depart from Wuhan at 2am local time (5am AEDT) and would head straight to mainland Australia, where those on board will then be transported to Christmas Island for a 14-day quarantine period. Footage of government officials in Wuhan appearing to take face masks intended for health workers battling the highly infectious coronavirus has fuelled a growing wave of anger over how Chinese authorities have handled the outbreak. It comes as the Philippines has reported the first death from the coronavirus outside China, adding to fears about the spread of the virus as more countries imposed travel restrictions. China\u2019s central bank has pledged to pump 1.2tn yuan (A$256bn) into its financial system in an attempt to protect its economy from the coronavirus epidemic. Bridget McKenzie has resigned from Scott Morrison\u2019s ministry in an effort to stem the rolling controversy and political damage over sports grants before the opening of the 2020 parliamentary session this week. The prime minister confirmed the departure of the besieged deputy leader of the Nationals late on Sunday after receiving advice from his departmental head and former chief of staff, Phil Gaetjens, and after a meeting with the governance committee of cabinet. Morrison declined to release the Gaetjens adjudication. \u201cMorrison wants this whole mess to be over with McKenzie\u2019s departure,\u201d writes Katherine Murphy. \u201cQuick prediction. This isn\u2019t over.\u201d A man has been shot dead by armed police in south London following a terrorist-related incident in which a number of people are believed to have been stabbed. The Metropolitan police confirmed the man, who was shot at about 2pm in Streatham, had been pronounced dead and added: \u201cWe believe there are two injured victims. We await updates on their conditions.\u201d They said the scene had been \u201cfully contained\u201d. The man shot dead by police was wearing a \u201cfake suicide vest\u201d made of objects designed to look like an improvised explosive device. Australia A group of 200 scientists are urging parliament to reduce Australia\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions, and work diplomatically to achieve coordinated global climate action after a catastrophic summer of bushfires. Government should abandon plans to increase employer contributions towards superannuation because new research shows about 80% of the extra money would be taken out of pay packets in the form of lower wage increases, the Grattan Institute says. The father of three of four children killed after a car crashed into them in Sydney has spoken of his devastating loss. Danny Abdallah told reporters on Sunday he was heartbroken. \u201cMy name is Daniel Abdallah, I have a wife, Leila, and six beautiful children I\u2019ve been blessed with. Yesterday, I lost three of my children,\u201d he said. The world At least 20 people have been killed in a crush during a church service at a stadium in northern Tanzania. Hundreds of people packed a stadium on Saturday evening in Moshi town, near the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, and were crushed as they rushed to get anointed with \u201cblessed oil\u201d. The looming Senate acquittal of Trump threatens to overshadow Iowa. As a growing number of Republican senators confirmed they will vote to acquit Donald Trump at the conclusion of his impeachment trial on Wednesday, the saga threatened to overshadow the first contest of the Democratic primary season in Iowa on Monday. The release of one of the most influential polls of the Democratic primary was cancelled on Saturday night, after candidate Pete Buttigieg reportedly complained that his name had been left off at least one survey. Enthusiasm would be widespread in the European Union if Scotland applied to rejoin after independence, Donald Tusk has said. The former president of the European council told the BBC he had great sympathy with the desire of many Scots to rejoin the EU after Brexit. Recommended reads In 2019 the idea of a millennial and Gen Z \u201csex recession\u201d became fact. \u201cOr it became the 2019 version of a fact: something we all (myself included) absorb after reading viral headlines on Facebook,\u201d writes Meg Watson. \u201cLast year ABC\u2019s national survey Australia Talks found that 40% of people aged 18 to 24 report \u2018never\u2019 having sex. Since then, young people have been lightly mocked on ABC TV, and in the Daily Telegraph. They\u2019ve even been made the subject of an \u2018intervention\u2019-based ad campaign for a condom company. But as clicky as that story sounds, it\u2019s not the whole truth. Instead of scolding young people for not having sex which they are in fact having, maybe we could look to them to understand the many ways that modern sex is changing.\u201d \u201cQ&amp;A succeeded because it created an opportunity that hadn\u2019t existed for ordinary Australians to challenge our politicians directly and measure their responses,\u201d writes Peter McEvoy, the program\u2019s former executive producer as part of Guardian Australia\u2019 Unforgettable Australian TV series. \u201cWe brought together Australian citizens from diverse political and cultural backgrounds to discuss the direction of the nation \u2026 After 12 years at Q&amp;A my faith in the power of reasoned discussion to change minds and build a consensus has taken a battering, but I can\u2019t identify any pathway forward that isn\u2019t built on bringing together people with divergent views to listen, debate and discuss.\u201d Listen/Watch On today\u2019s Full Story podcast, Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor explores Australia\u2019s long track record of stalling on climate change action. This summer, Scott Morrison has faced international criticism over his climate change policies. But this government is just the latest in a long line that have either failed on meaningful climate policy at home or blocked stronger climate action on the world stage. Sport Novak Djokovic has outlasted Dominic Thiem to win his eighth Australian Open crown, 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. Kevin Mitchell writes: \u201cNovak Djokovic strolled out of Rod Laver Arena a little after midnight, the cheers \u2013 and a few jeers \u2013 behind him drifting into the cool night through the opened roof.

Will Jimmy Garoppolo lead the 49ers to the team\u2019s sixth Super Bowl title or will Patrick Mahomes lift the Chiefs to their first since 1970? Our writers hash it out.

The Australian Financial Review warns the ASX is set to have its weakest day of 2020 as fears over economic damage caused by the coronavirus escalate. Coming up Australians trapped in the Chinese city of Wuhan due to the coronavirus will be evacuated to Christmas Island. A memorial service will be held in Sydney for John Morrison, the father of the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Follow all the Superbowl LIV action from Miami in our dedicated liveblog from 10am.

So it\u2019s not exactly a thriving democracy in that regard.\u201d Abbas, 84, took office in January 2005. In December 2009 his term was extended until any new elections were held. Palestinians had to see they had been offered a reasonable deal, Kushner said. \u201cWhat they did is they rejected this before it came out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey called for a day of rage, and they\u2019re saying, we want a state. But people who are ready to get a state aren\u2019t calling for days of rage and then marching in the street.\u201d He also said the US had tried to \u201ctake a pragmatic approach\u201d to \u201cprobably the most complicated problem in the world\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to do it differently, and I think that for the first time there\u2019s a real offer on the table to break the logjam. And it\u2019s really up to the Palestinians to see if they have the opportunity to pursue it.\u201d In Cairo, Arab League foreign ministers said the plan did not meet the minimum aspirations of Palestinians and the League would not cooperate in implementing it. They also affirmed Palestinian rights to create a state based on land captured and occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, with East Jerusalem as capital.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will issue a direct warning on Monday that the UK will refuse close alignment of rules and reject the jurisdiction of the European courts in any trade deal as EU leaders prepare to give his plans a frosty reception. In a bullish speech setting out the government\u2019s negotiating position, the prime minister will set out his vision for future relations with the trading bloc and reject accepting similar rules over competition, welfare spending and environmental standards. \u201cThere is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment, or anything similar any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules,\u201d he will say. His vision clashes with the mandate of EU leaders, which is due to be set out on the same day and is expected to aim at maintaining a level playing field. Labour has accused the government of indulging in \u201csabre-rattling\u201d as both sides set out their initial negotiating positions and embark upon 11 months of intense talks. In the speech, to be delivered to ambassadors and businesspeople on Monday morning, Johnson will argue in favour of either a Canada-style or Australia-style agreement that will respect the autonomy of the UK courts. \u201cThe choice is emphatically not \u2018deal or no deal\u2019. The question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada\u2019s \u2013 or more like Australia\u2019s. In either case, I have no doubt that Britain will prosper. And of course our new relationship with our closest neighbours will range far beyond trade. \u201cWe will seek a pragmatic agreement on security, protecting our citizens without trespassing on the autonomy of our respective legal systems,\u201d he will say. Senior government sources concede that the stakes are high if they fail. If there is no deal by 31 December, the UK will face a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d no-deal Brexit. References by Johnson\u2019s government to \u201cthe Australian model\u201d in briefings to journalists have bemused EU officials because no deal has yet been agreed with the Canberra government. An EU source said the government appeared to have decided that Australia \u201csounds much more popular than the WTO\u201d, but \u201cthere is no such thing as an Australia-style agreement\u201d. Earlier, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, had said that following EU rules after 2021 \u201cjust ain\u2019t happening\u201d and insisted that it was wrong for the EU\u2019s senior negotiator to claim that goods entering Northern Ireland and Great Britain would be subject to extra paperwork once Britain leaves the post-Brexit transition period. Asked on Sky News on Sunday whether Michel Barnier was wrong to say there would be border checks on goods moving between the EU and the UK, the foreign secretary said this was up to the EU. \u201cYes, he is wrong if the EU lives up to its commitments on its side both in the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. \u201cWe are entering into these negotiations with a spirit of goodwill. But we are just not doing that other stuff. The legislative alignment, it just ain\u2019t happening,\u201d he said. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Raab\u2019s words were part of a showy and childish attempt to set out the government\u2019s position in the trade negotiations. \u201cIt is \u2018sabre-rattling\u2019 \u2026 It is a bit puerile,\u201d he told the Andrew Marr Show. EU figures have expressed concern at the position of the Johnson government. Dacian Ciolo\u0219, a former prime minister of Romania who leads the Renew group in the European parliament which includes Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party, warned against an outbreak of aggressive posturing ahead of the negotiation. \u201cWe are now at a low moment in this relationship and, unfortunately, Brexit puts barriers between us. \u201cThe extent to which the EU can be open and make concessions will depend strongly on the extent to which the British government will be willing to cooperate. But, obviously, a deal can never be as good as EU membership,\u201d he said. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said the EU could reach a sector by sector deal with the UK if a comprehensive Brexit agreement was not reached by Johnson\u2019s December deadline. But he told the BBC it would be a \u201csecond-class outcome\u201d and mean that negotiations could drag on for years. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t possible to have a comprehensive deal then the back-up plan would be sectoral agreement or some temporary agreements that would buy us more time while we negotiate the comprehensive agreement, but that to me is an inferior outcome,\u201d he told Marr. \u201cAnd imposition of bureaucracy, checks, tariffs and quotas, that is not good for anyone.\u201d EU officials are expected to insist on protecting their companies from a race to the bottom on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards. \u201cThe EU understands the UK is not wanting to be a rule taker. But that works both ways, we also have a demanding public,\u201d an EU source said. Brussels has asked the UK to sign up to EU standards on workers\u2019 rights, environmental protection and state aid in order to get zero-tariffs, zero-quotas on trade in goods. Last October, Johnson agreed that the future relationship with the EU \u201cmust ensure open and fair competition, encompassing robust commitments to ensure a level playing field\u201d. In a further development, Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Arlene Foster, expressed concern that a refusal to consider alignment could cause a border down the Irish Sea. As part of the withdrawal agreement, Johnson agreed that the six counties would continue to follow single market rules to avoid border checks along the border with Ireland. It means, if Britain has rules that differ from Brussels post-2021, then cargo travelling into Northern Ireland from Great Britain could face inspections. In comments made to Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme, the DUP leader Foster said it was \u201cdifficult to see\u201d how checks could be avoided since ministers intended to \u201cdiverge away from single market regulations, whilst Northern Ireland remains within the single market\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Shops and cafes along Streatham High Road were crowded with shoppers and families onthe busy south London thoroughfare when terror struck at around 2pm on Sunday.</p> \n<p>From that moment on, everything happened incredibly quickly. It took the Metropolitan police just one hour and 15 minutes after the first emergency calls to declare it a terror-related incident. By then, two people had been stabbed, with one suffering life-threatening injuries, and one man had been shot dead by armed officers who arrived at the scene.</p> \n<p>Unlike previous attacks on London Bridge and Westminster Bridge, the action did not take place at a London landmark, but a semi-suburban high street. Shocked shoppers were initially unaware they were caught up in a terror incident.</p> \n<p>Unconfirmed reports are of the suspect entering a shop wielding a knife. It is then suggested he came out and stabbed a woman on a bicycle.</p> \n<p>He was then seen being chased by up to three others, dressed in civilian clothes, but now believed to have been undercover officers. Panic set in when gun shots were heard. Witnesses spoke of hearing around three.</p> \n<p>Video footage filmed by onlookers in the immediate aftermath showed a man\u2019s body lying in front of a Boots store. Police carrying machine guns and masked undercover officers were seen approaching the suspect\u2019s body, before rapidly moving away, leading to speculation that the suspect may have been wearing some kind of device, whether real or an imitation.</p> \n<p>Met police later said it was a hoax device.</p> \n<p>One student, who lived in Streatham, was crossing the road when he saw the man being chased. He had \u201ca machete and silver canisters on his chest\u201d, said the 19-year-old, who did not want to be named. Those chasing him were in civilian clothes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/streatham-zip/giv-3902RpsbDBYPCSn9/\" data-alt=\".\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/streatham-zip/giv-3902RpsbDBYPCSn9/\">.</a> \n <figcaption>\n  .\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe man was then shot. I think I heard three gun shots, but I can\u2019t quite remember,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that, I ran into the library to get to safety.\u201d From the library, the student saw ambulances and armed officers swarm on to the street.</p> \n<p>Nardos Mulugeta, 52, a mechanical engineer from Streatham, said he heard gunshots and also saw one victim lying in the street. \u201cI heard a shot, then there was a 20-second gap. Then there were three or four shots together.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mulugeta said he went over to the first victim, a man, on the ground near the White Lion pub where people were already helping him. \u201cThen five minutes later, a woman came over and said she had been stabbed too, in the back. And then people started helping her,\u201d he said. He then saw another man, lying face down, further away.</p> \n<p>Three victims were taken to south London hospitals, the Met later confirmed. One man\u2019s condition is no longer life-threatening after treatment, a Met statement said; one woman with minor injuries has been discharged; and another woman is still being treated for minor injuries that police said were believed to have been caused by glass following the discharge of a police firearm.</p> \n<p>From the shop where he was working with a colleague, Karker Tahir saw the suspect \u201cliterally running along the pavement and behind him were two or three police officers, undercover, with a gun\u201d. The officers were shouting \u201cstop\u201d, but \u201che did not stop\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThen I saw them shoot him three times,\u201d Tahir told Sky News. \u201cHe was on the floor.\u201d He looked like he was carrying something, he added. Police then told him and his colleague to leave the shop because it looked like he might have a bomb. He saw the officers checking on the man, then stepping back. \u201cThat\u2019s when we ran,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a bit shocked. I have never seen things like that.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the chaos that ensued, passersby attended to the wounded as they waited for ambulances to arrive. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaveChawner/status/1223981064751931393\">David Chawner</a>, an author, spoke on social media of his frustration: \u201cI had to stay with someone who\u2019d just been stabbed in Streatham for 30 minutes before a single ambulance arrived.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chawner told Sky News he had no idea he was in the midst of a terror attack until he saw \u201cthe guns\u201d. He said he liaised with paramedics on the phone for half an hour while the man lay \u201con the street bleeding out\u201d. Police, too, \u201cshared my frustration\u201d especially as they were less than one mile away from two major London hospitals. It was \u201cjust an incredibly frantic situation,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Luke Black, who was meeting a friend, was just about to have lunch when he saw people running and shouting. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure what was happening and thought it was some kids. It\u2019s only when we got to Boots that we saw a body on the floor and police were ushering people away. We were worried and we heard rumours the man had something strapped to his chest. The police were swift to come in and people were told to leave quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was lots of tension in the air after the incident and people were scared. I feel sad now. It\u2019s Sunday and a bustling street with families. It\u2019s a shame as there is a nice community here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Local St Leonard\u2019s church rector, Anna Norman-Walker, found her rectory taped off on both sides as police cordoned off the street. Later, she rewrote her Sunday night sermon in light of the day\u2019s events. \u201cSome of us are here tonight quite simply to be together and to say defiantly that this is a community of kindness, tolerance and friendship,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are proud not just of our diversity but of the quality of relationships we enjoy with our neighbours that go well beyond that rather loaded word \u2018tolerance\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting: Jedidajah Otte</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Shops and cafes along Streatham High Road were crowded with shoppers and families onthe busy south London thoroughfare when terror struck at around 2pm on Sunday. From that moment on, everything happened incredibly quickly. It took the Metropolitan police just one hour and 15 minutes after the first emergency calls to declare it a terror-related incident. By then, two people had been stabbed, with one suffering life-threatening injuries, and one man had been shot dead by armed officers who arrived at the scene. Unlike previous attacks on London Bridge and Westminster Bridge, the action did not take place at a London landmark, but a semi-suburban high street. Shocked shoppers were initially unaware they were caught up in a terror incident. Unconfirmed reports are of the suspect entering a shop wielding a knife. It is then suggested he came out and stabbed a woman on a bicycle. He was then seen being chased by up to three others, dressed in civilian clothes, but now believed to have been undercover officers. Panic set in when gun shots were heard. Witnesses spoke of hearing around three. Video footage filmed by onlookers in the immediate aftermath showed a man\u2019s body lying in front of a Boots store. Police carrying machine guns and masked undercover officers were seen approaching the suspect\u2019s body, before rapidly moving away, leading to speculation that the suspect may have been wearing some kind of device, whether real or an imitation. Met police later said it was a hoax device. One student, who lived in Streatham, was crossing the road when he saw the man being chased. He had \u201ca machete and silver canisters on his chest\u201d, said the 19-year-old, who did not want to be named. Those chasing him were in civilian clothes. \u201cThe man was then shot. I think I heard three gun shots, but I can\u2019t quite remember,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that, I ran into the library to get to safety.\u201d From the library, the student saw ambulances and armed officers swarm on to the street. Nardos Mulugeta, 52, a mechanical engineer from Streatham, said he heard gunshots and also saw one victim lying in the street. \u201cI heard a shot, then there was a 20-second gap. Then there were three or four shots together.\u201d Mulugeta said he went over to the first victim, a man, on the ground near the White Lion pub where people were already helping him. \u201cThen five minutes later, a woman came over and said she had been stabbed too, in the back. And then people started helping her,\u201d he said. He then saw another man, lying face down, further away. Three victims were taken to south London hospitals, the Met later confirmed. One man\u2019s condition is no longer life-threatening after treatment, a Met statement said; one woman with minor injuries has been discharged; and another woman is still being treated for minor injuries that police said were believed to have been caused by glass following the discharge of a police firearm. From the shop where he was working with a colleague, Karker Tahir saw the suspect \u201cliterally running along the pavement and behind him were two or three police officers, undercover, with a gun\u201d. The officers were shouting \u201cstop\u201d, but \u201che did not stop\u201d. \u201cThen I saw them shoot him three times,\u201d Tahir told Sky News. \u201cHe was on the floor.\u201d He looked like he was carrying something, he added. Police then told him and his colleague to leave the shop because it looked like he might have a bomb. He saw the officers checking on the man, then stepping back. \u201cThat\u2019s when we ran,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a bit shocked. I have never seen things like that.\u201d In the chaos that ensued, passersby attended to the wounded as they waited for ambulances to arrive. David Chawner, an author, spoke on social media of his frustration: \u201cI had to stay with someone who\u2019d just been stabbed in Streatham for 30 minutes before a single ambulance arrived.\u201d Chawner told Sky News he had no idea he was in the midst of a terror attack until he saw \u201cthe guns\u201d. He said he liaised with paramedics on the phone for half an hour while the man lay \u201con the street bleeding out\u201d. Police, too, \u201cshared my frustration\u201d especially as they were less than one mile away from two major London hospitals. It was \u201cjust an incredibly frantic situation,\u201d he added. Luke Black, who was meeting a friend, was just about to have lunch when he saw people running and shouting. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure what was happening and thought it was some kids. It\u2019s only when we got to Boots that we saw a body on the floor and police were ushering people away. We were worried and we heard rumours the man had something strapped to his chest. The police were swift to come in and people were told to leave quickly.\u201d \u201cThere was lots of tension in the air after the incident and people were scared. I feel sad now. It\u2019s Sunday and a bustling street with families. It\u2019s a shame as there is a nice community here.\u201d Local St Leonard\u2019s church rector, Anna Norman-Walker, found her rectory taped off on both sides as police cordoned off the street. Later, she rewrote her Sunday night sermon in light of the day\u2019s events. \u201cSome of us are here tonight quite simply to be together and to say defiantly that this is a community of kindness, tolerance and friendship,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are proud not just of our diversity but of the quality of relationships we enjoy with our neighbours that go well beyond that rather loaded word \u2018tolerance\u2019.\u201d Additional reporting: Jedidajah Otte",

Unlucky to deflect the forward\u2019s shot past Ederson. 7 Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi The Argentinian had nothing to worry about when it was 11 v 11. Less convincing after the red. 6 Oleksandr Zinchenko Cost City the game. Already on a booking when he needlessly felled Winks for a second yellow. 4 Rodri Classy at times and sloppy at others. Still adjusting to the pace of English football. Booked. 6 Riyad Mahrez Promised so much but delivered so little. Awful corner led to Zinchenko\u2019s red card. 5 Kevin De Bruyne Made life difficult for the Spurs midfield. Did not deserve to be on losing side. 6 Ilkay G\u00fcndogan Excellent in possession but his penalty was poor. Blazed over an open goal on the stretch. 6 Raheem Sterling Fortunate to escape red after fouling Alli. Should have set up G\u00fcndogan. Out of form. Booked. 5 Sergio Ag\u00fcero Uncharacteristically wasteful in the first half, although he won City\u2019s penalty. Substituted after the red card. 6 Subs Jo\u00e3o Cancelo (for Ag\u00fcero 64) 6, Gabriel Jesus (for Mahrez 72) 6, Bernardo Silva (for Sterling 84) 6.",

But when they did have a man sent off \u2013 Oleksandr Zinchenko for a second bookable offence in the 61st minute \u2013 it was the prompt for Tottenham to throw off the shackles and fire the wildest of turnarounds.</p> <p>Until then, it was difficult to overstate City\u2019s dominance. Sergio Ag\u00fcero missed a clutch of excellent chances and Ilkay Gundogan had a penalty saved by Hugo Lloris as Pep Guardiola\u2019s team set up residence in the Spurs half.

We worked very hard during the week. I\u2019m so pleased for the boys. We can look from the perspective of we were a bit lucky in a couple of situations, they hit a post or they missed a good chance, but from the other perspective we were very unlucky that the VAR didn\u2019t decide for a Sterling red card, which was a red card. And from that moment it was a completely different game if we played 75 minutes against 10 men. But my boys, very well organised, great effort, great discipline. We know how we can score goals. We know how we cannot score goals. So we were waiting for our chances. One player less is not a big deal for them, the way they move the ball. But we had our chances to score and we did, and a very important three points for us.</p> <p>That\u2019s Man City. It\u2019s the champion, a fantastic team, with players technically really good. We don\u2019t have the capacity to play with a front man that holds the ball and allows us to come out of pressure and to keep more possession. We have only one way to get out and that\u2019s not keeping possession of the ball. City love the ball, they know better than anyone what to do with the ball, so when they have the ball for the majority of the time it\u2019s hard. But fantastic performance, great concentration.</p> <p>I think the boys were phenomenal in their effort. The goalkeeper saved a penalty. I think it was god\u2019s will, because it\u2019s not a penalty.

It would have been another rival.\u201d As for Mourinho: \u201cWith him I remember more the three years we fought on the same side, working together at the same club. I remember more that than what people can speak about rivalry. Then of course Barcelona and Real Madrid, Inter and Barcelona in the Champions League, City and United, now Tottenham and City. A new chapter for us because it\u2019s the first time, Tottenham against Manchester City with us. Never Jose and Josep, like he is in Catalan. For me, it\u2019s a game I want to win because I want my team to win and we need points. No more than that.\u201d </p> <p>He has a point, though: Spurs really do need points. They are currently eighth, and a win today would rocket them up to fifth, but they are only three points away from 13th, and they have only won once all season against a team currently in the top half (at seventh-placed Wolves in December). They will be able to call on the exciting Dutch forward Steven Bergwijn, signed this week, in their quest to secure another one. As for City, they don\u2019t really need points, being as they are an extremely comfortable 15 points from dropping out of the Champions League places and an extremely distant 23 points from the top of the table. Still, points are nice. They\u2019d probably enjoy a few more points.</p> <p>Ever the incorrigible optimist, I\u2019m expecting a cracker. Welcome!</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That was wild. For most of it City were excellent, and Spurs rode their luck. There were successful penalty claims, unsuccessful penalty claims, possible red cards, actual red cards, saves, woodwork-bothering, VAR controversies. Spurs scored one excellent goal, another deflection-assisted one, and then they rode their luck a bit more. It was excellent entertainment from first to last. Thanks for sharing it with me. Bye! David Hytner has filed his match report, and here it is: Manchester City might have played for 78 minutes of this see-saw game with 10 men only for Raheem Sterling to get away with a horribly late tackle on Dele Alli. But when they did have a man sent off \u2013 Oleksandr Zinchenko for a second bookable offence in the 61st minute \u2013 it was the prompt for Tottenham to throw off the shackles and fire the wildest of turnarounds. Until then, it was difficult to overstate City\u2019s dominance. Sergio Ag\u00fcero missed a clutch of excellent chances and Ilkay Gundogan had a penalty saved by Hugo Lloris as Pep Guardiola\u2019s team set up residence in the Spurs half. Yet profligacy has been City\u2019s enemy on numerous occasions this season and they could count the cost once again. Much more here: Mourinho has an inevitable gripe about the depth of his squad: \u201cI have to say, if I have on the bench fresh attacking players, I can do things that at this moment I cannot do, so my attacking players have to go until their limit.\u201d He says they are \u201cin trouble\u201d for the FA Cup replay against Southampton on Wednesday, when Bergwijn will not be able to play, and Dele Alli might be knackered. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is delighted. Well, I assume he\u2019s delighted, he looks like he\u2019s just been slapped around the face with a gurnard. We had good work. We worked very hard during the week. I\u2019m so pleased for the boys. We can look from the perspective of we were a bit lucky in a couple of situations, they hit a post or they missed a good chance, but from the other perspective we were very unlucky that the VAR didn\u2019t decide for a Sterling red card, which was a red card. And from that moment it was a completely different game if we played 75 minutes against 10 men. But my boys, very well organised, great effort, great discipline. We know how we can score goals. We know how we cannot score goals. So we were waiting for our chances. One player less is not a big deal for them, the way they move the ball. But we had our chances to score and we did, and a very important three points for us. That\u2019s Man City. It\u2019s the champion, a fantastic team, with players technically really good. We don\u2019t have the capacity to play with a front man that holds the ball and allows us to come out of pressure and to keep more possession. We have only one way to get out and that\u2019s not keeping possession of the ball. City love the ball, they know better than anyone what to do with the ball, so when they have the ball for the majority of the time it\u2019s hard. But fantastic performance, great concentration. I think the boys were phenomenal in their effort. The goalkeeper saved a penalty. I think it was god\u2019s will, because it\u2019s not a penalty. But our goalkeeper is fantastic and he is there to try to give us points. This is true, obviously. City will have played away at Leicester, Manchester United and Chelsea (among other fixtures, obviously) before Liverpool kick off against Palace, a few hours after the final whistle blows on that Chelsea game. Steven Bergwijn has a little chat with Sky: It\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s a dream from me that\u2019s come true. I\u2019m so happy to be here and make a goal for the Spurs. As a little kid you want to play in the Premier League, and if you can score on your debut it\u2019s unbelievable. 90+6 mins: It\u2019s all over! Here\u2019s a summary of the key statistics: Spurs shots against Manchester City this season: six Spurs goals against Manchester City this season: four Spurs points against Manchester City this season: four Manchester City shots against Spurs this season: 48 Manchester City goals against Spurs this season: two Manchester City points against Spurs this season: one 90+5 mins: City hit the bar! Bernardo Silva bursts down the right and crosses, and Davinson Sanchez heads against his own woodwork! 90+4 mins: Rodri gets a booking, for fouling Lo Celso. 90+2 mins: Son ruins the statistical perfection of Tottenham\u2019s victory by having a shot that doesn\u2019t go in. 90+1 mins: I think that if Liverpool win all their games from here, they would win the league at home to Crystal Palace on 21 March. 90+1 mins: There will be about five minutes of stoppage time. 90 mins: Bernardo Silva\u2019s excellent cross from the left finds Jesus, but he can\u2019t get any pace on his header and Lloris saves again. 89 mins: Another couple of shots for City. First Bernardo Silva\u2019s effort hits Dier on the head, then De Bruyne\u2019s curler from way out on the left is tipped over by Lloris. 85 mins: Son\u2019s goal came courtesy of a hefty deflection off Fernandinho that I didn\u2019t spot at the time. When it\u2019s not your day, it\u2019s not your day. 83 mins: Sterling seems to have tweaked his left hamstring. He goes off, with Bernardo Silva coming on, and Eric Dier replaces Moura for Spurs. 82 mins: Spurs work the ball to the edge of the City area. Like me, though, they clearly think the two-shots-two-goals thing is hilarious, so rather than have another go they pass backwards a bit and then give it away. 80 mins: Cancelo goes down the left and pulls back to De Bruyne, but the ball is just too far in front of the Belgian. City have basically played excellently. They\u2019ve made chances, had shots, and restricted their opponents to scraps. They are, however, two goals and a man down. 78 mins: Sterling tries to lift the ball to De Bruyne, who was free on the left of Tottenham\u2019s penalty area, but Aurier does an unusual diving defensive header to send it looping into the air, and Lloris catches as it comes back down. 77 mins: City win a free-kick, which is lifted into the area by De Bruyne, and Fernandinho\u2019s half-volley deflects wide. 75 mins: City, still zipping the ball around, push forward, but then Jesus fouls Sanchez and that\u2019s the end of that. 72 mins: City bring Gabriel Jesus on, and take Mahrez off. A second shot, and a second goal for Spurs! Ndombele finds him on the edge of the area, and he turns onto his right foot before shooting low and hard inside the near post! 70 mins: A double substitution for Spurs: Tanguy Ndombele comes on for Alli, and Erik Lamela comes on for Bergwijn. City\u2019s corner is headed away. 68 mins: Bergwijn is on the turf. City attack anyway, with the home fans booing their lack of charity, and win a corner. The goalscoring Dutchman appears to have a spot of cramp. 66 mins: Lo Celso is booked for a foul on Walker. 66 mins: City\u2019s have had 44 shots against Spurs in the league this year; Spurs have had four against City. Spurs are 3-2 up on aggregate. 64 mins: A corner is headed clear to Moura, 25 yards out, who might have shot but instead chips a pass to Bergwijn, who chests down and volleys into the corner from just inside the area! Incredible! City have had 13 shots without scoring; Spurs have just smashed in their first! 63 mins: Gabriel Jesus has sat back down. Joao Cancelo is being readied now. 61 mins: Spurs try to break after a terrible City corner, and Zinchenko shoulder-barges Winks to stop it. It\u2019s his second yellow card, so he\u2019s got to go! 60 mins: Gabriel Jesus is being readied. 58 mins: A fine City move, but after De Bruyne finds Mahrez overlapping, his pull-back goes behind his teammates. 55 mins: Spurs briefly threaten to get into a position from which they might have an actual shot, but by the time Moura passes Alli is offside. 53 mins: A brief lull while everyone present comes to terms with the madness they have just witnessed. 49 mins: An open goal, and City can\u2019t find it! Sterling is played in; Lloris comes out and runs into Tanganga, the ball breaking to Aguero. His first-time shot is on its way to goal when Alderweireld hooks it clear, but it drops to Sterling. He squares to Gundogan - not a perfect pass, forcing his teammate to stretch - who blazes over! \u201cPinball, but no wizards,\u201d says Martin Tyler, which is the perfect summary. 47 mins: In their first three halves of league football against Tottenham this season Manchester City have had 41 shots, and Spurs have had three. The aggregate score is 2-2. (Thanks to Phil Grey for reminding me of the stats from August\u2019s game) 46 mins: Peeeeep! The players are back out and play is back under way. Both lineups are unchanged. I see Ryan\u2019s point here: the contact looks horrible in slow motion. There was no violence, no lunging, no losing control, but even so it must have been a close call. I\u2019ve seen every replay Sky has to show me, and I still have no idea if Sterling was caught by Lloris in the moments after the penalty. On the original penalty decision, one thing I don\u2019t know is whether everything that happened in the game during the two minutes that VAR was checking replays - passes, possession, whatever - will remain in official statistics, or whether that period of football and everything that occurred during it has been retrospectively deleted. \u201cI\u2019m confused and was hoping you can help me out,\u201d writes JR. \u201cWhat sport am I watching?\u201d Refereeing. The greatest of all sports. 45+5 mins: The game is, somehow, goalless at the break. 45+4 mins: Mahrez lifts an excellent pass to Sterling, running into the area. He squares to Aguero, but Aurier throws a leg out to block, and then the Argentinian slams the ball wide of the near post. It is City\u2019s ninth shot of the half; Spurs have had one. 45+2 mins: Zinchenko has the most off-target shot of the night. More cheers from the crowd. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be four minutes or so. Replays of the penalty show that Lloris was off his line when it was taken, but not significantly, and lord knows the referee had other things to be looking at. 45 mins: The free-kick eventually leads to a corner, which is poor from Son and cleared. 43 mins: The atmosphere has turned wild. Son, now playing to the left, is fouled, and Spurs have an attacking free-kick. 42 mins: The referee walks around with his yellow card for a while. I think Alderweireld and Zinchenko were the ones he showed it to. 41 mins: That looked no less penaltyish than the first one, but this time VAR is unimpressed! 40 mins: Lloris saves the penalty! The ball rolls loose, and Lloris and Sterling race for it. Sterling gets there first, and goes down! The referee gives a goal kick! 39 mins: Play continues for two full minutes, before Dean indicates that VAR has awarded the penalty! 36 mins: Big penalty shout for City! The ball rebounds to Gundogan, who could have shot but instead feeds Sterling, who is closed down, and then via a couple more ricochets it goes to Aguero, but Aurier slides in from the side to dispossess. Aguero goes down, but Dean makes a \u201cgot the ball\u201d sign with his hands and play goes on. 35 mins: Bergwijn crosses from the right towards Alli, but Walker gets the top of his head to it. 33 mins: A yellow card for Kyle Walker, who stops Moura from getting away. The decision proves quite popular with the home crowd. 30 mins: City continue to press. For the moment De Bruyne has moved to the right and Mahrez infield, and for a couple of minutes the ball is repeatedly worked to one or other of them in dangerous areas, but the home defence holds firm. 27 mins: City hit the post! Sanchez gives the ball away to Mahrez, who instantly feeds the run of Aguero, who bursts into the area and passes towards the near post, but Lloris flings out his left foot and it scrapes his studs, hits the base of the stanchion and rebounds to safety! 26 mins: A long ball is played up to Mahrez, who controls and then stops playing. Perhaps he heard a whistle from the crowd, because there was no offside decision, and in the ensuing confusion the ball is cleared into De Bruyne, but Spurs get away with it! 25 mins: De Bruyne\u2019s 25-yard drive flies straight into Lloris\u2019s arms. 22 mins: Another pass to Son on the right. This time Zinchenko slides in to take the ball, but this is where Tottenham are looking most dangerous. 20 mins: Fernandinho has had two significant defensive duels so far, and he\u2019s won both of them. Most recently he keeps up with Son and eventually dispossessed him. 18 mins: Spurs play the ball through for Son, but Ederson is out of his area like a rocket-fuelled hare, and clears to safety. 16 mins: Good work from both left-backs, with Tanganga bursting down the left before moving the ball infield, and Zinchenko anticipating well to end the attack. 14 mins: Sterling\u2019s foot landed on Alli\u2019s ankle, but there was no violent intent. It looks quite nasty in the replays, but not nasty enough to be worth more than a booking. Mourinho, having seen the challenge in slow motion, is not gruntled. 13 mins: Sterling is booked for a high tackle on Dele Alli, and VAR is going to have a closer look to see if a red card would have been more appropriate. 12 mins: The ball is chipped down Tottenham\u2019s left, but Otamendi manages to win the race with Bergwijn and send it back towards his keeper. But as Ederson waits for it, Moura attacks, and he very nearly takes it past the keeper for an open goal. 10 mins: De Bruyne\u2019s pass through to Sterling goes to Serge Aurier, but then deflects off his shin into Sterling\u2019s path and the Englishman runs away from the defence and into the penalty area before going to ground, with Aurier breathing down his neck. The referee waves play on. 9 mins: Aguero has his first two shots of the day, and hits defenders with both of them. 8 mins: Another good move from City, which ends with Mahrez controlling Rodri\u2019s pass and touching the ball forward for De Bruyne, who instead of blasting a low cross into ye mixer blasts a high shot well wide of the near post. 5 mins: A long ball from Alderweireld finds Alli breaking beyond the City defence. He controls, but the linesman raises his flag and Alli shoots limply at Ederson, but replays suggest the goal would probably have stood. 3 mins: City keep the ball for a while, before finally lifting it into the area, where it\u2019s touched back into the patch of Aguero, who tries to take on a couple of defenders and is dispossessed. 2 mins: Bergwijn is on Tottenham\u2019s left, with Son on the right and Moura in the middle. 1 min: Peeeeeeep! Manchester City, clad all in black, get the game started. Out they come! Hands have been shaken and anthems played, and action is now just moments away. Tottenham\u2019s players are in the tunnel, and just waiting for their opponents to turn up. Jose Mourinho has a pre-match chat with Sky: The thinking? The thinking is to try to be offensive, to try to score goals to win the game, without having a clear striker, a clear target man. So we go with the qualities that we have. Fast players, creative players, with good dynamic, with good mobility, and hopefully we can reach our objective with them. Bergwijn was playing with PSV, he\u2019s fit, he had a week of work to try to understand us better, for us to try to understand him. We don\u2019t have many options. Lamela is on the bench but not 100%. So we go with Bergwijn, with Son, with Dele Alli, with Lucas, with Lo Celso. We go with all of them. Pep Guardiola has a chat. He says Laporte is \u201cmuch better\u201d and will hopefully be back next weekend: We\u2019ll try to win the game, knowing who you are and the opponent. That\u2019s the idea, as always. They are physically sytrong, they have quality in the middle and a lot of pace up front. Experienced back. Always a tough team.\u201d Here\u2019s photographic evidence of Steven Bergwijn\u2019s existence. He\u2019s pacey, direct and very exciting, and though it\u2019s not always easy to translate Eredivisie form to Premier League form, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing him try. He\u2019s scored five and created 10 in 16 league appearances this season, so scoring or creating very nearly a goal a game. Not entirely (remotely) relevant to this game, but this is surely the VAR moment of the day/week/year/whatever: So by my calculations Vertonghen, Lamela and Sessegnon all drop out of the side that beat Norwich in Tottenham\u2019s last league game, with Tanganga, Sanchez and Bergwijn coming in. City bring Gundogan and Aguero in and leave Jesus and Laporte out. Team news is in, and this is the shape of it: Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Tanganga, Winks, Lo Celso, Bergwijn, Alli, Son, Lucas Moura. Subs: Vertonghen, Lamela, Dier, Sessegnon, Gazzaniga, Ndombele, Fernandes. Man City: Ederson, Walker, Fernandinho, Otamendi, Zinchenko, De Bruyne, Rodri, Gundogan, Mahrez, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Gabriel Jesus, Bernardo Silva, Silva, Joao Cancelo, Foden, Garcia. Referee: Mike Dean. Hello world! Ding ding ding! It\u2019s Guardiola v Mourinho, round 23! \u201cI think with him or without him I try to do my best,\u201d Guardiola said this week. \u201cWithout him, I think I would have done the same. It would have been another rival.\u201d As for Mourinho: \u201cWith him I remember more the three years we fought on the same side, working together at the same club. I remember more that than what people can speak about rivalry. Then of course Barcelona and Real Madrid, Inter and Barcelona in the Champions League, City and United, now Tottenham and City. A new chapter for us because it\u2019s the first time, Tottenham against Manchester City with us. Never Jose and Josep, like he is in Catalan. For me, it\u2019s a game I want to win because I want my team to win and we need points. No more than that.\u201d He has a point, though: Spurs really do need points. They are currently eighth, and a win today would rocket them up to fifth, but they are only three points away from 13th, and they have only won once all season against a team currently in the top half (at seventh-placed Wolves in December). They will be able to call on the exciting Dutch forward Steven Bergwijn, signed this week, in their quest to secure another one. As for City, they don\u2019t really need points, being as they are an extremely comfortable 15 points from dropping out of the Champions League places and an extremely distant 23 points from the top of the table. Still, points are nice. They\u2019d probably enjoy a few more points. Ever the incorrigible optimist, I\u2019m expecting a cracker. Welcome!",

Even the elected chamber uses an archaic and unrepresentative system, allowing a government that lost the popular vote to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. It favours Scotland over England. No European ruling opposed an English parliament or set out the Barnett formula. It is Westminster that left the English behind. It trashed local government. The first tranche of changes, though a year after Britain joined Europe, actually made us less like continental nations. Some reform was needed, but even from 1974 to 1994 there were too few districts and too many empty town halls. Things have got worse since. It failed to electrify. Electrified rail flourishes on the continent \u2013 and under Scotland\u2019s devolved government. Westminster has left Oxford, Bristol, Leicester and Nottingham without electrified lines and Sheffield with only its tramways. Even Crossrail has been repeatedly delayed. So if the left-behind think Brexit has solved anything, they will soon find otherwise. Charles Gilman Mitcham, Surrey \u2022 I want to thank Ian McEwan for expressing how I feel, both for myself and my children. I really do feel like a outsider, a \u201cleft-behind\u201d and fear for my children\u2019s future. I live in a coastal, typically deprived area as a single parent. Always a remainer who believes in sharing values and inclusion. What is left for us when all around us are people are celebrating a future I see as a huge mistake?

Her recollection is that this was not part of our original conditions of membership, but she is incorrect. Harold Wilson referred to the opportunity for political unity as early as 2 May 1967 (my source is Medium.com, which in turn quotes Hansard). Meanwhile, the Ideas on Europe website references a government <a href=\"http://eu-rope.ideasoneurope.eu/2018/11/04/britain-wasnt-misled-in-1975/\" title=\"\">pamphlet</a> from 1975 about why it wanted to remain, including the wish to have a \u201csay in the future economic and political development of the common market\u201d.</p> <p>The strange thing isn\u2019t that we joined in the first place. The strange thing is that leave made such an iconic success of such a claim that had no basis in fact \u2013 and went ahead and won anyway.<br><strong>Guy Clapperton</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Gisela Stuart argues that people voted to leave the EU for reasons of \u201ccommunity, identity and belonging\u201d rather than on economic grounds. She is quite right. Likewise, the core of the remain case was built on precisely the same principles, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/01/brexit-pointless-masochistic-ambition-history-done\" title=\"\">as Ian McEwan so elegantly expounds</a> in the same Guardian issue. The fundamental gap between leavers and remainers will always be unbridgeable because the two sides have antithetical views about the very meaning of being European. Even if the post-Brexit British economy flourishes as never before that will not diminish by one whit the ethical and philosophical case for us to get back into the EU at the earliest opportunity.<br><strong>Robin Wendt</strong><br><em>Chester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Gisela Stuart is entitled to her opinion, and hats off to the Guardian for allowing her the space to express it. She does, however, abuse your hospitality by playing fast and loose with the English language. When \u201cwe\u201d joined the common market in 1973, she was not yet one of \u201cus\u201d but still a German national.

      "bodyText": "Gisela Stuart is mistaken when she says Britain started to drift away from the EU when political union became a major issue (This was a divorce long in the making, Journal, 1 February). Her recollection is that this was not part of our original conditions of membership, but she is incorrect. Harold Wilson referred to the opportunity for political unity as early as 2 May 1967 (my source is Medium.com, which in turn quotes Hansard). Meanwhile, the Ideas on Europe website references a government pamphlet from 1975 about why it wanted to remain, including the wish to have a \u201csay in the future economic and political development of the common market\u201d. The strange thing isn\u2019t that we joined in the first place. The strange thing is that leave made such an iconic success of such a claim that had no basis in fact \u2013 and went ahead and won anyway. Guy Clapperton London \u2022 Gisela Stuart argues that people voted to leave the EU for reasons of \u201ccommunity, identity and belonging\u201d rather than on economic grounds. She is quite right. Likewise, the core of the remain case was built on precisely the same principles, as Ian McEwan so elegantly expounds in the same Guardian issue. The fundamental gap between leavers and remainers will always be unbridgeable because the two sides have antithetical views about the very meaning of being European. Even if the post-Brexit British economy flourishes as never before that will not diminish by one whit the ethical and philosophical case for us to get back into the EU at the earliest opportunity. Robin Wendt Chester \u2022 Gisela Stuart is entitled to her opinion, and hats off to the Guardian for allowing her the space to express it. She does, however, abuse your hospitality by playing fast and loose with the English language. When \u201cwe\u201d joined the common market in 1973, she was not yet one of \u201cus\u201d but still a German national. Nor does she make clear if she will retain her German passport and therefore her European citizenship now we have been stripped of \u201cours\u201d.

The original lineup featuring Allen and Burnham reformed in 2004, and toured internationally in 2005. In 2011 a new incarnation of the group released Content, which won widespread critical acclaim. In 2015 they released What Happens Next, but after a split with King, Gill was now the sole original member. Happy Now appeared in 2019, though Gang of Four were now a three-piece. Gill also enjoyed a successful career as a producer. His credits included the Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 eponymous debut album (1984), the Stranglers\u2019 Written in Red (1997), the Jesus Lizard\u2019s Blue (1998), Killing Joke (2003) and Therapy?\u2019s Crooked Timber (2009). In 1999 he married the journalist Catherine Mayer, who co-founded the Women\u2019s Equality party in the UK. She survives him, as does his brother, Martin. \u2022 Andrew James Dalrymple Gill, guitarist, born 1 January 1956; died 1 February 2020",

And in the ostentatious style of a family accustomed to getting its way, they were married in a closed-door ceremony in the cathedral of Culiac\u00e1n \u2013 the city at the centre of the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s criminal empire. The wedding took place on 25 January, according to the Mexican newspaper Reforma, which scandalised Mexico with the headline: \u201cCathedral locked down for the wedding of El Chapo\u2019s daughter.\u201d Photos and videos posted on social media showed the bride arriving at the Culiac\u00e1n cathedral, which had been cordoned off with yellow police tape, and a reception featuring popular Mexican musicians and the newlyweds taking in a private pyrotechnics show. To seasoned Mexican observers, the wedding once again offered an uncomfortable reminder of organised crime\u2019s influence in many pockets of the country, its ability to ingratiate itself into society at large and its relationship with the Catholic church, which has long been accused of laundering drug cartel funds through the collection plate. It also reminded Mexicans of El Chapo\u2019s lingering legacy in Sinaloa state, where his criminal empire provided employment and narco charity to many, and his children have succeeded him at the helm of the Sinaloa cartel. \u201cIt is a reminder of how deeply embedded and powerful the Guzm\u00e1n family remains in Sinaloa\u2019s society.

Even with El Chapo locked up in Colorado, the Guzm\u00e1n family has maintained a high profile and has tried to cash in on his image. El Chapo\u2019s wife Emma Coronel debuted last fall in a reality show on VH1.

In an increasingly acrimonious dispute, backers of the campaign to repatriate regalia belonging to Crowfoot of the Blackfoot Nation were told by officials at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM) in Exeter that \u201cno one wants to get their hands dirty\u201d when it came to the sensitive question of repatriating looted artefacts held in UK arts institutions. The resistance to attempts at repatriating items belonging to Crowfoot, who signed an 1877 treaty with crown forces, has demoralised those at a Blackfoot-run cultural and educational centre near to where he is buried, and which first lodged a formal repatriation request in 2015. \u201cWe are currently in our second decade of repatriation efforts, with no end in sight,\u201d the Guardian was told by Stephen Yellow Old Woman, general manager of Blackfoot Crossing Historical Park (BCHP). The centre has a purpose-built room ready to house the relics, which RAMM purchased for \u00a310 in 1904 from the family of Cecil Denny, an English-born member of the Canadian mounted police, who was one of the signatories of the treaty with Crowfoot. \u201cIt is like Siksika and Crowfoot are currently in a long dark tunnel with no end in sight,\u201d added Yellow Old Woman, who dates the beginning of the repatriation initiative back to 2008. The impasse over the return of the sacred indigenous relics comes as the Arts Council has tendered for help in drawing up new guidelines aimed at reshaping the British museum sector\u2019s wider approach to repatriation requests after European countries including France and Germany have committed to handing back objects. Multiple disputes over items in British museums include west African treasures plundered by British forces, from the Parthenon marbles at the British Museum, a long-running focus of Greek demands, and more recent requests by Gibraltar for the return of Neanderthal remains. Efforts to repatriate the Blackfoot regalia, which ranges from Crowfoot\u2019s cream-hued buckskin shirt and leggings to a dee hide necklace strung with grizzly bear claws, have been backed by Alberta\u2019s provincial premier, Jason Kenney. Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail reported that he had written to British officials to say that the repatriation \u201cwould be regarded as a great act of reconciliation with Canada\u2019s indigenous people\u201d. However, RAMM officials told the Blackfoot historical party that the letter from the premier \u201chas no effect whatsoever on how we operate here in the UK\u201d. This reply was \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d, said Yellow Old Woman, who added: \u201cMuch of this whole experience has been shocking to us.\u201d In a document shared with the Guardian, RAMM said the BCHP was not accredited with the Canadian Museums Association and that details needed to be provided about the long-term preservation of returned materials. Details about governance had also been requested \u201cto minimise the risk of competing or conflicting claims for the same material\u201d but negotiations had stalled because not all of the information had been sent by the BCHP. RAMM has now written directly to the Siksika tribal council, elected representatives of the Siksika nation and part of the Blackfoot confederacy, proposing that the repatriation request is considered by Exeter city council\u2019s executive committee in June. The letter also asked for information on the governance relationship between BCHP and the tribal council, plus sought clarification about who would have future ownership of the regalia. It added: \u201cIn recent months, debates on decolonising Britain\u2019s museums have intensified.

The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said in a statement: \u201cA man has been shot dead by armed police in Streatham following an incident that is being treated as terrorism-related. A number of people are believed to have been stabbed.\u201d \u201cI am in close contact with the Met commissioner and local representatives, and want to thank our police, security and emergency services staff for their swift and courageous response. They truly are the best. \u201cTerrorists seek to divide us and to destroy our way of life \u2013 here in London we were never let them succeed.\u201d Boris Johnson, the prime minister, responded to the incident on Twitter, saying: \u201cThank you to all emergency services responding to the incident in Streatham, which the police have now declared as terrorism-related. My thoughts are with the injured and all those affected.\u201d The local Labour MP, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, also responded, saying: \u201cVery concerned to hear about the incident on Streatham High St. My thoughts are with those injured, their families and those who witnessed the attack.\u201d Video footage posted by witnesses showed a huge police presence on Streatham High Road, as shoppers were held back by police officers. Paramedics and ambulances attended the scene, and police helicopters circled overhead. The Met warned people to stay away from the area, tweeting: \u201cPlease avoid the area while the emergency services deal with the incident in Streatham\u201d. Graham Norton, the strategic commander at the London Ambulance Service, said: \u201cWe were called at 1.58pm today to reports of an incident in Streatham High Road. We are working closely with the other emergency services and are treating a number of patients at the scene. \u201cWe worked closely with the other emergency services and sent a number of resources including five ambulance crews, an advanced paramedic practitioner, an incident response officer and a motorcycle responder, with the first of our medics arriving in four minutes. We also dispatched London\u2019s Air Ambulance. \u201cWe treated three patients for injuries at the scene, and took all three people to hospital.\u201d Anna Norman-Walker, the rector of St Leonard\u2019s Church in Streatham, tweeted: \u201cCurrently situation in the Streatham rectory with police tape both sides of us \u2026 Prayers for our wonderful police who are doing such a remarkable job in a frightening situation\u201d. Richard Mustonen-Smith, 59, a response pastor for Ascension Trust, has lived in the area all his life. He told PA Media: \u201cI\u2019m shocked it\u2019s happened in Streatham. I\u2019ve been here all my life. We\u2019re always getting accidents down here but not this. \u201cMy grandson was in the Odeon and they got told to go out the back because there was a bomb. They got them to go out of the back of the cinema. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a member of your family so close to you you don\u2019t expect it. You\u2019re always worried about your family being on the streets but this is even worse.\u201d",

One is believed to be in a serious condition. The attacker is thought to have been wearing a fake suicide vest made of objects designed to look like an improvised explosive device. The attacker is believed by police to have been motivated by an Islamist terrorist ideology. Plain-clothes surveillance officers appear to have been in the area. An investigation will be carried out by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), as is required by law when police use lethal force.",

      "bodyText": "When Labour announced HS2 in 2010, the 153-page launch document contained one mention of wildlife. Only \u201ca few\u201d protected wildlife sites would be affected, it said. There would be a line of concrete and steel crossing middle England, but any wild space that was destroyed would be compensated for with new trees, woods and ponds \u2013 \u201cno net loss of biodiversity\u201d, in eco-speak. But critics say HS2\u2019s commitment to biodiversity has weakened, at a time when concern is rising over mass extinction and the continuing decline of wildlife in Britain. HS2 now says it will \u201cseek to achieve a no net loss in biodiversity at a route-wide level as far as reasonably practicable\u201d \u2013 in other words, an aspiration at best. Since HS2 was first devised, the environment has been placed at the heart of planning decisions, with the principle of \u201cbiodiversity net gain\u201d. The national planning policy framework, which governs planning decisions, asks that developments ranging from housing estates to roads deliver measurable improvements for wildlife. The government\u2019s environment bill is expected to enshrine \u201cnet gain\u201d in law. But according to the Wildlife Trusts, even HS2\u2019s much more modest \u201cno net loss\u201d is unachievable under current plans. HS2 has undertaken the UK\u2019s largest ever survey of British wildlife to determine what is imperilled and how it could ameliorate its loss. Although formal construction has yet to get under way, \u201cenabling works\u201d have begun. Ancient trees where bats roost in summer have been removed while bats are absent over winter (it is illegal to disturb roosting bats), and miles of hedgerows have been grubbed up so roads and utilities including gas mains and pylons can be diverted. No one is counting exactly how much hedgerow has been destroyed. As well as being a habitat for nesting birds in the spring, many hedges in winter contain eggs of rare butterflies such as the brown hairstreak. HS2 will damage swaths of countryside where wildlife lives, although the project\u2019s proponents point out it represents an efficient land-take, potentially transporting as many people as a 10-lane motorway. The Wildlife Trusts calculate that HS2 presents a significant risk to five internationally protected wildlife sites, 33 sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs, the gold standard of wildlife habitat), 108 ancient woodlands and 693 local wildlife sites covering 9,696 hectares. These calculations include sites within 500 metres of the high-speed line that could experience disruption, such as from the relocation of utilities or noise pollution, but may not be directly affected. HS2\u2019s figures for directly affected sites are lower: it says 14 SSSIs, 62 ancient woodlands and 204 local wildlife sites will be affected. The London-Birmingham stage includes 25 miles of tunnel, 140 bridges and underpasses and 16 \u201cgreen\u201d bridges for wildlife. New habitat will include specially constructed newt ponds created in advance so wildlife has a place to move to. Opposition to HS2 has hardened since these compensation efforts have taken shape. Thousands of new trees died in Warwickshire after the hot summer of 2018; HS2 said it was more cost-effective to replant than water them. The Wildlife Trusts and HS2\u2019s own ecologists agree that the new line will provide a barrier to the movement of some birds, mammals and insects. Species particularly vulnerable to train strikes include low-flying barn owls and rare bats. There remain unresolved questions about the fate of chalk aquifers in the Chilterns and underground streams supplying drinking water, as well as ponds and wetlands. The loss of ancient woodland areas, continuously wooded since at least 1600, is particularly controversial. HS2 argues that only small portions of 62 ancient woodlands are affected, and 85% of these will remain. The Woodland Trust\u2019s calculation of 56 lost hectares on the London-Birmingham and Crewe stages amounts to 0.018% of Britain\u2019s remaining 308,000 hectares of ancient woodland. HS2 has a \u00a37m woodlands fund ((less than 0.007% of its projected \u00a3106bn total cost) supporting the creation of 116 hectares of new woodland and the restoration of 159 hectares of ancient woodland as compensation. HS2 may only take fragments of woodlands but in cases such as Glyn Davies wood it is removing the best bits, such as ancient boundary trees. Ancient woodland is considered irreplaceable by Natural England, the government\u2019s conservation watchdog. It takes at least 100 years for new woods to reach maturity.

More people might drive to HS2 \u201cparkway\u201d stations. And by connecting airports more effectively in London, Birmingham and Manchester, HS2 could lead to an increase in flights. If HS2 cuts demand for domestic flights, says Friends of the Earth, that could simply encourage the aviation industry to switch domestic flight slots to more profitable, and carbon-intensive, international routes.</p> \n<p>HS2 could be made less carbon intensive. Critics such as Berkeley point out that if HS2 was not built to such a high specification (with top speeds supposedly in excess of continental high speed rail), emissions would be reduced both in operation and construction; it wouldn\u2019t require carbon intensive concrete slab-track, for instance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"152375cede08f34dad6ebf7b66f6fdfbfa3f0ea6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/152375cede08f34dad6ebf7b66f6fdfbfa3f0ea6/0_0_5334_3201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An anti-HS2 sign sits in the ancient South Cubbington wood which will be part felled to make way for the HS2 line.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>An independent <a href=\"http://www.greengauge21.net/the-carbon-impacts-of-hs2/\">report by the rail consultants Greengauge</a> in 2012 said HS2\u2019s sustainability would be maximised by reducing its top speed, fully using freed-up capacity on the existing rail network, and creating city-centre stations rather than edge-of-town parkways. Supporters claim HS2\u2019s plans for parkway stations are already morphing into \u201csustainable urban extensions\u201d with high-density housing and tramways.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, HS2\u2019s future emissions will depend on wider \u2013 and more joined-up \u2013 transport and energy policies. It would use less carbon if there was a decarbonisation of electricity supply (rather than another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/30/uk-sued-for-approving-europes-biggest-gas-power-station\">dash for gas</a>), and coherent national policies to reduce car use and air travel. </p> \n<p>Friends of the Earth and other critics highlight the<a href=\"https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk/insight/opportunity-costs-hs2\"> \u201copportunity cost\u201d of HS2</a>: its \u00a3106bn price (at least \u00a35bn a year for 20 years) will lead to less investment in more effective carbon-saving transport, such as regional rail, buses, cycling and walking. Berkeley concluded that electrifying existing railways would have a much greater environmental benefit. Friends of the Earth suggest an even less glamorous low-carbon option: making all UK buses free would cost \u00a33bn a year.</p>",

A 2019 report for the High Speed Rail Group (HSRIL), which represents companies with an interest in high-speed rail, estimates construction could be reduced by 20% to 30% with low-carbon innovations, such as hydrogen-powered floodlights and hybrid excavators. HS2\u2019s calculations show its emissions will be offset by the wider decarbonisation of transport it helps create. Some road freight will move to rail as HS2 will enable the wider rail network to take more freight. There will also be a \u201cmodal shift\u201d \u2013 people choosing to travel by HS2 instead of driving or flying \u2013 but this is likely to be small. The Department for Transport suggests only 1% of HS2 passengers will be people who would have flown, and 4% those who would have driven. Some analysts argue that HS2 has presented an overly pessimistic carbon-saving forecast because it is obliged by law to give worst-case scenarios. The HSRILG report points out HS2\u2019s forecasts of 4% and 1% are based on assuming that driving and flying become more affordable while rail fares increase above inflation. In practice, the European average for high speed rail modal shift is 15% from cars and 30% from planes. Furthermore, HS2\u2019s forecasts do not include carbon-saving from increased use of local passenger rail, with HS2 freeing up lines such as the west coast mainline to provide better local services. Julia King, the deputy chair of the committee on climate change, reviewed HS2\u2019s carbon forecasts for Tony Berkeley\u2019s minority report on HS2 and judged them \u201csensible and conservative\u201d \u2013 they do not include highly speculative future scenarios, such as HS2 leading to fewer new roads. If HS2 was well integrated with the European high speed network (and critics say it is not, because it does not connect to HS1) it could become part of a European-wide system saving up to 5m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050 if all journeys under 1,000km moved to rail. But Lord Berkeley and other critics argue there are risks that HS2 could increase emissions. More people might drive to HS2 \u201cparkway\u201d stations. And by connecting airports more effectively in London, Birmingham and Manchester, HS2 could lead to an increase in flights. If HS2 cuts demand for domestic flights, says Friends of the Earth, that could simply encourage the aviation industry to switch domestic flight slots to more profitable, and carbon-intensive, international routes. HS2 could be made less carbon intensive. Critics such as Berkeley point out that if HS2 was not built to such a high specification (with top speeds supposedly in excess of continental high speed rail), emissions would be reduced both in operation and construction; it wouldn\u2019t require carbon intensive concrete slab-track, for instance. An independent report by the rail consultants Greengauge in 2012 said HS2\u2019s sustainability would be maximised by reducing its top speed, fully using freed-up capacity on the existing rail network, and creating city-centre stations rather than edge-of-town parkways. Supporters claim HS2\u2019s plans for parkway stations are already morphing into \u201csustainable urban extensions\u201d with high-density housing and tramways. Ultimately, HS2\u2019s future emissions will depend on wider \u2013 and more joined-up \u2013 transport and energy policies. It would use less carbon if there was a decarbonisation of electricity supply (rather than another dash for gas), and coherent national policies to reduce car use and air travel. Friends of the Earth and other critics highlight the \u201copportunity cost\u201d of HS2: its \u00a3106bn price (at least \u00a35bn a year for 20 years) will lead to less investment in more effective carbon-saving transport, such as regional rail, buses, cycling and walking. Berkeley concluded that electrifying existing railways would have a much greater environmental benefit. Friends of the Earth suggest an even less glamorous low-carbon option: making all UK buses free would cost \u00a33bn a year.",

      "bodyText": "In 2019 the idea of a millennial and Gen Z \u201csex recession\u201d became fact. Or it became the 2019 version of a fact: something we all (myself included) absorb after reading viral headlines on Facebook. There\u2019s certainly some truth to it. Studies from around the world have shown a moderate decline in sexual activity; a US survey found that between 1991 and 2017, the number of high school students having sexual intercourse dropped from 54% to 40%. In a fascinating cover story, the Atlantic put a name to the phenomenon, and the story stuck: young people are \u201cretreating from intimacy\u201d. This is now being used to explain, and most often criticise, the behaviours of young Australians too. Last year ABC\u2019s national survey Australia Talks found that 40% of people aged 18 to 24 report \u201cnever\u201d having sex. Since then, young people have been lightly mocked on ABC TV, and in the Daily Telegraph. They\u2019ve even been made the subject of an \u201cintervention\u201d-based ad campaign for a condom company. But as clicky as that story sounds, it\u2019s not the whole truth. \u2018Sexual frequency really hasn\u2019t changed\u2019 There are plenty of young people who aren\u2019t having sex. The Australia Talks survey revealed that Gen Z Australians are about as sexually active as people aged 75 and over. Just 37% report having sex once a month or more. This is a huge difference from the current sex habits of millennials: 62% of those aged 24-29 are having sex at least once a month, as are 67% of those in their 30s. But this isn\u2019t proof of generational change. Australian millennials and Gen Xers were actually having slightly less sex in their teenage years than Gen Z is today. Comparative data shows that a female Year 12 student in 2018 was 11.3% more likely to be having penetrative sex than a Year 12 student from 1992. She was also around 10% more likely to have received oral sex than a female student who graduated in 2002. The age of first sexual experience has also stayed pretty steady for decades. \u2019 Dr Richard de Visser, a psychologist and researcher who contributes to the comprehensive Australian Study of Health and Relationships (ASHR), says he is \u201cnot aware of data \u2026 that would support the suggestion that young Australians are having less sex\u201d. Adolescent health expert Dr Melissa Kang agrees: \u201c[Sexual frequency] really hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 and I don\u2019t expect it would.\u201d As both a clinician specialising in young people\u2019s sexuality and a long-time author of Dolly magazine\u2019s \u201cDolly Doctor\u201d column, Kang has, however, observed a loosening of taboos in sexual practice. \u201cThere\u2019s much more inclination to have oral sex prior to intercourse [and] probably a very small increase in heterosexual anal sex.\u201d De Visser also notes that Gen Z is \u201cmore likely to report gay, lesbian, bisexual or other sexual identities\u201d. (In 2018, 39% of students said they were attracted to people of the same or multiple genders). \u201cAwareness of, and positivity towards diversity in sexuality has increased.\u201d The figures that are showing declines in sexual frequency are actually from the general population. After surveying people aged 16 to 69, the 2013 ASHR study found that Australians on the whole were having less sex than a decade prior. Heterosexual couples went from doing it an average of 1.8 times a week to 1.4 times. This follows an international trend. See also: Britain, Sweden, Japan, Finland and the US. But in Australia, De Visser thinks the term \u201csex recession\u201d is \u201cprobably a bit extreme\u201d. He suggests these \u201cslight changes\u201d could be from people \u201cchoosing quality over quantity\u201d, from people being more comfortable saying \u201cno\u201d to a partner, or from an increase in masturbation facilitated by online porn. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that there\u2019s a simple explanation.\u201d Instead of scolding young people for not having sex which they are in fact having, maybe we could look to them to understand the many ways that modern sex is changing. \u2018Sex is celebrated\u2019 Nic, 24, has sex about once a year and isn\u2019t really fussed about having more than that. \u201cIf it happens, it happens,\u201d he says. Sophie*, also 24, feels similarly: \u201cSo many people need sex in their lives, but for me? I really don\u2019t know.\u201d There are many reasons \u2013 social, cultural, religious, medical \u2013 that people (young or old) feel this way. Nic is still looking for \u201cclose, intimate connections with people\u201d but says \u201cthat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean sex\u201d. Sophie, who last had sex three years ago and briefly identified as asexual, says she\u2019s often held back by anxiety and a lack of comfort. In high school, her boyfriend of three years was abusive and their sexual activity (oral sex) was \u201csometimes consensual, sometimes coercive\u201d. \u201cI need more trust than others may [need],\u201d she tells me. For Mia, 21, \u201csex is a crucial part of a relationship\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t need it all day every day, but I feel it\u2019s necessary to create and build the bond I want with my partner.\u201d She is in a predominantly monogamous relationship that has recently gone long-distance \u2013 which means she\u2019s having less sex than usual. \u201cI\u2019d like to have sexual freedom while my partner is gone, but we don\u2019t always see eye to eye or subscribe to the same sexual ethics,\u201d she says. This kind of openness and reference to negotiation around sex seems common. \u201cI think sex is less of a sacred act than it once was,\u201d says Ben, who is 19. \u201cI have so many friends who are in open relationships and the idea of that would totally spin out my parents.\u201d Ben is having sex at least once a month these days, after losing his virginity at schoolies when he was 17 \u2013 \u201cIt was fun and it was silly and I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201d He says in gay culture there can be \u201ca pressure to jump into this hypersexualised world\u201d, but the plus side is he feels totally free to talk about sex with new partners and friends. \u201cSTIs are not taboo at all, and I very rarely feel like any aspect of my sex life would be perceived with judgment.\u201d Nic, who is bisexual, feels the same. \u201c[This generation is] definitely more open and proud of sexuality and sex,\u201d he says. Notably, no one that was approached for this story turned down the opportunity to contribute. \u201cThere\u2019s no slut-shaming. It\u2019s quite the opposite: sex is celebrated.\u201d Things aren\u2019t always so simple for women. Mia, who is also bisexual, is able to talk to her close friends about sex \u201copenly and often\u201d, but says \u201cThere have been countless times where I\u2019ve seen people encourage women to open up, before almost immediately laughing at her expense or calling her a slut when she\u2019s left the room.\u201d Young people are also turning to new sources to learn about sex. \u201cEverything I know about sex is self-taught from reading, YouTube and friends,\u201d Sophie says. She tells me that the recently released season of Netflix series Sex Education features a teen who is asexual. \u201cWe are craving some kind of information or reassurance that we\u2019re not alone.\u201d They may not be in a sex recession, but young people are still trying to figure it out.

Geoff, a Liberal-voting Vietnam veteran turned plumber from western Sydney, challenged Abbott on his policy on marriage equality and his discomfort with gay men like Geoff\u2019s son. Abbott never appeared on Q&amp;A again. Later, when Abbott was PM, Zaky Mallah asked a question on Q&amp;A. Abbott and his office (with a baying Murdoch press) went berserk, banning government MPs from appearing on Q&amp;A and labelling the Q&amp;A audience a \u201clefty lynch mob\u201d. Scott Morrison has followed his lead. In the friendly interviews he prefers with shock jocks, he\u2019s made his disdain for Q&amp;A clear, and consistently refused to appear since taking over as prime minister. Why answer questions from an unfriendly crowd? The answer should be obvious: it\u2019s a democracy, mate. You\u2019re supposed to govern for everyone and that means answering their questions \u2013 even the difficult ones. Q&amp;A succeeded because it created an opportunity that hadn\u2019t existed for ordinary Australians to challenge our politicians directly and measure their responses. We brought together Australian citizens from diverse political and cultural backgrounds to discuss the direction of the nation. There\u2019s been plenty of bickering along the way about what should be debated and who should and shouldn\u2019t get to speak (including, of course, \u201cwhy not me?\u201d). Over the 12 years since Q&amp;A started, social media has pushed into the national debate. In 2009 when we pioneered onscreen tweets, people joined Twitter to take part in #QandA. Now the platform is a political arena in its own right. But television \u2013 mass broadcast media \u2013 still delivers something that social media can\u2019t. A common experience that everyone can share, rather than an echo chamber reinforcement of our own narrow views. After 12 years at Q&amp;A my faith in the power of reasoned discussion to change minds and build a consensus has taken a battering, but I can\u2019t identify any pathway forward that isn\u2019t built on bringing together people with divergent views to listen, debate and discuss. Perhaps after the hiding he\u2019s received since he returned from Hawaii, Morrison will finally see the point in going on Q&amp;A again. Maybe he\u2019ll hope the change of host or the change of executive producer will make it easier. In truth, when Q&amp;A is doing its job, the personnel don\u2019t matter. They\u2019re just there to spread the net wide. It\u2019s the power and passion of the audience that makes Q&amp;A work, whether it\u2019s Geoff the plumber, Ricci (\u201cHow can I \u2018have a go to get a go\u2019?\u201d) Bartels, or even Zaky Mallah. If Q&amp;A is working, the difficult uncomfortable questions for our politicians will keep on coming. Perhaps eventually the PM will realise that you don\u2019t build a nation with photo ops and involuntary handshakes. Australia has some questions for you, Scott. Don\u2019t turn your back. \u2022 Peter McEvoy is the creator and founding executive producer of Q&amp;A.",

      "bodyText": "A group of more than 200 scientists will on Monday urge returning parliamentarians to urgently reduce Australia\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions, and work diplomatically to achieve coordinated global climate action, after a catastrophic summer of fires. In an open letter timed to coincide with the resumption of the parliamentary year in Canberra, the group says scientific evidence unequivocally links human-caused climate change to the increasing risk of frequent and severe bushfires in the Australian landscape. It says that same science tells us \u201cthese extreme events will only grow worse in the future without genuine concerted action to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases\u201d. The letter says the science suggests a need for immediate action to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions, and manage a rapid transition to net zero emissions by 2050. One of the signatories to the open letter, the Australian National University climate scientist Nerilie Abram, says the letter is \u201cthe product of despair as scientists witnessed the deadly fire season unfold\u201d. \u201cScientists have been warning policymakers for decades that climate change would worsen Australia\u2019s fire risk, and yet those warnings have been ignored,\u201d she said. Given the catastrophic summer, with the bushfires triggering a barrage of commentary about the inadequacy of the Morrison government\u2019s current policy, a number of Liberal MPs are returning to Canberra for the opening session parliament with the view that the government needs to do more on climate change and energy policy. Cabinet has also discussed the issue. The strongly worded appeal by scientists comes as a new energy market analysis by Reputex predicts Australia will hit 50% renewable electricity by 2030, despite the lack of a federal energy policy. But it also warns a slump in new investment in wind and solar investment could threaten a continued decline in wholesale electricity prices. Reputex says the current drive to 50% renewables by 2030 is being driven by state renewable energy targets and rooftop solar schemes that are predicted to make higher cost gas and coal-fired power less competitive. It says that transition is expected to deliver a decline in wholesale prices in the national energy market from around $80 per megawatt-hour (/MWh) in 2020 toward $70/MWh over the next three years, which translates as a fall of 15% from today\u2019s levels. But it warns investment in renewable energy plunged by 50% last year compared with the year before, and it predicts that decline will continue \u2013 a development that will put upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices, particularly as major coal-fired facilities begin to close. \u201cIn the absence of an effective policy framework to guide new investment, the decline of our ageing generation fleet will lead to higher electricity prices before the new supply is developed, hurting both businesses and consumers,\u201d the assessment says. In an effort to emphasise a positive message on the issue, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told the ABC on Sunday the Morrison government\u2019s 2030 emissions reduction target of 26% on 2005 levels by 2030 was a floor and not a cap, \u201cand we hope to beat our target\u201d. But while declaring the government wanted to beat the 2030 target, Frydenberg said the target wasn\u2019t going to be adjusted. \u201cWe took to the Australian people a very clear target, so we\u2019re not about to lift that target,\u201d the treasurer said. \u201cWhat we are endeavouring to do is to meet our commitments now.\u201d Frydenberg did not mention that the government intends to use an accounting measure, carryover credits from the Kyoto period, to meet the 2030 target, with carryover credits, not practical abatement, supplying about half the pollution reduction load to 2030. The treasurer also played up the government\u2019s commitment to renewable energy. Frydenberg said on Sunday that more than $7bn was invested in renewables last year. He omitted the Coalition\u2019s efforts under Tony Abbott to gut the renewable energy target (RET), and the fact the RET winds down from this year \u2013 with policy uncertainty triggering the decline in new investment captured in the Reputex analysis.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Suzy Wrack\u2019s report from the Academy Stadium. Thanks for reading, see you next time. And this is how the table now stands. Chelsea will go top if they win their game in hand. A big win for Brighton today over Everton, to move away from the relegation zone. Just four matches with Liverpool v Birmingham and Tottenham v Bristol City being postponed because of waterlogged pitches. Brighton 1-0 Everton Chelsea 8-0 West Ham Man City 2-1 Arsenal Reading 1-1 Manchester United Six years, six trophies, here comes Nick Cushing. The best six years of my career, and some of the best moments of my life. It\u2019s brilliant to win trophies, but it\u2019s been an honour to coach these incredible people. But it\u2019s onto the next chapter. Cushing goes to the City fans, who show their appreciation. \u201cNick Cushing\u2019s Barmy Army\u201d comes the chant. He\u2019s popped into the dressing room but will apparently come back out for a guard of honour! City cling on for a vital win in Nick Cushing\u2019s final game in charge! They are a point ahead of Chelsea at the top of the table, with Arsenal now down in third. 90+7: Walsh has been announced as player of the match. Quietly effective in that City midfield. 90+6 min: Incredible work rate from Miedema, who tracks back a full 50 yards to win the ball back. But Arsenal are sloppy going forward, and give the ball away as the ball trickles out for a throw in. 90+4 min: Arsenal work it well to the edge of the City box, but Mead slips just as she shoots, and the ball slices harmlessly wide. 90+2 min: The Gunners look tired. They will drop to third if this result stands, with Chelsea now 7-0 up against West Ham. The Blues will go second and have a game in hand over leaders Man City, who will be top by a point. 90 min: Seven minutes added on here! Wow. We\u2019ve had our fair share of bookings, and a couple of injuries, but that seems excessive. Plenty of time for Arsenal to get the equaliser! 89 min: Free-kick to Arsenal, 30 yards out. Van de Donk looks like she\u2019s going for goal \u2026 but blazes it over. 88 min: Houghton has been superb, both with the ball and organising her defenders. A proper leader. 85 min: Big five minutes for both teams. This result could be pivotal in the title race. Arsenal pressing for an equaliser. 84 min: The bookings are stacking up now. McCabe sees yellow for an off-the-ball tackle. 82 min: Roord is booked for a nasty challenge on Hemp. 81 min: Arsenal yet to make a sub, I wonder how that will affect their last 10 minutes. They have a really small squad, and not many attacking options on the bench. 79 min: Think I missed a yellow card for Mead a few minutes ago. The Arsenal winger was penalised for handball. 78 min: Wullaert ghosts past Roord and releases Walsh, but an excellent block from McCabe keeps Arsenal in the game! 77 min: Chelsea, by the way, are now 6-0 up at home to West Ham. Beth England and Maren Mjelde have two goals apiece, with Sophie Ingle and Erin Cuthbert the other scorers. They are really the form team at the moment. This piece is a couple of weeks old, but still well worth a read. 75 min: City\u2019s fans are really getting behind their side now, who are hanging on a little here. Cushing looks nervous, muttering to himself on the City bench. 72 min: Arsenal come roaring back. Miedema goes alone this time, firing a fierce shot straight at Roebuck, with City lucky the rebound falls to one of their defenders on the penalty spot. Mead, this time popping up on the right wing, flashes another shot across goal, but nobody is there to tap it home! 71 min: Honestly, have no idea how this is not 2-2! Miedema rolls a wonderful ball across the six-yard box. Van de Donk is there, she just has to tap it in at the back post \u2026 but somehow a combination of Stokes and Roebuck keep the ball out. The ball cannons off both City players and trickles wide. 70 min: Bit of trivia, there has never been a WSL draw between these two sides. 68 min: Both teams are looking a little leggy now. The game is opening up, and there have been a few promising counter-attacks as both midfields get tired. 66 min: Chance for Arsenal! Van de Donk is a growing influence in the middle of midfield again, and she burst foward, feeding Mead, who curls a tempting cross low to the back post. Evans was lurking, but Stokes did exceptionally well to shepherd the ball away from danger. 62 min: City make the first change, Bremer off for Wullaert, who has three league goals this season. Straight swap, but City will have more mobility with the Belgian up top. 60 min: This is a proper game now. The tempo is raised and the challenges are flying in. Arsenal\u2019s goalscorer, Van de Donk, is booked for a late tackle before City\u2019s Stanway also gets a long overdue yellow for yet another challenge on Mead. Stanway smiles as she is shown the card. Out of nothing, Arsenal spring to life! Miedema finds some room on the right, plays a neat ball into the stride of Mead, who strikes it first time. She should really bury the chance, but Roebuck gets down quickly to save! The ball squirms loose and it is Van de Donk on hand to smash in the rebound. Stanway did her best to block it on the line but ended up colliding with the post instead. I think she\u2019s OK. Arsenal back in it! 55 min: Just wide from Arsenal! Mead whips in a good corner from the left and Schnaderbeck rises highest, her header a yard wide. 53 min: Miedema just can\u2019t get in the game. Wondering around City\u2019s half like a lost dog at the moment. 51 min: Cushing is understandably delighted. What a way for the manager to go out, against one of City\u2019s biggest rivals. Simple goal, but wonderfully taken! Walsh gets some room to get her head up and whips a ball to the back post. Maier is all at sea and gives Hemp way too much space in the box for a free header from 10 yards out. The ball loops up towards the top corner, clipping the underside of the bar on its way in. That\u2019s Hemp\u2019s fourth of the season! 48 min: City are lined up in two banks of four, with the two strikers, White and Bremer buzzing around. They seem to be happy for Arsenal to have the ball and try to break them down. The teams are out again, with Miedema re-emerging for the second half. She seems to have got over that ankle niggle from the first half. Half-time reading: Paul MacInnes went to meet Spurs\u2019 Giovani Lo Celso Evans looks like she\u2019s got a problem with her ankle. Not ideal for Joe Montemurro, who has to reset his team, who have probably been the better side this half. 45 min: Two added minutes. Stanway again crashes late into Evans. How she is not on a yellow card is anyone\u2019s guess. Weir sends the ball into the area, it cannons off the knee of Bonner, falls to the feet of Bremer, who scuffs her finish into the corner! Zinsberger was completely helpless. 44 min: A questionable free-kick for City, with Roord penalised for what seemed like a perfectly good tackle. Weir is standing over the ball on the right touchline \u2026 43 min: Scott gets a toe in to win possession back for City, and Walsh smashes one from 30 yards, just wide! That was travelling, and maybe ended up a couple of feet outside Zinsberger\u2019s right-hand post. 41 min: Excellent defending from Stanway! The stand-in right back makes a crucial block to deny Van de Donk, and then dispossesses Mead who was driving into the area. 39 min: White and Scott combine down City\u2019s right wing, the latter sending over a peach of a cross towards Bremer. The German risest above Williamson, but can only glance her header wide. Better from City, who are finally growing into this game. 38 min: The only other goal today to tell you about is between Reading and Manchester United. Lauren James has given United the lead \u2013 a win would cement their position in fourth. 36 min: Replays are showing that Miedema\u2019s injury came from when Houghton accidentally stepped on the Arsenal striker\u2019s heel. That\u2019s a painful one, but shouldn\u2019t keep her from seeing out the rest of this game. 34 min: All the play for Arsenal is coming down this left wing. But Mead\u2019s cross is a poor one. You wonder if Miedema is fit, she hasn\u2019t really been in the game at all here. 32 min: Concern for Arsenal here, as Miedema goes down clutching her ankle. I\u2019m not sure what caused her to go down, but she doesn\u2019t look comfortable. It looks like the Dutch international is going to carry on, but she is grimacing. 30 min: Mead earns a cheap free-kick to relieve some of the City pressure. It\u2019s the third time that Stanway has been penalised, she\u2019s probably one more foul away from a yellow card. Cushing comes off his bench to give Mead a bit of stick. Mead laughs it off and jokingly pushes the City manager back towards his bench. 28 min: Chance for City. A wonderful through ball finds Scott in acres of space on the right flank. Scott gallops into the area with that long stride, pushes to the byline and cuts back a dangerous ball to the six-yard box. Van de Donk just beats Bremer to the cut back, and slide tackles the ball clear to prevent what would have been a certain goal. 26 min: Hemp gets the better of McCabe for the first time on the right wing, but her pass to White is intercepted. That\u2019s better from City. 24 min: Another terrible City clearance gifts the ball to Nobbs on the edge of the area. Nobbs shoots \u2013 did that hit Houghton\u2019s arm?! \u2013 and the ball goes wide. There was surely a penalty shout there, but Arsenal\u2019s players seemingly weren\u2019t interested! 22 min: Schnaderbeck and Williamson are completely nullifying City at the back for Arsenal. The Austrian\u2019s pace and Williamson\u2019s ability to bring the ball out from the back means it is Arsenal who are dominating the game. 20 min: Arsenal spray a beautiful diagonal pass to Mead on the left wing, but Stanway does really well to sprint back and tackle her England team-mate before the Arsenal player could burst into the box. 16 min: This is really poor from City. They have no fluency going forward at all, and seem to be nervy at the back. You could see Arsenal\u2019s forwards capitalising on a mistake if things carry on like this. 14 min: Worth noting that Chelsea are already 2-0 up against West Ham. Maren Mjelde and Beth England (again!) have scored for the Blues, who would go top if they win today, and this match ends in a draw. Remember Chelsea have one game in hand over City and Arsenal. 13 min: Poor play from Stokes, who smashes a clearance into Evans. The ball breaks to Mead, who fires a shot straight at Roebuck. 11 min: Chance for Nobbs! McCabe latches onto a ball down the left wing, beats Houghton to the ball, and squares it to Nobbs, and the Arsenal captain drives into the box. She tries to squeeze a shot inside the near post, but Nobbs\u2019 left-footed shot has the sting taken off it by a challenge from Bonner. 8 min: Mead goes on another run down the left wing, and is brought to a halt by a clattering late tackle from Stanway. The City right back should really be booked for that, but gets away with one. 7 min: Lovely play from Mead who nutmegs Scott on the edge of her box and plays a lovely one-two with Miedema to get Arsenal on the counter-attack. 5 min: Chance for City! A short corner routine is well worked, a low delivery finding Bonner on the edge of the box but a dodgy connection only bobbles the ball to the back post. There is a half chance for White and Walsh as the ball pinballs around the penalty box, but Arsenal eventually clear. 4 min: Houghton is such a calming influence at the heart of that City defence. So often the ball comes out of the heavens and it is the City captain that is the one to get her team playing on the deck again. 2 min: Arsenal have started the better, with City unusually sloppy in possession. Scott of all people the guilty party there. Nobbs is being made to wait as the City players have their pre-match huddle with Cushing in front of the dugout. Eventually Houghton makes her way to the centre-circle and there is a frosty-ish embrace between the captains. The teams are out! An excellent crowd to see Cushing off at the Academy Stadium. The most talented striker in the league, for my money. Sam Kerr is a bigger name and obviously a world-class player but Miedema just does things that get people off their seats. Off the pitch at least, Little has been active. This explains why the Arsenal captain has joined Fifpro\u2019s new players\u2019 union, a global players\u2019 council. Two WSL matches today have been called off: Liverpool\u2019s game against Birmingham is off to a waterlogged pitch at Prenton Park, with the wet weather also claiming another match at the Hive, where Tottenham where meant to meet Bristol City. Two big absences for Arsenal: captain Kim Little and Lia W\u00e4lti, both of whom started in the defeat against Chelsea. Two big losses for the Gunners there, with Leonie Maier, Lisa Evans and Beth Mead all coming into the side. Manchester City: Roebuck, Stanway, Houghton (c), Bonner, Stokes, Walsh, Weir, Scott, Hemp, White, Bremer. Subs: Benameur, Coombs, Toland, Park, Wullaert, Bissell, Fidalgo. Arsenal: Zinsberger, Maier, Williamson, Schnaderbeckm, McCabe, Roord, Nobbs, Van de Donk, Evans, Miedema, Mead Subs: Peyraud-Magnin, Quinn, Beattie, Filis, Grant, Mace Simply put, this is the biggest game of the WSL season so far. The league leaders, Manchester City, meet the second-placed champions, Arsenal, with the two teams separated only by goal difference (one goal) at the top of the table. If that isn\u2019t enough spice for you, Arsenal beat City 2-1 in the League Cup semi-final just four days ago, knocking the holders out, and ensuring their place in the final, where they will meet Chelsea. This will also be the final game for City\u2019s manager, Nick Cushing, before his move to men\u2019s side NYC FC on Monday. City\u2019s players have been falling over themselves to pay tribute to Cushing, who Jill Scott called \u201ca genius.\u201d You can read more about what his departure might mean for City here, courtesy of Suzy Wrack. It could well be a rip-roaring start to today\u2019s game. In the last round of league games, City took the lead after just 34 seconds against Birmingham. Arsenal will be wary of a repeat, particularly as they conceded three goals in the opening 10 minutes against Chelsea \u2013 a comprehensive defeat that saw Sam Kerr net her first goal for the Blues, and meant Arsenal slipped to second. We\u2019ll have the team news with you shortly. Kick-off is at 2pm.",

      "body": "<p>The rain may have poured but it could not dampen the celebratory mood as Nick Cushing\u2019s long goodbye, after six years with Manchester City, finally came to an end in style with his side giving their outgoing manager what could prove a vital 2-1 victory over title rivals Arsenal.</p> <p>\u201cThese last five games have felt like I\u2019ve split up with my girlfriend but I\u2019m still living in the same house as her,\u201d said Cushing, and his departure has not quite sunk in. \u201cIt almost breaks my heart a little bit to think of it like that. And after a result like that I almost want to stay and finish the year. But at no point would I have walked out of here happy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/feb/02/manchester-city-v-arsenal-womens-super-league-live\">Manchester City 2-1 Arsenal: Women's Super League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Few managers could depart mid\u2011season to such love and acclaim but, as players lined to give him a guard of honour and fans stave him a standing ovation, Cushing\u2019s influence on women\u2019s football in England could not be overlooked. He leaves the club having presided over 193 games with a 75% win rate, a WSL title, two Women\u2019s FA Cups and three league cups.</p> <p>The manager had told his players to not go out attempting to win for him because they would run the risk of \u201cgoing out far too emotional and too illogical\u201d and there was a clinical edge to their play that implied the message had been received.</p> <p>On the cusp of half-time City took the lead. With Jill Roord penalised for what looked like a decent tackle, Caroline Weir swung a free-kick into the box, the ball cannoned off the centre-back Gemma Bonner\u2019s knee before falling at the feet of Pauline Bremer, whose scuffed shot rolled past a helpless Manuela Zinsberger and into the far corner.</p> <p>The goal heaped pressure on to Joe Montemurro\u2019s already stretched squad. The official line from Arsenal was that the captain, Kim Little, was \u201crested\u201d in midweek, but with her name absent from the team sheet here and the key defensive midfielder Lia W\u00e4lti also missing, there were signs that the manager\u2019s decision to live or die by his small squad, after their FA Cup fourth\u2011round win against West Ham on Sunday, was coming back to haunt him. \u201cLook we\u2019re just managing their load, they haven\u2019t recovered very well over the last couple of weeks and I think it was a bit of a risk today to play them in such a physical scenario,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the second half City wasted no time in doubling their lead. Keira Walsh whipped the ball to the back post and Lauren Hemp sent a looping header over Zinsberger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faba2a1a6949857289c7bca26c6774176f069149\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/faba2a1a6949857289c7bca26c6774176f069149/0_0_3500_2185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A buzzing Academy Stadium crowd watched the home side go a point clear at the WSL summit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A buzzing Academy Stadium crowd watched the home side go a point clear at the WSL summit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel French/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arsenal looked dejected at the restart. But this would not be the complete capitulation witnessed after the team went two behind at home to Chelsea in an eventual 4-1 defeat. Instead the Gunners sprang to life. Vivianne Miedema fed the ball neatly into the run of Beth Mead whose effort was saved by Ellie Roebuck only for Danielle van de Donk to smash in the rebound.</p> <p>The goal swung momentum to the visitors and with less than 20 minutes to play they should have been level. Having found her footing in the game Miedema rolled a ball across the face of goal, Van de Donk tried to turn it in but a combination of Roebuck and the left-back Demi Stokes forced it round the post to safety.</p> <p>\u201cI think we grew in passion into the final third \u2013 we got there and we had opportunities but part of the art of football is putting the ball into the back of the net and we couldn\u2019t today,\u201d Montemurro said.</p> <p>City stay top, a point clear of Chelsea, with an emotional club and England captain, Steph Houghton, pledging to go on and win the league for the departing Cushing. The manager feels he bids farewell to a team that can do just that: \u201cWe\u2019ve left this team in a place where it can consistently win. We\u2019ve built the foundations of a very successful football team.\u201d</p> <h2>Chelsea hit eight to go second</h2> <p><strong>Chelsea</strong> stayed a point behind Manchester City, and have a game in hand, with an 8-0 demolition of <strong>West Ham</strong>. Doubles from Maren Mjelde and Beth England and goals from Sophie Ingle, Erin Cuthbert, Ramona Bachmann and Emily Murphy sealed the win in style. A late penalty, scored by Fara Williams, earned <strong>Reading</strong> a 1-1 draw against <strong>Manchester United</strong>. A goal from Fern Whelan saw <strong>Brighton</strong> surprisingly beat <strong>Everton</strong>. Liverpool\u2019s home game against Birmingham and Tottenham\u2019s against Bristol City were both postponed due to waterlogged pitches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "The rain may have poured but it could not dampen the celebratory mood as Nick Cushing\u2019s long goodbye, after six years with Manchester City, finally came to an end in style with his side giving their outgoing manager what could prove a vital 2-1 victory over title rivals Arsenal. \u201cThese last five games have felt like I\u2019ve split up with my girlfriend but I\u2019m still living in the same house as her,\u201d said Cushing, and his departure has not quite sunk in. \u201cIt almost breaks my heart a little bit to think of it like that. And after a result like that I almost want to stay and finish the year. But at no point would I have walked out of here happy.\u201d Few managers could depart mid\u2011season to such love and acclaim but, as players lined to give him a guard of honour and fans stave him a standing ovation, Cushing\u2019s influence on women\u2019s football in England could not be overlooked. He leaves the club having presided over 193 games with a 75% win rate, a WSL title, two Women\u2019s FA Cups and three league cups. The manager had told his players to not go out attempting to win for him because they would run the risk of \u201cgoing out far too emotional and too illogical\u201d and there was a clinical edge to their play that implied the message had been received. On the cusp of half-time City took the lead. With Jill Roord penalised for what looked like a decent tackle, Caroline Weir swung a free-kick into the box, the ball cannoned off the centre-back Gemma Bonner\u2019s knee before falling at the feet of Pauline Bremer, whose scuffed shot rolled past a helpless Manuela Zinsberger and into the far corner. The goal heaped pressure on to Joe Montemurro\u2019s already stretched squad. The official line from Arsenal was that the captain, Kim Little, was \u201crested\u201d in midweek, but with her name absent from the team sheet here and the key defensive midfielder Lia W\u00e4lti also missing, there were signs that the manager\u2019s decision to live or die by his small squad, after their FA Cup fourth\u2011round win against West Ham on Sunday, was coming back to haunt him. \u201cLook we\u2019re just managing their load, they haven\u2019t recovered very well over the last couple of weeks and I think it was a bit of a risk today to play them in such a physical scenario,\u201d he said. In the second half City wasted no time in doubling their lead. Keira Walsh whipped the ball to the back post and Lauren Hemp sent a looping header over Zinsberger. Arsenal looked dejected at the restart. But this would not be the complete capitulation witnessed after the team went two behind at home to Chelsea in an eventual 4-1 defeat. Instead the Gunners sprang to life. Vivianne Miedema fed the ball neatly into the run of Beth Mead whose effort was saved by Ellie Roebuck only for Danielle van de Donk to smash in the rebound. The goal swung momentum to the visitors and with less than 20 minutes to play they should have been level. Having found her footing in the game Miedema rolled a ball across the face of goal, Van de Donk tried to turn it in but a combination of Roebuck and the left-back Demi Stokes forced it round the post to safety. \u201cI think we grew in passion into the final third \u2013 we got there and we had opportunities but part of the art of football is putting the ball into the back of the net and we couldn\u2019t today,\u201d Montemurro said. City stay top, a point clear of Chelsea, with an emotional club and England captain, Steph Houghton, pledging to go on and win the league for the departing Cushing. The manager feels he bids farewell to a team that can do just that: \u201cWe\u2019ve left this team in a place where it can consistently win. We\u2019ve built the foundations of a very successful football team.\u201d Chelsea hit eight to go second Chelsea stayed a point behind Manchester City, and have a game in hand, with an 8-0 demolition of West Ham. Doubles from Maren Mjelde and Beth England and goals from Sophie Ingle, Erin Cuthbert, Ramona Bachmann and Emily Murphy sealed the win in style. A late penalty, scored by Fara Williams, earned Reading a 1-1 draw against Manchester United. A goal from Fern Whelan saw Brighton surprisingly beat Everton. Liverpool\u2019s home game against Birmingham and Tottenham\u2019s against Bristol City were both postponed due to waterlogged pitches.",

Presenting one opera a year, they have now reached Siegfried, though when G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung is added in 2021 it will form part of two performances of the complete cycle. So far, the bar has beeen raised with each instalment, conductor and orchestra becoming more fully immersed in each successive work. Though, as with the previous operas, there are occasional vocal inequalities, much of this can only be described as a thing of wonder, generating a fierce excitement that on occasion took my breath away.</p> <p>Jurowski has, if anything, refined and honed his approach to Wagner over time. As with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/das-rheingold-review-jurowski-lpo-royal-festival-hall-ring-cycle\">Das Rheingold</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/28/die-walkure-review-royal-festival-hall-london-vladimir-jurowski-london-philharmonic-orchestra\">Die Walk\u00fcre</a>, his judgement of the relationship between speed and pace, and his ability to hold us in the moment while thinking in terms of cumulative span, remains immaculate. Here, in what has often been dubbed the Ring\u2019s \u201cscherzo\u201d, there was perhaps greater energy, tautness and dramatic fire.</p> <p>With the LPO on tremendous form, he prised open textures with vivid immediacy, from the baleful opening with its sinister bassoons to the strings and woodwind seething with excitement in the final interlude, as Siegfried ascends the mountain to awaken Br\u00fcnnhilde. The Nibelung ostinato wound its way through the first two acts like an unnerving, obsessive refrain. There was some exceptional string-playing in the whirring, harmonically unstable passages that suggest the fear that consumes Mime, but which Siegfried himself is initially unable to feel. And the final love duet, which in lesser hands can turn curiously bombastic, boiled over with elation and genuine ecstasy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cb7d70e923e90b57eab0adec2a5e557e57fec0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cb7d70e923e90b57eab0adec2a5e557e57fec0c/0_52_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Jurowski\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conductor and orchestra become fully immersed ...

The main element he needs to resolve \u2013 imnvhotbqfhwy - is how in midfield and attack. At the back, it\u2019s quite clear: he needs two quality centre-backs \u2013 but in front of that, he has decent players, just not players you\u2019d expect to see playing regularly in teams who win things. Ultimately, he needs to make a choice that Unai Emery avoided: Lacazette or Aubameyang. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e36cc928f0811db2faefd30\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-02T13:26:03.784Z\">1.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Arsenal, meanwhile, welcome back Shkodran Mustafi \u2013 what a sentence that is to type \u2013</strong> who was stretchered off at Bournemouth.

      "bodyText": "That, then, is us. Enjoy the rest of the weekend \u2013 later. And here\u2019s our minute-by-minute of Spurs-Man City. Here\u2019s Paul Wilson\u2019s report. Burnley, on the other hand, were excellent. McNeil gives them a really good balance in midfield, and their centre-backs a solidity that allows them to play two strikers. They could finish in mid-table. That game showed Mikel Arteta how much work he has to do \u2013 if he didn\u2019t already know \u2013 and might, perhaps, have made his mind up on one or two players. Lacazette and Ozil are worth having for the squad if they don\u2019t mind that being their role, but neither are taking Arsenal into the top four, never mind towards a title challenge. It really is that simple. Rodriguez thinks Burnley should\u2019ve won but doesn\u2019t specify why, while McNeil says the gameplan was to get after Arsenal. Rodriguez then takes responsibility for his miss, saying he hoped it\u2019d gone in off the bar, but the bar oughtn\u2019t to have been a factor. The most entertaining goalless draw I\u2019ve seen for ages. Arsenal ought to have scored in the first half, but Burnley were very good in the second and Jay Rodriguez missed the game\u2019s best chance. Burnley move up to 11th, while Arsenal move up to 10th. 90+3 min Andy Hinchcliffe give McNeil man of the match. I like him a lot, but he\u2019s not had as much influence as others. 90+2 min Taylor ploughs through Bellerin, but can\u2019t get around Guendouzi. 90+1 min I think Lowton was just given man of the match by whoever decides in the ground, but he struggled in the first half; I\u2019d go for Tarkowski. 90 min There\u2019ll be three added minutes. 90 min Cork lopes a clever ball from centre to left, finding Rodriguez. He crosses for Wood, but again, Mustafi - who\u2019s had another acceptable afternoon \u2013 does enough. 89 min And here he is, replacing Lacazette \u2013 who\u2019s endured another poor afternoon and is now nine games without a goal. 88 min Nketiah will shortly be with us. I\u2019m not sure why, if he\u2019s worth bringing on now, he wasn\u2019t worth bringing on 10 minutes ago. 86 min Bellerin, now getting forward, skirts around Taylor and dinks an excellent cross into the middle that\u2019s fractionally high for Aubameyang; Lowton can\u2019t take any chances at the back post, so turns the ball behind. The corner comes to nothing. 85 min Hendrick crosses from the right yet again and McNeil arrives onto the ball, leaping to cushion a side-footed volley which flies over the bar \u2013 but not by much. 83 min Aubameyang drifts left and crosses well, Torreira leaping to lay off for Lacazette, who turns ... and looks to have conjured a shooting lane, only for Tarkowski to close it, his block sending the ball looping back to Pope. He\u2019s just a really good player. 82 min Tarkowski runs right through Willock, introducing studs to instep f0r extra artistic merit. He\u2019s booked. 80 min The finishing today has been absolute nonsense. 78 min WHAT A MISS! Hendrick slings over from the right and McNeil nods back across, perfectly into the path of Rodriguez! Running off the back of Luiz \u2013 heads or tails situation there \u2013 he meets it with the full meat of his boot, five yards out, but can only cart against the bar and onto the line! Dearie me. 77 min The teams are in for Spurs-Man City. You can follow that here: 77 min Arsenal have 80 percent possession in the last 10 minutes. I think Aubameyang is playing through the middle now. 76 min Xhaka again marauds forward and finds Lacazette outside him, who comes inside and measures a tasty cross directly onto Aubameyang\u2019s prodigious spam. He should score \u2013 again \u2013 but heads wide of the near post. 75 min Burnley might just\u2019ve blown themselves out, and Bellerin does really well to take the ball from Aubameyang, cut inside Taylor and open the angle for a shot. But he can only curl wide. 73 min Pope punches the corner clear and gets some of Luiz in the process; actually, Luiz heads his other elbow. He\u2019s fine. 72 min The corner yields another, Mustafi jumping into Tarkowski, which allows Guendouzi to shoot wide, off Tarkowski. 71 min But here comes Xhaka, advancing down the left and curling over a fine ball, which Mee does brilliantly to reach ahead of Lacazette, heading behind. 69 min Arsenal were excellent at Bournemouth on Monday night, but that was against a team missing its best players and not really putting it in. Arteta has made some impact, but has a big job to do; Unai Emery wasn\u2019t the only barrier to Arsenal being good at football. 68 min Arsenal are improving a little; Willock breaks through midfield and fires over. 66 min In commentary they reckon that Burnley should get Aaron Lennon on to have a run at Xhaka \u2013 on a card, remember \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to argue with that. 65 min Lacazette rubs his head after being outjumped by Mee. He is enjoying this-1. 64 min Burnley know they can win this, and Wood pulls wide as McNeil crosses, Rodriguez arriving onto the ball ... but he can\u2019t quite sort his feet out and drags a shot wide. 63 min Here comes that Arsenal change: Willock replaces Ozil who, it appears, is not very good away from home. If only we\u2019d seen years\u2019 worth of football to apprise us of this precise fact. 61 min Arsenal pile forward and suddenly Ozil is in the box, but his cut-back hits Mee. The resultant corner comes to nothing. 60 min This is brilliant from Burnley, Lowton switching play to Taylor \u2013 yes, really \u2013 who knocks back to McNeil. The cross is a good one too, and here\u2019s Jeffrey! But Hendrick, who looks like he\u2019s done everything right, somehow heads wide! 58 min Westwood shmices the free-kick in flat, looking for those two centre-backs again; Rodriguez heads just wide. 57 min Burnley can sense something. Taylor ploughs forward, Martinelli alongside, then tucks inside to be flattened by Torreira, who\u2019s booked. 56 min Cork bends the free-kick flat to the back post, where Tarkowski and Mee rush it; the former gets there first, unable to quite get his brow the right side of the ball, skidding on his knees to head wide. 55 min Lowton pounces on another slack pass from Guendouzi and skates around Xhaka, who imparts forearm to coupon and is booked. 54 min Ozil finds Martinelli inside the box, and he ducks inside then rifles a shot through shins, which Pope saves easily enough. 53 min McNeil takes the ball and Bellerin gives him time to turn and cross, but Luiz does enough to stop Wood heading at goal. 51 min \u201cArsenal\u2019s players seem to be at about 80% of signal with the rest noise and fuzz,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cTime for Arteta to do some retuning: move Ozil\u2019s dial somewhere he gets better reception (or off the pitch).\u201d I think Willock might be a better fit \u2013 players who can run with the ball in the middle of the pitch are a rare commodity, and Burnley aren\u2019t sitting off. 50 min Westwood crosses from the right, but Mustafi does enough when challenging Wood, who turns out to have been offside. 49 min Burnley look like they really fancy this. 47 min Saka\u2019s injury coincided with Burnley coming back into the game. He didn\u2019t have the legs to get forward, which meant that Burnley were under less pressure, which means that they could exert more pressure. Now, with Xhaka at the back, they should probably focus their play on the right, or think about changing formation to a diamond so at least they\u2019ve got two strikers. 46 min Off we go again. Saka, who spent some of half-time mooching about the tunnel, is done, so Torreira comes on. I\u2019d expect Xhaka will go to left-back. Half-time email: \u201cOn that Aubameyang chance back in the 14th minute,\u201d says JR from Illinois, \u201ca couple of the Burnley players did that thing players do where they immediately and with 100% certainty bitterly complain and abuse the assistant referee because they think an opponent was offside when in reality he wasn\u2019t even close to being offside. Oh boy does it burn my bottom when they do that. As a metaphor for the current state of the world though you could do worse.\u201d I also enjoyed Xhaka booting someone, hurting himself, and making a fuss; I\u2019m not surprised his mum let him take the house keys. Anything for a quiet life. In the WSL, Arsenal have just taken the lead away to Manchester City. Follow along with that one here: Half-time entertainment: this is what control looks like. That was a relatively entertaining half. Aubameyang and Lacazette ought really to have scored, but Burnley have played really well and look good for a goal themselves. The second half should be decent. 45 min There\u2019ll be one added minute. 45 min Another cross from the left and Mee launches himself at it, sending a header just wide. 44 min Mesut Storey lifts his foot, boots someone\u2019s head, and earns a yellow card. 43 min Hendrick\u2019s free-kick is a good one, and Xhaka does well to get the first gel on it, sending the ball behind. Even better, the ref thinks it came off a Burnley head, so awards a goalkick. 42 min McNeil is coming onto a good game and, confronted by the fearsome sight of Ozil, out on the touchline, he easily floats outside him and wears the inevitable lazy hack. 39 min Xhaka goes down after booting Hendricks\u2019 studs, which is apparently the fault of the referee. The Burnley corner yields another and eventually McNeil swings in a cross which Tarkowski attacks, Guendouzi preoccupied with pulling shirts \u2013 well hard, him \u2013 and the header goes over the top. Burnley are right in this. 38 min Arsenal should be ahead really, but here come Burnley! McNeil crosses from the left and Mustafi hurls himself out of its way, face first, because why wouldn\u2019t he? This allows Hendrick to come onto the ball, but he rushes a rising shot that floats wide of the far post, via deflection. 36 min But here he is! Xhaka caresses a luscious ball over the top and again Aubameyang escapes Lowton. But Pope is out quickly, and pops up an arm to field the attempted lob. 34 min Ultimately, Aubameyang is a one-dimensional player. It\u2019s a very strong dimension - scoring goals \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t have the feet to do what, say, Marcus Rashford or Sadio Mane do from out wide. Obviously he\u2019s still good enough needs to do stuff from that position, but really he needs play within the width of the goal, and Lacazette isn\u2019t good enough to force him away from there. 33 min Nice from Guendouzi, who turns and finds Aubameyang. He looks to drag the ball outside Lowton, and then again a few seconds later. But Lowton reads him both times. 31 min Mee tries to pass out of defence and is blocked by Martinelli. The ball runs to Lacazette, who\u2019s offside \u2013 a lucky let-off for the defender. 30 min Guendouzi gives the ball away \u2013 of course he does, is he the Premier League player whose opinion of his abilities is most different to his abilities? \u2013 and Burnley quickly find McNeil, who cracks a shot which swerves just over the top. 29 min Almost all of Arsenal\u2019s attacks have come down the left. They\u2019re a little lopsided in that regard, because Martinelli doesn\u2019t really want to be out on the right. 27 min McNeil surges down the left and whips over a cross, which Mustafi knees into touch. 25 min Guendouzi knocks a pass out to Saka, who mystifyingly allows the ball to hit his boot and roll out of play. He then goes down, which explains things \u2013 he was involved in a clash of knees a bit ago, so perhaps it\u2019s that. He accepts treatment as Arteta readies a sub, but is soon back on. 24 min Arsenal are dominating possession, but Burnley aren\u2019t sitting back. They\u2019re backing themselves to score, and have had enough joy so far not to change their minds. 22 min Ozil advances towards the box and tries a shot, which Cork blocks ... but as Mee challenges Martinelli, the ball breaks to Lacazette who thinks he\u2019s going to score and rightly so! Except Tarkowski appears out of nowhere to nail him with a teeth-rattler of a sliding tackle! That\u2019s a proper goal-saver is that, that is, is that. 20 min The left-footed McNeil takes this one \u2013 Burnley are swinging them all in and Leno punches clear. He\u2019s improved a lot lately. 20 min Westwood curls in the corner but mishits it, forcing Leno to poke over the bar for another. 19 min Nice from Burnley, a long ball finding Wood in between the centre-backs, and he controls on his chest then tees up Rodriguez, whose low shot is turned around the post by Leno. 17 min Arsenal are playing with a lot of confidence here, knocking the ball about, probing and such. 14 min Eeesh! Aubameyang is playing as a second striker, more or less, and he zones inside and towards goal as Luiz clips a pass over the top. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those\u201d where he\u2019s suddenly in so much space you assume he\u2019s offside, but Taylor botched the trap and it looks like a certain goal; he\u2019s got time to sort his feet out, listen to Shine On You Crazy Diamond and all the rest. But instead of going across goal with his left foot or opening his body to do likewise with his right, he somehow drags a shot wide of the near post. That was miserable. 12 min Saka raps a ball into Lacazette, who opens his body to cushion a lovely touch to meet the run of Aubameyang. But Tarkowski is wise to the ruse, and nips in first. 10 min \u201c\u2018His last outing\u2019,\u201d says Charles Antaki, quoting me on Mustafenbauer, \u201c(and indeed the time before), Mustafi played reasonably well. That\u2019s fine, and well done him. The reasonableness is not the issue here. It\u2019s the magnificent, imperious unreasonableness that Arsenal fans don\u2019t like: the dazed eyes, the three-second delay in acting, the catastrophic tackle and \u2013 as only recently demonstrated \u2013 the extravagantly poor back-pass. So yes, reasonable, up to a point.\u201d Can\u2019t argue with that. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s been preferred to Sokratis, but it\u2019s an invidious choice really. 8 min Lacazette gives it away and Westwood finds Wood, who lumbers into the box and ... tries some stepovers! Which reminds me of the lovely phrase, \u201cfairy elephant\u201d. Er, and Wood quickly loses possession. 6 min \u201cI suspect the choice of Lacazette or Aubameyang may be taken out of Arsenal\u2019s hands,\u201d emails Matt Emerson. \u201cLacazette has been on a rotten run of form and he\u2019s probably the one that Arteta would want to sell. But Aubameyang is the class act and if wanted to go there would be no shortage of options for him. As it stands, we are playing both in the hope that Lacazette\u2019s form improves whilst Ozil is still in one of his brief periods of motivation...\u201d Lacazette has started every game under Arteta, but I agree he\u2019s the one I\u2019d expect to go. It\u2019s possible that his ability to bring others into play is valued, but Arsenal would need big goalscoring contributions from their wide players to make that work. Aubameyang, on the other hand, will always get goals, but playing through the middle he doesn\u2019t offer much else. 4 min Saka runs at Lowton, shimmying inside before nipping outside, Chris Waddle-style. Lowton chops him down, as you would, and Ozil will swing in the free-kick ... to no avail. 3 min Arsenal have started well, and Saka \u2013 what a talent he is \u2013 advances down the left, crossing towards the far post where Taylor has no option but to concede a corner, given Martinelli lurking behind him. The flag-kick \u2013 no you have not accidentally opened a mid-80s football comic library \u2013 yields another. 2 min Ozil spreads to Aubameyang, who takes a touch a picks out Lacazette with a cross! He really ought to score, but instead nods wide. There is no bowing and handshaking. 1 min \u201cI don\u2019t have the statistics ready to hand,\u201d says David Wall, \u201cbut has Arteta actually made that much difference to Arsenal since he took the job? There\u2019s been a lot of praise for him personally, about how changed they are already in the time he\u2019s been there, but have they actually been winning more games? I seem to remember them having a lot of drawn games recently, and after having had the lead in many of them (though that\u2019s just a loose impression, perhaps i\u2019m mis-remembering). That sounds much like the perennial soft-Arsenal picture that we\u2019ve seen through the last couple of managers over a number of years. Arteta might have spoken well since becoming their manager but has there actually been much material difference?\u201d He\u2019s not been given the job to immediately get them winning every week, but to oversee change, and my eyes certainly tell me that he\u2019s doing that. They\u2019re much better organised, in defence and attack, and their players know what they\u2019re doing, which previously they did not 1 min Off we go! Here come the teams ... and the ball is unplinthed! Email! \u201c100% with you on Henderson,\u201d tweets Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cPope a fine second. I was surprised Man Utd signed another young keeper this window when they have Henderson on their books and out on loan. He may well be better than De Gea is already.\u201d What\u2019s most impressive about Henderson is his mentality: he thinks he\u2019s proper and carries himself accordingly. United gave De Gea a contract he hadn\u2019t necessarily earned, and when there didn\u2019t seem to be much clamour for his services, but I seem to recall hearing they also rate Matej Kovar. Sean Dyche thinks he\u2019s hit on a system that works, mainly because the defence and attack are right. He\u2019d also like his team to play well today \u2013 more news as I get it. Well clever #what they\u2019ve done #here. Ozil reminds of Pogba in a way \u2013 partly because any footballing discussion necessarily ends with an argument about him \u2013 but also because he has sublime talent that is brilliant in a good team but can\u2019t elevate a poor one. On Sky, they\u2019ve been discussing who should be England\u2019s goalkeeper in the context of Pope v Pickford, which is semi-strange given the correct answer is very clearly Henderson. What Burnley will seek to do is pretty clear: get the ball wide, get Wood on Luiz and Rodriguez around Mustafi, then force them to defend. McNeil, who looks a really interesting player, might fancy himself to exploit any space left by Bellerin, or to shift the ball and cross early, before he can get in the way. Mesut \u00d6zil hasn\u2019t played at Burnley since 2016, and this is a chance for him. Arteta recognises his upside, but I wonder if he needs two midfielders with legs behind him. At some point, a decision needs to be made on Granit Xhaka, who is in the team because he performs a useful function, but again: teams to win stuff have better. Sitting five points behind Wolves and Manchester United and a further 10 behind Chelsea, Arsenal is that they can forget about qualifying for the Champions League next season \u2013 through the league. This, in a sense, gives Arteta an opportunity: he has scope to work out who to play and how to play them without the pressure of results. The main element he needs to resolve \u2013 imnvhotbqfhwy - is how in midfield and attack. At the back, it\u2019s quite clear: he needs two quality centre-backs \u2013 but in front of that, he has decent players, just not players you\u2019d expect to see playing regularly in teams who win things. Ultimately, he needs to make a choice that Unai Emery avoided: Lacazette or Aubameyang. Arsenal, meanwhile, welcome back Shkodran Mustafi \u2013 what a sentence that is to type \u2013 who was stretchered off at Bournemouth. It looked nasty, but he\u2019s fine and is rewarded for playing reasonably well prior to that. Alongside him, David Luiz returns after getting himself suspended trying to get Mustafi out of trouble, so Sokratis is on the bench. In midfield, Matteo Guendouzi keeps his place after two relatively decent displays, meaning no spot for Lucas Torreira, Mesut \u00d6zil does indeed return \u2013 maybe this will be the week he changes the ingrained habits of a lifetime \u2013 so Joe Willock misses out while, in attack, Alexandre Lacazette replaces Eddie Nketiah and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is in for Nicolas Pepe\u00e9. So, Burnley are unchanged from the win at Old Trafford, though they went out of the cup at Norwich in between. This means that Phil Bardsley \u2013 you may know him better as Tanya\u2019s husband \u2013 and who missed that game, injured \u2013 does not come straight back in. Instead, Charlie Taylor keeps his place at right-back. Burnley (a good, honest, old-fashioned, traditional, real, you know where you are with it 4-4-2): Pope; Lowton, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor; Hendrick, Westwood, Cork, McNeil; Wood, Rodriguez. Subs: Hart, Brady, Pieters, Lennon, Bardsley, Vydra, Long. Arsenal (a fancy, flighty, untrustworthy, insubstantial 4-3-3): Leno; Bellerin, Mustafi, David Luiz, Saka; Guendouzi, Xhaka, \u00d6zil; Martinelli, Lacazette, Aubameyang. Subs: Martinez, Sokratis, Ceballos, Torreira, Pepe, Willock, Nketiah. Commissioner: Chris Kavanagh (Manchester) Losing games of this ilk is the absolute height of Arsenal \u2013 Burnley is cold and unwelcoming, more passionate about control of borders than of trailing legs and whose footballers specialists in the ancient English tradition of facial entry. Except Arsenal have won on every visit to Turf Moor since Burnley returned to the Premier League, and beaten them in every game at the Emirates too, so. Quite what New Arsenal will make of today remains to be seen. Last time out, they were excellent against an admittedly disgracefully execrable Bournemouth, giving Mikel Arteta a problem: does he keep faith with maybes like Gabriel Martinelli and Joe Willock, or, more likely, does he rely on never will bes like Alexandre Lacazette and Mesut \u00d6zil? He has the rest of the season to settle on method and personnel, but must decide if the circumstance \u2013 where Arsenal are and where they want to be \u2013 demands revolution or evolution. Burnley, meanwhile, are looking good after a dodgy period. Wins over Leicester and Manchester United have left them six points and three places above the relegation zone, with today\u2019s game in hand; ruining things from here requires an enormous effort. The key wins which made this so were founded upon the defensive excellence of Ben Mee and James Tarkowski, who might just prefer the more statuesque stylings of the old men; will Arteta oblige them? Kick-off: 2pm GMT, 3pm CET.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Eat well</strong><br></h2> <p>A good diet is particularly important when breastfeeding. \u201cYou\u2019re fuelling yourself to fuel a baby,\u201d says Jane Moffett, a breastfeeding counsellor with the National Childbirth Trust (NCT). \u201cEat a varied, balanced diet,\u201d she says . \u201cIf you\u2019re vegan, think about calcium-fortified foods.\u201d Wholegrains, protein and vegetables help to regulate blood sugar and may reduce your cravings for high-fat and high-sugar foods. But, with breastfeeding burning about 300 calories a day, this is not the time to cut calories. \u201cAs you\u2019ll be feeding through the night as well as the day, it may be an idea to take a tuck box to bed,\u201d says Moffett.</p> <h2><strong>Take care of your emotional and mental health</strong><br></h2> <p>Breastfeeding, like all elements of early parenting, may be different from what you expected. You may feel tired, frustrated, confused or helpless. According to research by the NCT in 2017, half of mothers experienced mental health problems at some time during pregnancy or within the first year of their child\u2019s birth. If you feel in need of support, ask your GP, midwife or health visitor about breastfeeding clinics, drop in sessions and support groups. Help may be available locally but, if not, there are several national helplines in the UK. Check the <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/start4life/baby/breastfeeding/extra-help-and-support/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyJCD1NSr5wIVibHtCh1WJgLdEAAYASAAEgLUi_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" title=\"\">NHS website</a> for details.</p> <h2><strong>Get enough rest</strong><br></h2> <p>The pressure to relax can feel, ironically, rather stressful when your schedule is being dictated by a small baby. So, instead of telling yourself to sleep whenever the baby does, simply try to do things that make you happy. \u201cGet rest,\u201d advises Tamsin English, a baby feeding supporter based in east London. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be sleep \u2013 it could just be lying on the sofa, watching TV, or listening to music. Anything that helps you feel less frazzled.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Be breast aware </strong><br></h2> <p>While breastfeeding, take the time to look at your breasts in the mirror, and check them regularly for signs of tenderness. \u201cIf you start to feel fluey, have a red area on one of your breasts, or if your breasts feel painful, tell your doctor, midwife or health visitor,\u201d says Moffett. These can be the early signs of mastitis, a painful condition caused by a buildup of milk in the breast.

      "bodyText": "Eat well A good diet is particularly important when breastfeeding. \u201cYou\u2019re fuelling yourself to fuel a baby,\u201d says Jane Moffett, a breastfeeding counsellor with the National Childbirth Trust (NCT). \u201cEat a varied, balanced diet,\u201d she says . \u201cIf you\u2019re vegan, think about calcium-fortified foods.\u201d Wholegrains, protein and vegetables help to regulate blood sugar and may reduce your cravings for high-fat and high-sugar foods. But, with breastfeeding burning about 300 calories a day, this is not the time to cut calories. \u201cAs you\u2019ll be feeding through the night as well as the day, it may be an idea to take a tuck box to bed,\u201d says Moffett. Take care of your emotional and mental health Breastfeeding, like all elements of early parenting, may be different from what you expected. You may feel tired, frustrated, confused or helpless. According to research by the NCT in 2017, half of mothers experienced mental health problems at some time during pregnancy or within the first year of their child\u2019s birth. If you feel in need of support, ask your GP, midwife or health visitor about breastfeeding clinics, drop in sessions and support groups. Help may be available locally but, if not, there are several national helplines in the UK. Check the NHS website for details. Get enough rest The pressure to relax can feel, ironically, rather stressful when your schedule is being dictated by a small baby. So, instead of telling yourself to sleep whenever the baby does, simply try to do things that make you happy. \u201cGet rest,\u201d advises Tamsin English, a baby feeding supporter based in east London. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be sleep \u2013 it could just be lying on the sofa, watching TV, or listening to music. Anything that helps you feel less frazzled.\u201d Be breast aware While breastfeeding, take the time to look at your breasts in the mirror, and check them regularly for signs of tenderness. \u201cIf you start to feel fluey, have a red area on one of your breasts, or if your breasts feel painful, tell your doctor, midwife or health visitor,\u201d says Moffett. These can be the early signs of mastitis, a painful condition caused by a buildup of milk in the breast. If you suspect mastitis may be coming on, the NHS recommends massaging the affected area in a warm shower, continuing to breastfeed, trying different positions to stimulate the blocked area and maybe starting your baby feeding on the affected breast to try to drain any blockages. Look after your back Breastfeeding can cause aches and pains, particularly if you don\u2019t watch your posture. There are different breastfeeding positions that may suit parent and baby \u2013 from the rugby hold to the cradle hold, from lying flat to lying on your side, or even the jazzy sounding \u201ckoala\u201d position.

      "bodyText": "A mobile phone firm that has been a major Tory donor is embroiled in three disputes with the UK tax authorities over at least \u00a360m in allegedly unpaid tax. Lycamobile donated \u00a32.1m to the Conservatives between 2011 and 2016. The firm also supported Boris Johnson while he was seeking to be re-elected as London\u2019s mayor. The disputes relate to corporation tax, VAT, PAYE and national insurance stretching back eight years. Lycamobile, founded by businessman Allirajah Subaskaran in 2006, sells pay-as-you-go cards to individuals, often low-paid migrants, wanting to make cheap phone calls in the UK and abroad. The HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has issued an official demand using its anti-tax avoidance powers in one case, and in another, a tribunal is due to be held to adjudicate the dispute. Lycamobile believes that it is not required to pay the tax demanded by HMRC in each case and is in discussions with the department. The company has not made public the total amount of tax it would have to pay if it lost all three disputes. HMRC does not comment on the tax affairs of firms and individuals. A fourth dispute, over a \u00a38m bill, between Lycamobile and HMRC has recently been resolved after the department issued a penalty notice against the firm. Johnson\u2019s campaign to get re-elected as London\u2019s mayor in 2012 used the firm\u2019s Canary Wharf offices at least five times to conduct and coordinate telephone canvassing sessions. A year before, Johnson had praised the firm at one of its events, saying Lycamobile was as dynamic as London itself. Lycamobile also sponsored Johnson\u2019s Diwali celebrations in Trafalgar Square in 2012 when he was mayor. The firm has attracted criticism in the past over its financial affairs. In 2012, the Guardian disclosed that it had paid no corporation tax for three years. It has also risked being struck off as a company because it failed to publish its annual accounts on time. In 2016, its own auditors said its complex web of offshore and UK companies was so opaque that they could not account for \u00a3134m of assets. In 2018, HMRC was accused of refusing to help French investigators into suspected money laundering by Lycamobile because it noted in secret documents that the firm was at that time the \u201cbiggest corporate donor to the Conservative party\u201d. HMRC in turn said it was a mistake to cite the donations in the documents, adding that it had not helped the French investigators because they had not given enough information to justify such a move. Two years earlier, French investigators had raided Lycamobile\u2019s Paris office and arrested 19 employees. Lycamobile has denied any wrongdoing. Lycamobile has outlined some of the details of its current disputes with the HMRC in its recent annual accounts. The firm declined to make any further comment when approached by the Guardian. Lycamobile believes that it should not have to pay VAT on certain phone transactions and is going to a tribunal in March to fight HMRC. The firm estimates that it would have to pay \u00a360m if it loses \u2013 a potential liability that has almost doubled in recent years. Lycamobile declined to say how much is at stake in the two other disputes. Have you got new information about this story?

That fear has reshaped the primary debate this cycle, sharpening the focus on who is best positioned to win in the November presidential election, a calculation that often works against women and minority candidates.</p> \n<p>While support for Warren has dipped in the last few months, she has one of the largest and most organized political operations in Iowa, which could prove decisive on Monday night.

      "bodyText": "Hours after the Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump adjourned for the evening in Washington on Friday, Elizabeth Warren bounded into a brewery in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. The Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate, displaying the energy of Bailey, her golden retriever and the breakout star of her campaign, hopped on top of a box and greeted the room, which was so packed the wait staff had to ask guests to pass their pint glasses to the bar to be refilled because they couldn\u2019t bus the tables and had run out of fresh ones. Warren had missed an earlier campaign rally across the street because of the impeachment proceedings, and thanked her supporters for turning out. And then she turned to thank her campaign co-chairs who have stepped in for Warren in her absence: congresswomen Deb Haaland of New Mexico, Katie Porter of California and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who were all part of a wave of the record of women elected in the 2018 midterm elections. \u201cYou know what I love best about them? Warren said on Friday night, pointing to the members of Congress. \u201cThey prove that kickass women win.\u201d In the final days before the Iowa caucuses, Warren is explicitly confronting concerns among some voters about nominating another woman to take on Donald Trump in November. And for anyone still haunted by Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat in 2016, the three women by Warren\u2019s side serve as a reminder of what has changed. \u201cWomen have been doing very well since Donald Trump has been elected,\u201d Warren told supporters in a tele-town hall earlier this week. \u201c2020 is not 2016.\u201d The sharp focus on relieving any lingering doubts about her electability reflects the overwhelming desire by Democrats in Iowa and around the country to unseat a president they view as a singular threat. That fear has reshaped the primary debate this cycle, sharpening the focus on who is best positioned to win in the November presidential election, a calculation that often works against women and minority candidates. While support for Warren has dipped in the last few months, she has one of the largest and most organized political operations in Iowa, which could prove decisive on Monday night. Recent surveys of Iowa show no clear frontrunner and a large number of caucus-goers still undecided. Squeezed between the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who has consolidated support on the left in recent months, and former vice-president Joe Biden, who has remained the top choice of moderate candidates, Warren is now making an explicit case for why Iowans should turn to her on Monday night. \u201cWe\u2019re down in the final strokes, but understand, we will, we must come together as a party and beat Donald Trump,\u201d Warren told hundreds of supporters at a gymnasium in Cedar Rapids on Saturday. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a plan for that.\u201d In her final appeal to Iowans this weekend, Warren sought to cast herself as uniquely positioned to unite the party. Allies championed her as a consensus-candidate who can excite Democratic base voters without alienating either ideological flank. A recent Quinnipiac University poll found that Warren is the top second choice of Democratic primary voters nationally, a position that could matter in Monday\u2019s caucuses where a second round of balloting is required. At rallies and events, the senator was introduced by speakers who caucused for Bernie Sanders and Clinton in 2016 as well as by speakers who initially endorsed presidential candidates no longer in the race, including Cory Booker and Kamala Harris. A new advert released by her campaign features a man from rural Iowa who supported Trump in 2016 insisting that Warren can absolutely defeat the president. \u201cFor people that say that a woman can\u2019t win, I say: nonsense,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe a woman can beat Trump and I believe Elizabeth is that woman.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve talked a lot about how empathetic she is but let me give you another \u2018e\u2019 word,\u201d Pressley said at a rally in Iowa City. \u201cShe\u2019s electable too.\u201d Supporters in Iowa say they like that she has detailed plans.

Under this \u201creverse repo\u201d scheme, PBoC will purchase a range of securities from investors seeking ready cash, to avoid a wave of forced selling as investors return to work from the lunar new year break, which was extended after the coronavirus outbreak. According to Reuters\u2019 data, just over 1tn yuan of existing reverse repo contracts expire on Monday \u2013 the PBoC\u2019s move will allow these to be rolled over, plus an extra 150bn yuan (\u00a316bn) of fresh support. Over the weekend, the PBoC also announced more monetary and credit support for hospitals and medical institutions at the frontline of the battle against the Wuhan coronavirus. It urged financial institutions to provide \u201csufficient credit resources\u201d to hospitals and medical research units. Economists believe the virus will hurt the global economy in 2020. Goldman Sachs predicts it could knock Chinese growth down to 5.5% for the year, from 6.1% in 2019. Turbulence is expected on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges when they reopen on Monday.

On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, Buttigieg was asked if he would \u201creconsider his candidacy\u201d if he did not make the top three. \u201cI\u2019ll let others set the goalposts,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, look, let\u2019s face it. I need to have a good finish here in Iowa. We know it, and we\u2019re working very hard to do that.\u201d To ABC, he said: \u201cI think a lot of voters across the country understand that across the candidates we share largely similar values and are focused, more than anything else, on making sure we have the nominee to defeat Donald Trump. I believe that I have the campaign best positioned to do that. The message best positioned to do that. \u201cBut of course the first opportunity to actually prove it is to turn people out in the caucuses tomorrow evening, that\u2019s why I\u2019m getting in front of every caucus-goer that I can \u2026 Tomorrow is going to be a big night and it will propel us into the states ahead.\u201d Buttigieg also spoke to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where he was asked about remarks from his advisers to reporters which suggested he was already looking ahead to \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d, 3 March, on which 14 states and Democrats Abroad will hold their nominating contests. \u201cI\u2019m focused on Iowans\u2019 lives,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re counting on a good finish here in Iowa, going straight to New Hampshire and on to Nevada, South Carolina and the other states.\u201d",

It\u2019s just a plastic plate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has some of the foam that is in some of the new shoes. But it\u2019s a normal looking spike and it is due to market. So Laura and Jemma\u2019s spike will meet the new regulations in terms of plates and millimetres of foam. \u201cThese spikes are not the carbon plated spikes referenced online in pics of patents,\u201d he added. A World Athletics spokesperson also confirmed that the shoes were not under suspicion: \u201cIf they have one plate (plus the plate that the spikes screw into) and the soles are not more than 30mm thick, then they meet the criteria.\u201d",

But that weekend he met a young man who suggested that instead of enlisting in the navy, it would be \u201cfar more fun\u201d for Farnes to follow his example and join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR).</p> <p>By the end of the second world war, in 1945, Wg Cmdr Farnes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/29/last-battle-of-britain-flying-ace-paul-farnes-dies-aged-101\">who has died</a> aged 101, had shot down seven enemy aircraft, jointly accounted for a further two, had claims on another two, and damaged 11.

The squadron was part of the RAF\u2019s impressively named \u201cadvanced air striking force\u201d, and was heading for B\u00e9theniville aerodrome near Reims. That day marked the beginning of the Nazi onslaught on France.</p> <p>Two days later the 21-year-old shot down a Heinkel 111 bomber and took part in the downing of another.

Then it was back to Tangmere. </p> <p>Next up was the Battle of Britain, which, according to the British at least, began on 10 July 1940.

More than any other aircraft of that era, the Stuka had seemed to epitomise Blitzkrieg invincibility, with its siren, the \u201cJericho trumpet\u201d emitting a high-pitched scream as the plane dived. But it failed over England, a sitting duck for faster RAF fighters.</p> <p>Three days after the last Stuka, Farnes shot down a Dornier 17. On 28 August he added a Messerschmitt Me 109E. He damaged six more enemy aircraft during the battle: a Heinkel 111 on 30 August, two Messerschmitt 109s on 2 September, a Messerschmitt 110 on 3 September, and Dornier 17s on 14 and 27 September.</p> <p>On the last day of September, while flying his malfunctioning Hurricane back to Kenley, in Surrey, where he was by then based, he encountered a Junkers Ju 88 bomber flying directly towards him at 1,500 feet. Ducking behind the aircraft, he opened fire \u2013 and brought it down. Soon afterwards the Kenley station commander introduced Farnes and the surviving German pilot to each other, but the German declined to shake hands.

From the summer of 1940 until November 1942 the island was under siege by the Italians and the Germans, and Farnes took command of the squadron after the commanding officer was injured. In May 1942 his Hurricane squadron could be withdrawn, after more Spitfires arrived. Following a spell in Egypt he was posted to Iraq until early 1945.

Farnes was born in Boscombe, on the edge of Bournemouth, in what was then Hampshire but is now Dorset. His mother, who was unmarried, died in childbirth, while his father, a member of the Australian armed forces, returned home. The nurse who had brought him into the world then adopted him \u2013 \u201cI had a wonderful upbringing, just she and I together,\u201d Farnes said. Raised in Walton-on-Thames on the Surrey-London border, he was educated at Surbiton county grammar school and Kingston technical college. It was after securing a job with the Vickers engineering company that Farnes signed on with the RAFVR. His time there included a spell at Gatwick, and six months at St Athan in south Wales as a full-time flier, moving from Tiger Moth biplanes to Fairey Battles and on to Hurricanes. It was a time when the principal European powers were all developing monoplane fighters, and the Hurricane and its contemporary, the Spitfire, were at least as good as, if not better than, their main rival, Nazi Germany\u2019s Messerschmitt Me 109. Then in September 1939, as the second world war began, Sergeant Pilot Farnes joined No 501 Squadron. It was initially based at Filton, near Bristol, but by May 1940 it had moved to France. After leaving the RAF in 1958 Farnes worked in the motor industry, co-ran a builders\u2019 merchants and was a director of the Beach hotel in Worthing. In 1948 he married Pamela Barton. She died in 1989. In 1994 he married Cynthia Lacey, who died in 2012. He is survived by a daughter, Linda, and a son, Jonathan. Another son, Nicholas, predeceased him. \u2022 Paul Caswell Powe Farnes, fighter pilot, born 16 July 1918; died 28 January 2020",

After a YouGov poll put backing for independence at 51% (excluding those who said they didn\u2019t know) last week, Sturgeon is hoping to boost support for a fresh vote with a series of policy papers this summer setting out the case for independence. The public sector union Unison added to that sense of momentum when its Scottish council voted on Saturday to back calls for a second referendum. Even so, the YouGov poll found most Scots oppose a fresh vote for the next two years, even if the Scottish National party wins a majority of seats in next year\u2019s Holyrood election.

That opens up a further area of conflict between Sturgeon and Boris Johnson\u2019s government. The prime minister is expected to reject Brussel\u2019s demands for close alignment on key areas of policy such as workers\u2019 rights, state aid and the environment in the UK-EU trade talks, including UK-wide policies controlled by Westminster. Johnson\u2019s success in securing the UK\u2019s departure from the EU on Friday raises other significant challenges for Sturgeon over which currency an independent Scotland would use, its significant deficit and the difficulties of having a hard border with the rest of the UK, affecting 60% of Scotland\u2019s trade. Scotland would not be able to win back any of the concessions the UK had within the EU, such as less onerous VAT rules or exemption from the Schengen security treaty. Scotland would also be expected to rejoin the common fisheries policy \u2013 a system which boosted the pro-Brexit vote in Scottish fishing areas. Scottish government data, which was released last week but not publicised, showed a \u00a35bn cut in Scotland\u2019s economic output from \u00a3180bn to \u00a3175bn, which is equivalent to a deficit of 7.2%. The deficit shows the gap between public spending and tax income. The EU requires its member states to have a deficit below 3%. John McLaren, an economist, told the Sunday Times: \u201cA \u00a35bn \u2013 almost 3% \u2013 downwards revision in Scottish GDP has important implications for judging Scotland\u2019s economic and fiscal standing, especially in terms of independence or full fiscal autonomy.\u201d Alyn Smith, the SNP MP and former MEP who championed Scotland\u2019s case in Brussels, said Tusk\u2019s remarks proved \u201cScotland would be welcomed back into the EU with open arms as an independent country. What senior Europeans are saying in public is what they have been saying in private for some time.\u201d",

It makes the political weather for several days.</p> <p>\u201cI think part of the reason Trump got so much \u2018earned media\u2019 during the 2016 campaign is that he was so transgressive,\u201d Maddow says. \u201cIt was a relatively rational newsworthiness assessment to put a camera on him at all times, because there was a reasonably good chance he was going to do something shocking, wrong, transgressive or unbelievably disruptive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Getting a show on the air is like merging on to the freeway at 80 miles an hour at night in a storm with no headlights</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut that also dovetails with the question of whether or not his falsehoods and reversals and self-contradictions and professed ignorance got the critical coverage that they deserved. When nobody\u2019s expecting you to tell the truth, you telling a lie isn\u2019t news. If Barack Obama got up and said something that was proveably false or maybe not the whole truth, you\u2019d have the whole media, not just Fox News, going crazy for a month at a time. Donald Trump\u2019s mendacity has never been notable. It\u2019s just been baked in.\u201d</p> <p>Trump made more than 16,000 false or misleading claims in his first three years as president, according to the Washington Post \u2013 and that number is likely to accelerate as the election hots up. But he is undeniably good for ratings and clicks. Media outlets will have to choose whether or not to broadcast his campaign rallies and interview his surrogates unfettered, as well as how far to go in editing, fact-checking or simply \u201cno-platforming\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe went through our own transformation fairly early on when I realised that I couldn\u2019t put Trump administration officials on the air as guests because they did not tell the truth,\u201d says Maddow. \u201cHaving to clean up after your guest is a sort of \u2018fool me once\u2019 thing, like: \u2018When I told my audience that you were somebody worth listening to because you had something to contribute to our understanding of the world, I was wrong. I\u2019ve goodnighted you. I won\u2019t invite you back.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cI can play the tape of the president saying something that\u2019s not true and then clean up after him \u2013 but then I\u2019ve also just played the tape of him saying something not true, and maybe that\u2019s more compelling to you and more of what you remember than the part where I corrected it.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like there\u2019s a responsibility level there. So we\u2019re not going to give people a platform who are lying to the public. But I\u2019m assuming everybody else in the media is going through that same thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d018ea271ff611d8a6cd90555ab65155ab745bfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d018ea271ff611d8a6cd90555ab65155ab745bfa/0_0_3500_2237/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Maddow with Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Tom Steyer after a debate on 20 November\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maddow with<em> (from left)</em> Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Tom Steyer after moderating a debate between Democratic presidential candidates on 20 November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Observers of all political stripes have taken Maddow to task for her coverage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-russia-inquiry\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia</a>. Presidential cheerleader Sean Hannity, whose Fox News show airs in direct opposition, has called her \u201cthe chief conspiracy theorist\u201d. In a critique of her handling of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/15/how-trump-walked-into-putins-web-luke\" title=\"\">a 35-page dossier on the subject</a> compiled by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, Erik Wemple of the Washington Post wrote: \u201cShe was there for the bunkings, absent for the debunkings \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/26/rachel-maddow-rooted-steele-dossier-be-true-then-it-fell-apart/\" title=\"\">a pattern of misleading and dishonest asymmetry</a>.\u201d</p> <p>But Maddow, whose new book was inspired by Putin\u2019s motives for attacking US democracy, describes some of the criticism as dishonest and makes no apologies for being obsessive, especially since there is every prospect of Putin trying again this year. \u201cRussia interfered in the 2016 election to try to elect Donald Trump, and Donald Trump got elected and he is weirdly and irreversibly supplicant toward Russia and Putin. Like, OK, I\u2019m going to cover that,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anybody says about me. I don\u2019t play requests and I don\u2019t worry about the criticism. If we get something wrong, I\u2019ll correct it, but, in the absence of that, the criticism for focusing on real news stories that bother people \u2013 that\u2019s what I get paid to do.\u201d</p> <p>You have to grow a thick skin, she says. \u201cGetting a show on the air, even all these years in, is like merging on to the freeway at 80 miles an hour at night in a rainstorm with no headlights and no windshield wipers and a bunch of semi-trucks coming up right behind me. Somebody telling me that they don\u2019t like the colour of my car? I am not focusing on you! I\u2019ve got a job to do here.\u201d</p> <p>That freeway sounds terrifying and yet also an adrenaline rush. The Trump presidency is a liberal\u2019s worst nightmare and a dream for many journalists. Jim Acosta, the chief White House correspondent at Maddow\u2019s rival network CNN, has said: \u201cI\u2019m having the time of my life right now. This is the biggest story of my life. I\u2019m like a kid in a candy store.\u201d So, despite the daily horrors, is Maddow secretly enjoying this?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Civil rights aren\u2019t a given. They\u2019re asserted and protected \u2013 or assailed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if \u2018enjoy\u2019 is the right word, but I do have the best job in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cI talk to a lot of people who feel strongly about what\u2019s going on in the world, whether they\u2019re in public affairs or they\u2019re just concerned citizens who pay attention to what\u2019s going on. People say: \u2018Don\u2019t you find it incredibly demoralising? How do you think about all this stuff all day?\u2019 I feel the opposite. If you\u2019re at all engaged with what\u2019s going on in the country and in the world, you have to be concerned. But my job, what they actually pay me to do, is to read the news all day long and do original reporting and try to figure out what is and isn\u2019t reliable information. I feel like I\u2019m doing mental health work all day long.\u201d</p> <p>Maddow, who grew up in a small town in California, has previously worked as a labourer, a messenger, a waitress and a bucket washer at a coffee-bean factory. \u201cI am not a planner. This definitely wasn\u2019t like the thing that I set my mind toward and then I put together all the pieces to get there. I had much more of a drunken stumble through my career than you might expect, but now that I have landed here, I value it.\u201d</p> <p>She came out at Stanford University by posting an open letter inside every bathroom stall in her dormitory announcing that she was a lesbian, an incident that was reported in the student newspaper. \u201cClassy, right? I was 17. Why did we do anything? I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t thought about it in a long time. I think that I was very full of myself and thought that this was a very important piece of news that everybody needed to have. And I also liked needling people and confronting them in ways that I thought would be both funny and self-aggrandising. I don\u2019t look back on that with particular pride.\u201d</p> <p>Her conservative Catholic parents were stunned. \u201cI didn\u2019t handle it well. I wasn\u2019t very respectful and didn\u2019t have much emotional peripheral vision in terms of the way that my actions would affect others, which I think was a product both of my ego and self-regard and where I was in my own development at that time. They had a really hard time at first and we had a few rocky years.</p> <p>\u201cBut now my parents could not be more supportive. I\u2019m Catholic and I come from a Catholic family and the church\u2019s teachings on this have been a factor. But, ultimately, where we\u2019ve ended up is at the best possible place and I am super-blessed to have the support of my whole extended family.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"376e67a8bc73bbba1c9c236857b060633eff21fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/376e67a8bc73bbba1c9c236857b060633eff21fa/0_0_3000_2094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Maddow reports from New Orleans in 2010 on the city\u2019s recovery from Hurricane Katrina five years earlier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you\u2019re at all engaged with what\u2019s going on in the country and in the world, you have to be concerned\u2019 ...

Counterintuitively for a \u201cliberal icon\u201d, their first date involving throwing tomahawks and firing guns at a \u201cLadies Day on the Range\u201d sponsored by the National Rifle Association, of which Mikula\u2019s sister is a lifetime member.</p> <p>Maddow, who does not own a gun, says cheerfully: \u201cGoing to gun ranges is fun. Have you ever done it? You should go. You go and you pick which gun you want, you pay to use the time and they show you how to use it and you learn about the gun and then shoot a target. And then you leave the gun there and you go home.</p> <p>\u201cShooting sports is, I think, an interesting way to demystify guns, particularly if you\u2019re engaged in reporting on or commenting on the politics and culture around guns stuff. I don\u2019t have any problem with that at all. It\u2019s super-fun. Susan, it turns out, is a really good shot, which was a shock.\u201d</p> <p>It says something about the times that Maddow\u2019s ease with guns is more shocking to some than her sexuality. The CNN anchors Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper both came out almost a decade ago. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/26/gay-marriage-legal-supreme-court\" title=\"\">Same-sex marriage was legalised in 2015</a>. Now Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is bidding to become the first openly gay US president. Nothing, however, should be taken for granted. Under cover of myriad distractions, the Trump administration is attacking gay and transgender rights.</p> <p>Maddow reflects: \u201cCivil rights and social justice issues often advance in what I describe as a sawtooth pattern of progress, where you take two steps forward, one step back. It\u2019s work that doesn\u2019t do itself. It has to be done by human beings who are working in a concerted way, in a way that is nimble and that appreciates the potential for backsliding and even backlash.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one piece of this that I feel like we\u2019re learning more and more: that civil rights aren\u2019t a given.

When nobody\u2019s expecting you to tell the truth, you telling a lie isn\u2019t news. If Barack Obama got up and said something that was proveably false or maybe not the whole truth, you\u2019d have the whole media, not just Fox News, going crazy for a month at a time. Donald Trump\u2019s mendacity has never been notable. It\u2019s just been baked in.\u201d Trump made more than 16,000 false or misleading claims in his first three years as president, according to the Washington Post \u2013 and that number is likely to accelerate as the election hots up. But he is undeniably good for ratings and clicks. Media outlets will have to choose whether or not to broadcast his campaign rallies and interview his surrogates unfettered, as well as how far to go in editing, fact-checking or simply \u201cno-platforming\u201d. \u201cWe went through our own transformation fairly early on when I realised that I couldn\u2019t put Trump administration officials on the air as guests because they did not tell the truth,\u201d says Maddow. \u201cHaving to clean up after your guest is a sort of \u2018fool me once\u2019 thing, like: \u2018When I told my audience that you were somebody worth listening to because you had something to contribute to our understanding of the world, I was wrong. I\u2019ve goodnighted you. I won\u2019t invite you back.\u2019\u201d She adds: \u201cI can play the tape of the president saying something that\u2019s not true and then clean up after him \u2013 but then I\u2019ve also just played the tape of him saying something not true, and maybe that\u2019s more compelling to you and more of what you remember than the part where I corrected it. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a responsibility level there. So we\u2019re not going to give people a platform who are lying to the public. But I\u2019m assuming everybody else in the media is going through that same thing.\u201d Observers of all political stripes have taken Maddow to task for her coverage of Trump\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia. Presidential cheerleader Sean Hannity, whose Fox News show airs in direct opposition, has called her \u201cthe chief conspiracy theorist\u201d. In a critique of her handling of a 35-page dossier on the subject compiled by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, Erik Wemple of the Washington Post wrote: \u201cShe was there for the bunkings, absent for the debunkings \u2013 a pattern of misleading and dishonest asymmetry.\u201d But Maddow, whose new book was inspired by Putin\u2019s motives for attacking US democracy, describes some of the criticism as dishonest and makes no apologies for being obsessive, especially since there is every prospect of Putin trying again this year. \u201cRussia interfered in the 2016 election to try to elect Donald Trump, and Donald Trump got elected and he is weirdly and irreversibly supplicant toward Russia and Putin. Like, OK, I\u2019m going to cover that,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anybody says about me. I don\u2019t play requests and I don\u2019t worry about the criticism. If we get something wrong, I\u2019ll correct it, but, in the absence of that, the criticism for focusing on real news stories that bother people \u2013 that\u2019s what I get paid to do.\u201d You have to grow a thick skin, she says. \u201cGetting a show on the air, even all these years in, is like merging on to the freeway at 80 miles an hour at night in a rainstorm with no headlights and no windshield wipers and a bunch of semi-trucks coming up right behind me. Somebody telling me that they don\u2019t like the colour of my car? I am not focusing on you! I\u2019ve got a job to do here.\u201d That freeway sounds terrifying and yet also an adrenaline rush. The Trump presidency is a liberal\u2019s worst nightmare and a dream for many journalists. Jim Acosta, the chief White House correspondent at Maddow\u2019s rival network CNN, has said: \u201cI\u2019m having the time of my life right now. This is the biggest story of my life. I\u2019m like a kid in a candy store.\u201d So, despite the daily horrors, is Maddow secretly enjoying this? \u201cI don\u2019t know if \u2018enjoy\u2019 is the right word, but I do have the best job in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cI talk to a lot of people who feel strongly about what\u2019s going on in the world, whether they\u2019re in public affairs or they\u2019re just concerned citizens who pay attention to what\u2019s going on. People say: \u2018Don\u2019t you find it incredibly demoralising? How do you think about all this stuff all day?\u2019 I feel the opposite. If you\u2019re at all engaged with what\u2019s going on in the country and in the world, you have to be concerned. But my job, what they actually pay me to do, is to read the news all day long and do original reporting and try to figure out what is and isn\u2019t reliable information. I feel like I\u2019m doing mental health work all day long.\u201d Maddow, who grew up in a small town in California, has previously worked as a labourer, a messenger, a waitress and a bucket washer at a coffee-bean factory. \u201cI am not a planner. This definitely wasn\u2019t like the thing that I set my mind toward and then I put together all the pieces to get there. I had much more of a drunken stumble through my career than you might expect, but now that I have landed here, I value it.\u201d She came out at Stanford University by posting an open letter inside every bathroom stall in her dormitory announcing that she was a lesbian, an incident that was reported in the student newspaper. \u201cClassy, right? I was 17. Why did we do anything? I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t thought about it in a long time. I think that I was very full of myself and thought that this was a very important piece of news that everybody needed to have. And I also liked needling people and confronting them in ways that I thought would be both funny and self-aggrandising. I don\u2019t look back on that with particular pride.\u201d Her conservative Catholic parents were stunned. \u201cI didn\u2019t handle it well. I wasn\u2019t very respectful and didn\u2019t have much emotional peripheral vision in terms of the way that my actions would affect others, which I think was a product both of my ego and self-regard and where I was in my own development at that time. They had a really hard time at first and we had a few rocky years. \u201cBut now my parents could not be more supportive. I\u2019m Catholic and I come from a Catholic family and the church\u2019s teachings on this have been a factor. But, ultimately, where we\u2019ve ended up is at the best possible place and I am super-blessed to have the support of my whole extended family.\u201d Maddow has been with her partner, Susan Mikula, a photographer, for two decades. Counterintuitively for a \u201cliberal icon\u201d, their first date involving throwing tomahawks and firing guns at a \u201cLadies Day on the Range\u201d sponsored by the National Rifle Association, of which Mikula\u2019s sister is a lifetime member. Maddow, who does not own a gun, says cheerfully: \u201cGoing to gun ranges is fun. Have you ever done it? You should go. You go and you pick which gun you want, you pay to use the time and they show you how to use it and you learn about the gun and then shoot a target. And then you leave the gun there and you go home. \u201cShooting sports is, I think, an interesting way to demystify guns, particularly if you\u2019re engaged in reporting on or commenting on the politics and culture around guns stuff. I don\u2019t have any problem with that at all. It\u2019s super-fun. Susan, it turns out, is a really good shot, which was a shock.\u201d It says something about the times that Maddow\u2019s ease with guns is more shocking to some than her sexuality. The CNN anchors Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper both came out almost a decade ago. Same-sex marriage was legalised in 2015. Now Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is bidding to become the first openly gay US president. Nothing, however, should be taken for granted. Under cover of myriad distractions, the Trump administration is attacking gay and transgender rights. Maddow reflects: \u201cCivil rights and social justice issues often advance in what I describe as a sawtooth pattern of progress, where you take two steps forward, one step back. It\u2019s work that doesn\u2019t do itself. It has to be done by human beings who are working in a concerted way, in a way that is nimble and that appreciates the potential for backsliding and even backlash. \u201cThat\u2019s the one piece of this that I feel like we\u2019re learning more and more: that civil rights aren\u2019t a given. They\u2019re asserted and protected \u2013 or assailed.\u201d Blowout by Rachel Maddow is published by Bodley Head.

Welcome to our live coverage of the 2020 Australian Open men\u2019s final as first time finalist Dominic Thiem takes to the court against seven time champion Novak Djokovic.</p> <p>What a ride this fortnight has been for Dominic Thiem. He started the tournament with a five set second round scare against 140 ranked wildcard Alex Bolt and shortly after he took the decision to sack Thomas Muster, the Austrian legend he had appointed as a secondary coach, 2 weeks into their partnership and in the middle of a slam. Since then he has improved to play some great tennis but it has seldom been easy. After a desperately tight four set match against Nadal, in which he won three tiebreak sets and produced one of the best wins of his career, he overcame Alexander Zverev in four nervy sets. Thiem\u2019s quality has been clear for a long time, but it is only over the past eleven months that he has finally put his game together on hard courts. He is flattening out his strokes more, standing closer to the baseline, finishing more points at the net and slowly turning himself in the complete player.</p> <p>Still, none of this gets any easier. Tonight he will be facing the defending champion on the court that has defined him. Novak Djokovic may not have established quite the mind-numbing dominance on Rod Laver Arena as Rafael Nadal on Court Philippe Chatrier in Paris, the opponent and site of Thiem\u2019s two other slam finals, but it is damn near close. Djokovic is chasing a record extending 8th title and after producing arguably the performance of his career when he eviscerated Rafael Nadal in last year\u2019s final, the scariest part is that it seems like he has improved. He is serving even better, his second serve speeds have improved dramatically, and he is keeping the world at arms length off the ground. Although he wasn\u2019t always efficient in a strange semi-final against an injured Federer, after two weeks in Australia he has lost only one set of tennis and he hasn\u2019t come close to being troubled. We will see if Thiem can change that in the final.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me today. From another shock championship performance by a young female player to another Big 3 male player edging a five-setter to uphold the status quo, what a crazy two weeks of tennis that was. Thanks a lot for following throughout the past couple of weeks. Bye. Here is Djokovic\u2019s speech. Kudos to these men and women for giving their all in these matches they dreamed of as children, experiencing the extreme elation or distress that comes with a slam final, yet still having the wherewithal to deliver coherent speeches to millions of people in their second language. Not many other sports do this. What a brutal loss that was for Dominic Thiem. He has now lost his first three slam finals, a figure that would normally be described as a crisis (remember Andy Murray?) But his loses have been to Nadal as the Spaniard collected his 11th and 12 Roland Garros titles and now Djokovic enroute to his 8th Australian Open title. Thiem is still constantly improving Djokovic is absolutely right that he should eventually break through and win his first slam, but there is still a mental cost to these losses and it is by no means a certainty that he will eventually win one. The only thing he can do is keep on persevering in the hope that a slam draw will eventually fall his way. Still, another impressive fortnight from a player who is finally putting it together across all surfaces rather than just on clay. Here is Dominic Thiem\u2019s speech. Djokovic to Thiem: I would like to start by saying congratulations to Dominic for amazing tournament. It wasn\u2019t to be tonight but it was a tough match and you were very close to win it. You definitely have a lot more time in your career I\u2019m sure that you will get one of the slam trophies... More! More than one. Djokovic also mentioned the passing of his friend Kobe Bryant and, like Thiem, the bushfire devastation bringing perspective. Here is our first report on Novak Djokovic\u2019s 17th slam title: Dominic Thiem: I would like to start of course with a huge congrats to Novak. Amazing achievement and also to all your team. Unreal what you are doing throughout all this years. You and also two other guys, I think you brought men\u2019s tennis to a complete new level and I\u2019m really proud and happy that I can compete in these times and this period of tennis. I fell a little bit short today but I hope I can get soon a little revenge, so very well done. It\u2019s time for the trophy ceremony. Djokovic\u2019s triumphs today: 8th Australian Open title 17th slam title 78th ATP title, moving him above John McEnroe to 5th all time That match was Novak Djokovic in a nutshell. In the second and third sets, he struggled badly with his serve, his level dropped to the floor and he played some truly horrendous tennis at times. But there is no other player in history as good at digging out of a hole and finding their focus when absolutely necessary. He did it at Wimbledon against Federer and he did it here again. This was by no means a classic match in terms of quality, but it was another mental triumph for the new world number one. He does it! Novak Djokovic recovers from 2-1 sets down in a slam final for the first time to win his 8th Australian Open and 17th slam. He was struggling badly for much of the event, but he always finds a way. An incredible effort from Thiem, but it wasn\u2019t enough. It rarely is against Djokovic. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 *5-4 Dominic Thiem: Thiem has done all he can here. With thanks to a couple of misfiring Djokovic backhands, the Austrian moves through a quick hold to 15 and he will force Djokovic to handle the pressure and serve out his 8th Australian Open title. You never know. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 5-3* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic\u2019s service game opened with the most extraordinary long point, with Thiem finally being dragged into the net and doing just enough to elicit a forehand error from Djokovic\u2019s passing shot. At 15-15, Thiem then crunched an excellent down the line forehand return, forcing a backhand error from Djokovic and opening the door. Djokovic responded with a quick serve and forehand winner combo from 15-30, then he slid in an excellent wide serve for an easy service winner. With a second service winner in a row, he held and pumped a fist to his team. One game away. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 *4-3 Dominic Thiem: Somehow, Thiem survives again. Thiem spent this service game taking his forehand on at full pace and spraying a variety of incredible winners and ghastly unforced errors before finding himself down break point, a defacto match point. He saved the break point with a big ,unreturned serve down the T, then he found an ace at deuce. On his fourth game point, he fired down an excellent service winner off a second serve. Thiem may not win this match, but he is showing that he is such an admirable competitor. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 4-2* Dominic Thiem: Thiem is still trying as hard as he can, but there is only so much you can do against the force that is Novak Djokovic. After two tough deuce games, he pours a tub of salt into Thiem\u2019s wounds with a swift love hold. After struggling so badly on his serve for two sets, now he is serving from the stratosphere. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 *3-2 Dominic Thiem: Thiem digs out another tough hold to stay in the match. After being pegged back from 40-30 to deuce, he found a big serve at deuce followed by a bruising forehand to hold. Thiem is beginning to tire in these longer rallies but he deserves immense credit for his resilience and temperament here. After losing his serve, he immediately fought back and generated break points. He is still fighting with everything he has and, aside from a few words to his box and shakes of the head, he has betrayed almost no emotion in the biggest match of his life. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 3-1* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic survives an excruciatingly tense service game, saving two break points to hold. On the first break point, Thiem set up the point well but then he sent a aggressive forehand into the net. He responded by immediately generating a second break point with a vicious crosscourt backhand. This time, Djokovic responded. He completely changed things up with a serve and volley on break point. He did just enough with the backhand volley to force the error. At deuce, with the tension at its peak, Djokovic then had the clarity to throw in an excellent drop shot. With a final missed backhand from Thiem, Djokovic held. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 *2-1 Dominic Thiem: Djokovic breaks first! Thiem rightfully held his head in his hands as he sent a routine forehand to an open court well long, giving Djokovic a 30-30 window. He then missed a first serve and, of course, Djokovic ground him down until he missed a forehand. With his third successive forehand error, he handed over the break. The defending champ is not missing now and this is turning into a very typical Djokovic recovery after looking horrendous in parts of this match. Can Thiem do anything to break his momentum? Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 1-1* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic bites back with a second successive love hold of the match. Excellent serving, both first and second. At 30-0, Djokovic produced a slow but wicked kick serve to Thiem\u2019s backhand that elicited an error. I keep on going on about it, but now that his second serve is slightly more trustworthy, everything is flowing better. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 *0-1 Dominic Thiem: After losing the opening point, four excellent points in succession from Thiem to secure an essential hold. He burst to a 40-15 with a down the line backhand winner so good that Djokovic applauded, then he finished it off with a serve-forehand one-two. Good work. Thiem has departed to the locker room and he undoubtedly knows that the burden will be on him to raise his level. He didn\u2019t do too much wrong in that set, but he threw in one bad service game and he was viciously punished. Djokovic thrives in these scenarios and Thiem will have to stand up to him in these early stages of the fifth set. After starting the fourth set in a desperate state, Djokovic saved an early break point and he is now serving extremely well and barely missing off the ground. An excellent recovery. This is what he does. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 5-3* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic breaks. Djokovic has indeed dug into this second set and Thiem finally helped him along, missing a simple volley at 15-0 and then double faulting at 15-30. Thiem saved the first break point with a forehand winner, but then he blasted a forehand miles long. Suddenly, Djokovic is serving for a fifth set. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 4-3* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic slams down a quick hold, winning four points in a row from 0-15 to inch back in the lead. Suddenly, he is serving extremely well. Both players are incredibly alert right now and the next 10-15 minutes will be crucial. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 *3-3 Dominic Thiem: Right after Djokovic\u2019s most encouraging hold in a long time, Thiem slams the door shut with an exceptional hold. Djokovic is clearly far happier with his game now and he is hitting cleaner and with greater depth. With the Serb prowling at 30-30, Thiem found a great service winner. Djokovic then dragged him into deuce by winning an endless slice rally. Thiem responded like a champ by going on the attack, pounding forehands and then coolly putting away the overhead after what felt like about 5 clear winners against any other player. He closed off with an easy serve-forehand one-two. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 3-2* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic keeps himself ahead with perhaps his best hold since the second set. He served much better and sealed it off with a dainty cat-and-mouse point in which he brought Thiem forward and then finished the point at the net. Perhaps most importantly, he seems to have figured out how he should hit his second serve now, forcing a return error with a very solid 145kmh second serve at 30-0. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 *2-2 Dominic Thiem: As Djokovic tries to find his level again, Thiem looks free. He held with another sliding ace in a game that included some exceptional hitting, including yet another searing backhand down the line winner. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 2-1* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic keeps himself ahead, but only narrowly as he quickly found himself down 30-40 after a bad forehand miss. He responded incredibly well. At break point, Djokovic did something that he has only attempted once today: he serve and volleyed, scuppering the break point with two slick volleys. He then moved into the net on the very next point and executed another lovely volley. He completed the hold with a bit of luck - a net cord winner off a regular slice. If he is in any mental shape for a scrap, Djokovic should take a lot from how he navigated that game. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 *1-1 Dominic Thiem: These early games are going to be so important for Thiem as Djokovic looks to dig into the fourth set, break early and steal some momentum. We have seen it so often in the past. A great hold to 15 from the Austrian there, closed off with his 9th ace after some exemplary serving. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 1-0* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic pieces together an essential routine hold to open the fourth set, sealed with a point-ending inside-in forehand. He is still struggling with his second serve and rolling them in at laughable speeds, but it was enough there. From John Murray on Twitter: \u201cHow many times has Novak trailed 2 sets to 1 in Australian Open finals?\u201d The answer is zero. Uncharted territory for Novak Djokovic here. However, he is the world\u2019s top expert at playing poorly against the very best yet winning the points that matter and escaping with the win. If he wants to come back, he has to start with his serve which has been a complete mess. After increasing his second serve speed in the off-season and firing huge second serves throughout this tournament, it has unraveled under pressure and it is affecting every part of his game. That was nervy and tough, but Thiem edges out the hold to move to within a set of his first slam title. Thiem moved up set point at 40-30, but he just couldn\u2019t convert. Djokovic forced a forehand error from Thiem on the first set point at 40-30, then Thiem double faulted on the second set point. On the third attempt, Djokovic crunched a great backhand down the line return winner. But after saving a break point, Thiem finally got it done. The three unforced errors by Djokovic from break point up was a great reflection of his level today. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-5* Dominic Thiem: A regulation, businesslike hold from Djokovic with much better serving. Now for the most important game of the match so far: Thiem will attempt to serve this out. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 *1-5 Dominic Thiem: Well, that was easy. Dominic Thiem strolls to a love hold, sealed with a glorious backhand down the line. That shot was missing in action early on but now he can\u2019t stop landing them. One game away from a 2-1 sets lead. Djokovic just had the trainer on for an unspecified reason. The commentators at Eurosport thought they heard something about Djokovic being \u201ctired\u201d. Who knows? Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 1-4* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic finally nabs his first game since 4-4 in the second set. Some good serving and one particularly delightful finish off a serve and volley, but it\u2019s doubtful that Thiem was particularly fussed about that. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 *0-4 Dominic Thiem: Thiem very nearly did help Djokovic back into the set, double faulting at 15-15. But he recovered extremely well, eliciting a Djokovic forehand error with an awesome crosscourt forehand before directing a lovely lob over the Serb\u2019s head. He sealed the hold with an ace. A great sequence. As dire as Djokovic has been since the middle of the second set, Thiem deserves so much credit for how he has handled these tight moments. Six games in a row. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 0-3* Dominic Thiem: Thiem is flying as Djokovic sinks deeper into distress. After Djokovic fell down 0-30 with his 5th double fault of the day, Thiem responded with another brilliant backhand down the line at 15-30, a shot that is finally beginning to fire. On the second break point, Djokovic dumped a weak forehand into the net. It will take something spectacular from Djokovic to win this set from a double break down or something spectacularly poor from Thiem to lose this set. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 *0-2 Dominic Thiem: A tremendous hold from Thiem to consolidate the break. Djokovic played a glorious drop shot at 30-30 to bring up break point, which Thiem erased with a vicious backhand down the line after a long point. At deuce, Thiem landed a huge inside out forehand to bring up deuce before a solid first serve elicited a return error. Bold and brave under immense pressure. From Philip: Djokovic and Federer have played each other 50 times with the Serb winning 27-23 including 11-6 in Grand Slams, 13-6 in tournament finals and 21-10 since 2011. Surely there must be a case for Novak being the greatest player of all time? Yes. Personally, I think that there is a good case to be made for everyone at this point. What Djokovic lacks in slams, he makes up for in the mere fact that he has had to break through both Nadal and Federer to win his slams. Still, I think this will be a better conversation when they all retire. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 0-1* Dominic Thiem: Thiem sensed an opportunity here and he has taken it. At 30-15, he snuck into the net and put away a lovely angled backhand drop volley winner. Then he crunched a forehand down the line winner to bring up break point. Although he missed the break point with a quite horrendous forehand miss as Djokovic stood stranded at the net, Djokovic gave up two bad unforced errors to hand over the early break. Djokovic is particularly struggling on his serve. He opened the game with a double fault and he keeps on falling over his follow-through as he misses first serves. Thiem has to run with this momentum for as long as he can because, with Djokovic, it usually doesn\u2019t last. Here is a lovely photo gallery from two great weeks in Melbourne. \u201cGreat job, man. You made yourself famous. Well done.\u201d - Novak Djokovic to umpire Damien Dumusois after his two time violation calls. Thiem had no problems serving out the first set there, breezing through the hold to 15 with good serving and a couple of enormous forehands. As Djokovic\u2019s mood continues to swing, he has been cool and focused even when struggling with his own form. A well deserved set. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-5* Dominic Thiem: Oh dear. Just as it seemed that Djokovic would wrestle the momentum, Djokovic found himself down 15-30 after a double fault. At 15-30, Djokovic was given his first time violation and the crowd cheered. He responded with a drop shot into the net. At 15-40. Djokovic immediately received another time violation, losing his first serve as a result. He immediately sprayed a forehand long. As he walked past the chair, Djokovic gave the umpire a sarcastic thumbs up. A complete mess of a game. Meanwhile, Thiem is cool and relaxed across the net. He will serve for the set. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *4-4 Dominic Thiem: Djokovic immediately chased after a break, moving to 15-30 and putting immense pressure on the Thiem serve. Thiem recovered extremely well, playing a beautiful forehand dropshot winner after dragging Djokovic out of the court with bruising forehands. At 30-30, he found a forehand on-two punch to bring up game point. But from 40-30, Thiem missed a couple of first serves and sprayed three loose errors in a row: a forehand error and then two backhands errors. Across the net, Djokovic is grunting louder, finding more depth on his strokes and refusing to miss. He is fully dialled in and now he is back on serve. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 3-4* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic pieces together another swift hold to 15. He looks a lot more focused and Thiem is going to have to serve extremely well in order to see this set out. Here is the report on Joe Salisbury\u2019s Australian Open doubles title. He now has a bit more money (around 192,500 pounds) to put towards moving out of his sister\u2019s Peckham flat. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *2-4 Dominic Thiem: A big moment here. Thiem once again found himself down break point after missing another backhand down the line at 30-15 before double faulting at 30-30. From break point down, Thiem stepped up. He scuppered it with a brutal inside out forehand winner and then he found an excellent service winner at deuce. He closed off the game with a sickly sweet low backhand slice, drawing a slice error from Djokovic. Djokovic is smiling bitterly and shaking his head. This is a different match. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 2-3* Dominic Thiem: A much better hold for Djokovic there. Easy and businesslike, sealed with a lovely combo of backhands. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *1-3 Dominic Thiem: Djokovic\u2019s level is finally out of the stratosphere and the fact that he is openly seething isn\u2019t helping. Djokovic opened the game two bad errors and then a weak drop shot-lob combo, with Thiem easily dispatching the overhead. After some excellent defense from Thiem at 40-15, a last ditch Djokovic dropshot landed just wide. It was called in, but Thiem rescued the point with a glorious challenge. Everything is going his way now. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 1-2* Dominic Thiem: Thiem breaks in set two! Thiem finally managed to open up on his trusty backhand down the line early in the game, crushing one such winner to bring up 15-30. At 30-30, Djokovic then double faulted to bring up a break point. This time, a flashy Thiem backhand went well wide on the break. Djokovic saved the second break point with a serve and forehand combo, but on the third, he bizarrely went for a 194kmh second serve and he missed. Game on. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *1-1 Dominic Thiem: Thiem opens with a rare love hold of his own despite landing only one first serve. He opened with some incredible defence, chasing down at least three shots that seemed almost certain winners, including an overhead, before grinding out the unforced error. Helpfully, Thiem\u2019s one first serve was an ace on game point. First set stats: Djokovic: First serves in: 80%, First serve points won: 65%, Second serve points won: 80% Receiving points won: 46% 9 winners, 14 errors. Thiem: First serves in: 73% First serve points won: 63% Second serve points won: 23% Receiving points won: 32% 12 winners, 16 unforced errors Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 1-0* Dominic Thiem: An easy love game from Djokovic to begin, which included a glorious backhand down the line at 30-0. The pressure is all on Thiem right now. Sadly for Thiem, that was a mess of his own making. Thiem opened with two bad unforced errors and although he served extremely well to move back to 30-30, he then tripped over a forehand as he moved towards the net and handed Djokovic a set point. Thiem did extremely well on the set point, dispatching a couple of enormous forehands and then forcing an errant passing shot from Djokovic by moving to the net. But after digging himself to game point, he then threw in two bad errors and followed them with a double fault on set point #2. Six errors in a 4-5 game. He knows that it\u2019s not good enough. The crowd is very rowdy right now and Novak is not pleased. Check out his reaction after this excellent overhead. First set: Novak Djokovic 5-4* Dominic Thiem: The points are getting longer and tougher on Djokovic\u2019s serve, but the Serb gets back on track with an essential hold. After a gruelling rally ended with a Thiem backhand into the net at 30-15, Djokovic held with an unreturned serve. Thiem\u2019s backhand still hasn\u2019t fully arrived in this match. His down the line backhand is going to be essential to flipping these long points in his favour and it needs to start firing. He will serve to stay in the first set. First set: Novak Djokovic *4-4 Dominic Thiem: Thiem survives another difficult hold while under immense pressure from the Djokovic return. This time, from 30-15, Djokovic came up with an incredible inside out forehand to dispatch an excellent low, short slice from Thiem. At 30-30, he produced a brilliant forehand crosscourt return to bring up break point. Thiem saved the break point with aplomb, sweeping into the net to clean up the short ball from a big forehand down the line. He found a big serve from deuce, then he closed it off with another foray to the net and a solid overhead. Two years ago, Thiem would not have even considered finishing either point at the net. He is a different player now. First set: Novak Djokovic 4-3* Dominic Thiem: Finally, Thiem gets stuck into some of the lengthier rallies and he immediately breaks back! At 15-15, he ground Djokovic down until the Serb sent a forehand well wide, then he stepped into the baseline and broke up a gruelling 24 stroke rally fantastic down the line backhand. On the first break point, Djokovic dumped a backhand into the net. Suddenly, we\u2019re back on serve. Return points won: Dominic Thiem: 3 Novak Djokovic: 13 First set: Novak Djokovic *4-2 Dominic Thiem: Thiem digs out another tight hold. Thiem was en-route to an easy game after firing an ace to move up 40-0. He found a first serve, he lined up a backhand down the line, and then sent it just long. Some great returning and baseline pressure from Djokovic elicited a couple of forced errors, pulling him back to deuce. Thiem responded with a great serve and forehand combo, but Djokovic dragged him back to deuce again. Finally, Thiem found an ace on the second deuce and a Djokovic backhand error gave him a second game. First set: Novak Djokovic 4-1* Dominic Thiem: All the action so far is on Dominic Thiem\u2019s serve. Once again, Djokovic breezes through another service game. After arriving at 40-0 thanks to more excellent serving, he took his second game point with a glorious backhand down the line winner after a long rally. First set: Novak Djokovic *3-1 Dominic Thiem: Thiem digs out an excellent first hold, but even that was so difficult. Djokovic has been so aggressive early on and he is controlling far more of the rallies than Thiem expected. Djokovic sent a forehand wide at 30-30, then immediately responded by crunching a crosscourt forehand winner. He went on the prowl again at deuce, but Thiem came up with some incredible defence, throwing up a beautiful lob over Djokovic\u2019s head and then moving forward to dispatch Djokovic\u2019s tweener. He held with a nice serve-forehand combo. First set: Novak Djokovic 3-0* Dominic Thiem: One of the big stories this week has been Djokovic\u2019s improved serving and he showed it there as he breezed through the following service game with ample first serves to consolidate the break. He sealing the hold with another unreturned serve. First set: Novak Djokovic *2-0 Dominic Thiem: Djokovic breaks! What a tough game that was. Thiem worked his way to 40-15, but Djokovic reeled him back to deuce with an excellent point-ending backhand return at 40-15 and then a forehand error from the Austrian. Thiem generated two further game points, but Djokovic scuppered both before winning a crazy cat-and-mouse point at deuce. After a long rally, he drew out a forehand error from Thiem on his first break point to take the lead. A couple of errors from Thiem early on, but Djokovic is already not letting him breathe. First set: Novak Djokovic 1-0* Dominic Thiem: A fine start for the defending champion, who pieced together an easy hold to 15. Djokovic drew out a forehand error from Thiem in a long rally at 15-0, then he slammed down successive aces from 30-15 to hold. Ready? Play. We begin. Djokovic to serve. Dominic Thiem\u2019s growth on hard courts in context: The players have arrived on- court. Djokovic won the toss and should serve first. This should be good. Dominic Thiem on Novak Djokovic: I mean, yeah, it\u2019s true, I won I think more of the last encounters than he did. But I think it doesn\u2019t count so much. It\u2019s absolutely his comfort zone here. He always plays his best tennis in Australia since many, many years. So I\u2019m expecting that as well in the finals. All I can do is doing my best again, playing great tennis again, and of course take a look at the last matches we had as well in Paris and also London, try to repeat the good stuff what I did there. .. I think I have to keep a good balance. Of course, I have to risk a lot. I have to go for many shots. At the same time, of course, not too much. That\u2019s a very thin line. In the last match against him, hit that line perfectly in London. Of course, going to take a look at that match, how I played, and try to repeat it. But for sure he\u2019s the favorite. I mean, he won seven titles here, never lost a final, going for his eighth one. I mean, I\u2019m feeling good on the court. I\u2019m playing great tennis. So try to be at my absolutely best on Sunday. Novak Djokovic on Dominic Thiem: Well, Dominic won our last match we played against each other, a close one in London. He played a terrific match against Rafa last night. I watched that. Definitely one of the best players in the world. Deserves to be where he is. It seems like he\u2019s improved his game a lot on hard courts, because his game is more suitable to the slower surfaces. The clay of course being his favorite surface. But winning Indian Wells I think last year, beating Roger in the finals, that probably gave him a lot of confidence that he can win big tournaments on other surfaces, as well. .. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really anymore next generation. He\u2019s been around for many years. Now already he\u2019s an established top-5, top-10 player. Played a couple of Grand Slam finals, won Masters events, played finals of World Tour Finals. He\u2019s already there. It\u2019s just a matter of one match here and there that can potentially give him a Grand Slam title, that he can actually get in the mix of top three in the world. He definitely has the game. He has the experience now. He has the strength. He has all the means to really be there. He has improved in the last 12 months playing on the hard court without a doubt, and the results are showing that. Here are some highlights of their meeting at the end of last year in London. A not insignificant stat: Thiem is now 7-2 against the big 3 over the past couple of years. He is competing with them consistently and now it is a case of beating two of them in one tournament. Djokovic leads the head-to-head 6-4 but Thiem has won four of their last five meetings. Four of those five meetings came on clay, including two victories for Thiem at Roland Garros, but Thiem finally made a hard court breakthrough against Djokovic at the end of last year as he surprised the Serb with a 6-7(5) 6-3 7-6(5) win in the round robin stages of the ATP Finals. It was an incredible match and performance from Thiem, who blasted winners for three hours and was mostly clean off the ground yet he still just about survived. It shows that Thiem is more than capable of competing with one of the best hardcourt players of his time, but it also shows the stratospheric level that will likely be required over three sets to beat him. It is so difficult. So, what is on the line today? Novak Djokovic is chasing his record extending 8th Australian Open title, his 17th slam title which would put him within two slams of Nadal and three of Federer, a return to the number one spot and his 78th title. Thiem is looking to become the first man born after 1988 to win a slam and the second Austrian ever after Thomas Muster, who he sacked last week. Thiem would rise to third in the rankings with a win and, incredibly, around 1000 points from Djokovic in the rankings. He would be the first new slam champion since Cilic in the 2014 US Open. Still, a great couple of weeks for the Aussie wildcards. It will be difficult to top a slam final on home soil. Earlier today, Britain\u2019s Joe Salisbury became a slam champion for the first time as he and Rajeev Ram of the United States defeated Aussie wildcards Max Purcell and Luke Saville in the men\u2019s doubles final. Hello! Welcome to our live coverage of the 2020 Australian Open men\u2019s final as first time finalist Dominic Thiem takes to the court against seven time champion Novak Djokovic. What a ride this fortnight has been for Dominic Thiem. He started the tournament with a five set second round scare against 140 ranked wildcard Alex Bolt and shortly after he took the decision to sack Thomas Muster, the Austrian legend he had appointed as a secondary coach, 2 weeks into their partnership and in the middle of a slam. Since then he has improved to play some great tennis but it has seldom been easy. After a desperately tight four set match against Nadal, in which he won three tiebreak sets and produced one of the best wins of his career, he overcame Alexander Zverev in four nervy sets. Thiem\u2019s quality has been clear for a long time, but it is only over the past eleven months that he has finally put his game together on hard courts. He is flattening out his strokes more, standing closer to the baseline, finishing more points at the net and slowly turning himself in the complete player. Still, none of this gets any easier. Tonight he will be facing the defending champion on the court that has defined him. Novak Djokovic may not have established quite the mind-numbing dominance on Rod Laver Arena as Rafael Nadal on Court Philippe Chatrier in Paris, the opponent and site of Thiem\u2019s two other slam finals, but it is damn near close. Djokovic is chasing a record extending 8th title and after producing arguably the performance of his career when he eviscerated Rafael Nadal in last year\u2019s final, the scariest part is that it seems like he has improved. He is serving even better, his second serve speeds have improved dramatically, and he is keeping the world at arms length off the ground. Although he wasn\u2019t always efficient in a strange semi-final against an injured Federer, after two weeks in Australia he has lost only one set of tennis and he hasn\u2019t come close to being troubled. We will see if Thiem can change that in the final.",

A 30-second loop of the \u201cSpring\u201d section of the Italian composer\u2019s classic concerto has for more than a decade kept callers company \u2013 and often driven them to distraction \u2013 while waiting to speak to a DWP adviser about a benefits problem. Officials finally decided to ditch the track after discovering some callers found its repetitiveness disturbing. Millions of claimants put on hold while trying to speak to social security staff have been subjected to millions of hours of Vivaldi since the track was introduced in 2006. \u201cWe had some feedback that the Vivaldi clip caused anxiety for claimants and in particular had an impact on autistic callers,\u201d said a DWP spokesperson.

It is not uncommon for callers unable to hang on that long \u2013 possibly \u201cVivaldi\u2019d out\u201d \u2013 to abandon calls altogether.

      "body": "<p>Much of the media has spent the last week reliving the 2016 referendum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/01/brexit-pointless-masochistic-ambition-history-done\" title=\"\">grieving</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/morley-marks-brexit-with-top-hats-bangers-and-jerusalem\" title=\"\">celebrating</a> accordingly. Those of us concerned with social justice cannot afford to look backwards, not when decades of progress \u2013 across protections at work, for the environment, and for equal treatment of all people \u2013 are at stake. This government is leaving the EU on the hardest terms, and our hard-won rights may not survive a deal with Donald Trump\u2019s US.</p> <p>I hate where we have ended up: a reckless government willing to risk jobs, our security and trash the cooperation of the past 50 years; a future that looks precarious for many, particularly for working people across the country whose jobs depend on EU trade. But we still have a choice. The battles of the past four years must end. Labour must get on the front foot and shape an alternative vision for Britain that sets out a better future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/30/labour-leave-remain-divide-brexit\">Now Labour must end the leave-remain divide. Another future is possible | Keir Starmer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We have to go out and win the argument that our future is European. Close cooperation is possible outside the EU \u2013 and it is necessary. For all the talk of trade deals with other countries, our businesses trade with the EU and that\u2019s not going to stop. We have to make and win this argument in the country \u2013 especially in those areas where the leave vote was highest and where the local economy depends on trade with the EU. If there is a lesson to be learned from the devastating referendum defeat, it is that arguments behind the dispatch box will not cut it. We need to go out, arm our activists with the knowledge they need, and win this argument in workplaces, pubs and town halls across the UK.</p> <p>We need to take on the challenges the Tory government is creating \u2013 and answer them. How will we remain competitive in a world where we trade with countries whose businesses can cut corners on how they treat their workers and the damage they do to the planet, when we shouldn\u2019t be allowing UK businesses to do the same? The answer is to invest in the biggest asset we have \u2013 our people. The great protection for our car industry in the north-east against a hard Brexit is the skills that exist in that region, which are second to none, and not found in such great numbers anywhere else. The answer is education, education, education \u2013 in every part of the UK. Investing in our people is now central to the UK\u2019s survival. This is about lifelong learning as well as a huge investment in our young people.</p> <p>And we should bring this attitude and innovation to trade. The bilateral trade deals that the Tories fantasise about are clunky, built for a different era and disadvantage the UK. But our services exports are almost twice the value of goods exports. We need to look at how we can capture the fast growth of trade in services, including through digitisation. This is where our strength already lies. Not in a race to the bottom to provide ever cheaper goods.</p> <p>We have the right base to build on in every part of this country: the reward for a history of ingenuity, entrepreneurship and facing down adversity. Britain is home to world-class education, and a rich and vibrant culture that attracts people from all over the world. From Grimsby and Aberdeen where wind energy is the basis of a thriving economy, to Barrow and Fife where shipbuilding is world-class, we should be making more of our assets and take advantage of the areas where our skills lie. National government has a role in backing those industries to succeed, and backing universities to stay world-class. But to realise this strength we need a political system that can see that such assets and potential must be protected, not just left to the whim of the market alone.</p> <p>For too long our nations and regions have been treated as a problem to be solved.

      "bodyText": "Much of the media has spent the last week reliving the 2016 referendum, grieving or celebrating accordingly. Those of us concerned with social justice cannot afford to look backwards, not when decades of progress \u2013 across protections at work, for the environment, and for equal treatment of all people \u2013 are at stake. This government is leaving the EU on the hardest terms, and our hard-won rights may not survive a deal with Donald Trump\u2019s US. I hate where we have ended up: a reckless government willing to risk jobs, our security and trash the cooperation of the past 50 years; a future that looks precarious for many, particularly for working people across the country whose jobs depend on EU trade. But we still have a choice. The battles of the past four years must end. Labour must get on the front foot and shape an alternative vision for Britain that sets out a better future. We have to go out and win the argument that our future is European. Close cooperation is possible outside the EU \u2013 and it is necessary. For all the talk of trade deals with other countries, our businesses trade with the EU and that\u2019s not going to stop. We have to make and win this argument in the country \u2013 especially in those areas where the leave vote was highest and where the local economy depends on trade with the EU. If there is a lesson to be learned from the devastating referendum defeat, it is that arguments behind the dispatch box will not cut it. We need to go out, arm our activists with the knowledge they need, and win this argument in workplaces, pubs and town halls across the UK. We need to take on the challenges the Tory government is creating \u2013 and answer them. How will we remain competitive in a world where we trade with countries whose businesses can cut corners on how they treat their workers and the damage they do to the planet, when we shouldn\u2019t be allowing UK businesses to do the same? The answer is to invest in the biggest asset we have \u2013 our people. The great protection for our car industry in the north-east against a hard Brexit is the skills that exist in that region, which are second to none, and not found in such great numbers anywhere else. The answer is education, education, education \u2013 in every part of the UK. Investing in our people is now central to the UK\u2019s survival. This is about lifelong learning as well as a huge investment in our young people. And we should bring this attitude and innovation to trade. The bilateral trade deals that the Tories fantasise about are clunky, built for a different era and disadvantage the UK. But our services exports are almost twice the value of goods exports. We need to look at how we can capture the fast growth of trade in services, including through digitisation. This is where our strength already lies. Not in a race to the bottom to provide ever cheaper goods. We have the right base to build on in every part of this country: the reward for a history of ingenuity, entrepreneurship and facing down adversity. Britain is home to world-class education, and a rich and vibrant culture that attracts people from all over the world. From Grimsby and Aberdeen where wind energy is the basis of a thriving economy, to Barrow and Fife where shipbuilding is world-class, we should be making more of our assets and take advantage of the areas where our skills lie. National government has a role in backing those industries to succeed, and backing universities to stay world-class. But to realise this strength we need a political system that can see that such assets and potential must be protected, not just left to the whim of the market alone. For too long our nations and regions have been treated as a problem to be solved. Decisions have been made by a small group of men in London and the south-east. We have piled investment into places that are already pulling ahead to improve productivity and it has left us lagging. One solution is greater devolution. But simple federalism will not do. The change must be much more profound \u2013 real power, in people\u2019s hands. It is only on that basis that we can pull together to build a better future. But this means sticking to our values. We should not be doing trade deals with countries that do not sign the Paris climate agreement. We should call out those who do not make a contribution. To stop exploitation and tax evasion. To require companies to pay the living wage. To level the playing field in ways big and small \u2013 whether we are talking about large companies able to game the system on tax or business rates.

      "bodyText": "We kick off with The Trial You Wish Had Happened, turning the farce of the Senate and impeachment into a daytime courtroom show. Chief Justice John Roberts hands the reins over to Judge Mathis (Kenan Thompson), who brooks no nonsense from the president\u2019s cheerleaders, \u201cSneaky Little\u201d Mitch McConnell (Beck Bennett) and \u201csimple country simpleton\u201d Lindsey Graham (Kate McKinnon). He also allows witnesses to testify, welcoming \u201cmessy bitch who loves drama\u201d John Bolton (Cecily Strong, well-hidden behind a Yosemite Sam mustache), a vape-smoking, hoverboard-riding Hunter Biden (Pete Davidson), and Donald Trump himself. Alec Baldwin\u2019s Trump tries to \u201cWeinstein\u201d everyone by hobbling out on a walker, but it doesn\u2019t fool anyone. A couple of random references to My Cousin Vinny and Les Mis later, things come to a merciful close. After last week\u2019s creative and hilarious cold open, the show is back to its lazy habits. In anticipation of the Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Texans defensive end JJ Watt hosts, though of course he\u2019d rather be playing the game. It\u2019s always a dicey prospect when SNL lets a pro athlete \u2013 even one as charismatic as Watt \u2013 take over as host, and unfortunately Watt delivers a wooden and milquetoast monologue. It\u2019s by no means a disaster, but it has the feel of the high-school jock taking a role in the fall play for credits. A commercial for the Frozen II DVD includes deleted scenes addressing Elsa\u2019s latent gayness, the film\u2019s lack of diversity and Olaf the Snowman growing a crotch carrot. It\u2019s disjointed and goes on way too long. Next, a college football team demand their coach put a third-string nobody (Chris Redd) into the big game, only to quickly realize what a terrible idea that is. It\u2019s a decent send-up of inspirational sports movies like Rudy, but not particularly memorable. Next, Watt and Aidy Bryant play a suburban mom and dad giving their teen son \u201cthe talk\u201d after he walks in on sex. Their cheerfully filthy advice includes nuggets such as \u201cSometimes you gotta man up and clap those cheeks\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need to know how to ride that thang like a soldier!\u201d Then, Watt plays the new spokesman for Olay Eye Black, part of the \u201cjust gay enough\u201d Olay Bro Skin Line.

Asked what any of these people have to do with Black History Month, she continually responds \u201cthey\u2019re black \u2013 and they\u2019re history to me!\u201d It\u2019s a welcome showcase for Nwodim, who rarely gets to be the center of attention.

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill.

This may force auto firms to slash prices on lower-emitting plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to encourage consumers to buy them, according to the investment bank UBS.</p> <p>Average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of almost all cars sold in the EU during the next two years must fall below 95g a kilometre, with heavy fines for carmakers that miss individual targets designed to meet the goal. The rules include the UK until at least 1 January 2021.</p> <p>Around \u20ac8.4bn (\u00a37.1bn) will be wiped from carmakers\u2019 profits over the next two years as they try to comply with the regulations. That\u2019s \u20ac1bn more than previously expected, due to electric car delays and consumers\u2019 desire for more polluting SUVs, according to calculations by UBS analysts led by Patrick Hummel. Sales of PHEVs, which can be charged from an external source without using the internal combustion engine, need to grow sevenfold between 2019 and 2021, they said.</p> <p>\u201cAs [carmakers] likely need to aggressively push PHEVs to their customers, we see risk of a price war in the course of 2020,\u201d wrote Hummel.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s Daimler, the maker of Mercedes Benz cars, and France\u2019s Renault are particularly at risk of missing their targets and having to pay large fines. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is also at risk, despite a deal thought to be worth hundreds of millions of euros to \u201cpool\u201d its emissions with Tesla\u2019s zero-emissions cars. While legal, the deal has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/17/european-parliament-carbon-dioxide-emission-truck-2035\">heavily criticised by campaigners</a>.</p> <p>Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors, is also exposed, with costs of \u00a3179m expected over the next two years. Britain\u2019s largest carmaker, which has just launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/30/jaguar-land-rovers-ralf-speth-to-quit-amid-11bn-cuts-package\">a second round of tough cost-cutting</a> as it struggles with electric investments, needs to increase its hybrid sales rapidly, UBS said.</p> <p>The green credentials of some hybrid cars are controversial because of their continued use of polluting internal combustion engines alongside battery motors.</p> <p>Julia Poliscanova, clean vehicles director at Transport &amp; Environment, a Brussels-based thinktank, said there is evidence that plug-in hybrids rarely achieve the emissions reductions predicted by lab tests because users fail to charge them.</p> <p>\u201cIn the real world, their emissions are often two or three times higher,\u201d she said, referencing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46152853\">findings from the Miles Consultancy</a> which said many business users never used their charging cables.</p> <p>If plug-in hybrids are not charged, they can even emit more carbon dioxide and air pollution than the equivalent car without a battery, because a smaller engine is pulling more weight and therefore running less efficiently.</p> <p>Nevertheless, plug-in hybrids, which can be charged from external sources, are a key part of carmakers\u2019 emission-reduction efforts, because they can use the same factories in which they have already sunk billions of euros in investment.</p> <p>The emissions limits could hardly have come at a worse time for the car industry, with China\u2019s market suffering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/09/china-car-sales-fall-for-first-time-in-more-than-20-years\">two years of recession</a> even before the coronavirus outbreak and sales of their profitable diesel cars in freefall following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/22/dirty-lies-how-the-car-industry-hid-the-truth-about-diesel-emissions\">\u201cdieselgate\u201d emissions cheating scandal</a>. At the same time, consumer confidence is weakening across some key European markets and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/06/uk-car-sales-brexit-diesel-electric-vehicles-emissions\">Brexit uncertainty has dented sales in Britain</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe new car market is soft at the moment so dealers are having to work hard,\u201d said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT, the UK car industry\u2019s lobby group. \u201cIt\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market.\u201d</p> <p>The costs of complying with the regulations are expected to vary across carmakers, which have radically different strategies. For instance, Volkswagen, the world\u2019s largest carmaker by volume, has launched an all-out electric assault, with plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/27/volkswagen-to-hit-1m-electric-cars-milestone-two-years-early\">produce 1m battery electric cars by the end of 2023</a>. Rival executives believe the company panicked after its reputation was sullied by the dieselgate scandal. Rival manufacturers such as BMW and Daimler have instead focused in the short term on hybrids, which are easier to produce using existing factories and avoid problems such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/07/uk-car-industry-future-hinges-not-on-brexit-but-on-batteries\">shortages of lithium ion batteries</a>.</p> <p>Car executives argue that hybrids are essential to reduce society\u2019s emissions. However, they are also particularly attractive from a regulatory perspective. All hybrids that emit less than 50g of CO<sub>2</sub> per kilometre under test conditions qualify for \u201csupercredits\u201d for the next two years. This means they count double under the EU regulations, so carmakers are equally incentivised to sell hybrids and battery electric vehicles.</p> <p>\u201cPlug-in hybrids are a short-term compliance strategy for vehicle manufacturers,\u201d said Poliscanova. \u201cThey are unavoidably costly because you are locked into two engines and a motor. They should not be part of the future.\u201d</p>",

The rules include the UK until at least 1 January 2021. Around \u20ac8.4bn (\u00a37.1bn) will be wiped from carmakers\u2019 profits over the next two years as they try to comply with the regulations. That\u2019s \u20ac1bn more than previously expected, due to electric car delays and consumers\u2019 desire for more polluting SUVs, according to calculations by UBS analysts led by Patrick Hummel. Sales of PHEVs, which can be charged from an external source without using the internal combustion engine, need to grow sevenfold between 2019 and 2021, they said. \u201cAs [carmakers] likely need to aggressively push PHEVs to their customers, we see risk of a price war in the course of 2020,\u201d wrote Hummel. Germany\u2019s Daimler, the maker of Mercedes Benz cars, and France\u2019s Renault are particularly at risk of missing their targets and having to pay large fines. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is also at risk, despite a deal thought to be worth hundreds of millions of euros to \u201cpool\u201d its emissions with Tesla\u2019s zero-emissions cars. While legal, the deal has been heavily criticised by campaigners. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors, is also exposed, with costs of \u00a3179m expected over the next two years. Britain\u2019s largest carmaker, which has just launched a second round of tough cost-cutting as it struggles with electric investments, needs to increase its hybrid sales rapidly, UBS said. The green credentials of some hybrid cars are controversial because of their continued use of polluting internal combustion engines alongside battery motors. Julia Poliscanova, clean vehicles director at Transport &amp; Environment, a Brussels-based thinktank, said there is evidence that plug-in hybrids rarely achieve the emissions reductions predicted by lab tests because users fail to charge them. \u201cIn the real world, their emissions are often two or three times higher,\u201d she said, referencing findings from the Miles Consultancy which said many business users never used their charging cables. If plug-in hybrids are not charged, they can even emit more carbon dioxide and air pollution than the equivalent car without a battery, because a smaller engine is pulling more weight and therefore running less efficiently. Nevertheless, plug-in hybrids, which can be charged from external sources, are a key part of carmakers\u2019 emission-reduction efforts, because they can use the same factories in which they have already sunk billions of euros in investment. The emissions limits could hardly have come at a worse time for the car industry, with China\u2019s market suffering two years of recession even before the coronavirus outbreak and sales of their profitable diesel cars in freefall following the \u201cdieselgate\u201d emissions cheating scandal. At the same time, consumer confidence is weakening across some key European markets and Brexit uncertainty has dented sales in Britain. \u201cThe new car market is soft at the moment so dealers are having to work hard,\u201d said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT, the UK car industry\u2019s lobby group. \u201cIt\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market.\u201d The costs of complying with the regulations are expected to vary across carmakers, which have radically different strategies. For instance, Volkswagen, the world\u2019s largest carmaker by volume, has launched an all-out electric assault, with plans to produce 1m battery electric cars by the end of 2023. Rival executives believe the company panicked after its reputation was sullied by the dieselgate scandal. Rival manufacturers such as BMW and Daimler have instead focused in the short term on hybrids, which are easier to produce using existing factories and avoid problems such as shortages of lithium ion batteries. Car executives argue that hybrids are essential to reduce society\u2019s emissions. However, they are also particularly attractive from a regulatory perspective. All hybrids that emit less than 50g of CO2 per kilometre under test conditions qualify for \u201csupercredits\u201d for the next two years. This means they count double under the EU regulations, so carmakers are equally incentivised to sell hybrids and battery electric vehicles. \u201cPlug-in hybrids are a short-term compliance strategy for vehicle manufacturers,\u201d said Poliscanova. \u201cThey are unavoidably costly because you are locked into two engines and a motor. They should not be part of the future.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Sheep farmer Mark Candy did not realise at first that he had been targeted by rustlers. His Romney ewes graze among trees and rough ground on a Wiltshire country estate, and it was not obvious at first that some were missing.</p> <p>\u201cThen I sensed that something wasn\u2019t quite right,\u201d said Candy, whose family have farmed in the area for five generations. \u201cI did a rough count and it became clear many of them had gone.\u201d</p> <p>It turned out that 72 ewes had been taken in the night. Candy was amazed. \u201cAt night sheep are glued to the spot they are in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like to move. To get those sheep out of there at night they must have had exceptionally trained dogs and very good stockmanship.\u201d</p> <p>Candy\u2019s loss is not an isolated one. Figures released this week by the rural insurer <a href=\"https://www.nfumutual.co.uk/\">NFU Mutual</a> reveal that farm animals worth \u00a33m were stolen from UK farms in 2019.</p> <p>Large-scale sheep thefts in particular are on the rise, making rustling the most costly crime for Britain\u2019s farmers after agricultural vehicle and machinery theft, according to the insurer.</p> <p>Candy\u2019s theft was the third in rapid succession within a few miles. His ewes were taken shortly after Christmas from the Bowood Estate at Derry Hill, near Chippenham. The week before, 61 were stolen from a farm near Melksham, 10 miles away. Forty-five sheep were stolen in November from Lacock, just down the road from Bowood.</p> <p>The loss is hard to take for Candy. He and his wife, Vicky, have worked hard to earn special \u201chigh health\u201d accreditation for their flock. It makes replacing the animals they lost harder as they have to source them from farms with the same accreditation or breed from their own animals. It may take two years for the Candys to get them back to where they were at Christmas. \u201cThe sheep that have been taken are very difficult to replace,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Local farmers have started up a WhatsApp group to try to keep an eye out for each other. Candy said he did not believe the police took the issue seriously enough. \u201cIf tens of thousands of pounds was taken from a bank they\u2019d be all over it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hazel Coles could not believe her eyes when more than 50 of her sheep suddenly vanished from the fields of her Exmoor farm.</p> <p>\u201cI ran round the neighbours to check if they had seen them. Could someone have left a gate open? But, no, they had just gone. The first emotion was disbelief. It\u2019s something we\u2019d heard about in other parts of the country but not around here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e6d18076f22382b4d0f8e852fd85fd42ad0379c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e6d18076f22382b4d0f8e852fd85fd42ad0379c/0_775_3790_2274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheep\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Large-scale sheep thefts are on the rise, making rustling the most costly crime for the UK\u2019s farmers after vehicle and machinery theft, according to insurers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Forty-two ewes and 10 lambs were taken, worth a total of \u00a36,000. Among those taken were four of the farm\u2019s 30 pure-bred Texels. \u201cThey are very much a foundation of the flock. They\u2019re quite difficult to breed and in a few minutes they were gone,\u201d said Coles.</p> <p>Her family has farmed on Exmoor for more than half a century and have never had animals stolen before.

      "bodyText": "Sheep farmer Mark Candy did not realise at first that he had been targeted by rustlers. His Romney ewes graze among trees and rough ground on a Wiltshire country estate, and it was not obvious at first that some were missing. \u201cThen I sensed that something wasn\u2019t quite right,\u201d said Candy, whose family have farmed in the area for five generations. \u201cI did a rough count and it became clear many of them had gone.\u201d It turned out that 72 ewes had been taken in the night. Candy was amazed. \u201cAt night sheep are glued to the spot they are in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like to move. To get those sheep out of there at night they must have had exceptionally trained dogs and very good stockmanship.\u201d Candy\u2019s loss is not an isolated one. Figures released this week by the rural insurer NFU Mutual reveal that farm animals worth \u00a33m were stolen from UK farms in 2019. Large-scale sheep thefts in particular are on the rise, making rustling the most costly crime for Britain\u2019s farmers after agricultural vehicle and machinery theft, according to the insurer. Candy\u2019s theft was the third in rapid succession within a few miles. His ewes were taken shortly after Christmas from the Bowood Estate at Derry Hill, near Chippenham. The week before, 61 were stolen from a farm near Melksham, 10 miles away. Forty-five sheep were stolen in November from Lacock, just down the road from Bowood. The loss is hard to take for Candy. He and his wife, Vicky, have worked hard to earn special \u201chigh health\u201d accreditation for their flock. It makes replacing the animals they lost harder as they have to source them from farms with the same accreditation or breed from their own animals. It may take two years for the Candys to get them back to where they were at Christmas. \u201cThe sheep that have been taken are very difficult to replace,\u201d he said. Local farmers have started up a WhatsApp group to try to keep an eye out for each other. Candy said he did not believe the police took the issue seriously enough. \u201cIf tens of thousands of pounds was taken from a bank they\u2019d be all over it,\u201d he said. Hazel Coles could not believe her eyes when more than 50 of her sheep suddenly vanished from the fields of her Exmoor farm. \u201cI ran round the neighbours to check if they had seen them. Could someone have left a gate open? But, no, they had just gone. The first emotion was disbelief. It\u2019s something we\u2019d heard about in other parts of the country but not around here.\u201d Forty-two ewes and 10 lambs were taken, worth a total of \u00a36,000. Among those taken were four of the farm\u2019s 30 pure-bred Texels. \u201cThey are very much a foundation of the flock. They\u2019re quite difficult to breed and in a few minutes they were gone,\u201d said Coles. Her family has farmed on Exmoor for more than half a century and have never had animals stolen before. Securing the farm is not easy. \u201cPadlocks and chains are next best to a waste of time. They\u2019re too easy to cut.\u201d Coles has placed bales across some gates in areas of the farm. \u201cBut I do worry,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t really think the sheep are safe.

You do your best, you put them where you think they\u2019ll be safest but you can\u2019t completely protect them.\u201d Rebecca Davidson, a rural affairs specialist at NFU Mutual, said rustling caused suffering to farmers and to the animals.

We are concerned that gangs are now using working sheepdogs, which have also been stolen, to get the job done.\u201d An alarming trend is the illegal butchery of animals in the field. Rather than having the bother of moving animals \u2013 and hiding them until they or their meat can be sold on \u2013 thieves sometimes prefer to kill them where they are, butcher the carcasses and leave the remains.

Giving it the go-ahead looks like a bit of a personal setback. So how does he turn defeat into victory?</p> \n<p>One way would be to combine final approval for HS2 with an announcement that the third runway at Heathrow will no longer go ahead.

Anything could happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>From a Downing Street perspective, saying no to Heathrow expansion ticks a lot of boxes. For a start, the prime minister is a lot more hostile to a third runway than he is to HS2. When he was elected to parliament in 2015 he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/01/boris-johnson-heathrow-third-runway-davies-report\">vowed to lie down in front of the bulldozers</a> to prevent the project going ahead. When the issue came before parliament in 2018, the then foreign secretary was so embarrassed that he made sure he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/15/controversial-trip-by-boris-johnson-on-day-of-key-vote-cost-20000\">out of the country</a> and did not have to vote. It would do the prime minister no harm at all to be seen \u2013 for once \u2013 to be keeping his promises.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip will be affected by Heathrow expansion, but so will a lot of other constituencies in west London. There were not that many Conservative losses in the 2019 general election but two of them were in seats under the Heathrow flight path: Putney and Richmond Park. Brexit was the key issue in these heavily remain-voting seats, but the support given by Theresa May\u2019s government to a third runway will certainly not have helped.</p> \n<p>The cost of a third runway at Heathrow is put at \u00a314bn \u2013 a fraction of the current budget for HS2 \u2013 and the money is supposed to come from the private sector. But there have already been questions asked about the ability of Heathrow\u2019s owners to find the cash necessary for the investment, leaving open the possibility that passengers and taxpayers will end up picking up a large chunk of the bill. In any event, the Treasury will have to stump up for the improved road and rail infrastructure that will be needed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3289f51d-eba9-471e-8d3d-20b4b257b473\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Potential emissions</b></p>\n    <p>Construction:</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Huge quantities of steel and concrete including concrete slab-track</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Moving construction materials to site</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Tunnelling (more carbon-intensive than open-air construction)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Construction machines</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Removing soil by truck</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Manufacture of rolling stock</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Journey to work of HS2 employees</p>\n    <p>Operation:</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Power source not guaranteed to be renewable.

Sajid Javid is expected to announce new rules in his March budget that will lead to investment decisions being less focused on national economic growth and more on the impact it will have on helping poorer parts of the country. A tough approach to a third runway would help convince sceptics that the government means it when it says it intends to level up Britain.</p> \n<p>Last but not least, abandoning plans for a third Heathrow would burnish the government\u2019s green credentials in the run-up to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/02/leadsom-gove-touted-cop26-presidency\">crucial climate change summit being held in Glasgow</a> later this year.</p> \n<p>Ministers are desperate for COP26 to be a success but know that it will be judged a failure unless they can get international support for speedier action to reduce carbon emissions. One way of doing that would be for the UK to take the lead by noting an inconsistency between planning for a net zero carbon economy on the one hand and encouraging air travel on the other.</p> \n<p>There are, of course, other factors for the government to consider. It is keen for Britain to be seen as an outward looking country after Brexit and international connectivity is part of the narrative. Business groups will kick up a stink, arguing there will be a loss to jobs and competitiveness, and that passengers will decamp from London to places such as Amsterdam and Frankfurt, where there is more capacity. Carbon emissions will go down in Britain, but go up elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Still, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/01/boris-johnson-heathrow-island-airport-london\">prime minister likes a big announcement</a> and a grand bargain that involved yes to HS2 and no to Heathrow would fall into that category. Business is right: it has all gone very quiet on the question of a third runway. By no stretch of the imagination does Whitehall\u2019s silence definitely mean that Downing Street is cooking something up, and there has been no briefing to that effect. But if Johnson is not rethinking government policy towards Heathrow expansion, then he ought to be.</p>",

Anything could happen.\u201d From a Downing Street perspective, saying no to Heathrow expansion ticks a lot of boxes. For a start, the prime minister is a lot more hostile to a third runway than he is to HS2. When he was elected to parliament in 2015 he vowed to lie down in front of the bulldozers to prevent the project going ahead. When the issue came before parliament in 2018, the then foreign secretary was so embarrassed that he made sure he was out of the country and did not have to vote. It would do the prime minister no harm at all to be seen \u2013 for once \u2013 to be keeping his promises. Johnson\u2019s seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip will be affected by Heathrow expansion, but so will a lot of other constituencies in west London. There were not that many Conservative losses in the 2019 general election but two of them were in seats under the Heathrow flight path: Putney and Richmond Park. Brexit was the key issue in these heavily remain-voting seats, but the support given by Theresa May\u2019s government to a third runway will certainly not have helped. The cost of a third runway at Heathrow is put at \u00a314bn \u2013 a fraction of the current budget for HS2 \u2013 and the money is supposed to come from the private sector. But there have already been questions asked about the ability of Heathrow\u2019s owners to find the cash necessary for the investment, leaving open the possibility that passengers and taxpayers will end up picking up a large chunk of the bill. In any event, the Treasury will have to stump up for the improved road and rail infrastructure that will be needed. Saying no to Heathrow would also counter one of the criticisms levied by Labour councils in the north: that London and the south-east gets more than their fair share of public infrastructure spending. Sajid Javid is expected to announce new rules in his March budget that will lead to investment decisions being less focused on national economic growth and more on the impact it will have on helping poorer parts of the country. A tough approach to a third runway would help convince sceptics that the government means it when it says it intends to level up Britain. Last but not least, abandoning plans for a third Heathrow would burnish the government\u2019s green credentials in the run-up to the crucial climate change summit being held in Glasgow later this year. Ministers are desperate for COP26 to be a success but know that it will be judged a failure unless they can get international support for speedier action to reduce carbon emissions. One way of doing that would be for the UK to take the lead by noting an inconsistency between planning for a net zero carbon economy on the one hand and encouraging air travel on the other. There are, of course, other factors for the government to consider. It is keen for Britain to be seen as an outward looking country after Brexit and international connectivity is part of the narrative. Business groups will kick up a stink, arguing there will be a loss to jobs and competitiveness, and that passengers will decamp from London to places such as Amsterdam and Frankfurt, where there is more capacity. Carbon emissions will go down in Britain, but go up elsewhere. Still, the prime minister likes a big announcement and a grand bargain that involved yes to HS2 and no to Heathrow would fall into that category. Business is right: it has all gone very quiet on the question of a third runway. By no stretch of the imagination does Whitehall\u2019s silence definitely mean that Downing Street is cooking something up, and there has been no briefing to that effect. But if Johnson is not rethinking government policy towards Heathrow expansion, then he ought to be.",

      "bodyText": "Dominic Raab has been accused of engaging in diplomatic \u201csabre-rattling\u201d after rejecting legislative alignment with Brussels and dismissing claims by Michel Barnier that the Brexit agreement makes customs checks in the Irish Sea \u201cindispensable\u201d . The UK foreign secretary said following EU rules after 2021 \u201cjust ain\u2019t happening\u201d and insisted it was wrong for the EU\u2019s senior negotiator to claim that goods entering Northern Ireland and Great Britain would be subject to extra paperwork once Britain leaves the post-Brexit transition period. The UK is embarking on an 11-month transition period during which Boris Johnson and his government will try to secure a future trading and security relationship with the EU. If there is no deal by 31 December, the UK will face a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d no-deal Brexit. Asked on Sky News on Sunday if Michel Barnier was wrong to say there would be border checks on goods moving between the EU and the UK, Raab said this was up to the EU. \u201cYes, he is wrong if the EU lives up to its commitments on its side both in the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect those assurances and agreements to be kept to. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve done this deal \u2013 it is a package.\u201d Barnier made the claim in a speech at Queen\u2019s University in Belfast earlier this week when the EU negotiator said the withdrawal agreement was clear on checks. \u201cThe text is very precise. I always tell the truth,\u201d he said. Later, Raab told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that following EU rules after 2021 \u201cjust ain\u2019t happening\u201d. \u201cWe are entering into these negotiations with a spirit of goodwill. But we are just not doing that other stuff. The legislative alignment, it just ain\u2019t happening,\u201d he said. He accused Brussels of attempting to \u201cshift the goalposts\u201d since the political declaration was signed off last year. Asked about reports of EU demands for the European court of justice to oversee disputes in any trade deal with the UK, Raab said: \u201cWe all agreed that we weren\u2019t going to do that. You knew that, you signed up to the withdrawal agreement and political declaration on that basis. Why are you trying to shift the goalposts? \u201cWe want to have a good positive win-win new deal with the EU. That\u2019s not going to happen if they pull the rug, shift the goalposts.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Raab\u2019s words were a showy and childish attempt to set out the government\u2019s position in the trade negotiations. \u201cIt is \u2018sabre-rattling\u2019 \u2026 It is a bit puerile,\u201d he told the Andrew Marr Show. Raab\u2019s claims followed reports that British diplomats have been ordered to make a symbolic break with Brussels. After Johnson set out a hardline position before talks with the EU begin, the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said the EU could reach a sector by sector deal with the UK if a comprehensive Brexit agreement was not reached by Johnson\u2019s December deadline. But he told the BBC it would be a \u201csecond-class outcome\u201d and mean that negotiations could drag on for years. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t possible to have a comprehensive deal then the back-up plan would be sectoral agreement or some temporary agreements that would buy us more time while we negotiate the comprehensive agreement, but that to me is an inferior outcome. And imposition of bureaucracy, checks, tariffs and quotas, that is not good for anyone,\u201d he told Marr. He added that such a deal \u201cby its nature would be temporary or short-lived because we would still have to come to the agreement on the other matters, which means everything running on to 2021 and 2022\u201d. It is understood Downing Street is not keen on a sector by sector agreement but it could be a fallback that would allow pacts on vital national interests such as security and aviation if talks on other issues break down. A clash in thinking over regulatory alignment between the UK and the EU is already shaping up to be a central sticking point, with the EU insisting on alignment in exchange for access to the single market and the UK threatening to throw up a customs wall around Britain. Varadkar called on the UK to tone down the \u201cnationalist rhetoric\u201d and said negotiations would get off to a better start if they did \u201cnot repeat some of the errors that were made in the last two and a half years\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s not set such rigid red lines that makes it hard to come to an agreement and let\u2019s tone down the kind of nationalistic rhetoric,\u201d he told the BBC. He said reports that British ambassadors were being instructed to sit away from EU ambassadors at international events was \u201csilly\u201d. \u201cI think it just comes across as a little bit petty. It\u2019s kind of when you are in primary school and in secondary school and you get worried about who you can sit beside in class. Most international forums I have attended, whether it\u2019s the UN or other international bodies, you tend to be seated in alphabetic order or protocol.\u201d He said it was \u201cpossible to have a Canada-style trade agreement\u201d but it would not make sense because of the UK\u2019s geography. \u201cCanada isn\u2019t the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t geographically part of the European continent.

How so?</strong><br>It\u2019s a different way of looking at a play. I initially approached <em>Taming of the Shrew</em> with trepidation, because of what I thought it was and what I\u2019d been told. The gender politics presents challenges to a modern audience, for example. But Maria\u2019s process drills down into the essence of the story. Shakespeare works on a mythical level that we don\u2019t in our everyday lives.</p> <p><strong>Aren\u2019t you playing different characters in different performances?</strong><br>Maybe! Part of the deal was that we all signed up without knowing who we\u2019d be playing. It meant that during rehearsals we\u2019d explore the whole play and see what emerged, rather than each looking at it through a single character. Eventually we settled on three alternative ways it can be cast. We\u2019re currently concentrating on one of those, but that could change. The director\u2019s philosophy is that any of us could play any part. It\u2019s an ongoing process, which is exciting.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve said nothing scares you more than an empty theatre\u2026</strong><br>That\u2019s true, but a full theatre can also be quite scary. Maybe it\u2019s just theatre generally! Both spaces at the Globe are so intimate, there\u2019s nowhere to hide. You\u2019re surrounded by the audience. They see the whites of your eyes. It\u2019s both frightening and invigorating.</p> <p><strong>How is it working with your wife, Michelle Terry?</strong><br>I love working with her \u2013 otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have done so many shows together! We last worked together on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/16/macbeth-review-sam-wanamaker-playhouse-london\" title=\"\"><em>Macbeth</em></a>, which was very intense and psychological, but this is different. We\u2019re not playing opposite each other, here we\u2019re part of an ensemble.</p> <p><strong>You sometimes take your three-year-old daughter, Scout,</strong><strong> to work. How would you feel if she wanted to follow you both into acting?</strong><br>I\u2019d strongly discourage it, of course [laughs]. No, that would feel like a betrayal of how we\u2019ve both spent our lives. I\u2019d encourage her if that\u2019s what she wanted, but I\u2019d make sure it was for the right reasons. Not fame and money \u2013 there\u2019s got to be something else, otherwise it\u2019s hard to last. She\u2019s currently going through a \u201cWatch me!\u201d phase and loves going to the Globe, so who knows what will happen? We\u2019re really lucky she can grow up around that.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve done two full series of <em>Motherland</em> now. Has it become a tight team?</strong><br>It truly has. I have a lot of fun with Anna Maxwell Martin [who plays Julia] and Diane Morgan [Liz] especially. We really get on and I hope that chemistry comes across onscreen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b6962a51296ec28c74fb3a191c20b14b9f165d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b6962a51296ec28c74fb3a191c20b14b9f165d1/0_128_4500_2629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Ready as Kevin with, from left, Phillipa Dunne, Anna Maxwell Martin and Diane Morganin Motherland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"584\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Ready as Kevin with, from left, Phillipa Dunne, Anna Maxwell Martin and Diane Morgan in Motherland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You seemed to spend most of the recent series in cycling gear\u2026</strong><br>Well, Kevin\u2019s very busy. Always on the go. His marriage is in a terrible, loveless state but he holds everything together for those kids, bless him.</p> <p><strong>Which character\u2019s parenting style does your real life most resemble?</strong><br>At the soft play centre, I\u2019m Kevin. But when I\u2019m trying to balance my work and learning lines with parenting, I\u2019m probably heading straight towards Julia levels of stress.</p> <p><strong>Have fellow parents started to behave differently around you at playdates?</strong><br>Not really. I have a massive beard at the moment so I don\u2019t look much like Kevin. Although, brilliantly, a woman did sidle up to me at a kid\u2019s party the other day and say: \u201cMy friends call me the female Kevin.\u201d Normally people don\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re Kevins, but we\u2019ve all got Kevin in us.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever cooked \u201can event pig\u201d, like Kevin on that cottage minibreak?</strong><br>Never. I\u2019m not tempted either. It looked like hell and I\u2019d definitely give people food poisoning.</p> <p><strong>You played the </strong><strong>home </strong><strong>secretary\u2019s aide in <em>Bodyguard</em>. What was it like being part of such a ratings phenomenon?</strong><br>It took me a bit by surprise, not because Jed Mercurio\u2019s scripts weren\u2019t brilliant, but because the response to it was so epic. There was one episode where it looked like it was me who\u2019d blown up Keeley Hawes. At that point, I was definitely getting some funny looks on the tube.</p> <p><strong>In Channel 4 conspiracy thriller <em>Utopia</em>, you memorably gouged out someone\u2019s eye with a teaspoon. Was that fun?</strong><br>I loved that role. I originally auditioned for another part, but the director said: \u201cCome and try out for Lee the hitman instead.\u201d I never thought I\u2019d get the chance to play that sort of character. I always want varied roles, so to play Kevin at one extreme, then spoon out someone\u2019s eye at the other \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get better than that.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s next for you?</strong><br>A third series of <em>Motherland</em> has been commissioned and they\u2019re in the process of writing it now, so we\u2019ll probably film it later this year. I also played a part in something else and that character might go again. I can\u2019t say more than that! I\u2019m always looking for the next adventure.</p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s on your bucket list to work with?</strong><br>I\u2019d love to do some more film in future. Directors I\u2019d love to work with include Paul Thomas Anderson, Yorgos Lanthimos and Ruben \u00d6stlund. I adore their different approaches to storytelling. Failing that, a voiceover in <em>Trolls 3</em> \u2013 then my kid will be happy.</p> <p><strong>What do you do when you\u2019re not working?</strong><br>Mainly parenting, but that\u2019s at a fun stage where it\u2019s basically playing. I\u2019ve got very good at doing different voices for Anna, Elsa and Kristoff from <em>Frozen</em>.</p> <p><strong>Do you get typecast in one role?</strong><br>No, it\u2019s pretty freeform. Depends what my daughter\u2019s woken up as that day.</p> <p><strong>Sounds a bit like <em>Taming Of The Shrew</em></strong><br>It completely is [laughs]. I\u2019m basically taking my work home with me, aren\u2019t I?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/whats-on/the-taming-of-the-shrew-2020/\" title=\"\"><em>The Taming of the Shrew</em></a><em> runs until 18 April at The Globe, London SE1</em></p>",

You\u2019ve said nothing scares you more than an empty theatre\u2026 That\u2019s true, but a full theatre can also be quite scary. Maybe it\u2019s just theatre generally! Both spaces at the Globe are so intimate, there\u2019s nowhere to hide. You\u2019re surrounded by the audience. They see the whites of your eyes. It\u2019s both frightening and invigorating. How is it working with your wife, Michelle Terry? I love working with her \u2013 otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have done so many shows together! We last worked together on Macbeth, which was very intense and psychological, but this is different. We\u2019re not playing opposite each other, here we\u2019re part of an ensemble. You sometimes take your three-year-old daughter, Scout, to work. How would you feel if she wanted to follow you both into acting? I\u2019d strongly discourage it, of course [laughs]. No, that would feel like a betrayal of how we\u2019ve both spent our lives. I\u2019d encourage her if that\u2019s what she wanted, but I\u2019d make sure it was for the right reasons. Not fame and money \u2013 there\u2019s got to be something else, otherwise it\u2019s hard to last. She\u2019s currently going through a \u201cWatch me!\u201d phase and loves going to the Globe, so who knows what will happen? We\u2019re really lucky she can grow up around that. You\u2019ve done two full series of Motherland now. Has it become a tight team? It truly has. I have a lot of fun with Anna Maxwell Martin [who plays Julia] and Diane Morgan [Liz] especially. We really get on and I hope that chemistry comes across onscreen. You seemed to spend most of the recent series in cycling gear\u2026 Well, Kevin\u2019s very busy. Always on the go. His marriage is in a terrible, loveless state but he holds everything together for those kids, bless him. Which character\u2019s parenting style does your real life most resemble? At the soft play centre, I\u2019m Kevin. But when I\u2019m trying to balance my work and learning lines with parenting, I\u2019m probably heading straight towards Julia levels of stress. Have fellow parents started to behave differently around you at playdates? Not really. I have a massive beard at the moment so I don\u2019t look much like Kevin. Although, brilliantly, a woman did sidle up to me at a kid\u2019s party the other day and say: \u201cMy friends call me the female Kevin.\u201d Normally people don\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re Kevins, but we\u2019ve all got Kevin in us. Have you ever cooked \u201can event pig\u201d, like Kevin on that cottage minibreak? Never. I\u2019m not tempted either. It looked like hell and I\u2019d definitely give people food poisoning. You played the home secretary\u2019s aide in Bodyguard. What was it like being part of such a ratings phenomenon? It took me a bit by surprise, not because Jed Mercurio\u2019s scripts weren\u2019t brilliant, but because the response to it was so epic. There was one episode where it looked like it was me who\u2019d blown up Keeley Hawes. At that point, I was definitely getting some funny looks on the tube. In Channel 4 conspiracy thriller Utopia, you memorably gouged out someone\u2019s eye with a teaspoon. Was that fun? I loved that role. I originally auditioned for another part, but the director said: \u201cCome and try out for Lee the hitman instead.\u201d I never thought I\u2019d get the chance to play that sort of character. I always want varied roles, so to play Kevin at one extreme, then spoon out someone\u2019s eye at the other \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get better than that. What\u2019s next for you? A third series of Motherland has been commissioned and they\u2019re in the process of writing it now, so we\u2019ll probably film it later this year. I also played a part in something else and that character might go again. I can\u2019t say more than that! I\u2019m always looking for the next adventure. Who\u2019s on your bucket list to work with? I\u2019d love to do some more film in future. Directors I\u2019d love to work with include Paul Thomas Anderson, Yorgos Lanthimos and Ruben \u00d6stlund. I adore their different approaches to storytelling. Failing that, a voiceover in Trolls 3 \u2013 then my kid will be happy. What do you do when you\u2019re not working? Mainly parenting, but that\u2019s at a fun stage where it\u2019s basically playing. I\u2019ve got very good at doing different voices for Anna, Elsa and Kristoff from Frozen. Do you get typecast in one role? No, it\u2019s pretty freeform. Depends what my daughter\u2019s woken up as that day. Sounds a bit like Taming Of The Shrew It completely is [laughs]. I\u2019m basically taking my work home with me, aren\u2019t I? The Taming of the Shrew runs until 18 April at The Globe, London SE1",

The company was co-founded in 2014 by <a href=\"https://biox.stanford.edu/people/tony-wyss-coray\" title=\"\">Tony Wyss-Coray</a>, a neurologist at Stanford University, after he published papers showing that the rejuvenating effect of parabiosis extended to the mouse brain. Old mice showed improved performance on cognitive tasks, and grew new neurons. His studies also showed that it was young plasma that had the beneficial effect, with proteins in that plasma seeming largely responsible.</p> <p>Alkahest, which has about 80 employees and more than $41.5m in funding, has clinical trials under way and is reporting its first results. \u201cWe\u2019re not just big mice,\u201d says Steven Braithwaite, Alkahest\u2019s chief scientific officer. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen so much in our animal models that convinces us, but we need to learn from people.\u201d</p> <p>In August of last year, Alkahest reported the results from a six-month trial that saw 40 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease infused with a proprietary human plasma \u201cfraction\u201d. It appeared to arrest their expected mental decline.</p> <p>The fraction was one of two that Alkahest has developed that are similar in nature. Each contains about 500 proteins \u2013 far fewer than the 10-20,000 contained in natural human plasma. The fractions are made from pooled plasma, which allows for a homogeneous product, by Grifols, a plasma-derived medicines company that is an investor in Alkahest. The fractions contain fewer of the proteins that increase with age (and tend to be detrimental), leaving more that decrease with age (and tend to be beneficial). Donors to the plasma pool are in their early 30s, on average \u2013 much younger than intended recipients. </p> <p>Alkahest believes that the fractions could affect symptoms and slow progression of neuro-degenerative diseases. Trials among patients with severe Alzheimer\u2019s and with Parkinson\u2019s are due to report. Following the encouraging results among patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s, a larger trial with placebo control is planned. Depending on the trials, the company hopes that fractionated plasma treatments will be available within a decade. Yet the point, says Braithwaite, is not actually to be an enriched-plasma company. It wants to further refine those fractions, to perhaps 10 or 20 of the most beneficial proteins, and bioengineer them: no plasma needed. This is necessary, says Braithwaite, because the supply of donated plasma is always going to be limited.</p> <p>Alkahest also has results showing that a drug that deactivates a protein in old blood could help with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Two small six-week trials in patients with AMD \u2013 29 who had never been treated for the disease and 26 who hadn\u2019t responded adequately to existing treatment \u2013 showed that most maintained or improved their visual acuity as judged by how successfully they read a standard eye chart. They were treated with a pill designed by Alkahest to block the signalling of a bad protein called Eotaxin, which Wyss-Coray found was increased in old mice and has negative effects.</p> <h2><strong>Elevian</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ce25157aeceaf340c5e04b570f940fa37d841e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ce25157aeceaf340c5e04b570f940fa37d841e6/0_179_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elevian scientists in the Pagliuca Harvard Life Lab.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elevian scientists in the Pagliuca Harvard Life Lab.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elevian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Startup <a href=\"https://www.elevian.com/\" title=\"\">Elevian</a> also wants to commercialise the power of parabiosis. It was co-founded in 2018 by Amy Wagers, who was on the Stanford parabiosis revival team and is now a professor of stem-cell and regenerative biology at Harvard University.</p> <p>The company is based in Boston, but with an office in Silicon Valley, and is backed by $9.4m in investment, including from the firm of Peter Diamandis, a tech entrepreneur and futurist. It is working on therapies to elevate the activity of Growth Differentiation Factor 11 (GDF11) \u2013 a protein in blood plasma present in very small amounts that it believes decreases with age in mice.</p> <p>Studies published in 2013 and 2014 by Wagers\u2019s laboratory and those of the company\u2019s other scientific co-founders, showed that old mice injected with GDF11 reproduced several of the parabiosis findings \u2013 with regeneration seen in the heart, skeletal muscle and brain. It is the only factor that has been demonstrated in old mice to have beneficial effects across a number of major organs that decline with age, notes Wagers. Elevian is working on scaling up GDF11 production before launching its first human trial. It wants first to test whether injections of the protein promote stroke recovery. \u201cStroke recovery is a very significant unmet medical need,\u201d says Mark Allen, Elevian\u2019s CEO. It is also trying to develop new molecules that could lead to less frequent GDF11 injections, and has a project using artificial intelligence to discover small molecules that could produce GDF11\u2019s biological actions, so patients could take a pill instead.</p> <p>GDF11 is controversial. It has proved hard to replicate some of the regeneration findings, calling into question its use as a potential therapy.</p> <p>Nathan LeBrasseur, a scientist who studies ageing at the Mayo Clinic, a not-for-profit academic medical centre in Minnesota, says his lab could not find that GDF11 changed with age. \u201cI\u2019m challenged to see a therapeutic opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cFor skeletal and cardiac muscle, I have not seen compelling evidence for a beneficial effect of GDF11 beyond the initial papers, and while there is a possibility of beneficial effects of GDF11 on the brain, preventing adverse effects on muscle or heart poses a challenge.\u201d</p> <p>For Paul Robbins, a researcher who works on the biology of ageing at the University of Minnesota, the negative data doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the original findings are wrong. \u201cIt just means that it\u2019s a complicated system, and the question is why it works in some hands and not in others,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Wagers acknowledges that there is much to learn about GDF11 biology. She points out that the protein is difficult to measure, because it reacts with other proteins and can exist in both active and inactive forms. But she and Allen defend the improvements seen in muscle and heart when GDF11 was supplemented. A \u201ctherapeutic window\u201d may be at play, suggests Wagers. Too little or too much and effects are deleterious \u2013 and many conflicting studies used high doses. There is \u201cstrong data for moving forward\u201d with Elevian\u2019s programme, says Wagers. Her research group, sponsored by the company, is busy with additional experiments to test what they think is going on. \u201cWe\u2019re letting the data lead us and we will report whatever the outcome is,\u201d she says. \u201cControversy pushes the field forward.\u201d</p> <p>Which approach is likely to best slow or reverse age-related diseases based on parabiosis\u2019s effects? Alkahest\u2019s plasma fractions are the \u201csafe bet\u201d, says Robbins. \u201cI can\u2019t say that results from the clinic [to date] have been amazing [but] I think they will have something that works.\u201d Elevian could be closer to a home run, however, if it can resolve the issues with the biology of GDF11. \u201cIf it does work as initially published it could change our treatments for ageing,\u201d says Robbins.</p> <p>For LeBrasseur, the most promising is Alkahest\u2019s approach of fixing aged blood by inhibiting bad proteins. Aged blood appears to promote disease and impair rejuvenation, he notes: \u201cAddressing what is causing that may be more effective than simply dripping in young factors.\u201d</p> <h2>Ambrosia, plasma and the FDA</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0e0944a085e61fc4f8bc865c2378ef69b4e4792\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0e0944a085e61fc4f8bc865c2378ef69b4e4792/0_60_4366_2620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frozen blood plasma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frozen blood plasma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralf Hirschberger/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2016, Jesse Karmazin began offering infusions of young whole-plasma as a way to help beat ageing, without published evidence that the treatment worked. By the end of 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2017/aug/21/ambrosia-the-startup-harvesting-the-blood-of-the-young\" title=\"\">Ambrosia</a>, the US startup he founded, which charges $8,000 for one litre or a discounted $12,000 for two, had opened clinics in five US cities. But in February of last year, the FDA issued a general warning to consumers: plasma infusions from young people provide \u201cno proven clinical benefit\u201d against ageing or its diseases. And, as with any plasma product, the infusions could pose risks.</p> <p>The company wasn\u2019t warned first by the FDA. \u201cIt came out of the blue,\u201d says Karmazin, who ceased operations out of caution and to understand the FDA\u2019s position. <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/exclusive-ambrosia-the-young-blood-transfusion-startup-is-quietly-back-in-business-ee2b7494b417\">Last </a><a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/exclusive-ambrosia-the-young-blood-transfusion-startup-is-quietly-back-in-business-ee2b7494b417\">October</a>, after an eight-month hiatus, Ambrosia reopened as a scaled-back operation with a clinic in San Francisco. As Karmazin sees it, the law is on his side. Plasma is an approved drug; his treatment is just an off-label one, which is allowed. And while the FDA statement says that procedures such as his \u201cshould\u201d be performed under an active Investigational New Drug (IND) application, that isn\u2019t the same as saying they are required to be. \u201cMy lawyers are all telling me I have the legal right to do this,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Ambrosia\u2019s approach irks many scientists trying to methodically translate the effects of parabiosis into therapies to slow or reverse ageing. It is unfortunate, says Amy Wagers of Elevian, when scientific work and Ambrosia\u2019s approach become conflated. \u201cI think the FDA did the right thing,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, Karmazin says he still plans to publish the results of a clinical trial of customers given infusions that compares their biomarkers before and after (it wasn\u2019t placebo-controlled) \u2013 but first he is getting the company back on its feet.</p> <p>Whether the FDA will come after Ambrosia again is unclear. It doesn\u2019t comment on compliance matters but said in a statement that it had not \u201clicensed or approved any plasma product obtained from young donors for any use\u201d.</p>",

Studies published in 2013 and 2014 by Wagers\u2019s laboratory and those of the company\u2019s other scientific co-founders, showed that old mice injected with GDF11 reproduced several of the parabiosis findings \u2013 with regeneration seen in the heart, skeletal muscle and brain. It is the only factor that has been demonstrated in old mice to have beneficial effects across a number of major organs that decline with age, notes Wagers. Elevian is working on scaling up GDF11 production before launching its first human trial. It wants first to test whether injections of the protein promote stroke recovery. \u201cStroke recovery is a very significant unmet medical need,\u201d says Mark Allen, Elevian\u2019s CEO. It is also trying to develop new molecules that could lead to less frequent GDF11 injections, and has a project using artificial intelligence to discover small molecules that could produce GDF11\u2019s biological actions, so patients could take a pill instead. GDF11 is controversial. It has proved hard to replicate some of the regeneration findings, calling into question its use as a potential therapy. Nathan LeBrasseur, a scientist who studies ageing at the Mayo Clinic, a not-for-profit academic medical centre in Minnesota, says his lab could not find that GDF11 changed with age. \u201cI\u2019m challenged to see a therapeutic opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cFor skeletal and cardiac muscle, I have not seen compelling evidence for a beneficial effect of GDF11 beyond the initial papers, and while there is a possibility of beneficial effects of GDF11 on the brain, preventing adverse effects on muscle or heart poses a challenge.\u201d For Paul Robbins, a researcher who works on the biology of ageing at the University of Minnesota, the negative data doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the original findings are wrong. \u201cIt just means that it\u2019s a complicated system, and the question is why it works in some hands and not in others,\u201d he says. Wagers acknowledges that there is much to learn about GDF11 biology. She points out that the protein is difficult to measure, because it reacts with other proteins and can exist in both active and inactive forms. But she and Allen defend the improvements seen in muscle and heart when GDF11 was supplemented. A \u201ctherapeutic window\u201d may be at play, suggests Wagers. Too little or too much and effects are deleterious \u2013 and many conflicting studies used high doses. There is \u201cstrong data for moving forward\u201d with Elevian\u2019s programme, says Wagers. Her research group, sponsored by the company, is busy with additional experiments to test what they think is going on. \u201cWe\u2019re letting the data lead us and we will report whatever the outcome is,\u201d she says. \u201cControversy pushes the field forward.\u201d Which approach is likely to best slow or reverse age-related diseases based on parabiosis\u2019s effects? Alkahest\u2019s plasma fractions are the \u201csafe bet\u201d, says Robbins. \u201cI can\u2019t say that results from the clinic [to date] have been amazing [but] I think they will have something that works.\u201d Elevian could be closer to a home run, however, if it can resolve the issues with the biology of GDF11. \u201cIf it does work as initially published it could change our treatments for ageing,\u201d says Robbins. For LeBrasseur, the most promising is Alkahest\u2019s approach of fixing aged blood by inhibiting bad proteins. Aged blood appears to promote disease and impair rejuvenation, he notes: \u201cAddressing what is causing that may be more effective than simply dripping in young factors.\u201d Ambrosia, plasma and the FDA In 2016, Jesse Karmazin began offering infusions of young whole-plasma as a way to help beat ageing, without published evidence that the treatment worked. By the end of 2018 Ambrosia, the US startup he founded, which charges $8,000 for one litre or a discounted $12,000 for two, had opened clinics in five US cities. But in February of last year, the FDA issued a general warning to consumers: plasma infusions from young people provide \u201cno proven clinical benefit\u201d against ageing or its diseases. And, as with any plasma product, the infusions could pose risks. The company wasn\u2019t warned first by the FDA. \u201cIt came out of the blue,\u201d says Karmazin, who ceased operations out of caution and to understand the FDA\u2019s position. Last October, after an eight-month hiatus, Ambrosia reopened as a scaled-back operation with a clinic in San Francisco. As Karmazin sees it, the law is on his side. Plasma is an approved drug; his treatment is just an off-label one, which is allowed. And while the FDA statement says that procedures such as his \u201cshould\u201d be performed under an active Investigational New Drug (IND) application, that isn\u2019t the same as saying they are required to be. \u201cMy lawyers are all telling me I have the legal right to do this,\u201d he says. Ambrosia\u2019s approach irks many scientists trying to methodically translate the effects of parabiosis into therapies to slow or reverse ageing. It is unfortunate, says Amy Wagers of Elevian, when scientific work and Ambrosia\u2019s approach become conflated. \u201cI think the FDA did the right thing,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, Karmazin says he still plans to publish the results of a clinical trial of customers given infusions that compares their biomarkers before and after (it wasn\u2019t placebo-controlled) \u2013 but first he is getting the company back on its feet. Whether the FDA will come after Ambrosia again is unclear. It doesn\u2019t comment on compliance matters but said in a statement that it had not \u201clicensed or approved any plasma product obtained from young donors for any use\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "For some of Supreme\u2019s most die-hard fans, the highly coveted garments exist solely in their closets. Supreme\u2019s box-logo tees, the Birkin bags of skatewear, are treated with the sort of care and attention typically given to a wedding dress \u2013 vacuum sealed and tucked away for safekeeping. The protective impulse makes sense: Supreme\u2019s hyped and limited collaborations often get flipped for 10 times their selling price, creating serious profit for resellers and casual fans alike. So why are Supreme fans filming themselves burning or destroying their tees with scissors and hot irons and posting the clips to YouTube and Instagram? This bizarre brand of content is self-consciously silly and plays like a 2020 update of MTV\u2019s slapstick prank show Jackass. But are these savage, costly destructions an anti-capitalist statement, Gen-Z nihilism or simply a shameless play for clicks? \u201cAny video with \u2018Supreme\u2019 in the title will get traffic,\u201d says Gianmarco Garofalo, who recorded a video where he and his friends destroyed a Supreme x Louis Vuitton box-logo tee, worth over $1,000 in resell markets. \u201cDestroying something that is worth so much, I think people find entertainment in that. They watch the videos because they can\u2019t do it.\u201d In one video, Tristan Wick, a 17-year-old from South Carolina, takes a sharpie to his Supreme x Damien Hirst tee (worth over $400 on resale markets) and scribbles \u201cNothing Matters\u201d in skinny, large letters. In another, Eric Whiteback, known as \u201cthe Supreme Guy\u201d, tie-dyes a rare camo-print tee, creating a one-of-a-kind design for himself. Whiteback has over 400,000 followers on Instagram (where he primarily posts his videos) and Wick has over 25,000 YouTube subscribers. Whiteback says he customizes and destroys his high-valued tees to remind people that, at the end of the day, they\u2019re just clothes. \u201cToo many people view their Supreme items as sacred \u2013 never taking off the tags and leaving the items in their closets for years,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cI want to break that mold and do something fun, creative, and shocking.\u201d Whiteback\u2019s original creations are largely credited for feeding the ever-growing customizations trend in streetwear. However, Supreme-heads are divided over these DIY-designs, popularized by Whiteback, the YouTuber Marko Terzo, and others. Some call the alterations destruction, others view them as art. \u201cA lot of people shame Whiteback for what he does,\u201d Garofalo says, citing him as a major inspiration for his own videos. \u201cIt triggers people.\u201d These creators can stand to lose a Supreme tee every now and then.

Do we need it more masculine?\u2019\u201d Male actors, she said, aren\u2019t thinking: \u201c\u2018I still need to look like this because I\u2019m a leading man.\u2019 That\u2019s out of the question now. It\u2019s almost like everyone is looking at things with more neutral goggles.\u201d</p> <p>Film critic Guy Lodge believes that now actors use their style as something that can supplement their brand. \u201cMale actors dress in ways that support and complement their screen personae,\u201d he says. \u201cChadwick Boseman has crafted a kind of Afro-futurist red-carpet look befitting of <em>Black Panther</em>. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet makes offbeat choices that stress his youth and artsiness. Donald Glover has a whole soul-dandy thing going on, and so on.

It\u2019s less about binaries and more about a plurality of dressing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to play with codes. I think that the era of being masculine only if you have a specific suit \u2013 it\u2019s over,\u201d he told US <em>GQ</em>\u2019s New Masculinity issue in October. Put simply: the Male Diva rules the red carpet roost. The MD\u2019s best friend is his stylist, he\u2019s a trend starter (that could mean wearing an up-and-coming designer, but that could also mean sporting an unexpected \u201clewk\u201d) and he will, of course, be <em>trending</em> by the time you read this.</p> <p>Indeed, he wants to \u201cgo viral\u201d, but ultimately with a message. The power of a red-carpet \u201cmoment\u201d can have more cultural legacy than the film the actor is promoting and can stay in the public\u2019s mind for a long time after (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/20/high-octane-glitz-for-versace-as-j-lo-brings-the-house-down\" title=\"\">Jennifer Lopez</a>\u2019 safari Versace dress comes to mind here). And for many that was Billy Porter\u2019s appearance at the 2019 Oscars dressed in a voluminous tuxedo dress. A political, social message wrapped in a red carpet outfit, it was men\u2019s fashion\u2019s big coming out moment. A statement of intent that was impossible to deny. It was the male equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cher-1988-oscar-dress-photo_n_3061075?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF9Vi1qcSiNDl2edUUqIGjamwyRo53xhwUvaqC4u2uCb9to6JFpYnJiYUjeq2Xi1TgBRGsjEy9_GtigmSwia8IDTwZAIYhao0iYpY8srcddKtVSEMpdHLv5A3MG3izRddhirw5LI7JdYviWrvtcmAI_QmZ422oStNiZ_lAc6rM3J\" title=\"\">Cher</a> in a glittering Bob Mackie reveal at the 1988 Oscars, 30 years earlier. \u201cIt was the arrival of gender-blurring fashion on the red carpet in this really massive, explosive, very mainstream way,\u201d said <em>Washington Post</em>\u2019s Robin Givhan. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look like a man who\u2019d earned a seat at that table. He was the table,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what would happen, but we knew it was a conversation we needed to have,\u201d says Porter\u2019s stylist Sam Ratelle. \u201cFashion tells the tale of our times, and for Billy, wearing a big ballgown in that space, as a theatre person, as an LGBT person, as a black person, was important.\u201d</p> <p>For Ratelle the red carpet is like a stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a theatre, it\u2019s about having fun,\u201d he says. \u201cClothes are costumes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8aab843d9e6c52fe21c3c7ed433e5b476bcc941\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8aab843d9e6c52fe21c3c7ed433e5b476bcc941/0_0_4250_6000/708.jpg\" alt=\"Suited and booted: Darren Criss at the 2019 Met Gala.\" width=\"708\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suited and booted: Darren Criss at the 2019 Met Gala.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s deeper than that. \u201cPeople have contacted me to say, \u2018because of you, I wore a ballgown to my prom\u2019, or \u2018because of you I feel comfortable wearing nails or makeup.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ezra Miller is another actor who has utterly invigorated the red carpet. He wore a \u201cbizarre padded gown\u201d (the <em>Sun</em>) to the US premiere of <em>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald </em>(actually a piece by Moncler x Pierpaolo Piccioli) and black lipstick. At the London premiere he wore a piece of feather-filled Givenchy couture that resembled a big white bird, and he cosplayed Toadette from Mario Kart at <a href=\"https://ew.com/comic-con/2018/07/21/ezra-miller-cosplay-toadette-fantastic-beasts-comic-con-panel/\" title=\"\">Comic</a><a href=\"https://ew.com/comic-con/2018/07/21/ezra-miller-cosplay-toadette-fantastic-beasts-comic-con-panel/\" title=\"\">-Con</a>. Because\u2026 why not? \u201cHe basically sees the fashion industry at large as his dressing up box,\u201d says Teo van den Broeke, <em>GQ</em>\u2019s style and grooming director. \u201cHe\u2019s an extraordinary example of a reconstructed man with no concern (and every concern) about the way he is perceived by the wider world. I wish I was brave enough to dress the way he does.\u201d (Guy Lodge adds a note of caution here: \u201cIt might still limit his casting prospects a bit if he\u2019s just seen as a beautiful fashion freak,\u201d he says).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7379af19094ef5a0a834edd097b67497afd3b765\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7379af19094ef5a0a834edd097b67497afd3b765/71_113_1899_2887/658.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There was a time where I\u2019d never ever be able to be myself like this\u2019: Sam Smith.\" width=\"658\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There was a time where I\u2019d never ever be able to be myself like this\u2019: Sam Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Bragado/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miller, Porter, Chalamet and their like have opened the door.

Mitch Grassi, while we don\u2019t see him on a red carpet as much, shows up and shows out as well, especially in Balenciaga.\u201d</p> <p>Most tellingly one of his picks is dissolving the gender boundaries completely. \u201cI have to say <a href=\"https://fashionsizzle.com/2019/11/14/rickey-thompson-in-givenchy-2019-peoples-choice-awards/\" title=\"\">Rickey Thompson </a>in a Givenchy Fall 2019 look at the People\u2019s Choice Awards was truly the best thing I\u2019ve seen on a man in a while,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the best part?

More recently, Smith made the link between clothing and perception. \u201cI felt like I was playing this \u2018Sam Smith\u2019 character that I created. I was depressed because I was this person in suits who other people wanted me to be,\u201d they told Out magazine. \u201cI can wear a suit now, actually, and can feel completely different in the suit, but at the time I felt, I\u2019ve got to be butch for other people.\u201d Kocharian thinks that a fluidity around the gender conversation has had a knock-on effect on the celebrity world. \u201cThere is a more evolved view of masculinity in the past few years where men are able to embrace their femininity, too,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is to be celebrated, not suppressed, which in turn has lead to much more creativity and diversity in what we\u2019re seeing on the red carpet.\u201d Ashley Weston, the stylist who put Chadwick Boseman in a harness, told GQ: \u201cWe\u2019re getting into the period of time where no one\u2019s [thinking], \u2018OK, is this too feminine? Do we need it more masculine?\u2019\u201d Male actors, she said, aren\u2019t thinking: \u201c\u2018I still need to look like this because I\u2019m a leading man.\u2019 That\u2019s out of the question now. It\u2019s almost like everyone is looking at things with more neutral goggles.\u201d Film critic Guy Lodge believes that now actors use their style as something that can supplement their brand. \u201cMale actors dress in ways that support and complement their screen personae,\u201d he says. \u201cChadwick Boseman has crafted a kind of Afro-futurist red-carpet look befitting of Black Panther. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet makes offbeat choices that stress his youth and artsiness. Donald Glover has a whole soul-dandy thing going on, and so on. Red-carpet wear has become more of a personality outlet for performers than it used to be.\u201d It has coincided with a time when designers such as Gucci\u2019s Alessandro Michele are upending traditional notions of masculine dress. By garnishing A$AP Rocky with a Dot Cotton-esque headscarf, Bad Bunny in a florid nudie suit, or putting Jared Leto in a bejewelled gown (accessorised with a replica bust of his own head \u2013 the Met Gala), Michele has changed the conversation. It\u2019s less about binaries and more about a plurality of dressing. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to play with codes. I think that the era of being masculine only if you have a specific suit \u2013 it\u2019s over,\u201d he told US GQ\u2019s New Masculinity issue in October. Put simply: the Male Diva rules the red carpet roost. The MD\u2019s best friend is his stylist, he\u2019s a trend starter (that could mean wearing an up-and-coming designer, but that could also mean sporting an unexpected \u201clewk\u201d) and he will, of course, be trending by the time you read this. Indeed, he wants to \u201cgo viral\u201d, but ultimately with a message. The power of a red-carpet \u201cmoment\u201d can have more cultural legacy than the film the actor is promoting and can stay in the public\u2019s mind for a long time after (Jennifer Lopez\u2019 safari Versace dress comes to mind here). And for many that was Billy Porter\u2019s appearance at the 2019 Oscars dressed in a voluminous tuxedo dress. A political, social message wrapped in a red carpet outfit, it was men\u2019s fashion\u2019s big coming out moment. A statement of intent that was impossible to deny. It was the male equivalent of Cher in a glittering Bob Mackie reveal at the 1988 Oscars, 30 years earlier. \u201cIt was the arrival of gender-blurring fashion on the red carpet in this really massive, explosive, very mainstream way,\u201d said Washington Post\u2019s Robin Givhan. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look like a man who\u2019d earned a seat at that table. He was the table,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what would happen, but we knew it was a conversation we needed to have,\u201d says Porter\u2019s stylist Sam Ratelle. \u201cFashion tells the tale of our times, and for Billy, wearing a big ballgown in that space, as a theatre person, as an LGBT person, as a black person, was important.\u201d For Ratelle the red carpet is like a stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a theatre, it\u2019s about having fun,\u201d he says. \u201cClothes are costumes.\u201d But it\u2019s deeper than that. \u201cPeople have contacted me to say, \u2018because of you, I wore a ballgown to my prom\u2019, or \u2018because of you I feel comfortable wearing nails or makeup.\u2019\u201d Ezra Miller is another actor who has utterly invigorated the red carpet. He wore a \u201cbizarre padded gown\u201d (the Sun) to the US premiere of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (actually a piece by Moncler x Pierpaolo Piccioli) and black lipstick. At the London premiere he wore a piece of feather-filled Givenchy couture that resembled a big white bird, and he cosplayed Toadette from Mario Kart at Comic-Con. Because\u2026 why not? \u201cHe basically sees the fashion industry at large as his dressing up box,\u201d says Teo van den Broeke, GQ\u2019s style and grooming director. \u201cHe\u2019s an extraordinary example of a reconstructed man with no concern (and every concern) about the way he is perceived by the wider world. I wish I was brave enough to dress the way he does.\u201d (Guy Lodge adds a note of caution here: \u201cIt might still limit his casting prospects a bit if he\u2019s just seen as a beautiful fashion freak,\u201d he says). Miller, Porter, Chalamet and their like have opened the door. But what\u2019s the next step? Fashion vlogger Luke Meagher, aka Haute Le Mode, name checks a host of millennial stars who push the envelope with the ease of a generation not burdened by gender preconceptions. When asked who is stepping up, he says: \u201cLil Nas X definitely, I mean that Prince dedication look by Christian Cowan was superb. Cody Fern has also caught my attention whenever he steps on to a carpet. Mitch Grassi, while we don\u2019t see him on a red carpet as much, shows up and shows out as well, especially in Balenciaga.\u201d Most tellingly one of his picks is dissolving the gender boundaries completely. \u201cI have to say Rickey Thompson in a Givenchy Fall 2019 look at the People\u2019s Choice Awards was truly the best thing I\u2019ve seen on a man in a while,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the best part? That it was a women\u2019s look.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 February 2020 to change the pronouns which refer to Sam Smith to \u201cthey\u201d rather than \u201che\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Independent bookstores across the US have found themselves in the crosshairs of the unabating controversy over American Dirt, with some booksellers debating how they should promote the novel, and redistribute the profits. Jeanine Cummins\u2019 third novel drew swift criticism following its 21 January release for its stereotypical depictions of Mexicans and inaccurate representation of undocumented immigrants in America. The large advance Cummins received raised questions about who gets to profit from telling the story of the border crisis. Following the backlash, several US bookstores canceled appearances with the author. Among them was Left Bank Books, a local bookstore in St Louis, Missouri. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to create a big mess,\u2019 Kris Kleindienst, the owner of Left Bank, told the Guardian. However, Kleindienst didn\u2019t want to give Cummins a spotlight without including authentic Latinx voices at the 25 January event. There also were legitimate safety concerns, Kleindienst said. Amid the controversy, Cummins received threats. People left aggressive comments on the Facebook page of the event. (Days after Left Bank canceled its event, American Dirt\u2019s publisher Flatiron Books canceled the rest of Cummins\u2019 book tour, citing safety concerns). Kleindienst said the outrage surrounding American Dirt is much larger than other controversial books the store has promoted. \u201cThis is unprecedented. It\u2019s ripped open a festering sore in this country and made us finally have a conversation about what\u2019s going on at the border,\u201d Kleindienst said. The San Francisco bookstore City Lights confirmed it was not selling American Dirt, but declined to comment further on its decision. Green Apple Books, a local bookstore chain in San Francisco, employed a different tactic, displaying works by Latinx authors next to American Dirt. \u201cThat\u2019s how we usually prefer to deal with a situation like this,\u201d said Kevin Ryan, the co-owner of Green Apple. Would his store consider not selling American Dirt? \u201cDeciding not to sell something is a big decision. One we don\u2019t take lightly.\u201d Linda Sherman-Nurick, the owner of bookstore Cellar Door, in Riverside, California, opted to donate 20% of the store\u2019s profits from American Dirt to Raices, a not-for-profit organization providing legal aid to immigrants. \u201cWe should be making sure the right people are getting something from this book,\u201d Sherman-Nurick told the Guardian. \u201cOur store should not be profiting from this whole controversy.\u201d Kleindienst, the Left Bank Books owner, said many booksellers feel Flatiron Books should have done more to prepare bookstores for the attention and scrutiny American Dirt events were poised to receive.

It wasn\u2019t sand, samba and rainforests I was after, but clean modernist lines and reinforced concrete laid out on the Cerrado (the country\u2019s vast tropical savannah).</p> \n<p>I was first smitten by the great modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer, who died eight years ago at the age of 104, when I saw pictures of his Niter\u00f3i Contemporary Art Museum in Rio de Janeiro, completed in 1996. With its red snaking access walkway and saucer-shaped gallery, it looks like something out of a 1960s sci-fi film. Niemeyer was a sort of Brazilian Le Corbusier (with whom he worked) and the more pictures I saw of his exotic modernism and the more I read about his socialist utopian vision, the more I wanted to see them. No one else has quite matched his free-flowing designs, their sculptural quality, the way they seem to float free of the ground. Niemeyer was all about the \u201csensual curve\u201d, inspired as much by Brazil\u2019s landscape as the female form. \u201cRight angles don\u2019t attract me. Nor straight, hard and inflexible lines created by man,\u201d he once wrote.</p> \n<p>While I was in Rio, I met Niemeyer\u2019s great-grandson. Paulo Niemeyer is an architect and designer himself and president of the Niemeyer Institute, and he showed me around the stunning two-storey Casa das Canoas, the concrete-and-glass family home that Niemeyer designed in 1951, on a hillside in the southwest of the city surrounded by the Tijuca rainforest (the building is now closed for renovation). Paulo hoiked me up on to the sinuous white slab roof to show me how as a child he used to jump into the pool, careful to avoid the large granite rock that the house is built around.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a8b2bb4ec6ee160c59350b00d585391bdf4707e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a8b2bb4ec6ee160c59350b00d585391bdf4707e/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reflected glory: Brasil\u00eda\u2019s Itamaraty palace, designed by Oscar Niemeyer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reflected glory: Brasil\u00eda\u2019s Itamaraty palace, designed by Oscar Niemeyer.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is a good year to visit Niemeyer\u2019s work since it marks the 60th anniversary of the inauguration of Bras\u00edlia, the gleaming new capital of Brazil masterplanned by L\u00facio Costa and designed by Niemeyer, built from scratch in barely four years and completed in 1960.

The city is divided into zones \u2013 residential, governmental, hotels and so on.

In the T\u00e9rreo restaurant, I enjoyed sumptuous scallops with black rice, asparagus and crayfish bisque and afterwards I went to see a jazz show that brought together the choro and frevo, the music of Bras\u00edlia and Recife, at the music venue Clube de Choro \u2013 yet another Niemeyer design \u2013 where 600ml bottles of Colorado Indica kept coming to our table in a bucket of ice while we watched the uplifting, high-tempo Face Musical Quarteto with the great frevo conductor, the saxophonist Spok.</p> \n<p>The next day, L\u00facio took me around superblock 308, one of the neighbourhood units, to explore some of Niemeyer\u2019s residential designs. Each is self-contained, with four six-storey apartment blocks, planted walkways, commercial streets, schools, social club, health centre and library \u2013 not unlike the Barbican in its vision. It\u2019s here that you get a good idea of how Bras\u00edlia is as a liveable city. These superblocks have a pleasant neighbourhood rather than big city feel to them.

The economy of its structure, which has 16 parabolic columns rising as if to form a pair of hands or a crown of thorns, is simply breathtaking. The massive triangular coloured stained glass windows appear ethereal within its embrace. Then there\u2019s the nearby National Congress building with its H-shaped towers and cupola and dome, all adding to Norman Foster\u2019s assessment that, \u201cBras\u00edlia is not simply designed, it is choreographed\u201d.</p> \n<p>At Niemeyer\u2019s Itamaraty palace on the Monumental Axis, Paulo expounded on Niemeyer\u2019s elegant detailing \u2013 the foyer\u2019s magnificent spiral staircase without balustrade, the chamfered edge of the overhanging mezzanine, the tall arched tapering columns.</p> \n<p>To top everything off I stayed at Niemeyer\u2019s majestic Palace Hotel, right next to his Alvorada Palace where the president stays. Paulo told me that Oscar stayed here for the final time on his 100th birthday, stubbornly insisting on walking to his favourite room \u2013 a bit of a schlep down its long corridors. My single room was small and minimalist with 1960s modernist furniture and a balcony overlooking Lake Parano\u00e1, which is used for watersports.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8022a363b47f539a08653adf4310a6fd8973ff02\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8022a363b47f539a08653adf4310a6fd8973ff02/0_6_6753_4052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"See the light: the main altar and glass roof of the Cathedral of Bras\u00edlia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">See the light: the main altar and glass roof of the Cathedral of Bras\u00edlia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the breakfast buffet I loved the tiny little pastries and <em>p\u00e3o franc\u00eas</em> (French rolls) to go with my <em>pingado</em> (coffee) and pineapple juice with mint, while watching the ostrich-like rhea birds walking around by the pool. At night, the hotel\u2019s pillars dissolve and the building seems to levitate.</p> \n<p>The criticism has been that Bras\u00edlia is a city built not for pedestrians but cars, however I found it very walkable if you have enough time there and combine it with buses and taxis. The city doesn\u2019t disappoint \u2013 and not just in terms of its architecture. There are museums (the <a href=\"https://www.bb.com.br/pbb/pagina-inicial/sobre-nos/cultura/ccbb#/\" title=\"\">Banco do Brasil</a> cultural centre is great), art galleries and parks (the botanical garden is a lovely picnic spot with its <em>orquid\u00e1rio</em> and Japanese garden) as well as lively and interesting places to eat and drink.

My single room was small and minimalist with 1960s modernist furniture and a balcony overlooking Lake Parano\u00e1, which is used for watersports. At the breakfast buffet I loved the tiny little pastries and p\u00e3o franc\u00eas (French rolls) to go with my pingado (coffee) and pineapple juice with mint, while watching the ostrich-like rhea birds walking around by the pool. At night, the hotel\u2019s pillars dissolve and the building seems to levitate. The criticism has been that Bras\u00edlia is a city built not for pedestrians but cars, however I found it very walkable if you have enough time there and combine it with buses and taxis. The city doesn\u2019t disappoint \u2013 and not just in terms of its architecture. There are museums (the Banco do Brasil cultural centre is great), art galleries and parks (the botanical garden is a lovely picnic spot with its orquid\u00e1rio and Japanese garden) as well as lively and interesting places to eat and drink. Concrete jungle? Give me the concrete savannah any day. Way to go The trip was organised by visitbrasil.com. The writer stayed at the Santa Teresa hotel Mgallery (all.accor.com) and Mama Shelter (mamashelter.com) in Rio and the Palace Hotel in Bras\u00edlia (plazabrasilia.com.br).

The foreign secretary said the government was doing everything in its power to help Britons who wished to leave but that the process posed serious challenges. \u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to make sure that those that still want to leave, give them the opportunity to do so,\u201d he said on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show. \u201cThe challenge that we\u2019ve got, and the Chinese have got frankly, is to contain the virus but also then to lift out people that want to come back home and we\u2019re doing that as sensitively and as effectively as we can.\u201d The second group of evacuees - made up of British nationals and family members - boarded a French flight and will also be brought to Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral where they will spend 14 days in quarantine, Raab said. Mr Raab had said 11 British nationals would be returning but the Foreign Office later confirmed the group includes a mix of British nationals and some of their relatives. He said the Government is doing all it can to help Britons in Wuhan leave if they want to. Raab\u2019s comments came as the Philippines reported the first death from coronavirus outside China, where 304 have died since it was first detected, and the first people to be tested positive for the virus in the UK continue to be treated at a special unit at a hospital in Newcastle. The Department of Health on Sunday confirmed 266 tests have been carried out in the UK for coronavirus and that 264 have been confirmed negative. The UK government had been expecting that 200 people would be on Friday\u2019s chartered flight, but when it left Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, only 83 Britons were onboard. Earlier, on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Raab said those flown back would join the other 83 evacuees in quarantine conditions in Arrowe Park, on the Wirral in north-west England.

Chris Hill, 38, said he had refused to board the flight back to the UK because because the Foreign Office could not confirm whether his four-year-old daughter, a Chinese national, would be allowed to join him.

The University of York set up a call centre on Saturday after confirming one of the first two confirmed UK cases of the virus was a student. In a statement on Sunday, University of York vice-chancellor Professor Charlie Jeffery and representatives from the Chinese Students and Scholars Association said the student did not attend a university Chinese New Year celebration or recent graduation ceremonies. They said as soon as the student\u2019s relative showed symptoms, they contacted emergency services and were both taken to the specialist medical facility in Newcastle, where they were diagnosed with the virus. A spokesman said the university remains open as usual and stressed that it will continue to monitor the situation. He added: \u201cWe reiterate Public Health England\u2019s assurance that the risk level to our staff and students remains low.\u201d",

Environmental urgency is here, but in this play natural resources are waning not waxing: these leaves look too lively.</p> <p>McPherson\u2019s modern version is light on the tongue without being over-delicate, and has astute touches: in this household of diminishing possibilities, characters continually echo each other, as if drawing on a continually depleting stock of words. I am, though, unconvinced by the decision to turn solo musings into direct addresses to the audience: this is to make these characters too purposeful, too frank.</p> <p>Crumpled with disillusion, Toby Jones is a very fine Vanya: he does something truly Chekhovian in making the difference between comic and sad look like a trick of the light, and as a quizzical crosspatch is unusual in making his character\u2019s foray into farcical violence look convincing. Rosalind Eleazar, who breathed fresh air into Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/02/king-hedley-ii-review-rutherford-and-son-the-starry-messenger\" title=\"\">The Starry Messenger</a></em> last year, is outstanding as Yelena, the woman who drives everyone mad with desire. Poised but palpitating, she gets the balance just right between calculation and indifferent wafting.

Aimee Lou Wood brittles her way through the part of Sonya; Richard Armitage purrs along in neutral as Astrov. They do, though, generate a moment that produced a gasp of anguish on press night.

Some signatories are worried about the impact the lights are having on wildlife, particularly insects: one woman claims she can hear birds still singing in her garden at 9pm. Others complain the lights are keeping them awake. The Premier League club has defended its methods of keeping the turf in a standard condition, saying it is safer for footballers to play on, but Geliot replied that it should look for alternative ways to maintain the grass. \u201cI really wish Brighton well and recognise that the club does great things for the wider community but surely they can find an alternative? There must be an artificial lighting system where the beams don\u2019t reflect up but are focused down on the pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cAt present, this giant splurge of light everywhere must be damaging to wildlife, especially birds and insects, as well as keeping some folk up at night who can\u2019t sleep.\u201d The 59-year-old photographer, videographer and sculptor said he has taken shots of the orange glow from as far away as the Long Man of Wilmington, the ancient hill figure drawn on the South Downs, which is 11 miles from the stadium. \u201cThe light pollution is blocking out some of the stars as well, disturbing sleep and causing damage to the ecosystem,\u201d Geliot said. \u201cThe club should be helped to find an alternative lighting system that avoids all this.\u201d A spokesperson for the club said: \u201cWith millions of pounds\u2019 worth of athletic and football talent on display each home matchday, we must not only meet and maintain league regulations for the quality of our playing surface, but we also have a duty of care to our players and those of visiting teams. \u201cIn the winter months, while we may at times experienced high rainfall and high winds, with little or no natural sunlight, a grass pitch misses a key element of its natural ability to regenerate and grow after use. We must therefore replicate that loss of light artificially. \u201cWe take our responsibilities for the environment very seriously, but like airlines, car manufacturers, supermarkets, consumer goods factories, and other businesses we all use every day, it is impossible for us to eliminate our environmental footprint altogether.\u201d Jeff Travis, a spokesman for the South Downs national park, said it did not have any powers to force the club to dim or turn off the lights because the stadium was just outside its boundary. \u201cWe will, however, seek informal ways to work with the club to see what may be possible to reduce the effects of the lighting on the national park and its \u2018Dark Sky\u2019 designation,\u201d Travis said, ahead of the park\u2019s Dark Skies festival, which starts on Friday. Some critics of the petition have claimed fans of Brighton\u2019s greatest rivals, Crystal Palace, are signing up so they can cause reputational damage to the club, but Geliot said: \u201cWe have had only two Palace fans make a few rum remarks after signing the petition, but I\u2019ve filtered them out. \u201cThis is all about Brighton people only \u2013 including loyal fans \u2013 who want the club to do something about this problem.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ant and Dec had barely hosed the protective goose fat off David Walliams\u2019s semi-aquatic body at the National Television Awards on Tuesday, before the furious Twittersphere exploded as Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys beat both The Flea Bag and Ricky Gervais\u2019s Afterlife for Best Comedy. Furious alt right incels, whose loyalty Gervais cultivates indiscriminately online, were outraged. The stifling cult of political correctness had ensured that an old Irish woman had beaten their truth-telling hero, dubbed The Wokefinder General by the cultural critic Sarah Vine in the Daily Mail. But the National Television Awards are voted for by the public, who, unlike the Hollywood elitists of the Golden Globes panel, have not been provided with review copies of every single show under consideration to help them make an informed choice.

This is why my own critically acclaimed work always wins accolades voted for by carefully chosen panels of informed experts in their fields \u2013 Baftas, Olivier Awards, and British Comedy Awards for example \u2013 but is largely ignored in polls voted for by the public, who are not my target audience, though I tolerate their open-mouthed bafflement at my high-concept live shows.

      "body": "<p>There were a few days in mid-December when it looked like the nation might have won some respite from its daily diet of shouty culture wars. But then, on 17 December, just days after Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory, Piers Morgan signed his new contract with <em>Good Morning Britain</em>, and the most enthusiastic cheerleader of national disharmony was granted two more lucrative years behind his breakfast desk.</p> \n<p>Morgan insisted that this would be his last term of office, and that he will \u201csail off into the sunset\u201d in 2022. His original tabloid mentor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/kelvin-mackenzie\" title=\"\">Kelvin MacKenzie</a>, argued a year ago that Morgan would not be happy until he \u201cabsolutely owns breakfast\u201d and \u201cis making \u00a310m a year\u201d. I don\u2019t imagine he is quite there yet.</p> \n<p>In the four and a half years since Morgan took up his seat \u2013 \u201cback by unpopular demand\u201d \u2013 I\u2019ve done my best to avoid watching <em>Good Morning Britain</em> because, well, obviously, who in their right mind wants to start the day with Morgan at their breakfast table? But in fact there is no escape. You don\u2019t need to be among the million viewers who tune in to <em>Good Morning Britain</em> to feel its daily presence in your life. Anyone with an eye on this country\u2019s media, whether print, social, broadcast, will have absorbed Morgan\u2019s more strident opinions \u2013 about vegan sausage rolls or Donald Trump or gender identity \u2013 by osmosis.</p> \n<p>As part of a somewhat perverse new year\u2019s resolution, for the past few weeks I have reversed my abstention, and watched <em>Good Morning Britain</em> \u2013 \u201cthe nation\u2019s most talked about show\u201d \u2013 as much as work has allowed. After the increasingly disconcerting political events of last year, I felt some need to begin the decade immersed in the nation\u2019s prevailing gobby mood; where better to start? I have come to think of this hair-shirt commitment as Morganuary.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>For Morgan, Monday mornings are critical \u2013 he can set the dogs of particular items&nbsp;running all week</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The exercise has reminded me of another story I once wrote for this paper, when, at the time the movie <em>Super Size Me</em> came out, I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/jul/11/foodanddrink.shopping%0D\" title=\"\">required to eat only fast food for a week</a>. Before and after my seven days of Big Macs and Bargain Buckets and Double Whoppers I had to undergo blood tests. The results, magnified on a hospital screen, showed an alarming rise in all sorts of fatty deposits in my veins. As I near the end of Morganuary I can\u2019t help feeling I should have taken similar before and after fMRi scans of my brain activity. I imagine neural pathways muddied with bombast, and clogged with undigested gobbets of vitriol.</p> \n<p>Morgan has, as you will know whether you like it or not, begun this decade as he finished the last, as the nation\u2019s self-appointed headline-generator in chief. His long-running obsession with Meghan Markle became, as if at his personal direction, also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/prince-harry-meghan-two-most-spoiled-brats-in-history-pundits-provoked-by-royal-rupture\" title=\"\">the nation\u2019s primary obsession</a>: having amplified the persecution of the Duchess of Sussex, Morgan then choreographed the fallout of her escape from that persecution. Along the way there has also been the usual quota of viral sidelines. Inevitably, Morgan chimed in with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2020/jan/20/id-never-heard-of-laurence-fox-until-he-started-lecturing-us-about-racism\" title=\"\">Laurence Fox</a> and his acoustic struggle to highlight the plight of white male TV celebrities, along the way explaining his definition of racism to colleagues <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhGR5XVOXo\" title=\"\">including mixed-race weatherman Alex Beresford</a> and guests in what <em>GMB</em> regulars enjoy calling \u201cdiversity corner\u201d.</p> \n<p>Counter-intuitively, one effect of social media has been a dramatic narrowing of the range of topics that capture the collective mind. Morgan with his 7 million Twitter followers is a master of the kind of circularity that online debate demands \u2013 all links lead back to him. As Roger Ailes, creator of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\" title=\"\">Fox News</a>, observed of the so-called infotainment age: \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be informed, they want to <em>seem</em> informed.\u201d Morgan is a prime mover in that principle.</p> \n<p>I should make a very obvious point, belatedly, here: that Morgan is never alone at his <em>Good Morning Britain</em> desk (though he sometimes seems to believe himself to be). He is, for a start, not there at all on Thursdays and Fridays, or over the weekend. And beside him, from Monday to Wednesday, sits the unflappably charming and sane Susanna Reid, winner of numerous awards for television valour. Reid is paid more than \u00a31m a year; leaving aside the manifest absurdity of that wage, there can hardly be a regular viewer of <em>Good Morning Britain</em> who does not entertain the idea that she earns every penny.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF-sXmzkfwY\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gF-sXmzkfwY?start=271&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=271\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF-sXmzkfwY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=271\">Watch Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid interview Thomas Markle.</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The industry cliche has it that news anchors are finally hired on the basis of how convincing they appear with the sound off. Reid has taken that principle to a whole new level. Though she is an incisive interviewer \u2013 witness her brilliant evisceration of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicky-morgan\" title=\"\">Nicky Morgan</a> talking nonsense about nurses before the election \u2013 much of her best work is nonverbal. There are YouTube compilation videos of Reid\u2019s grimaces and eye rolls during Morgan\u2019s never-ending monologues. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVExq6zHOXA\" title=\"\">Susanna Reid dies a little</a> inside every time Piers Morgan opens his mouth\u2026\u201d has nearly 800,000 views.</p> \n<p>The more you watch the pair at work, you can\u2019t help but feel Morgan and Reid, for better and worse, dramatise precisely, depressingly, the public mood, in which those who talk loudest feel empowered to drown out those you might want to hear. Much of the time Morgan and Reid are engaged in inane banter about ratings or Gwyneth Paltrow, but arguably no television double act has better reflected a fracturing national psyche since <em>Steptoe and Son</em>. Just as Albert Steptoe never gave Harold\u2019s dreams of a more civilised life a moment\u2019s thought, so Morgan blunders over Reid\u2019s every effort at compromise or nuance.</p> \n<p>Reid worked for 20 years at the BBC and once reflected that she had the corporation running through her \u201clike the words on a stick of rock\u201d. Her role on the show represents the collective memory of a more civilised, easygoing national sofa, before the arrival of her co-host and his confrontational desk, before trolling, before Brexit. Talking recently to the <em>Radio Times</em>, Reid noted, along with the rest of the nation, how \u201c[Piers] has pushed me to get more opinionated. I don\u2019t agree he should be left to chew these people up and spit them out like one of his rare steaks. Piers too needs to be held to account for what he says.\u201d</p> \n<p>The latter is obviously easier said than done. Take last Monday. Even in the short time I have been watching I have noticed that some mornings matter to Morgan much more than others. Mondays are particularly critical because he can set the dogs of particular items running all week. The three stories that he has decided are dominating that morning\u2019s agenda are all out of his own back pocket, or at least he makes them seem so.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVExq6zHOXA\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fVExq6zHOXA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVExq6zHOXA\">Watch a compilation of Susanna Reid\u2019s on-screen reactions.</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>First, there is the tragic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/kobe-bryant-obituary\" title=\"\">death of Kobe Bryant</a>, which for Morgan inevitably becomes an occasion for personal reminiscence of his time watching basketball in Los Angeles when he was hosting his talk show for CNN. Second, there is the latest chapter in the ongoing Meghan Markle story, a trail for another exclusive interview with Markle\u2019s estranged father, Thomas. And finally there is the kind of \u201cstory\u201d Morgan gets up for. This is generated by a stray comment that Hugh Grant has made in promoting his latest movie, suggesting that the December election result was \u201ca catastrophe\u201d and, because of Brexit, Britain \u201cis finished\u201d.</p> \n<p>In one of his many reflections on his decade editing the <em>News of the World</em> and the <em>Mirror</em>, Morgan once observed that \u201con newspapers every day is a feud. All editors need one to get by.\u201d Morgan always needed several. Most days he rips into his current nemeses \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-lineker\" title=\"\">Gary Lineker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alastaircampbell\" title=\"\">Alastair Campbell</a>, feminists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex\" title=\"\">Meghan Markle</a>, assorted \u201csnowflakes\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewadonis\" title=\"\">Lord Adonis</a> \u2013 but the feud with Grant seems more primal.</p> \n<p>As he gets into his stride about how much he despises Grant \u2013 one of Morgan\u2019s gifts to the nation has been to normalise the idea that it is natural for presenters to own up to \u201cloathing\u201d and \u201chating the guts\u201d of particular public figures \u2013 you are reminded that one of the moments in his career of which Morgan is most proud was the day he ran out of his office \u201cpunching the air delightedly and shrieking an order: \u2018Get the hooker!\u2019\u201d This after Grant had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/from-the-archive-blog/2015/jun/26/hugh-grant-arrest-prostitute-divine-brown-20-1995\" title=\"\">arrested with a prostitute</a> on Sunset Boulevard.</p> \n<p>The drama of finding and buying off Divine Brown for the <em>News of the World</em> is presented in Morgan\u2019s memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/06/biography.society\" title=\"\">The Insider</a></em>, as if he had taken possession of the Pentagon papers. Grant had the temerity not to be overly chuffed about that treatment in the <em>News of the World</em>, or about the fact that his phone was subsequently hacked by other journalists. Grant is many of the things that Morgan can\u2019t abide: he went to private school and to Oxford (Morgan, who grew up with his mother and stepfather at a village pub in Sussex, was educated privately until he was 13, then went to the local comp after his family fell on harder times).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I'm far enough into Morganuary that it seems that the reporting of no world event is complete without input from Morgan</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Using all this stored animus, Morgan revs himself up at 6.40 to a quite alarming pitch about the romcom actor\u2019s lack of patriotism while Reid winces silently beside him. Inevitably, an immediate poll is called for by Morgan (it is an overlooked fact that the national either/or of Brexit was primed by countless such online barometers of staged anger). \u201cDo you agree with Hugh Grant that Britain is finished?\u201d</p> \n<p>It is then that <em>Good Morning Britain</em>\u2019s hold on the national conversation kicks in. As you watch Morgan and Reid argue about Grant, you can also watch Morgan\u2019s mansplaining immediately amplified in real time. Some of this comes from online reaction \u2013 unchecked outrage about Grant\u2019s throwaway line is by now trending on Twitter \u2013 some comes from online newspaper journalists, who appear to watch <em>Good Morning Britain</em> in the way that their predecessors used to watch the tickertape of newswires.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOagvfIpD38\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YOagvfIpD38?start=27&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=27\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOagvfIpD38&amp;t=27s\">Watch the debate on Hugh Grant\u2019s Brexit comments on Good Morning Britain.</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hardly has Morgan half-uttered the words \u201cShut up\u201d to his co-host than an online news story in the <em>Sun </em>is breathlessly reporting the fact: \u201cPiers Morgan has admitted he pushes co-host Susanna Reid to her absolute limits when the pair host <em>Good Morning Britain</em>. This morning the pair exchanged fiery comments whilst presenting <em>GMB</em> live on air, signalling no end in sight to their stark differences in opinion,\u201d the paper announced. </p> \n<p>\u201cSusanna attempted to shut down her fellow presenter by saying: \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about Hugh Grant any more.\u2019 In this particular moment, Susanna knew how to wind up the former newspaper editor as he was almost caught saying \u2018Shut up\u2019 on camera. He let out a \u2018Shu\u2013\u2019 before quickly correcting himself\u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>By now I am far enough into Morganuary that it can seem that no reporting of a world event is complete without input from Morgan. There is a genuine weirdness in watching this unfold. Morgan writes newspaper columns for the <em>Mail </em>and the <em>Mail on Sunday</em>. There was a time when that would have meant that rival tabloid newspapers would have operated a blanket ban on coverage of him. Now, perversely, certain rival online editors appear to work on the principle that if a tree falls in a forest and Piers Morgan has not tweeted about it, has it really happened?</p> \n<p>Here, for example, is how the <em>Express</em> \u2013 ostensibly the biggest rival to the <em>Mail</em> for the hearts and minds of middle England \u2013 first reported the tragedy of the helicopter crash in which basketball legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter died: \u201cPiers Morgan pays tribute to \u2018icon\u2019 Kobe Bryant after death aged 41\u201d the <em>Express</em> headline reads. And this is how the story that follows is constructed: \u201cPIERS MORGAN took to Twitter alongside many celebrities to pay tribute to basketball legend Kobe Bryant, who has passed away at the age of 41\u2026 The <em>Good Morning Britain</em> presenter, 54, shared a photo of the basketball star in his Lakers kit and wrote in view of his 7.1 million Twitter followers: \u2018Few bigger icons in the history of world sport than Kobe Bryant.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>This habit of filtering world events through Morgan\u2019s eyes is very far from an isolated case. On Monday morning there are by my count at least a dozen clickbait stories in the papers featuring Morgan\u2019s reaction to the world. The previous week, in the <em>Express</em> alone, I had counted 16.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Does any of this matter? It used to be observed \u2013 partly because of the grounding principles of the BBC in our media \u2013 that something like Fox News, which set the tone for the extremist populism of Trump, could never gain a foothold in this country. With BBC news under siege from all sides, <em>Good Morning Britain</em>, operating in that no man\u2019s land between news and highly partisan presenter-dominated comment, goes some way to proving the opposite.</p> \n<p>Morgan\u2019s main opponent in this war is consensus. Increasingly of course, that means he casts himself as the defender of \u201ccommon sense\u201d and plain speaking in straw-man arguments about whether \u201cclapping should be replaced with \u2018jazz hands\u2019 to make it more inclusive\u201d; or in rants about plus-sized models, gender-neutral clothing or men carrying babies in papooses.</p> \n<p>\u201cCulture war\u201d seems a grandiose term for what <em>Good Morning Britain </em>does. But the effect is to add to that pervasive impression that public life is a zero sum game in which for me to win, you have to lose. Morgan jokes continuously about his rival morning show on the BBC (which brings in twice the viewers but emits a fraction of the \u201cnoise\u201d). \u201cI want to destroy them, I want to dismantle them, I want to wreck them,\u201d he says, only partly tongue in cheek.</p> \n<p>We might think of this kind of tone as an invention of cable networks and shock jocks in the United States. If you trace its history closely, however, the language of Breitbart and Fox News \u2013 that mixture of laddish mischief and bigoted cruelty \u2013 was lifted wholesale from the <em>Sun </em>and the <em>News of the World</em> in the 1970s and 80s. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/rupert-murdoch\" title=\"\">Rupert Murdoch</a> first injected it into the American bloodstream in the pages of the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/new-york-post\" title=\"\">New York Post</a></em>, and then into television through Ailes\u2019s Fox News. The lowest common denominator principle was to \u201cGive people what they want\u201d.</p> \n<p>Morgan was in many ways the wunderkind of that impulse. In 1994, Murdoch scenting an ambition he could work with, promoted 28-year-old Morgan from being editor of the <em>Sun</em>\u2019s celebrity gossip column, Bizarre, to the editorship of the planet\u2019s most read paper, the <em>News of the World</em>. He no doubt sensed that Morgan understood, at heart, that profit should always come before principle. Morgan tested that idea a couple of times, most notably in his bold anti-war stance while editor of the <em>Mirror</em> at the time of the invasion of Iraq. A crash in sales, however, saw him send a note of apology to his then boss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/slybailey\" title=\"\">Sly Bailey</a>. \u201cOne thing I won\u2019t be doing is sitting here defiantly telling myself how I\u2019m right and they are all wrong,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe readers are never wrong. Repulsive maybe, but never wrong.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2c8f09c13652bbf61520ee5fb400846d17b3b021\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c8f09c13652bbf61520ee5fb400846d17b3b021/0_404_5184_3109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morgan and Reid debate the future of the monarchy with Ken Wharfe and Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morgan and Reid debate the future of the monarchy with Ken Wharfe and Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu last month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That definitive populist wisdom is something Morgan has carried with him ever since; the sense that news was a business, or a game played with public sentiment, and one that you would be a mug not to play to win. \u201cSometimes the job does feel a bit like playing God with people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said of his time at the <em>News of the World</em>. \u201cI get, ultimately, to decide every week who lives and who dies by the <em>NoW </em>sword\u2026 The obvious glee with which my newsdesk rehearse the weekly stories of misery and mayhem created by our revelations slightly unnerves, as well as excites.\u201d</p> \n<p>That excitement has never quite left Morgan, even now he slurps his tea for the breakfast cameras. He would like you to believe that most of it is for show, these days, and that perhaps it always was.</p> \n<p>In interviews, he says: \u201cMy persona in public is a slight pantomime villain. I constantly fuel this because it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s entertaining, it\u2019s provocative, it gets everybody going, it encourages debate. All the things I like.\u201d</p> \n<p>The thing he most doesn\u2019t like is the suggestion that any of that villainy might ever have been for real. Morgan has long performed triple-salchows on the thinnest of ice around the hacking scandal that led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2011/jul/07/news-of-the-world-phone-hacking-live-coverage\" title=\"\">closure of the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2011/jul/07/news-of-the-world-phone-hacking-live-coverage\" title=\"\">News of the World</a></em>, and 14 criminal convictions. By his own admission before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/leveson-inquiry\" title=\"\">Leveson inquiry</a>, he knew about illegal voicemail hacking some years before it became a public outrage but he has always strongly denied any involvement in the practice. These denials have never been tested before a jury because his former employer, Mirror Group \u2013 now Reach plc \u2013 has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/there-is-a-reason-why-royals-demonised-but-wont-read-all-about-it-prince-harry-meghan-markle\" title=\"\">preferred to settle any claims out of court</a> \u2013 \u00a370m has been set aside to cover compensation payments and legal fees and significant sums <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/05/hugh-grant-wins-damages-from-mirror-phone-hacking-case\" title=\"\">have already been paid out</a>.</p> \n<p>Two live cases may yet require Morgan to answer more legal questions. Princess Diana\u2019s former lover, James Hewitt, is suing Mirror Group for damages arising from unlawful information gathering during Morgan\u2019s time as editor at the <em>Mirror</em>, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/04/prince-harry-begins-legal-proceedings-against-sun-and-mirror-meghan\" title=\"\">Prince Harry also has a suit pending</a> against the <em>Mirror</em> and the <em>Sun </em>on similar grounds.</p> \n<p>Morgan did not mention that latter case in the latest instalment of his headline-making interview with Thomas Markle on Monday, though he was once again pointedly critical of Meghan\u2019s recourse to the courts in her privacy battle against another of his employers, the <em>Mail on Sunday</em>. He did not feel the need to highlight any conflict of interest.</p> \n<p>When news of Hewitt\u2019s suit against the <em>Mirror </em>was tweeted by Hugh Grant, Morgan was, as ever, however, quick to respond:</p> \n<p>\u201cGreat! Always wanted to get the Major into court so we can discuss his treasonous adultery with the wife of our future king. This will be fun! Ps Just a reminder, again, \u2018Saint\u2019 Hugh \u2013 one of us has a criminal record, and it\u2019s not me.

Though by all accounts an affable and charming colleague and friend, in his professional life, even at 7am, he retains the right to a bully\u2019s instinct for taking advantage of vulnerability. That instinct, which he exploits more effectively than any other journalist in our tribal times, drives attention where he wants it: towards him. He knows how to feed that playground impulse that made you run toward a scrap when the cry of \u201cFight!\u201d went up.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday morning, Morgan was obsessing about his no-show at the National Television awards, and slagging off another of his hate figures, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-walliams\" title=\"\">David Walliams</a>. I watched Reid trying to get a word in edgeways, and felt her lucrative pain a few times when she had to give up.

      "bodyText": "There were a few days in mid-December when it looked like the nation might have won some respite from its daily diet of shouty culture wars. But then, on 17 December, just days after Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory, Piers Morgan signed his new contract with Good Morning Britain, and the most enthusiastic cheerleader of national disharmony was granted two more lucrative years behind his breakfast desk. Morgan insisted that this would be his last term of office, and that he will \u201csail off into the sunset\u201d in 2022. His original tabloid mentor, Kelvin MacKenzie, argued a year ago that Morgan would not be happy until he \u201cabsolutely owns breakfast\u201d and \u201cis making \u00a310m a year\u201d. I don\u2019t imagine he is quite there yet. In the four and a half years since Morgan took up his seat \u2013 \u201cback by unpopular demand\u201d \u2013 I\u2019ve done my best to avoid watching Good Morning Britain because, well, obviously, who in their right mind wants to start the day with Morgan at their breakfast table? But in fact there is no escape. You don\u2019t need to be among the million viewers who tune in to Good Morning Britain to feel its daily presence in your life. Anyone with an eye on this country\u2019s media, whether print, social, broadcast, will have absorbed Morgan\u2019s more strident opinions \u2013 about vegan sausage rolls or Donald Trump or gender identity \u2013 by osmosis. As part of a somewhat perverse new year\u2019s resolution, for the past few weeks I have reversed my abstention, and watched Good Morning Britain \u2013 \u201cthe nation\u2019s most talked about show\u201d \u2013 as much as work has allowed. After the increasingly disconcerting political events of last year, I felt some need to begin the decade immersed in the nation\u2019s prevailing gobby mood; where better to start? I have come to think of this hair-shirt commitment as Morganuary. The exercise has reminded me of another story I once wrote for this paper, when, at the time the movie Super Size Me came out, I was required to eat only fast food for a week. Before and after my seven days of Big Macs and Bargain Buckets and Double Whoppers I had to undergo blood tests. The results, magnified on a hospital screen, showed an alarming rise in all sorts of fatty deposits in my veins. As I near the end of Morganuary I can\u2019t help feeling I should have taken similar before and after fMRi scans of my brain activity. I imagine neural pathways muddied with bombast, and clogged with undigested gobbets of vitriol. Morgan has, as you will know whether you like it or not, begun this decade as he finished the last, as the nation\u2019s self-appointed headline-generator in chief. His long-running obsession with Meghan Markle became, as if at his personal direction, also the nation\u2019s primary obsession: having amplified the persecution of the Duchess of Sussex, Morgan then choreographed the fallout of her escape from that persecution. Along the way there has also been the usual quota of viral sidelines. Inevitably, Morgan chimed in with Laurence Fox and his acoustic struggle to highlight the plight of white male TV celebrities, along the way explaining his definition of racism to colleagues including mixed-race weatherman Alex Beresford and guests in what GMB regulars enjoy calling \u201cdiversity corner\u201d. Counter-intuitively, one effect of social media has been a dramatic narrowing of the range of topics that capture the collective mind. Morgan with his 7 million Twitter followers is a master of the kind of circularity that online debate demands \u2013 all links lead back to him. As Roger Ailes, creator of Fox News, observed of the so-called infotainment age: \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be informed, they want to seem informed.\u201d Morgan is a prime mover in that principle. I should make a very obvious point, belatedly, here: that Morgan is never alone at his Good Morning Britain desk (though he sometimes seems to believe himself to be). He is, for a start, not there at all on Thursdays and Fridays, or over the weekend. And beside him, from Monday to Wednesday, sits the unflappably charming and sane Susanna Reid, winner of numerous awards for television valour. Reid is paid more than \u00a31m a year; leaving aside the manifest absurdity of that wage, there can hardly be a regular viewer of Good Morning Britain who does not entertain the idea that she earns every penny. The industry cliche has it that news anchors are finally hired on the basis of how convincing they appear with the sound off. Reid has taken that principle to a whole new level. Though she is an incisive interviewer \u2013 witness her brilliant evisceration of Nicky Morgan talking nonsense about nurses before the election \u2013 much of her best work is nonverbal. There are YouTube compilation videos of Reid\u2019s grimaces and eye rolls during Morgan\u2019s never-ending monologues. \u201cSusanna Reid dies a little inside every time Piers Morgan opens his mouth\u2026\u201d has nearly 800,000 views. The more you watch the pair at work, you can\u2019t help but feel Morgan and Reid, for better and worse, dramatise precisely, depressingly, the public mood, in which those who talk loudest feel empowered to drown out those you might want to hear. Much of the time Morgan and Reid are engaged in inane banter about ratings or Gwyneth Paltrow, but arguably no television double act has better reflected a fracturing national psyche since Steptoe and Son. Just as Albert Steptoe never gave Harold\u2019s dreams of a more civilised life a moment\u2019s thought, so Morgan blunders over Reid\u2019s every effort at compromise or nuance. Reid worked for 20 years at the BBC and once reflected that she had the corporation running through her \u201clike the words on a stick of rock\u201d. Her role on the show represents the collective memory of a more civilised, easygoing national sofa, before the arrival of her co-host and his confrontational desk, before trolling, before Brexit. Talking recently to the Radio Times, Reid noted, along with the rest of the nation, how \u201c[Piers] has pushed me to get more opinionated. I don\u2019t agree he should be left to chew these people up and spit them out like one of his rare steaks. Piers too needs to be held to account for what he says.\u201d The latter is obviously easier said than done. Take last Monday. Even in the short time I have been watching I have noticed that some mornings matter to Morgan much more than others. Mondays are particularly critical because he can set the dogs of particular items running all week. The three stories that he has decided are dominating that morning\u2019s agenda are all out of his own back pocket, or at least he makes them seem so. First, there is the tragic death of Kobe Bryant, which for Morgan inevitably becomes an occasion for personal reminiscence of his time watching basketball in Los Angeles when he was hosting his talk show for CNN. Second, there is the latest chapter in the ongoing Meghan Markle story, a trail for another exclusive interview with Markle\u2019s estranged father, Thomas. And finally there is the kind of \u201cstory\u201d Morgan gets up for. This is generated by a stray comment that Hugh Grant has made in promoting his latest movie, suggesting that the December election result was \u201ca catastrophe\u201d and, because of Brexit, Britain \u201cis finished\u201d. In one of his many reflections on his decade editing the News of the World and the Mirror, Morgan once observed that \u201con newspapers every day is a feud. All editors need one to get by.\u201d Morgan always needed several. Most days he rips into his current nemeses \u2013 Gary Lineker, Alastair Campbell, feminists, Meghan Markle, assorted \u201csnowflakes\u201d, Lord Adonis \u2013 but the feud with Grant seems more primal. As he gets into his stride about how much he despises Grant \u2013 one of Morgan\u2019s gifts to the nation has been to normalise the idea that it is natural for presenters to own up to \u201cloathing\u201d and \u201chating the guts\u201d of particular public figures \u2013 you are reminded that one of the moments in his career of which Morgan is most proud was the day he ran out of his office \u201cpunching the air delightedly and shrieking an order: \u2018Get the hooker!\u2019\u201d This after Grant had been arrested with a prostitute on Sunset Boulevard. The drama of finding and buying off Divine Brown for the News of the World is presented in Morgan\u2019s memoir, The Insider, as if he had taken possession of the Pentagon papers. Grant had the temerity not to be overly chuffed about that treatment in the News of the World, or about the fact that his phone was subsequently hacked by other journalists. Grant is many of the things that Morgan can\u2019t abide: he went to private school and to Oxford (Morgan, who grew up with his mother and stepfather at a village pub in Sussex, was educated privately until he was 13, then went to the local comp after his family fell on harder times). Using all this stored animus, Morgan revs himself up at 6.40 to a quite alarming pitch about the romcom actor\u2019s lack of patriotism while Reid winces silently beside him. Inevitably, an immediate poll is called for by Morgan (it is an overlooked fact that the national either/or of Brexit was primed by countless such online barometers of staged anger). \u201cDo you agree with Hugh Grant that Britain is finished?\u201d It is then that Good Morning Britain\u2019s hold on the national conversation kicks in. As you watch Morgan and Reid argue about Grant, you can also watch Morgan\u2019s mansplaining immediately amplified in real time. Some of this comes from online reaction \u2013 unchecked outrage about Grant\u2019s throwaway line is by now trending on Twitter \u2013 some comes from online newspaper journalists, who appear to watch Good Morning Britain in the way that their predecessors used to watch the tickertape of newswires. Hardly has Morgan half-uttered the words \u201cShut up\u201d to his co-host than an online news story in the Sun is breathlessly reporting the fact: \u201cPiers Morgan has admitted he pushes co-host Susanna Reid to her absolute limits when the pair host Good Morning Britain. This morning the pair exchanged fiery comments whilst presenting GMB live on air, signalling no end in sight to their stark differences in opinion,\u201d the paper announced. \u201cSusanna attempted to shut down her fellow presenter by saying: \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about Hugh Grant any more.\u2019 In this particular moment, Susanna knew how to wind up the former newspaper editor as he was almost caught saying \u2018Shut up\u2019 on camera. He let out a \u2018Shu\u2013\u2019 before quickly correcting himself\u2026\u201d By now I am far enough into Morganuary that it can seem that no reporting of a world event is complete without input from Morgan. There is a genuine weirdness in watching this unfold. Morgan writes newspaper columns for the Mail and the Mail on Sunday. There was a time when that would have meant that rival tabloid newspapers would have operated a blanket ban on coverage of him. Now, perversely, certain rival online editors appear to work on the principle that if a tree falls in a forest and Piers Morgan has not tweeted about it, has it really happened? Here, for example, is how the Express \u2013 ostensibly the biggest rival to the Mail for the hearts and minds of middle England \u2013 first reported the tragedy of the helicopter crash in which basketball legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter died: \u201cPiers Morgan pays tribute to \u2018icon\u2019 Kobe Bryant after death aged 41\u201d the Express headline reads. And this is how the story that follows is constructed: \u201cPIERS MORGAN took to Twitter alongside many celebrities to pay tribute to basketball legend Kobe Bryant, who has passed away at the age of 41\u2026 The Good Morning Britain presenter, 54, shared a photo of the basketball star in his Lakers kit and wrote in view of his 7.1 million Twitter followers: \u2018Few bigger icons in the history of world sport than Kobe Bryant.\u2019\u201d This habit of filtering world events through Morgan\u2019s eyes is very far from an isolated case. On Monday morning there are by my count at least a dozen clickbait stories in the papers featuring Morgan\u2019s reaction to the world. The previous week, in the Express alone, I had counted 16. * * * Does any of this matter? It used to be observed \u2013 partly because of the grounding principles of the BBC in our media \u2013 that something like Fox News, which set the tone for the extremist populism of Trump, could never gain a foothold in this country. With BBC news under siege from all sides, Good Morning Britain, operating in that no man\u2019s land between news and highly partisan presenter-dominated comment, goes some way to proving the opposite. Morgan\u2019s main opponent in this war is consensus. Increasingly of course, that means he casts himself as the defender of \u201ccommon sense\u201d and plain speaking in straw-man arguments about whether \u201cclapping should be replaced with \u2018jazz hands\u2019 to make it more inclusive\u201d; or in rants about plus-sized models, gender-neutral clothing or men carrying babies in papooses. \u201cCulture war\u201d seems a grandiose term for what Good Morning Britain does. But the effect is to add to that pervasive impression that public life is a zero sum game in which for me to win, you have to lose. Morgan jokes continuously about his rival morning show on the BBC (which brings in twice the viewers but emits a fraction of the \u201cnoise\u201d). \u201cI want to destroy them, I want to dismantle them, I want to wreck them,\u201d he says, only partly tongue in cheek. We might think of this kind of tone as an invention of cable networks and shock jocks in the United States. If you trace its history closely, however, the language of Breitbart and Fox News \u2013 that mixture of laddish mischief and bigoted cruelty \u2013 was lifted wholesale from the Sun and the News of the World in the 1970s and 80s. Rupert Murdoch first injected it into the American bloodstream in the pages of the New York Post, and then into television through Ailes\u2019s Fox News. The lowest common denominator principle was to \u201cGive people what they want\u201d. Morgan was in many ways the wunderkind of that impulse. In 1994, Murdoch scenting an ambition he could work with, promoted 28-year-old Morgan from being editor of the Sun\u2019s celebrity gossip column, Bizarre, to the editorship of the planet\u2019s most read paper, the News of the World. He no doubt sensed that Morgan understood, at heart, that profit should always come before principle. Morgan tested that idea a couple of times, most notably in his bold anti-war stance while editor of the Mirror at the time of the invasion of Iraq. A crash in sales, however, saw him send a note of apology to his then boss, Sly Bailey. \u201cOne thing I won\u2019t be doing is sitting here defiantly telling myself how I\u2019m right and they are all wrong,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe readers are never wrong. Repulsive maybe, but never wrong.\u201d That definitive populist wisdom is something Morgan has carried with him ever since; the sense that news was a business, or a game played with public sentiment, and one that you would be a mug not to play to win. \u201cSometimes the job does feel a bit like playing God with people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said of his time at the News of the World. \u201cI get, ultimately, to decide every week who lives and who dies by the NoW sword\u2026 The obvious glee with which my newsdesk rehearse the weekly stories of misery and mayhem created by our revelations slightly unnerves, as well as excites.\u201d That excitement has never quite left Morgan, even now he slurps his tea for the breakfast cameras. He would like you to believe that most of it is for show, these days, and that perhaps it always was. In interviews, he says: \u201cMy persona in public is a slight pantomime villain. I constantly fuel this because it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s entertaining, it\u2019s provocative, it gets everybody going, it encourages debate. All the things I like.\u201d The thing he most doesn\u2019t like is the suggestion that any of that villainy might ever have been for real. Morgan has long performed triple-salchows on the thinnest of ice around the hacking scandal that led to the closure of the News of the World, and 14 criminal convictions. By his own admission before the Leveson inquiry, he knew about illegal voicemail hacking some years before it became a public outrage but he has always strongly denied any involvement in the practice. These denials have never been tested before a jury because his former employer, Mirror Group \u2013 now Reach plc \u2013 has preferred to settle any claims out of court \u2013 \u00a370m has been set aside to cover compensation payments and legal fees and significant sums have already been paid out. Two live cases may yet require Morgan to answer more legal questions. Princess Diana\u2019s former lover, James Hewitt, is suing Mirror Group for damages arising from unlawful information gathering during Morgan\u2019s time as editor at the Mirror, while Prince Harry also has a suit pending against the Mirror and the Sun on similar grounds. Morgan did not mention that latter case in the latest instalment of his headline-making interview with Thomas Markle on Monday, though he was once again pointedly critical of Meghan\u2019s recourse to the courts in her privacy battle against another of his employers, the Mail on Sunday. He did not feel the need to highlight any conflict of interest. When news of Hewitt\u2019s suit against the Mirror was tweeted by Hugh Grant, Morgan was, as ever, however, quick to respond: \u201cGreat! Always wanted to get the Major into court so we can discuss his treasonous adultery with the wife of our future king. This will be fun! Ps Just a reminder, again, \u2018Saint\u2019 Hugh \u2013 one of us has a criminal record, and it\u2019s not me. So stick your moralising up your a**.\u201d Watching Morgan at breakfast over a period of time, and despite all his self-mockery, that old tabloid nastiness is never too far from the surface. Though by all accounts an affable and charming colleague and friend, in his professional life, even at 7am, he retains the right to a bully\u2019s instinct for taking advantage of vulnerability. That instinct, which he exploits more effectively than any other journalist in our tribal times, drives attention where he wants it: towards him. He knows how to feed that playground impulse that made you run toward a scrap when the cry of \u201cFight!\u201d went up. On Wednesday morning, Morgan was obsessing about his no-show at the National Television awards, and slagging off another of his hate figures, David Walliams. I watched Reid trying to get a word in edgeways, and felt her lucrative pain a few times when she had to give up. I could sense my resolve to keep my Morganuary habit going into our post-Brexit February waning. As with all new year\u2019s resolutions, a month suddenly seemed like more than enough. * * * \u2018Morganuary\u2019: a month of clashes Monday 13 Author Afua Hirsch is asked to defend her New York Times piece \u201cBlack Britons know why Meghan Markle wants out \u2013 it\u2019s the racism\u201d. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say these things are racist when they\u2019re not,\u201d Morgan froths. \u2018I\u2019m telling you that as someone who\u2019s lived the experience of being a person of African heritage in this country that there are narratives that are regularly\u2026\u201d Hirsch replies, before being cut off by her host. Tuesday 14 A discussion about \u201cHarry and Meghan\u2019s new life\u201d becomes another robust debate about whether the treatment of the couple by the UK media had been racist. Morgan says not. This prompts lawyer and activist Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu to say: \u201cYou are a man privileged to have power and influence, and you\u2019re using your power so irresponsibly to spout some personal vendetta with nasty and vile comments.\u201d Wednesday 22 Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy also ends up having to fact-check Morgan\u2019s view that race and gender were not a factor in the media\u2019s treatment of Meghan Markle. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me saying, how on earth would you know?\u201d she counters. \u201cAs someone who\u2019s never had to deal with ingrained prejudice, you\u2019re not in a position to understand people who have.\u201d He also picks a fight with GMB\u2019s mixed-race weather presenter, Alex Beresford, about, you guessed it, race and Meghan Markle. Wednesday 22 After saying he had been championing the anti-woke frontman and Question Time celebrity Laurence Fox, Morgan clashes with him over Fox\u2019s comments that the inclusion of a Sikh soldier in the film 1917 was \u201cforcing diversity on people\u201d. Morgan points out that he was \u201csort of insulting, actually, to Sikh soldiers who had served\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>The Bosphorus, the magnificent strait dividing Istanbul in two, is named after Io, a mortal lover of the god Zeus, who was cursed by his wife Hera to wander the earth in the form of a white heifer: the name comes from the Greek <em>bo\u00fbs</em>, cow, and <em>poros</em>, passage.</p> <p>Io may have been the first to cross the waterway dividing Europe from Asia, but she was certainly not the last. As the route from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, the Bosphorus offers enormous geopolitical power to whoever controls it. The city of Constantinople was founded on either side of its shores, successively the seat of the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires. Today, the Bosphorus breathes calmly and quietly beneath the hills of modern Istanbul, but its waters are still full of international intrigue.</p> <p>Alongside the thousands of passenger ferries, oil tankers and cargo boats that make this waterway one of the busiest in the world, the comings and goings of warships on the Bosphorus can predict events in volatile places as far away as Syria, Libya and Venezuela. As a result, the traffic is monitored obsessively by the channel\u2019s self-appointed guardian \u2013 a warm and funny bear of a man called Y\u00f6r\u00fck I\u015f\u0131k.</p> <p>I\u015f\u0131k, born in Istanbul, has been in love with the Bosphorus his whole life. He is one of the city\u2019s handful of passionate ship spotters who in recent years have realised that their hobby is of interest to diplomats and intelligence agencies all over the world.</p> <p>Last Saturday, I\u015f\u0131k was up before dawn in pursuit of something special. Wrapped up against the wind on the open-top deck of a ferry, he kept his hands warm in his pockets as the winter sun began to dance on the water and the boat left the wooden mansions of the middle-class neighbourhood of Emirgan behind.</p> <p>\u201cI end up doing this at all hours of the night and day when I\u2019m looking for something,\u201d the 48-year-old said. \u201cIt drives my wife mad sometimes. But it\u2019s totally worth it for the right ship.\u201d</p> <p>Equipped with a powerful zoom lens donated by the local Reuters bureau after it got a bit too battered in war zones, I\u015f\u0131k leapt up to photograph a pod of dolphins (\u201calways nice\u201d) and a passing Turkish submarine (\u201ca rare treat\u201d). But the prize, the Russian patrol ship Dmitriy Rogachev, didn\u2019t come into view around the Bosphorus\u2019s narrow bends.</p> <p>Under the terms of a 1936 international treaty, the Bosphorus is open to all civilian boats during peacetime, as well as naval ships belonging to its Black Sea neighbours. The treaty reestablished Turkish control of the strait but ensured Soviet dominance of the inland sea. Today it gives Russian ships stationed there access to the wider world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"152445b3db8a1338da8ae06028fd51f7b827e565\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/152445b3db8a1338da8ae06028fd51f7b827e565/149_35_4802_2882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Russian submarine on the Bosphorus heads towards the Black Sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Russian submarine on the Bosphorus heads towards the Black Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Y\u00f6r\u00fck I\u015f\u0131k/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was always fascinating to me to watch the Russian and Nato ships when I was growing up,\u201d I\u015f\u0131k said. \u201cTurkish media has become less and less reliable, so I decided to set up my blog as a citizen journalist.

It actually sailed to the Libyan city of Misrata, arriving on 1 January.</p> <p>The Turkish parliament didn\u2019t approve military assistance until 2 January, leading to speculation the carrier actually transported equipment from Istanbul for the Turkish military build-up before the vote took place.</p> <p>\u201cOur planet is mostly made up of water.

      "bodyText": "The Bosphorus, the magnificent strait dividing Istanbul in two, is named after Io, a mortal lover of the god Zeus, who was cursed by his wife Hera to wander the earth in the form of a white heifer: the name comes from the Greek bo\u00fbs, cow, and poros, passage. Io may have been the first to cross the waterway dividing Europe from Asia, but she was certainly not the last. As the route from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, the Bosphorus offers enormous geopolitical power to whoever controls it. The city of Constantinople was founded on either side of its shores, successively the seat of the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires. Today, the Bosphorus breathes calmly and quietly beneath the hills of modern Istanbul, but its waters are still full of international intrigue. Alongside the thousands of passenger ferries, oil tankers and cargo boats that make this waterway one of the busiest in the world, the comings and goings of warships on the Bosphorus can predict events in volatile places as far away as Syria, Libya and Venezuela. As a result, the traffic is monitored obsessively by the channel\u2019s self-appointed guardian \u2013 a warm and funny bear of a man called Y\u00f6r\u00fck I\u015f\u0131k. I\u015f\u0131k, born in Istanbul, has been in love with the Bosphorus his whole life. He is one of the city\u2019s handful of passionate ship spotters who in recent years have realised that their hobby is of interest to diplomats and intelligence agencies all over the world. Last Saturday, I\u015f\u0131k was up before dawn in pursuit of something special. Wrapped up against the wind on the open-top deck of a ferry, he kept his hands warm in his pockets as the winter sun began to dance on the water and the boat left the wooden mansions of the middle-class neighbourhood of Emirgan behind. \u201cI end up doing this at all hours of the night and day when I\u2019m looking for something,\u201d the 48-year-old said. \u201cIt drives my wife mad sometimes. But it\u2019s totally worth it for the right ship.\u201d Equipped with a powerful zoom lens donated by the local Reuters bureau after it got a bit too battered in war zones, I\u015f\u0131k leapt up to photograph a pod of dolphins (\u201calways nice\u201d) and a passing Turkish submarine (\u201ca rare treat\u201d). But the prize, the Russian patrol ship Dmitriy Rogachev, didn\u2019t come into view around the Bosphorus\u2019s narrow bends. Under the terms of a 1936 international treaty, the Bosphorus is open to all civilian boats during peacetime, as well as naval ships belonging to its Black Sea neighbours. The treaty reestablished Turkish control of the strait but ensured Soviet dominance of the inland sea. Today it gives Russian ships stationed there access to the wider world. \u201cIt was always fascinating to me to watch the Russian and Nato ships when I was growing up,\u201d I\u015f\u0131k said. \u201cTurkish media has become less and less reliable, so I decided to set up my blog as a citizen journalist. But it was only when Russia decided to intervene in the Syrian war in 2015 that people outside our nerdy little community really started paying attention. \u201cThe photographs on my blog of Russian vessels transiting the Bosphorus on their way to Syria began to paint a picture of the scale of the intervention, which as we now know ended up changing the course of the war in [Syrian president] Bashar al-Assad\u2019s favour.\u201d Warships are allowed to turn off their GPS tracking devices and commercial boats contracted by navies often give false destinations, making I\u015f\u0131k\u2019s work akin to that of an international relations detective, piecing together where ships went, for how long, and why. His most famous photo, taken in 2015, showed a Russian soldier on the top deck of a huge landing ship holding a shoulder-launched missile as he sailed through the heart of a city home to 16 million people. Ankara was furious at the provocation, which further damaged the two countries\u2019 already tense relationship after Turkey shot down a Russian jet on the Syrian border it said had violated its airspace. The elusive Dmitriy Rogachev was on I\u015f\u0131k\u2019s radar last week because a fellow ship spotter in Sevastopol had messaged to say he believed the Russian warship had left the Black Sea for the first time. Any pictures he could take would be the first proof of the ship in active service outside Russian waters, probably en route to the Syrian port of Latakia. Over the last five years, as Russia has begun to reassert itself as a major player in Middle Eastern politics, such movements hold the key to understanding where and how Moscow wants to send soldiers and equipment to project its power. Other Russian vessels, loaded with wheat and other goods, have made their way through the Bosphorus for Venezuela, where Moscow supports a government struggling with an economic crash. Watching Turkey\u2019s maritime movements, too, is becoming more and more important since Ankara\u2019s recent agreement to come to the aid of the UN-recognised government in Libya. I\u015f\u0131k and his fellow ship spotters watched with interest the arrival of the Lebanese-flagged Bana, which arrived in Istanbul\u2019s Haydarpa\u015fa port on 11 December and left again with its destination set as Beirut. It actually sailed to the Libyan city of Misrata, arriving on 1 January. The Turkish parliament didn\u2019t approve military assistance until 2 January, leading to speculation the carrier actually transported equipment from Istanbul for the Turkish military build-up before the vote took place. \u201cOur planet is mostly made up of water. It\u2019s what connects everything,\u201d said Devrim Yaylal\u0131, 49, another ship spotter. The two men are friends united by their love of the Bosphorus. \u201cWhen a ship leaves its berth for the open sea it goes over the horizon, out of sight and out of mind. Istanbul is unique because they have to come so close to the city, even if they don\u2019t stop. Ship spotting here gives you an insight into what the world looks like outside your own little part of it. It\u2019s an inherently political hobby.\u201d There isn\u2019t much in Turkey that doesn\u2019t have a political dimension. Last month President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan revived plans to in effect create a second Bosphorus \u2013 a 45km canal to be built west of the natural waterway that the government says will ease the heavy traffic on the Bosphorus and reduce the risk of accidents. First announced in 2011, the proposed Istanbul canal is the most ambitious of dozens of the president\u2019s infrastructure megaprojects that have come to define modern Turkey\u2019s economic boom and bust. The \u00a39.5bn plan was put on hold in 2018 when the Turkish lira crashed. Its reintroduction has prompted concern from environmentalists and Turkish opposition parties, which have warned costs will spiral. \u201cThe Sea of Marmara has a very delicately balanced oxygenation system and it is already struggling with the changes caused by the rapid expansion of the city of Istanbul in the last few decades,\u201d said Cemal Saydam, a professor of environmental engineering at Ankara\u2019s Hacettepe University. \u201cTo connect the two seas like this would reduce oxygen levels enough to kill all life in the Sea of Marmara. That kind of mistake cannot be undone.\u201d Neighbouring Black Sea states have been left to wonder what the proposed canal will mean for the balance of power in the region.

I\u015f\u0131k echoes the environmental concerns over the project, but at the same time can\u2019t help but wonder what new dimensions it might bring to his hobby. Around 4pm, seven hours later than expected, the powerful silhouette of the Dmitriy Rogachev finally appeared at the mouth of the Bosphorus. The grey warship dwarfed the tiny Turkish coastguard tugboat sent to accompany it, which bobbed up and down in the larger ship\u2019s wake. The Russian vessel quickly powered past the gardens of the Topkap\u0131 palace towards the open sea on its first voyage into the wider world. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d I\u015f\u0131k said. \u201cTotally worth it.\u201d",

Our measures aren\u2019t particularly stringent. When we\u2019re with him, we put our phones away and if we need to use a phone, we move to another room. Considering how simple this is, it\u2019s revealing how difficult I\u2019ve found it.</p> <p>At some point I realised I was talking about this addiction as if it is my son\u2019s, when obviously it\u2019s my own. This is heartily proven when we find our son doesn\u2019t miss them at all, whereas we feel strangely naked.</p> <p>I\u2019m not interested in broader judgment about phones and children, because they are a lifesaver in certain situations. And I\u2019m tired of the puritanical parent-blaming that goes along with tirades against modern technology. This is about me, specifically, since my phone use is so habitual as to be robotic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I click on Twitter less than three seconds after I last closed it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My work depends on a certain degree of being always-online, but this is also a cover. I cycle through the same two or three apps at Tetris speed, farming notifications as if my wellbeing depends on it. (To some extent, it does.) I click on Twitter less than three seconds after I last closed it, as if my brain has reset its endorphin count and needs an immediate re-injection of being appalled by angry people on the internet. This, without ever contemplating that I am, obviously, just one more example of that very species.</p> <p>Left to my own devices, in every sense of that term, I\u2019d continue the cycle forever, looking up the name of an actor who\u2019s face I just can\u2019t identify; the difference between frogs and toads; the exact lyrics to a song I don\u2019t like and will never remember\u2026 I find it hard to believe there is a definition of healthy internet use that includes being dead to all external stimulus as I scroll through the Wikipedia page for tarragon. I spend too much time looking up the internet and not enough time looking up from it. At the very least, I can afford to restrict myself to indulging this impulse when my son\u2019s not around.</p> <p>All parents have had the experience of diverting their attention for five seconds to discover their child moments away from impaling themselves on some nearby object. It\u2019s a ubiquitous part of parenting that predates phones, but the question is whether I\u2019ve been creating more occasion for such moments to occur. And the answer is yes. Knowing that Russian tarragon prefers poor soils and grows to be over 1m tall is simply not a good enough trade-off.</p> <p>Aside from such scares, the truth is I\u2019ve been missing out on the world in front of me, even if it\u2019s just for a minute or two at a time. I fear my son thinking I\u2019m more fascinated in that glowing screen than I am in him. So, for the time being, Twitter will have to wait.

At some point I realised I was talking about this addiction as if it is my son\u2019s, when obviously it\u2019s my own. This is heartily proven when we find our son doesn\u2019t miss them at all, whereas we feel strangely naked. I\u2019m not interested in broader judgment about phones and children, because they are a lifesaver in certain situations. And I\u2019m tired of the puritanical parent-blaming that goes along with tirades against modern technology. This is about me, specifically, since my phone use is so habitual as to be robotic. My work depends on a certain degree of being always-online, but this is also a cover. I cycle through the same two or three apps at Tetris speed, farming notifications as if my wellbeing depends on it. (To some extent, it does.) I click on Twitter less than three seconds after I last closed it, as if my brain has reset its endorphin count and needs an immediate re-injection of being appalled by angry people on the internet. This, without ever contemplating that I am, obviously, just one more example of that very species. Left to my own devices, in every sense of that term, I\u2019d continue the cycle forever, looking up the name of an actor who\u2019s face I just can\u2019t identify; the difference between frogs and toads; the exact lyrics to a song I don\u2019t like and will never remember\u2026 I find it hard to believe there is a definition of healthy internet use that includes being dead to all external stimulus as I scroll through the Wikipedia page for tarragon. I spend too much time looking up the internet and not enough time looking up from it. At the very least, I can afford to restrict myself to indulging this impulse when my son\u2019s not around. All parents have had the experience of diverting their attention for five seconds to discover their child moments away from impaling themselves on some nearby object. It\u2019s a ubiquitous part of parenting that predates phones, but the question is whether I\u2019ve been creating more occasion for such moments to occur. And the answer is yes. Knowing that Russian tarragon prefers poor soils and grows to be over 1m tall is simply not a good enough trade-off. Aside from such scares, the truth is I\u2019ve been missing out on the world in front of me, even if it\u2019s just for a minute or two at a time. I fear my son thinking I\u2019m more fascinated in that glowing screen than I am in him. So, for the time being, Twitter will have to wait. From here on out, I\u2019m looking up.

      "body": "<p>Five years ago I flew over the Connecticut hospital mortuary where thousands of feet below my husband\u2019s dead body lay. The map on the screen flashed up New Haven as we headed east over the Atlantic\u2026 leaving him behind. During the six-hour flight back to London I sat bolt upright, tearless and unable to eat, drink or even visit the loo. I felt nothing, utterly empty, numb and as close to inanimate as I imagine a person can feel.</p> <p>Andrew, at just 52, had died at 8am that morning, killed by a vicious land grabber of a cancer that had taken 14 months to overwhelm every organ in his body. This was my trauma beginning, to be followed, inevitably, by grief. We knew from the start it was bad, but I didn\u2019t somehow think he would actually die. We never discussed it. Now, this seems astounding to me. I am still perplexed by the strength of his denial. And by my complicity.</p> <p>No one survives lung cancer for very long. But we had simply never even spoken of the possibility. Stranger still \u2013 I was, and still am, a psychotherapist, used to working with people in deep grief, contemplating their own impending death or that of a loved one, recently or in the past. I remain baffled that Andrew and I did not broach the subject as we did everything else, carefully and together. But I got a lot of things wrong.</p> <p>With victims of trauma the rule is that \u201ctalking therapy\u201d or psychological help should not begin for at least two weeks. The sufferer will simply not be able to take anything in. As a psychotherapist I should have known better, but no one reminded me of this and I had forgotten most of what I knew anyway, my brain drenched with cortisol and saturated with disbelief. Yet 24 hours after the plane landed and 24 hours before his hastily arranged burial I was lying on a therapist\u2019s couch, trying to put into words what was going on in my mind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My mind was in paralysis, disabling any interest in analysis</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The trouble was my mind was in a psychic paralysis, disabling any interest in exploring my unconscious. Yet, I continued the treatment for the next two years, even though the experience almost destroyed my conviction in the importance and value of the process. What on earth was there to be curious about? The worst thing I could imagine (bar my children dying) had actually happened.</p> <p>Yet I functioned \u2013 back to work, the school run, the weekly shop. But the immense logistical crises caused by his death could not be solved by the analyst, nor by analysing them. Andrew had left a lot undone. Where we were going to live, for example. And, as I was discovering daily, widowed people cannot delegate \u201cdeathmin\u201d as a friend grimly named it. I resented terribly the analyst\u2019s silence \u2013 only an invitation to gently explore my war-torn inner world, but which felt to me like an intrusive sniper at the time, waiting to show me how useless my psychical apparatus now was.</p> <p>The analyst and I staggered on, and I would guess it was as bad for him as it was for me. All I wanted was to regain some kind of outward order, work (this I found a balm), move, organise Andrew\u2019s (and therefore my) affairs and ensure my sons\u2019 massively disrupted lives were as calm as possible. I did not want to be made to mourn what I knew perfectly well I had lost.</p> <p>Five years on I surprise myself by being unconvinced that therapy is the best remedy for grief, at least in the immediate or short term. Personally, I wish I had waited at least a year, or possibly longer \u2013 to return to psychoanalysis. And yet \u201ctalking therapy\u201d is more than just my work. I am a passionate advocate of psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. I believe that navigating the internal world, accompanied by a therapist, may be the only way for some people to deeply understand themselves. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One way of managing is to use the very human capacity of forgetting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I gave up but then did return again to psychoanalysis, and found that, three years after Andrew\u2019s death, it once again became an essential part of my life, by which I mean I could \u201cstand\u201d it and more than that, found it deeply interesting as a process. And as I went over and over (with a new analyst) how much I had loved Andrew, what an extraordinary man he was, how unfair, brutal and unkind life had been to him, I often thought I was not analysing very much.</p> <p>And yet this analyst reminded me that sharing can be as important as interpreting. He listened and listened and listened, in a way I could not expect my parents or friends to. And life began again for me. The analyst\u2019s presence washed over me, his kindness and constancy rocking me back to the soothed contented way I knew how to live. My inquiring brain became available to me again. And, finally, I began to see how in mourning, rather than grief, I could recover Andrew psychologically.</p> <p><em><strong>Recently, a patient </strong></em>came to see me for a consultation. He had been bereaved and wanted to know whether he should get some help. Grey haired and robust, he sat easily in my room, looking at my books, the picture on the wall, and finally at me. He told me his only daughter had been killed in a car crash 32 years ago, when she was 21. He and his wife had three other children and he had enjoyed a significant and successful career. He said it had been a very happy life in many ways.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We spent much of the session in silence, the man seeming to enjoy the quiet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But he was about to celebrate his 75th birthday and wondered why he had never felt overwhelmed by the pain of losing his daughter. Had he ever grieved, he wondered aloud? He had been feeling sad as this milestone approached. I asked him to tell me about his daughter and was surprised by how little he had to say about her. She had been a sweet baby, a lovely little girl, successful at school and university. We spent much of the session in silence, the man seeming to enjoy the quiet, and feeling no need to fill it.</p> <p>We met twice more and towards the end of the third session, he fell into silence again. At the end he told me our meetings had made him realise there was not much he could do. Life had dealt him a terrible blow, but he had had to get on with things and he had been good at forgetting the details of his daughter. He concluded that this had protected him from a grief he could not imagine. It is one way of coping.</p> <p>I looked at him during our sessions and felt sadness on an inordinate scale. I found myself tearful as I tried to write up my notes. Was this my counter-transference (the term used for the therapist\u2019s own feelings) provoked by the patient? Was I able to feel some sadness for him that he could not? (He wrote to me a week or so later, thanking me and telling me the sessions had been most helpful, but that he felt no need to continue. And I believed him.)</p> <p><em><strong>What do I know</strong></em> five years on, as widow and as a therapist? Only that bereavement is an idiosyncratic experience without states, process, rights or wrongs, other than for most of us, with luck, the shocked state of grief, eventually leads to mourning, which is life long but it diminishes. One way of managing is by using the very human capacity of forgetting \u2013 my patient and I discovered that in different ways.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am a Freudian \u2013 and believe that all our dreams are wish fulfilments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t remember the ordinary everydayness of Andrew any more. His smell is gone from the clothes of his that I kept, and I can\u2019t really remember the sound of his voice. I don\u2019t dream about him much and when I do I wake up restless and miserable, wishing I had not had him back for minutes in the night. But I am a Freudian \u2013 and believe that all our dreams are wish fulfilments. So there must be a part of me that does still want him back, however much I know that this is impossible.</p> <p>To recover from enormous and unexpected deaths in our lives, we must (partly) forget, in order to move on and rebuild lives that are fulfilling. We tell ourselves our loved ones would have wanted this, and the man I saw for those three consultations told me he was convinced that this was what his daughter would have wanted. Our routes were different. I have gradually got back to the life I had, with a lot of therapeutic support. I simply live it without Andrew and, of course, it is different. I am contented again, with work I thoroughly enjoy, two beloved children, parents, family and friends who I treasure. And I love someone again, which doesn\u2019t feel odd or strange or a betrayal. It just feels right. Time, the hard transformation of reality into memory, and forgetting, is all I know five years on. </p> <p><em>The State of Disbelief by Juliet Rosenfeld is published on 7 Feb</em><em>ruary by Short Books at \u00a312.99.

It\u2019s not attempting to be high art or progressive. Theatre as an art form often tries to do something excellent and reaches for the stars even when it fails, but this current crop of immersive shows have to make money.

      "bodyText": "With seven cast members, three understudies, 59 different ways to see the show unfold and more than 1,000 performances in four years, the Guild of Misrule\u2019s The Great Gatsby has established itself as the longest-running immersive play in the UK. Each night, in a converted mansion block in central London, about 200 people pack in \u2013 often in roaring 20s fancy dress and most likely tipsy \u2013 to experience a two-and-a-half-hour production that lands somewhere between a Fitzgeraldian fantasy-scape and an office party. What was still considered a left-field artistic proposition a decade ago, popularised by the likes of Punchdrunk and dreamthinkspeak, has become one of theatre\u2019s biggest commercial money-makers. Now, dozens of events across the UK are riding on the immersive gravy train. In Nottingham, punters can book into an experience called Flight that \u201cwill allow audience members to experience a plane crash\u201d. In towns across England and Wales, customers can pay \u00a355 each for a deliberately bad meal with Faulty Towers The Dining Experience. In London alone, immersive-experience hunters can choose between Jeff Wayne\u2019s The War of The Worlds, Mamma Mia! The Party, a murder mystery by way of The Invitation or hold tight for a limited run of 18 shows in May and June of Human Traffic Live: an \u201cimmersive rave theatre experience\u201d based on a 90s film about clubbing, set in a cavernous nightclub and charging \u00a3300 for the pleasure of VIP tickets. So, has the scene combusted and peaked? \u201cFor some producers, it\u2019s become a licence to print money,\u201d says Andrzej Lukowski, theatre editor for Time Out. \u201cIt\u2019s a party night and infantilised. It\u2019s not attempting to be high art or progressive. Theatre as an art form often tries to do something excellent and reaches for the stars even when it fails, but this current crop of immersive shows have to make money.

Aziz is among an estimated 500,000 people to have been trapped in temporary accommodation or unsaleable homes because of confusion over new fire safety guidelines. In December 2018, the government issued advice on the materials and maintenance of cladding on high-rise buildings to ensure that they were not combustible following the deaths of 72 people in the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, for which flammable cladding was blamed. Cladding on buildings more than 18 metres high, which may have been in line with old regulations, must now be examined to ensure it complies with new stringent guidelines.

The National House Building Council, a warranty and insurance provider, insisted on the cladding of the four towers being removed to insert fire-stopping infill, although the design and installation had previously been approved by building control. Swan says it is \u201cactively responding to rapidly changing guidance\u201d and is awaiting approval from the London Fire Brigade, which is under \u201cextreme workload pressure\u201d.

The National Housing Federation (NHF), which represents social housing providers, wants the government to coordinate the \u201cunprecedented\u201d checks and works, and to establish a building safety fund to pay for them. Last month, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced the appointment of a consultant to identify how safety works can be accelerated, and says it is considering helping freeholders with funding. The package includes clarified and updated cladding advice to freeholders and a safety regulator to oversee the design and construction of high-risk buildings. The MHCLG says that the government\u2019s \u201cupmost priority\u201d remains resident safety, and that it has made \u00a3600m available to deal with unsafe cladding and announced legislation to strengthen enforcement powers \u201cto hold building owners and managers to account\u201d. Victoria Moffett, head of building and fire safety programmes at NHF, says: \u201cThis is a huge programme of work which could take many years; in the meantime it is unacceptable that people\u2019s lives are being put on hold through no fault of their own.\u201d * Name has been changed",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://heddasternefoundation.org/about-the-artist\" title=\"\">Hedda Sterne</a> (1910-2011) is a magnificent heroine of art. She died in New York <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/14/hedda-sterne-obituary\" title=\"\">at the age of 100</a>, almost entirely blind, but still drawing \u201cbehind my eyes\u201d. In an eight-decade career, Sterne refused to cleave to any single style \u2013 no logo, as she drily remarked \u2013 unlike the abstract expressionists, with whom she was and remains too closely associated. She ran all the way from self-portraiture to cityscape, still life and collage. Her last exhibition, at 94, was a series of figurative portraits.</p> <p>But it was her appearance in a famous <em>Life</em> magazine photograph in 1951 that restricted Sterne\u2019s reputation. She stands at the back, in a hat, the lone woman among the group of New York School painters, including Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell and Willem de Kooning, who had signed a letter of protest against the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s failure to include abstraction in its shows of American art.</p> <p>Late to the shoot, and diminutive in any case, Sterne was asked to clamber up on a table. She stands out among all these men in their surprisingly conservative suits, rising like a feather in a cap. But still she was there in that moment, clinched in what would become exhibit A in any history of abstract expressionism. \u201cI am known more for that darn photo,\u201d she later remarked, \u201cthan for 80 years of work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4e0e266c571fbc94ebfacc370188678921f7d55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4e0e266c571fbc94ebfacc370188678921f7d55/0_0_4616_5568/829.jpg\" alt=\"Hedda Sterne, top, the only woman in a portrait of New York School painters, including Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, in the 15 January 1951 edition of Life magazine.\" width=\"829\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hedda Sterne, top, \u2018rising like a feather in a cap\u2019, the only woman in a portrait of New York School painters, including Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, in the 15 January 1951 edition of Life magazine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Nina Leen/Life Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so it has seemed, in this country at least; for Sterne has never had a solo exhibition in Britain. This alone would make <a href=\"https://www.victoria-miro.com/exhibitions/555/\" title=\"\">the show at Victoria Miro</a> momentous. But the gallery has chosen to present a very specific phase of her work \u2013 a few years in the early 1960s, inspired by a Fulbright fellowship to Venice, when Sterne began to paint the so-called <em>Vertical-Horizontal</em> pictures. They could hardly have made a better choice.</p> <p>Enter the gallery, and a high, portrait-shaped canvas transmits a startling glow straight at you. It is like walking into a sunset. But that\u2019s not exactly what the painting depicts. Horizontal bars of lavish paint rise in a storeyed format, one above the other. You might call them stripes, to be crude, but they are much more than that. Each is laid on the canvas in relation to the next, in a variety of overlaps, blends, nubs of merging colour of curious moments of ignition, like fireflies or sparks. The significant impression is of an electrifying green, glittering in darkness, like the northern lights.</p> <p>But up close, that exact colour is not there at all. Instead, you see a brilliantly orchestrated arrangement of yellows, black and taupes, setting off an internal light of their own. This apparently simple composition, and its ever-changing effects, approaches the sublime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2be548ba78af8d810a86dba8f54a8f45e0358fa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be548ba78af8d810a86dba8f54a8f45e0358fa9/0_0_4092_6045/677.jpg\" alt=\"Horizon #3, 1963-65 by Hedda Sterne.\" width=\"677\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Horizon #3, 1963-65 by Hedda Sterne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 The Hedda Sterne Foundation Inc, ARS, NY and DACS, London 2019 Courtesy Van Doren Waxter and Victoria Miro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But is this abstraction, let alone a variant of abstract expressionism? Sterne was adamant in her rejection of both. And none of the works in this show have anything in common with <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/barnett-newman-1699\" title=\"\">Barnett Newman</a>\u2019s stripes or <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/rothko-untitled-t04148\" title=\"\">Mark Rothko</a>\u2019s numinous oblongs. Sterne\u2019s horizontals invoke horizons every time (some of the works are explicitly titled <em>Horizon</em>). And the more these bands multiply, the greater the sense of landscapes and seascapes, of wide skies and watery reflections.</p> <p>The golden crescent near the top of one canvas suggests an actual sunset, but far away in the distance across receding flatlands or tides. <em>Vertical Horizontal #6 </em>from 1963, is a stunning field of opalescent striations, milky blue, silver and cream, with fleeting washes of grey and tan. It slows down the scene, and the weather, and the time of day to a perfect poise, the visual equivalent of a sustained harmonious chord.</p> <p>Venice was a return to Europe for Hedwig Lindenberg, who was born in Bucharest to Romanian Jews, and married a local businessman, Fritz Stern, in 1932. When the Nazis occupied the city in 1941, he changed his surname to Stafford and helped her escape to New York. The first person she called on arrival was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/26/big-picture-peggy-guggenheim-venice-stefan-moses\" title=\"\">Peggy Guggenheim</a>, who she had met in Paris in the 1930s, and who included her in several group shows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89bdebfea85e40b25527d84f00eadfcf83ed931b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89bdebfea85e40b25527d84f00eadfcf83ed931b/0_0_2208_3617/610.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled, 1966 by Hedda Sterne.\" width=\"610\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled, 1966 by Hedda Sterne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 The Hedda Sterne Foundation Inc, ARS, NY and DACS, London 2019 Courtesy Van Doren Waxter and Victoria Miro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sterne \u2013 she added the \u201ce\u201d \u2013 later married the great <em>New Yorker</em> cartoonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/dec/07/saul-steinberg-illuminations-dulwich\" title=\"\">Saul Steinberg</a>.

Ideological objections are put to one side: there is, in this reckoning, no \u201cconservative\u201d way of doing things, only an aggressive pursuit of popularity and ideology-free effectiveness.</p> <p>Thus it will be no surprise if this week the loud hints are confirmed and Johnson goes ahead with HS2 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/31/boris-johnson-hs2-keep-digging\" title=\"\">as he seemed to say on Friday</a> to 10-year-old reporter Braydon Brent on Sky\u2019s children\u2019s news show <em>FYI</em>, a happier format for the prime minister than one in which he is challenged by adults.

Morrison also read out bits of what the attorney general, Christian Porter, said in order to counter the ANAO\u2019s opinion that the grants made under the program were not only skewed towards targeted seats, they may not have been made with appropriate legal authority \u2013 which I explained on Saturday was a troubling proposition for a bunch of reasons bigger than one summer sports rorts saga, and \u201cto Bridget or not to Bridget\u201d. I wondered how the government might square this particular circle. Apparently Porter told Morrison that after having consulted the Australian Government Solicitor, the ANAO was quite wrong about the lack of legal authority question. \u201cWith respect.\u201d The end. Sorry, what, prime minister, can we see that advice? The response to that was talk to the hand. The response later from the Morrison office was no one releases that kind of advice. No one. The end. I mean seriously? This is the response? When there are big issues at stake, bigger than the dog ate my homework, or the grants were allocated on colour-coded spreadsheets tying in with a targeted seats strategy before the election, or whether someone inside the National party room will have a tantrum if they have to lose their job and someone else gets it? This is the response? When people are looking at the whole institution of government and wondering if the whole thing is entirely off the rails \u2013 the antidote to this corrosive distrust is sending McKenzie out the door with a tight smile and a light shove, and declining to be transparent about how a program can be a debacle according to the auditor general and a just flesh wound according to the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet? In what universe does that address the underlying issues? In what universe does that response satisfy voters that governance in this country is OK, and proceeding in an orderly and competent fashion, in the interests of people, whether they live in a marginal seat, or whether they don\u2019t. Morrison wants this whole mess to be over with McKenzie\u2019s departure. Quick prediction. This isn\u2019t over. Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor",

      "body": "<p>In a few days, a pair of two-year-old cheetahs, Saba and Nairo, will depart from the UK on a remarkable journey. The brothers will be taken from Howletts Wild Animal Park, in Kent, and flown to South Africa to begin a new life \u2013 in the wild.</p> <p>It will be the first time that cheetahs born in captivity have left the UK for rewilding in Africa, says Damian Aspinall, who runs Howletts. \u201cThere are only about 7,000 cheetahs left on the planet and they are listed as vulnerable,\u201d he says. \u201cThis reintroduction \u2013 to a reserve in Mount Camdeboo, in south of the country \u2013 is important because it will help to support the small population of cheetahs we have left in the wild.\u201d</p> <p>And the process of releasing animals from his wildlife parks is likely to continue unabated, adds Aspinall. He now campaigns vigorously for a sharp acceleration in the return of all captive animals to the wild and, ultimately, the closure of all zoos and wildlife parks in the UK \u2013 including his own.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no moral right as a species to let animals suffer just because we are curious about them,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The day of the zoo is over, he claims \u2013 and his views are reflected by other critics who view wildlife parks and<strong> </strong>animal<strong> </strong>collections as anachronisms that should be phased out of existence over the coming 25 years.</p> <p>Yet zoos are a major part of British culture. About 30 million visits are made to animal collections every year, according to the <a href=\"https://biaza.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a>. Some of these outfits are small and isolated \u2013 and occasionally fall foul of local authorities for their mistreatment of animals. On the other hand, some larger institutions, such as London or Chester zoos \u2013 are well-run and, according to supporters, justify their existence for three clear reasons: education, research and conservation.</p> <p>According to this argument, revealing the wonders of our planet\u2019s wildlife to the public, and investigating the biology of these animals in order to help them return to nature provide zoos with valid reason to exist. In a world beset by climate change, habitat loss and soaring human numbers, zoos provide protection for the world\u2019s endangered species.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca61259fd265524a663c7d22f28e7366c8221c02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca61259fd265524a663c7d22f28e7366c8221c02/0_173_5130_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aquarium in Dubai\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Attenborough argues that aquariums, such as this one in Dubai, are more successful than zoos at conserving species in captivity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Kellerman/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So who is right? Is there any justification, today, for keeping wild animals in captivity? Are zoos good for the planet\u2019s threatened creatures \u2013 or are they relics of past cruel attitudes to wildlife?</p> <p>One argument is that zoos educate visitors, particularly younger ones, about the wonders of the planet\u2019s wildlife. But Chris Draper of Born Free, the international charity that campaigns against keeping wild animals in captivity, disagrees. \u201cToday, people get more from a TV nature documentary than they will ever get from seeing animals in zoos. In captivity, an elephant or a giraffe is out of its natural environment and probably in an unnatural social grouping. Television or the internet are much better resources for understanding animals than a zoo.\u201d</p> <p>Aspinall agrees. \u201cDavid Attenborough\u2019s programmes are far more educational than a day trip to a zoo,\u201d he says. And you can see their point. Attenborough\u2019s last series, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/20/david-attenborough-environment-new-series-seven-worlds-one-planet\" title=\"\">Seven Worlds, One Planet</a></em>, was made up of typically stunning material \u2013 dramatic close-ups of gentoo penguins fleeing leopard seals, pumas in pursuit of guanacos, and Barbary macaques in high-level chases after infant kidnappers. It was exhilarating, informative \u2013 and surely ideal for getting people hooked on animals.</p> <p>But Attenborough flatly disagrees and is emphatic that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/27/seven-worlds-one-planet-review-david-attenborough-breathtaking-moving-harrowing\" title=\"\">his documentaries</a> cannot compare to seeing the real thing. Only the sight of a creature in the flesh can give us a true understanding of its nature, he says.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no way you can appreciate the quiddity of an elephant except by seeing one at close quarters,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cPeople ought to be able to see what an animal looks like. And smells like. And sounds like. I think that is quite important. Actually, very important.\u201d</p> <p>Education certainly justifies a well-run zoo\u2019s existence, he insists. On the other hand, Attenborough acknowledges that some animals fare better than others in zoos. \u201cModern aquariums are particularly successful, with their vast ceiling-high tanks in which you can see whole communities of different species of fish living together. They are absolutely fabulous.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, polar bears, big raptors and large hunting mammals like lions are not suitable for being kept in zoos, says Attenborough. \u201cI certainly agree with Mr Aspinall in saying you should not have lions in zoos \u2013 unless they were becoming endangered in the wild, which, of course is now becoming a real risk.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ace0277990b2a9646555a7a53ac0a165b3e84330\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ace0277990b2a9646555a7a53ac0a165b3e84330/0_0_4412_2964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damian Aspinall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damian Aspinall, chairman of the Aspinall Foundation, plans to close the charity\u2019s zoos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And the same goes for conservation, he adds. \u201cBreeding programmes for animals that are on the verge of extinction are of incredible importance. If it was not for zoos, there would be no Arabian oryx left in the world, for example.\u201d</p> <p>The Arabian oryx was hunted to extinction in the wild by 1972 but was later reintroduced \u2013 originally with animals from San Diego safari park \u2013 to Oman. Further reintroductions have since taken place in Saudi Arabia and Israel and iIt is estimated that there are now more than 1,000 Arabian oryx in the wild.</p> <p>Other species reintroduced to the wild using zoo-bred animals include the European bison and Przewalski\u2019s horse. But that is about it, argues Aspinall. \u201cOnly a very small number of animals held by European zoos have been the subject of release projects, and third of those species were not rated as threatened,\u201d he says. Instead, zoos are cluttered with unthreatened species put there purely to entertain the public: otters and meerkats are common examples.</p> <p>However, zoo officials reject the idea that their rewilding successes are limited and point to other examples of successfully returning zoo-bred animals to the wild \u2013 for example, the Mauritius kestrel. In 1974 only four of these beautiful raptors were known to exist in the wild. It had become the world\u2019s rarest bird thanks to habitat loss, introduction of non-native predators, and widespread use of DDT and other pesticides on the island.</p> <p>A rescue plan was launched by a number of organisations, including the Durrell wildlife park and London Zoo, in a bid to save the Mauritius kestrel from extinction in the wild. \u201cThe invasive crab-eating macaque was a particular problem,\u201d says Gary Ward, curator of birds at London Zoo. \u201cIt had arrived in Mauritius from Asia and was stealing eggs from kestrel nests. So we designed nesting boxes that were longer than a macaque\u2019s arm, so they couldn\u2019t reach in to snatch eggs. The birds then had a safe place to bring up their young.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F49aac2a1600233b83de18ca1e7c2b0c295deadc9%3Fcrop%3D120_0_3600_2160&amp;left-caption=A%20gentoo%20penguin%20confronting%20a%20leopard%20seal%20in%20a%20scene%20from%20Attenborough%E2%80%99s%20Seven%20Worlds.%20One%20Planet%20TV%20series.%E2%80%82PA&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F0e89bdfa01ce78ef95d2fc1f9e73ada01a88bbfe%3Fcrop%3D0_93_5472_3283&amp;right-caption=There%20were%20only%20four%20Mauritius%20kestrels%20left%20in%20the%20world%20when%20a%20rewilding%20programme%20using%20zoo-bred%20birds%20helped%20boost%20numbers%20to%20800.%E2%80%82Alamy&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Gentoo penguin and Mauritius kestrel\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F49aac2a1600233b83de18ca1e7c2b0c295deadc9%3Fcrop%3D120_0_3600_2160&left-caption=A%20gentoo%20penguin%20confronting%20a%20leopard%20seal%20in%20a%20scene%20from%20Attenborough%E2%80%99s%20Seven%20Worlds.%20One%20Planet%20TV%20series.%E2%80%82PA&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F0e89bdfa01ce78ef95d2fc1f9e73ada01a88bbfe%3Fcrop%3D0_93_5472_3283&right-caption=There%20were%20only%20four%20Mauritius%20kestrels%20left%20in%20the%20world%20when%20a%20rewilding%20programme%20using%20zoo-bred%20birds%20helped%20boost%20numbers%20to%20800.%E2%80%82Alamy&always-place-captions-below=false\">Gentoo penguin and Mauritius kestrel</a> </figure>  <p>Nesting boxes, in combination with other conservation measures, allowed numbers of Mauritius kestrels to rise to about 800 \u2013 although these have dipped slightly in recent years.</p> <p>Other zoo-led rewilding successes have ranged from the spectacular, such as the Californian condor which was restored to the skies above the western US last century, thanks to the release of young birds bred in San Diego \u2013 to the minuscule, such as the return of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/28/return-of-native-tiny-partula-snail-key-south-pacific-wildlife\" title=\"\">tiny partula snail</a>, native to Huahine and Moorea in the Society Islands, French Polynesia, from populations bred in London, Edinburgh, Chester and Amsterdam zoos.</p> <p>However, zoo opponents argue that these reintroductions remain infrequent and do not justify the keeping of other, unthreatened wild animals, a point taken up by Sam Threadgill of <a href=\"https://www.freedomforanimals.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Freedom for Animals</a>, which has campaigned for the abolition of zoos for several decades.</p> <p>Together with Born Free, Freedom for Animals has studied zoos in England and Wales and concluded that only a small percentage of their animals are endangered species, and only about 15% are threatened.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a simple fact that the vast majority of animals kept in zoos are not endangered or threatened and are there simply to provide public entertainment,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Aspinall goes further. He maintains that many large mammals kept in zoos \u2013 lions, elephants, and rhinos, for example \u2013 are inbred or diseased or have the wrong genetic profiles to reintroduce to the wild, where they could further weaken wild populations already struggling to survive. \u201cSo why are they being \u2018arked\u2019 in the first place?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>The infrequency of releases of zoo-bred animals into the wild is acknowledged by Dominic Jermey, director general of the Zoological Society of London, but interpreted in a different way: \u201cThe truth is that many \u2018wild\u2019 areas are no longer viable habitats for animals \u2013 and reintroduction is much more complicated than people might realise. Many of the world\u2019s most threatened species are living in habitats degraded by agriculture, threatened by disease or hemmed into tiny areas with no way of reaching potential mates without coming into conflict with humans.\u201d</p> <p>For his part, Aspinall points to conservation successes that he believes can be achieved with key endangered species without any input from zoos. First, he plans to gradually empty his two zoos \u2013 at Howletts and at Port Lympne, near Folkestone \u2013 and use these to help set up large groups of animals \u2013 gorillas, rhinos, lions and others \u2013 in protected reserves in Africa. \u201cA particular animal would be given homes at several reserves so that if one got into trouble for some reason \u2013 civil war, for example \u2013 there would be other sources that could resupply the reserve once those troubles had been sorted.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The majority of animals in zoos are not endangered or threatened and are there simply to provide public entertainment.</p> <footer> <cite>Sam Threadgill, Freedom for Animals</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Aspinall points to the example of the mountain gorilla. Their numbers had fallen to under 250 by the early 1980s. Today the population stands at 1,000. \u201cThis is in the country of Gabon, surrounded by aggressive habitat destruction, civil war and poaching \u2013 and all done without any captive breeding.\u201d</p> <p>The crucial point of this plan is that animals would not be kept behind bars but left to roam in their homeland. And instead of money being spent on zoos, funds would go directly to conservation.</p> <p>But the idea of closing zoos to boost funds for conservation is challenged by Mark Pilgrim, chief executive of Chester Zoo. His organisation has a total annual budget of \u00a347m.</p> <p>\u201cThat money is raised virtually entirely from people paying at our doors to get in,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter you deduct our running costs and cash for new development, we have around \u00a31.5m and that goes on conservation in the field \u2013 work that includes studies of chimpanzees in Nigeria and sun bears in Asia and a programme to reintroduce eastern black rhinos to Uganda. If we simply closed our doors, as some people have suggested, our funding of these conservation projects would come to an immediate halt.\u201d</p> <p>He quotes as an example Nigeria\u2019s Gashaka Gumti national park, which houses the last reserve of the highly endangered Nigerian-Cameroon chimpanzee. \u201cChimpanzees here live in forests that are less dense and drier than where other members of the species live in other parts of Africa,\u201d says Andrew Moss, a lead conservation scientist at Chester. \u201cTheir diets are rich in insects, and we have found they are amazingly adept at making tools that are just right for getting a different type of insect.</p> <p>\u201cThe crucial point is that if we had closed our gates at Chester, the research camp we support at Gashaka Gumti would have been badly hit and this crucial field work threatened.\u201d</p> <p>Nor is it merely money for conservation work that makes zoos important, say supporters. Expertise built up in zoos is also crucial. Over the past few years, wild vulture populations in India and Nepal have crashed from about 40 million to a few thousand because of the use of diclofenac, a livestock anti-inflammatory drug that is highly poisonous to vultures who eat their carcasses.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been closely involved in conservation work, and our expertise in building aviaries on site to protect the last few vultures \u2013 and in treating sick animals \u2013 has been tremendously useful,\u201d says Nic Masters, assistant director of wildlife health at London Zoo.</p> <p>In the end, these efforts and other attempts at conservation may prove futile in a world challenged by climate change, habitat loss and swelling numbers of humans, as Draper argues. \u201cKeeping alive a handful of the last of a sub-species starts to look like fool\u2019s errand because this tiny population is destined either to a life in captivity in perpetuity or to extinction. Neither of those two options is particularly attractive in anyone\u2019s book, I would say. The damage has been done.\u201d</p> <p>This view is contested by scientists who still believe there is time to save species and who argue, strenuously, that zoos have a role to play as arks for threatened wildlife. This idea is backed by primatologist Jane Goodall, whose pioneering studies of chimpanzees in the wild have revealed the complex lives led by humanity\u2019s closest biological relatives.</p> <p>\u201cGroups who believe all zoos should be closed have not spent the time I have out in the wild,\u201d she once said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t seen the threats destroying chimpanzee habitat; they don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to watch a chimp struggle, wounded and lame from a wire snare. But I do.\u201d</p> <h2>The first zoo</h2> <p>Until the early 19th century, collections of exotic animals were usually owned by kings and queens and were symbols of royal power. This changed with the establishment of the Zoological Society of London in Regent\u2019s Park in 1828. This was the world\u2019s first scientific zoo and was intended to be a collection of unusual beasts for scientific study.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b39f5b9affdc51ac917864684e1bd2a09d5da6bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b39f5b9affdc51ac917864684e1bd2a09d5da6bf/0_4_5227_3137/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The camel enclosure at Regent\u2019s Park Zoological Gardens in 1835.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The camel enclosure at Regent\u2019s Park Zoological Gardens in 1835.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The collection was eventually opened to the public in 1847.

      "bodyText": "In a few days, a pair of two-year-old cheetahs, Saba and Nairo, will depart from the UK on a remarkable journey. The brothers will be taken from Howletts Wild Animal Park, in Kent, and flown to South Africa to begin a new life \u2013 in the wild. It will be the first time that cheetahs born in captivity have left the UK for rewilding in Africa, says Damian Aspinall, who runs Howletts. \u201cThere are only about 7,000 cheetahs left on the planet and they are listed as vulnerable,\u201d he says. \u201cThis reintroduction \u2013 to a reserve in Mount Camdeboo, in south of the country \u2013 is important because it will help to support the small population of cheetahs we have left in the wild.\u201d And the process of releasing animals from his wildlife parks is likely to continue unabated, adds Aspinall. He now campaigns vigorously for a sharp acceleration in the return of all captive animals to the wild and, ultimately, the closure of all zoos and wildlife parks in the UK \u2013 including his own. \u201cWe have no moral right as a species to let animals suffer just because we are curious about them,\u201d he says. The day of the zoo is over, he claims \u2013 and his views are reflected by other critics who view wildlife parks and animal collections as anachronisms that should be phased out of existence over the coming 25 years. Yet zoos are a major part of British culture. About 30 million visits are made to animal collections every year, according to the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Some of these outfits are small and isolated \u2013 and occasionally fall foul of local authorities for their mistreatment of animals. On the other hand, some larger institutions, such as London or Chester zoos \u2013 are well-run and, according to supporters, justify their existence for three clear reasons: education, research and conservation. According to this argument, revealing the wonders of our planet\u2019s wildlife to the public, and investigating the biology of these animals in order to help them return to nature provide zoos with valid reason to exist. In a world beset by climate change, habitat loss and soaring human numbers, zoos provide protection for the world\u2019s endangered species. So who is right? Is there any justification, today, for keeping wild animals in captivity? Are zoos good for the planet\u2019s threatened creatures \u2013 or are they relics of past cruel attitudes to wildlife? One argument is that zoos educate visitors, particularly younger ones, about the wonders of the planet\u2019s wildlife. But Chris Draper of Born Free, the international charity that campaigns against keeping wild animals in captivity, disagrees. \u201cToday, people get more from a TV nature documentary than they will ever get from seeing animals in zoos. In captivity, an elephant or a giraffe is out of its natural environment and probably in an unnatural social grouping. Television or the internet are much better resources for understanding animals than a zoo.\u201d Aspinall agrees. \u201cDavid Attenborough\u2019s programmes are far more educational than a day trip to a zoo,\u201d he says. And you can see their point. Attenborough\u2019s last series, Seven Worlds, One Planet, was made up of typically stunning material \u2013 dramatic close-ups of gentoo penguins fleeing leopard seals, pumas in pursuit of guanacos, and Barbary macaques in high-level chases after infant kidnappers. It was exhilarating, informative \u2013 and surely ideal for getting people hooked on animals. But Attenborough flatly disagrees and is emphatic that his documentaries cannot compare to seeing the real thing. Only the sight of a creature in the flesh can give us a true understanding of its nature, he says. \u201cThere is no way you can appreciate the quiddity of an elephant except by seeing one at close quarters,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cPeople ought to be able to see what an animal looks like. And smells like. And sounds like. I think that is quite important. Actually, very important.\u201d Education certainly justifies a well-run zoo\u2019s existence, he insists. On the other hand, Attenborough acknowledges that some animals fare better than others in zoos. \u201cModern aquariums are particularly successful, with their vast ceiling-high tanks in which you can see whole communities of different species of fish living together. They are absolutely fabulous.\u201d By contrast, polar bears, big raptors and large hunting mammals like lions are not suitable for being kept in zoos, says Attenborough. \u201cI certainly agree with Mr Aspinall in saying you should not have lions in zoos \u2013 unless they were becoming endangered in the wild, which, of course is now becoming a real risk.\u201d And the same goes for conservation, he adds. \u201cBreeding programmes for animals that are on the verge of extinction are of incredible importance. If it was not for zoos, there would be no Arabian oryx left in the world, for example.\u201d The Arabian oryx was hunted to extinction in the wild by 1972 but was later reintroduced \u2013 originally with animals from San Diego safari park \u2013 to Oman. Further reintroductions have since taken place in Saudi Arabia and Israel and iIt is estimated that there are now more than 1,000 Arabian oryx in the wild. Other species reintroduced to the wild using zoo-bred animals include the European bison and Przewalski\u2019s horse. But that is about it, argues Aspinall. \u201cOnly a very small number of animals held by European zoos have been the subject of release projects, and third of those species were not rated as threatened,\u201d he says. Instead, zoos are cluttered with unthreatened species put there purely to entertain the public: otters and meerkats are common examples. However, zoo officials reject the idea that their rewilding successes are limited and point to other examples of successfully returning zoo-bred animals to the wild \u2013 for example, the Mauritius kestrel. In 1974 only four of these beautiful raptors were known to exist in the wild. It had become the world\u2019s rarest bird thanks to habitat loss, introduction of non-native predators, and widespread use of DDT and other pesticides on the island. A rescue plan was launched by a number of organisations, including the Durrell wildlife park and London Zoo, in a bid to save the Mauritius kestrel from extinction in the wild. \u201cThe invasive crab-eating macaque was a particular problem,\u201d says Gary Ward, curator of birds at London Zoo. \u201cIt had arrived in Mauritius from Asia and was stealing eggs from kestrel nests. So we designed nesting boxes that were longer than a macaque\u2019s arm, so they couldn\u2019t reach in to snatch eggs. The birds then had a safe place to bring up their young.\u201d Nesting boxes, in combination with other conservation measures, allowed numbers of Mauritius kestrels to rise to about 800 \u2013 although these have dipped slightly in recent years. Other zoo-led rewilding successes have ranged from the spectacular, such as the Californian condor which was restored to the skies above the western US last century, thanks to the release of young birds bred in San Diego \u2013 to the minuscule, such as the return of the tiny partula snail, native to Huahine and Moorea in the Society Islands, French Polynesia, from populations bred in London, Edinburgh, Chester and Amsterdam zoos. However, zoo opponents argue that these reintroductions remain infrequent and do not justify the keeping of other, unthreatened wild animals, a point taken up by Sam Threadgill of Freedom for Animals, which has campaigned for the abolition of zoos for several decades. Together with Born Free, Freedom for Animals has studied zoos in England and Wales and concluded that only a small percentage of their animals are endangered species, and only about 15% are threatened. \u201cIt is a simple fact that the vast majority of animals kept in zoos are not endangered or threatened and are there simply to provide public entertainment,\u201d he says. Aspinall goes further. He maintains that many large mammals kept in zoos \u2013 lions, elephants, and rhinos, for example \u2013 are inbred or diseased or have the wrong genetic profiles to reintroduce to the wild, where they could further weaken wild populations already struggling to survive. \u201cSo why are they being \u2018arked\u2019 in the first place?\u201d he asks.

Their numbers had fallen to under 250 by the early 1980s. Today the population stands at 1,000. \u201cThis is in the country of Gabon, surrounded by aggressive habitat destruction, civil war and poaching \u2013 and all done without any captive breeding.\u201d The crucial point of this plan is that animals would not be kept behind bars but left to roam in their homeland.

      "body": "<p>\u201cAcross the globe, democracy is in a state of malaise.\u201d That is the bleak assessment of <a href=\"https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/media/uploads/files/DemocracyReport2020.pdf\" title=\"\">a report </a>from the Centre for the Future of Democracy at Cambridge University. Here in the UK, three out of five of us \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/news/109461/more-half-british-voters-now-unhappy-democratic-system-new\" title=\"\">60.3% </a>of the voting population \u2013 are unhappy with the functioning of our democracy. The last time we saw comparable levels of dissatisfaction with the way we are governed was during the \u201cwinter of discontent\u201d in 1978-79.</p> <p>And there is plenty more bad news where that came from \u2013 bad news for democracy across the globe.</p> <p>In the US, for the first time ever, the majority lack faith in the democratic system. That decline has been rapid and recent. Before the financial crisis, more than three-quarters of Americans were satisfied with US democracy; today more than half (55%) are dissatisfied. Worldwide, 57.5% of citizens in the nations studied indicated they were not satisfied. Back in 2005, that was just 38.7%.</p> <p>Taken together, these figures amount to what the report\u2019s authors call a \u201cglobal democratic recession\u201d. The tipping point, they suggest, took place around 2005 and has led now to the \u201chighest level of democratic discontent on record\u201d. What is critical here is that people are growing increasingly dissatisfied not just with their political leaders but with the democratic systems that put them in place. Democracy itself is in trouble.</p> <p>As with all reports built on deep analysis of large data sets (in this case, 3,500 surveys involving more than 4 million respondents), the picture painted by the researchers is complex and there are multiple factors lying behind falls in levels of satisfaction. But what is not in doubt is that we should be worried. It\u2019s harder, however, to conclude that we have any business being surprised.</p> <p>In 2005, at the end of Tony Blair\u2019s second term, levels of democratic dissatisfaction in the UK stood at 32.8%, despite the Iraq war. A quick recap of the intervening period between then and now helps explain why that figure today is 60.3% \u2013 the past 15 years weren\u2019t exactly liberal democracy\u2019s golden age.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Donald Trump did not cause America\u2019s democratic crisis of faith, he rode to power on it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Short-term crises, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/14/mps-expenses-westminster-parliament\" title=\"\">expenses scandal of 2009</a>, rocked voters\u2019 faith in our political system, but far more corrosive were the deeper, systemic failures. Millions stopped believing that democracy was functioning as it should, because the governments it produced were unable or unwilling to address the great disaster of the age.</p> <p>When the banks crashed the global economy in 2007-08, it was they who received a bailout while the rest of us got austerity. As vast reservoirs of wealth were concentrated in the hands of the 1%, governments here and abroad not only tolerated growing inequality, they accelerated it through tax cuts both for the rich and for the companies they owned. Democratically elected governments meekly requesting giant corporations to pay pitifully low levels of tax on their enormous profits is not a good look.</p> <p>When liberal democratic governments refuse or are incapable of bringing about change, voters seek out populist parties and charismatic leaders who promise to tear up the rules and bring about real transformation.</p> <p>Donald Trump did not cause America\u2019s democratic crisis of faith, he rode to power on it. Once in control, he and other populists discovered their room for manoeuvre was expanded by the same disillusionment that helped them into office.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAcross the globe, democracy is in a state of malaise.\u201d That is the bleak assessment of a report from the Centre for the Future of Democracy at Cambridge University. Here in the UK, three out of five of us \u2013 60.3% of the voting population \u2013 are unhappy with the functioning of our democracy. The last time we saw comparable levels of dissatisfaction with the way we are governed was during the \u201cwinter of discontent\u201d in 1978-79. And there is plenty more bad news where that came from \u2013 bad news for democracy across the globe. In the US, for the first time ever, the majority lack faith in the democratic system. That decline has been rapid and recent. Before the financial crisis, more than three-quarters of Americans were satisfied with US democracy; today more than half (55%) are dissatisfied. Worldwide, 57.5% of citizens in the nations studied indicated they were not satisfied. Back in 2005, that was just 38.7%. Taken together, these figures amount to what the report\u2019s authors call a \u201cglobal democratic recession\u201d. The tipping point, they suggest, took place around 2005 and has led now to the \u201chighest level of democratic discontent on record\u201d. What is critical here is that people are growing increasingly dissatisfied not just with their political leaders but with the democratic systems that put them in place. Democracy itself is in trouble. As with all reports built on deep analysis of large data sets (in this case, 3,500 surveys involving more than 4 million respondents), the picture painted by the researchers is complex and there are multiple factors lying behind falls in levels of satisfaction. But what is not in doubt is that we should be worried. It\u2019s harder, however, to conclude that we have any business being surprised. In 2005, at the end of Tony Blair\u2019s second term, levels of democratic dissatisfaction in the UK stood at 32.8%, despite the Iraq war. A quick recap of the intervening period between then and now helps explain why that figure today is 60.3% \u2013 the past 15 years weren\u2019t exactly liberal democracy\u2019s golden age. Short-term crises, such as the expenses scandal of 2009, rocked voters\u2019 faith in our political system, but far more corrosive were the deeper, systemic failures. Millions stopped believing that democracy was functioning as it should, because the governments it produced were unable or unwilling to address the great disaster of the age. When the banks crashed the global economy in 2007-08, it was they who received a bailout while the rest of us got austerity. As vast reservoirs of wealth were concentrated in the hands of the 1%, governments here and abroad not only tolerated growing inequality, they accelerated it through tax cuts both for the rich and for the companies they owned. Democratically elected governments meekly requesting giant corporations to pay pitifully low levels of tax on their enormous profits is not a good look. When liberal democratic governments refuse or are incapable of bringing about change, voters seek out populist parties and charismatic leaders who promise to tear up the rules and bring about real transformation. Donald Trump did not cause America\u2019s democratic crisis of faith, he rode to power on it. Once in control, he and other populists discovered their room for manoeuvre was expanded by the same disillusionment that helped them into office. The trashing of democratic norms and the abuse of institutions such as the judiciary and the press was made possible by the delegitimisation of democratic systems. As Dr Roberto Foa, one of the co-authors of the Cambridge report, states: \u201cWithout this weakening legitimacy, it would be unthinkable for a US presidential candidate to denounce American democracy as rigged, or for the winning presidential candidate in Latin America\u2019s largest democracy to openly entertain nostalgia for military rule.\u201d Such statements further undermine faith in democracy, creating a feedback loop. In 2016, after Trump\u2019s election, Sinclair Lewis\u2019s dystopian novel It Can\u2019t Happen Here, written in 1935, suddenly surged into the Amazon bestseller list. George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four enjoyed a comparable spike in sales. Readers turned to those books \u2013 one written just before the Second World War, the other just after \u2013 to look for points of similarity between the politics of the early 21st century and that of Europe in the 1920s and 30s.

Mostly, my privacy project left me angry.

Now I am theirs.\u201d</p> <p>The future of privacy is likely to be complicated. For starters, no one can even agree what \u201cprivacy\u201d means today. Some argue its first obituary was written 21 years ago when Scott McNealy, then CEO of Sun Microsystems, pronounced: \u201cYou have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.\u201d That may, technically speaking, be true. A different question is: have we reached the tipping point when enough people mind?</p> <p>The traditional response is to argue that privacy has become a bargain. We may all be uneasy about granting so much access to our lives that big corporations know more about us than we do about ourselves\u2026 but we are, by and large, happy to trade that data for the (mostly free!) services and convenience we get in return.</p> <p>So one scenario is that nothing much will change. Elite newspapers and Harvard professors can wring their hands about the human rights implications and the menacing power of the algorithm. But, in the end, the world has moved on and the privacy genie is never going back into the bottle. A second scenario is that there will be some sort of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/28/tech-industry-year-in-review-facebook-google-amazon\" title=\"\">techlash</a>, with consumers increasingly changing their privacy settings \u2013 both real and metaphorical.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/22/cybercrime-laws-need-urgent-reform-to-protect-uk-says-report\">Cybercrime laws need urgent reform to protect UK, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s changed in the past year (this argument goes) is the growing realisation of the sheer scale of what\u2019s happening.

      "bodyText": "Probably too late to ask, but was the past year the moment we lost our technological innocence? The Alexa in the corner of the kitchen monitoring your every word? The location-betraying device in your pocket? The dozen trackers on that web page you just opened? The thought that a 5G network could, in some hazily understood way, be hardwired back to Beijing? The spooky use of live facial recognition on CCTV cameras across London. With privacy there have been so many landmarks in the past 12 months. The $5bn Federal Trade Commission fine on Facebook to settle the Cambridge Analytica scandal? The accidental exposure of a mind-blowing 1.2 billion people\u2019s details from two data enrichment companies? Up to 50m medical records spilled? Maybe your mind was changed by the New York Times\u2019s Privacy Project, an intensely reported and alarming yearlong exploration of the issue? Or the publication of Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s searing book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism? Was it the growing unease over the probable manipulation of elections the world over? Or that moment when you learned from whistleblowers that Big Tech giants had hired actual humans to monitor Siri and Alexa activations, who ended up listening to couples making love? Even people whose job it is to think deeply about technology have begun to come out with forms of belated protest or dissent. The Washington Post\u2019s tech columnist, Geoffrey A Fowler, concluded 2019 by writing: \u201cLearning how everyday things spy on us made me, at times, feel paranoid. Mostly, my privacy project left me angry. Our cultural reference points \u2013 Big Brother and tinfoil hats \u2013 don\u2019t quite capture the sickness of an era when we gleefully carry surveillance machines in our pockets and install them in our homes.\u201d Fowler\u2019s newspaper \u2013 owned by one of the biggest data harvesters of all, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos \u2013 was not alone in publishing detailed guides to readers on the steps they could try to recover a degree of privacy online (belatedly, essential reading for Bezos himself, now he knows what it is like to have his own privacy invaded in the most spectacular way). But most commentators agree that such measures are too little too late \u2013 maybe 20 years too late. \u201cWe were caught off-guard by surveillance capitalism,\u201d says Zuboff, a Harvard professor. \u201cOnce we searched Google, but now Google searches us. Once we thought of digital services as free, but now surveillance capitalists think of us as free\u2026 The message here is simple: Once I was mine. Now I am theirs.\u201d The future of privacy is likely to be complicated. For starters, no one can even agree what \u201cprivacy\u201d means today. Some argue its first obituary was written 21 years ago when Scott McNealy, then CEO of Sun Microsystems, pronounced: \u201cYou have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.\u201d That may, technically speaking, be true. A different question is: have we reached the tipping point when enough people mind? The traditional response is to argue that privacy has become a bargain. We may all be uneasy about granting so much access to our lives that big corporations know more about us than we do about ourselves\u2026 but we are, by and large, happy to trade that data for the (mostly free!) services and convenience we get in return. So one scenario is that nothing much will change. Elite newspapers and Harvard professors can wring their hands about the human rights implications and the menacing power of the algorithm. But, in the end, the world has moved on and the privacy genie is never going back into the bottle. A second scenario is that there will be some sort of techlash, with consumers increasingly changing their privacy settings \u2013 both real and metaphorical. What\u2019s changed in the past year (this argument goes) is the growing realisation of the sheer scale of what\u2019s happening. You or I might have been reasonably relaxed about Google or Instagram targeting us with tailored ads in return for free email, search or social pictures. But we may draw the line at the newly revealed armies of trackers and data-brokers, traders and compilers who are running riot across insurance, retail, finance, health, education and much, much more. The New York Times found smartphones broadcasting the exact locations of users thousands of times per day through hundreds of apps. \u201cThat\u201d, thundered a NYT editorial, \u201cis not a glitch in the system. It is the system. If the government ordered Americans to continuously provide such precise, real-time information about themselves, there would be a revolt.\u201d And maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 there will be one. Possibly it could take just one more massive hack or leak or breach of data to make even non-NYT readers sit up and take notice. A third scenario could see a gradual shift in behaviours as new players enter the market, along with new technologies that allow for the better stewardship of personal data. So-called edge computing seeks to move information out of the cloud and back on to personal devices. Think of the developments in the Apple iPhone that seek to do encryption and store biometric information on your smartphone itself rather than pinging information halfway round the globe. One estimate is that there may be 200 or 300 startups, SMEs and entrepreneurs rethinking the ownership and value of data. Finland\u2019s MyData project is just one high-profile attempt to let individuals regain control of their own data. Other players are exploring how blockchain can strengthen privacy as a basic consumer right. The jury is out \u2013 and doubtless will be for a while yet. The final scenario is regulation. Europe has led the way with GDPR (see the recent thumping \u00a3500k fine on Dixons Carphone for not spotting the malicious software planted on more than 5,000 tills). It used to be assumed that the US would be slow to go down this route, but there have been baby steps in Vermont and Illinois, and January 2020 saw the introduction of the California Consumer Privacy Act, which marks a significant change in how west coast companies need to behave. Who will follow? Our actual loss of privacy will eventually be dated to before 2019, but that was the year we shed our naivety about the scale of the loss. As always in the digital world, the future is unknowable. We may carry on as though nothing has happened.

      "bodyText": "Australians stranded in the Chinese city of Wuhan were expected to fly out of the city on Monday morning as they make their way towards Christmas Island. There are believed to be around 600 Australian citizens and permanent residents stuck in Wuhan. The Australian government had been negotiating with the Chinese government to allow a plane to fly in and evacuate those stuck in Wuhan as the world works to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has now more than 14,000 confirmed cases and has killed 305 people. A Qantas 747 aircraft left Sydney early Sunday afternoon with a team of 14 Qantas cabin crew and four pilots bound for Hong Kong, and then Wuhan. It is understood the flight will be departing from Wuhan at 2am local time (5am AEDT) and will head straight to mainland Australia, where those on board will then be transported to Christmas Island for a 14-day quarantine period. The flight could not go direct to Christmas Island because the runway on the island is not long enough for the 747. Those Qantas staff assigned to the flight volunteered, and the number of staff who volunteered exceeded the number of available positions on the flight. Passengers will be required to go through health checks before boarding, and there will be medical staff on board to assist. All crew and passengers will wear surgical masks that will be changed hourly, and crew will be given hand sanitiser. The entire upper deck of the 747 will be reserved for the Qantas crew, and there will be limited inflight food and drinks in order to limit the exposure of the crew to passengers. Speaking on Triple M radio on Friday, the Qantas CEO, Alan Joyce, said crew would lay out meals and drinks on seats before the flight departed to avoid direct contact with passengers. In normal operations, the 747-400 has 364 seats. The aircraft also uses HEPA filters in its air-conditioning, and the plane will be cleaned once it has returned to Australia. The crew will not be required to be quarantined after the flight. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Sunday that the measures put in place to protect the crew should be sufficient to avoid the need for quarantine. The federal government is covering the majority of the cost of the flight, and as announced on Sunday, passengers will not be expected to pay up to $1,000 for the evacuation, after the government backed down on its previous plan. On Saturday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced anyone bar Australian citizens and permanent residents, and New Zealand visa holders, would not be allowed to travel to Australia if they are coming from, or have travelled through, China. Those who have arrived in Australia before the ban came into effect have been asked to isolate themselves for 14 days.",

A young woman with a pugnacious jaw and a pair of unflattering spectacles on the end of her nose is striding out across a moor, oblivious both to the damp underfoot \u2013 the book\u2019s first frame shows nothing more than a ladylike boot splashing through a puddle \u2013 and to the looming clouds above. Tiny in her bonnet beneath the vast, steely sky, this woman, for all her determination, strikes the reader as terribly alone.</p> <p>And she is alone, for this is the writer Charlotte Bront\u00eb. In the course of the past year, she has lost all three of her living siblings \u2013 Anne, Branwell and Emily \u2013 to tuberculosis; she is still deep in grief. But then something strange happens. No sooner has she spread a blanket over the heather, and taken off her bonnet, than a dashing fellow suddenly appears beside her. He is not dressed for the moor. He wears a top hat, a scarlet cravat, dazzling white breeches and, somewhat incongruously, a pair of sunglasses. Who is he? Is this peacock with the spiky, rock-star hair real, or is he a figment of her imagination?</p> <p>In fact, he\u2019s the latter \u2013 though as Greenberg points out, in the case of the Bront\u00ebs, reality and the life of the imagination are sometimes difficult to separate. \u201cIn Charlotte\u2019s diaries, there\u2019s a bit where Anne and Emily are sitting at the kitchen table, talking about baking bread or something, and then they just switch into what\u2019s happening in Gondal as casually as if they\u2019re discussing the weather,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Gondal was Anne and Emily\u2019s imaginary world: an island in the north Pacific. Like Angria, the rival land invented by Charlotte and Bramwell, the older of the siblings, it had its roots in the Glass Town Confederacy, a realm that was inspired by the 12 wooden soldiers given to them as small children by their father, Patrick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7093ddb4465ba8dbe2704f3270b7b7387e14b110\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7093ddb4465ba8dbe2704f3270b7b7387e14b110/0_374_5606_3363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the moors near Haworth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of the moors near Haworth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTheir devotion to [Gondal] is extraordinary,\u201d says Greenberg. \u201cAt times, it\u2019s almost like an addiction \u2013 and this is what I wanted to explore in my book: the idea that the imagination can impinge on reality in ways that are both positive and negative.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte\u2019s moorland visitor, we will soon discover, is Charles Wellesley, the brother of Arthur Wellesley, AKA Zamorna, the most important character in Angria \u2013 and out on the moor, he now asks her if she wouldn\u2019t like to visit Glass Town, which is all that remains of these lands since she abandoned them, for one final time. What follows is a wild journey: an odyssey that takes in both Glass Town and Haworth, the West Yorkshire village where the Bront\u00ebs grew up. In Greenberg\u2019s hands, it is both comic and tragic; a feat of narrative concision that is by turns dreamy, and gritty. If it\u2019s a fantastic comic \u2013 and I think that it is \u2013 then it\u2019s also one of the best books about the Bront\u00ebs\u2019 juvenilia ever written.</p> <p>Has she always been interested in the Bront\u00ebs? \u201cI read <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/16/charlotte-bronte-bicentenary-birth-jane-eyre-by-sarah-waters-margaret-drabble-jeanette-winterson\" title=\"\">Jane Eyre</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/16/emily-bronte-wuthering-heights-100-best\" title=\"\">Wuthering Heights</a></em> at school,\u201d Greenberg says, when we meet one cold winter morning. \u201cI liked them, but I wouldn\u2019t say I was obsessed. I didn\u2019t know anything about their juvenilia until much later, but when I did finally hear about it, it interested me immediately from a world-building perspective. They were so young \u2013 and the sheer quantity and scale of it. It\u2019s Tolkien-level.\u201d Determined to dedicate her next book to it, she travelled to Yorkshire, hoping to see the tiny handmade books the Bront\u00eb children devoted to Gondal and Angria (they\u2019re in the collection of the <a href=\"https://www.bronte.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Parsonage Museum</a>, where they once lived). \u201cThe first time, I didn\u2019t have the proper paperwork. But the second time, I lucked out: a visiting American academic had them out already, so I was able to see a couple at last.\u201d However, it was visiting Haworth itself that was most inspiring: reaching it across the moors on a local bus; the lingering sense of isolation. \u201cIt\u2019s a special place. Not even all the tea shops can change that.\u201d</p> <p>Back in London, she read and read. \u201cI got into a pickle. The more I researched, the more attached to the source material I got. Eventually, I had to stop and make some choices. The biggest decision was to choose which of their worlds to go for. My gut was to go for Gondal, with its amazing female characters.\u201d She took the characters she thought most interesting, and some of the details of their plots. But thereafter, she freewheeled, adapting and embellishing the narratives as she thought fit. \u201cZamorna is as he appears in their stories, but the connections between the other characters, and the timeline, are my own. The Bront\u00ebs were children of the empire, and there is a lot of Victorian racism in there, so I gave one of their black characters a more empowered story.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"865bcca07eff2323cb2f7b19f51abe21027c054f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/865bcca07eff2323cb2f7b19f51abe21027c054f/51_15_2326_1507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pages from Glass Town.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pages from Glass Town.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Isabel Greenberg/Jonathan Cape</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did it feel at all transgressive, daring to rewrite them like this? \u201cI would never have messed with <em>Jane Eyre </em>or<em> Wuthering Heights</em>. But these stories aren\u2019t sculpted, and they weren\u2019t intended for publication: if I was going to mess with anything, it was this.\u201d She used the older, grieving Charlotte as a framing device. \u201cThere are lots of flashbacks, and to avoid confusion, I used colour to help the reader with the time frame. The present day [when Charlotte is alone and looking back at her childhood] is in sad blues and greys; the sepia tones signify flashbacks; and the Glass Town stories are in full Technicolor.\u201d Charles, meanwhile, functions as Charlotte\u2019s male alter ego: \u201cThat\u2019s why they bicker a bit. Sometimes, he\u2019s like a brother; sometimes, he\u2019s more like some louche journalist.\u201d</p> <p>Greenberg, who is 31, studied illustration at Brighton University, and for an MA in animation at the Royal College of Art. She now teaches on the illustration course at Camberwell College of Arts, London. She still believes, however, that she owes her start as a writer of long-form comics to the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/observer-graphic-short-story-prize\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/observer-graphic-short-story-prize\" title=\"\">/Cape graphic short story prize</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/observer-graphic-short-story-prize\" title=\"\">,</a></em> which she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/06/observer-graphic-short-story-prize-greenberg\" title=\"\">won in 2011</a>. This, she says, made her career. \u201cI felt so lucky. At the time, I didn\u2019t have any commissions. I was working as a nanny. Winning it changed everything. It got me my first agent, and my first publisher.\u201d</p> <p>Her first graphic novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/14/encyclopedia-early-earth-isabel-greenberg\" title=\"\">The Encyclop</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/14/encyclopedia-early-earth-isabel-greenberg\" title=\"\">edia of Early Earth</a></em>, which came out in 2013, was nominated for two Eisner awards, and won the best book category at the British comic awards. Her second, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/09/one-hundred-nights-hero-isabel-greenberg-review\" title=\"\">The One Hundred Nights of Hero</a></em>, made the <em>New York Times</em> graphic books bestseller list. What makes this all the more gratifying is that she didn\u2019t grow up reading comics. \u201cI didn\u2019t know writing them was even something you could do,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to write, and I wanted to draw, that\u2019s all.\u201d For <em>Glass Town</em>, she completely changed her working practice, switching from black ink to pencil and charcoal: \u201ca scratchier finish\u201d. Having relied heavily on narration in her first two books, this one also makes more use of the comic form \u2013 something she would like to play around with in the future.</p> <p>Comics, she notes, are becoming more mainstream, readers coming to understand that they are a medium, not a genre. But for those who create them, they\u2019re also all-engrossing; the sheer labour involved is incredible. Thanks to this, she says she will always have to teach, and take on other illustration projects (she\u2019s currently finishing a children\u2019s book). \u201cThey\u2019re never going to be the only thing I do,\u201d she says, with a rueful smile. \u201cUnless someone wants to buy the movie rights.\u201d But this hardly matters. When she\u2019s at her drawing board, they\u2019re what she loves to do best of all.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Glass Town</em> is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a318.99).

Sometimes, he\u2019s like a brother; sometimes, he\u2019s more like some louche journalist.\u201d Greenberg, who is 31, studied illustration at Brighton University, and for an MA in animation at the Royal College of Art. She now teaches on the illustration course at Camberwell College of Arts, London. She still believes, however, that she owes her start as a writer of long-form comics to the Observer/Cape graphic short story prize, which she won in 2011. This, she says, made her career. \u201cI felt so lucky. At the time, I didn\u2019t have any commissions. I was working as a nanny. Winning it changed everything. It got me my first agent, and my first publisher.\u201d Her first graphic novel, The Encyclopedia of Early Earth, which came out in 2013, was nominated for two Eisner awards, and won the best book category at the British comic awards. Her second, The One Hundred Nights of Hero, made the New York Times graphic books bestseller list. What makes this all the more gratifying is that she didn\u2019t grow up reading comics. \u201cI didn\u2019t know writing them was even something you could do,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to write, and I wanted to draw, that\u2019s all.\u201d For Glass Town, she completely changed her working practice, switching from black ink to pencil and charcoal: \u201ca scratchier finish\u201d. Having relied heavily on narration in her first two books, this one also makes more use of the comic form \u2013 something she would like to play around with in the future. Comics, she notes, are becoming more mainstream, readers coming to understand that they are a medium, not a genre. But for those who create them, they\u2019re also all-engrossing; the sheer labour involved is incredible. Thanks to this, she says she will always have to teach, and take on other illustration projects (she\u2019s currently finishing a children\u2019s book). \u201cThey\u2019re never going to be the only thing I do,\u201d she says, with a rueful smile. \u201cUnless someone wants to buy the movie rights.\u201d But this hardly matters. When she\u2019s at her drawing board, they\u2019re what she loves to do best of all. \u2022 Glass Town is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a318.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

A vast neoclassical building, its corridors are austere, their anonymous expanses broken only by American flags and identical brass plates identifying which Congressman or woman may be found behind each door. Turning a corner, however, something else suddenly appears on the horizon: a multicoloured cloud of butterflies that turns out, on closer examination, to be a collection of hundreds of Post-It notes. \u201cThank you for being strong,\u201d says one. \u201cYou\u2019re the best of what America can be,\u201d says a second. A third, heart-shaped and embellished with a smiley face, announces simply: \u201cYou are home.\u201d Almost, but not entirely, obscured by this outpouring of love is another regulation brass plate. This one reads: Representative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ilhan-omar\" title=\"\">Ilhan Omar</a>, Minnesota.</p> <p>Even by its own standards, the atmosphere in Washington this afternoon is febrile.

But to meet Congresswoman Omar, you would never know all this. Amid the noise and excitement, she is an unexpectedly still, quiet point. In her office she sits, tiny as a bird, hunched over a cup of soup, as if this was just another ordinary day.</p> <p>Does it feel slightly unreal to be here at such a highly charged moment? Omar smiles. \u201cMany of the plot lines in my story feel preposterous at times,\u201d she says, wiping her mouth with a napkin. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m so drawn to watching dramas that are over the top. It\u2019s more bizarre than <em>House of Cards</em>. But my situation is also an example of how two contrary narratives can co-exist.

You expect fire. After all, since her election to Congress, when she became not only the first representative to wear a hijab on the floor of the House, but also the first naturalised citizen from Africa and one of the first two Muslim women to serve, controversy has trailed her almost unceasingly. She\u2019s a member of the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/the-squad-name-origins-aoc-ilhan-omar-ayanna-pressley-rashida-tlaib\" title=\"\">Squad</a>, a group of four women elected to Congress in 2018 (the others are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/04/ayanna-pressley-massachusetts-congress-democratic-primary\" title=\"\">Ayanna Pressley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rashida-tlaib\" title=\"\">Rashida Tlaib </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/24/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-first-year-congress\" title=\"\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>) who are pushing for such progressive ideals as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a>, a Democrat-sponsored resolution that aims to address climate change and economic inequality, and Medicare for All, in which universal healthcare would be funded by taxation.

I vividly remember the first sounds of gunshots through concrete walls. I would have been eight. I remember the distinct noise that a rocket makes as it flies over your home. I remember the desire to escape your own body as you hid under the bed, not knowing whether that rocket is going to hit your home. When the war began, we lived between the rebel forces and the regime. I was truly caught up in the crossfire and our home would ultimately be hit by rockets multiple times. I lived through an invasion of militia men into our home.\u201d She lost no one close, but several people in her wider family were killed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Arriving in the US was brutal. I\u00a0was black, Muslim and female</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The family fled to a refugee camp in Kenya where they remained for four years. \u201cI have memories of arriving there, too. One thing that has stayed with me, and which helps guide my advocacy now, is that I remember what a relief it was to show up there, to receive water and blankets \u2013 and as a kid in the open field, as people are being processed and assigned tents, you get to roam. When I see images of kids in cages at our border [with Mexico], I know their mind is not getting the break that mine got; that moment of feeling like their childhood is being restored to them, when they\u2019re allowed to play. The process we are putting children through is retraumatising.\u201d</p> <p>Did the camp come to feel like home? \u201cIt did, to the point where I protested about leaving \u2013 something my family made fun of me for. You get into a routine and for someone like me, who\u2019d grown up in a very protected environment, watched over in a big family compound, there was lots of new freedom. The rules shifted. When you\u2019re little, you can get away with a lot; you can sneak off. To run around between tents, to stand in line for water, to have the ability to move and to be trusted, was one that I adored. So, the restart wasn\u2019t something I looked forward to. When everything you know no longer exists, and you\u2019ve created a new reality, to do it again\u2026 that was hard.\u201d</p> <p>Her father decided the family would seek asylum in the US; having been a teacher trainer in Somalia, he would make his living in Minneapolis as a cab driver and working for the post office. She was 12 when they arrived, and 17 when she became an American citizen. \u201cMy dad is ever the optimist. It\u2019s hard to see his smiling face and to imagine what he survived. The yearning for home never goes away. But it\u2019s a lot easier to come to the US and have the opportunity of a start than it is to stay in a refugee camp, in limbo. The challenges were really all mine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a870fb870dbfc734b526ef1cc954fd08b58b9e10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a870fb870dbfc734b526ef1cc954fd08b58b9e10/0_51_1564_938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ilhan Omar and her father arriving at the airport in Washington, with their luggage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Touch down: arriving with her father in Washington to be sworn in at Congress.

It was lonely and maddening. I have moved my own kids around a few times [a divorcee, she\u2019s been married twice and has three children by her first husband. Last summer, the rightwing press gleefully reported that she was having a \u201csecret affair with a married aide\u201d]. When they used to complain about it, I would say: \u2018Imagine doing that in a new culture, with no acknowledgement of your faith, and no ability to communicate.\u2019 It\u2019s a good disciplinary tool. Kids like mine can\u2019t complain because their mothers will always go back to their refugee stories.\u201d</p> <p>Was this new world racist? \u201cI grew up in a black world until I was 12, so I\u2019d never even had a conversation about being black \u2013 and even in Kenya, people were predominantly Muslim, so that wasn\u2019t talked about either. So arriving in the US was brutal, yes. Not only was I made aware that I was black and Muslim; I was also a refugee and a female. But being Muslim was the thing about me that was really noticed. Wearing a hijab was an odd thing. The other kids called it out, because that\u2019s what children do. I was made aware that I was not normal. I realised discrimination was part of the system.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, she thrived. She read political science at university in North Dakota, after which she worked in child nutrition back in Minnesota. Having managed the campaigns of other local politicians, by 2016, she had been elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives herself, challenging an incumbent of 44 years; two years later, she stood for Congress. \u201cI think it speaks to something the people have acknowledged,\u201d she says, of her resounding victory in that election. \u201cBy sending me to Washington, they\u2019ve established a counter-narrative; I am an antidote to the rhetoric of Trump. That we have come into the ring is a loss for him, not for us.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s proud of what she has achieved. She is still only 37, after all. She sees the miracles here. But she\u2019s cautious, too; resolute. \u201cThis is a place that is designed to mould and change you. Except, we don\u2019t want to be changed. We want to change it \u2013 and we have.\u201d As one aide begins knocking at the door, and another begins gesturing for me to wind up, her hands go to her scarf. \u201cThere is room here for a hijab.\u201d</p> <p>How high does she want to go? Where does her ambition end? She says something pat about living in the present, but looking at her face, I can\u2019t help but notice that, just for a moment, she seems suddenly coy. \u201cWe can be as bold and courageous as we want,\u201d she says, in the seconds before she darts from the room. \u201cWe have\u2026 opportunities.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This article was amended on 3 February 2020 to correct the fact that the assassination of Suleimani took place in Iraq and not in Iran.</em></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Longworth House, which stands just south of the Capitol in Washington DC, is one of three offices used by members of the House of Representatives. A vast neoclassical building, its corridors are austere, their anonymous expanses broken only by American flags and identical brass plates identifying which Congressman or woman may be found behind each door. Turning a corner, however, something else suddenly appears on the horizon: a multicoloured cloud of butterflies that turns out, on closer examination, to be a collection of hundreds of Post-It notes. \u201cThank you for being strong,\u201d says one. \u201cYou\u2019re the best of what America can be,\u201d says a second. A third, heart-shaped and embellished with a smiley face, announces simply: \u201cYou are home.\u201d Almost, but not entirely, obscured by this outpouring of love is another regulation brass plate. This one reads: Representative Ilhan Omar, Minnesota. Even by its own standards, the atmosphere in Washington this afternoon is febrile. Yesterday, the articles of impeachment against President Trump were finally brought from the House to the Senate. Meanwhile the two leading candidates on the left in the race to be the Democratic presidential candidate, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, had a very public falling out, the former having accused the latter of calling her a liar on live television. Outside, news crews seem to be around every corner. But to meet Congresswoman Omar, you would never know all this. Amid the noise and excitement, she is an unexpectedly still, quiet point. In her office she sits, tiny as a bird, hunched over a cup of soup, as if this was just another ordinary day. Does it feel slightly unreal to be here at such a highly charged moment? Omar smiles. \u201cMany of the plot lines in my story feel preposterous at times,\u201d she says, wiping her mouth with a napkin. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m so drawn to watching dramas that are over the top. It\u2019s more bizarre than House of Cards. But my situation is also an example of how two contrary narratives can co-exist. We live in a time of hopefulness, with so many firsts, yet we can also be in complete despair, a tyrant in the White House.\u201d Her serenity \u2013 minutes can tick by before she answers a question \u2013 comes as a surprise at first. You expect fire. After all, since her election to Congress, when she became not only the first representative to wear a hijab on the floor of the House, but also the first naturalised citizen from Africa and one of the first two Muslim women to serve, controversy has trailed her almost unceasingly. She\u2019s a member of the so-called Squad, a group of four women elected to Congress in 2018 (the others are Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) who are pushing for such progressive ideals as the Green New Deal, a Democrat-sponsored resolution that aims to address climate change and economic inequality, and Medicare for All, in which universal healthcare would be funded by taxation. On the left of the Democratic party, she often draws the ire of her own side as well as that of the right \u2013 particularly when it comes to Israel. Last February, for instance, the Democratic House leadership accused Omar, who is critical of Israel and a supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, of having engaged in antisemitic tropes; she later apologised, and thanked Jewish colleagues for their efforts to \u201ceducate\u201d her. Nevertheless, it is from the Republican side that the worst abuse comes. Last year, the campaign Twitter account for Danielle Stella, a Republican who hopes to unseat her in Minnesota, posted two messages suggesting she be tried for treason \u2013 alleging she had shared sensitive information that found its way to Iran \u2013 and hanged. On social media, the rage against her never lets up. No wonder her staff are reluctant to take down the adoring Post-It notes left by more supportive visitors \u2013 by those who regard her as a symbol of hope and American diversity \u2013 for all that the Capitol Hill authorities have quietly asked them to. Did it feel historic to vote to send the articles to the Senate? \u201cIt did. We have a corrupt, lawless president who has subjected the American people to a great deal of harm and this is our opportunity to uphold our oath of office.\u201d She believes that the impeachment is the morally correct course of action for Democrats, irrespective of whether Trump is acquitted or of its potential effect on the presidential election later this year. \u201cAs the Speaker said, this is the highest form of patriotism.

Will he win the candidacy? \u201cI believe he will.\u201d And if he does, can he really beat Trump? It\u2019s not only that some Americans regard Sanders as a communist.

I\u2019m confident people are going to be for Bernie, because they know he sees them and hears them and will make their lives better. He has an ability, unlike anyone else, to organise a multiracial, multifaith, multiclass movement.\u201d Still, better any Democrat in the White House than no Democrat, she says. Ultimately, whoever runs will have her support. Watching Omar on CBS\u2019s The Late Show last April, resplendent in huge yellow earrings \u2013 under questioning, she apologised again for her comments about the Israel lobby; like many people, she said, she didn\u2019t always fully understand the historic context of certain words and the pain they might cause \u2013 I was vaguely amazed by her star power.

Why would anyone want to deny her experiences? \u201cI understand how quickly a society can deteriorate,\u201d she says, softly. \u201cThere are other Congress members who know what it means to live under an oppressive regime, and who, as children, fled conflict. But I\u2019m unique in being a Representative who lived through active war and who remembers the destruction.\u201d It\u2019s this that, at least in part, lies behind the progressive foreign policy ideas she hopes to announce in the coming weeks, a package that will include the prohibition of arms sales to countries that cross humanitarian red lines and a demand that the US ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. What does she remember of the war? \u201cI remember it in moments. I vividly remember the first sounds of gunshots through concrete walls. I would have been eight. I remember the distinct noise that a rocket makes as it flies over your home. I remember the desire to escape your own body as you hid under the bed, not knowing whether that rocket is going to hit your home. When the war began, we lived between the rebel forces and the regime. I was truly caught up in the crossfire and our home would ultimately be hit by rockets multiple times. I lived through an invasion of militia men into our home.\u201d She lost no one close, but several people in her wider family were killed. The family fled to a refugee camp in Kenya where they remained for four years. \u201cI have memories of arriving there, too. One thing that has stayed with me, and which helps guide my advocacy now, is that I remember what a relief it was to show up there, to receive water and blankets \u2013 and as a kid in the open field, as people are being processed and assigned tents, you get to roam. When I see images of kids in cages at our border [with Mexico], I know their mind is not getting the break that mine got; that moment of feeling like their childhood is being restored to them, when they\u2019re allowed to play. The process we are putting children through is retraumatising.\u201d Did the camp come to feel like home? \u201cIt did, to the point where I protested about leaving \u2013 something my family made fun of me for. You get into a routine and for someone like me, who\u2019d grown up in a very protected environment, watched over in a big family compound, there was lots of new freedom. The rules shifted. When you\u2019re little, you can get away with a lot; you can sneak off. To run around between tents, to stand in line for water, to have the ability to move and to be trusted, was one that I adored. So, the restart wasn\u2019t something I looked forward to. When everything you know no longer exists, and you\u2019ve created a new reality, to do it again\u2026 that was hard.\u201d Her father decided the family would seek asylum in the US; having been a teacher trainer in Somalia, he would make his living in Minneapolis as a cab driver and working for the post office. She was 12 when they arrived, and 17 when she became an American citizen. \u201cMy dad is ever the optimist. It\u2019s hard to see his smiling face and to imagine what he survived. The yearning for home never goes away. But it\u2019s a lot easier to come to the US and have the opportunity of a start than it is to stay in a refugee camp, in limbo. The challenges were really all mine.\u201d She hated not being able to speak English. \u201cIn effect, you\u2019re rendered mute. It was lonely and maddening. I have moved my own kids around a few times [a divorcee, she\u2019s been married twice and has three children by her first husband. Last summer, the rightwing press gleefully reported that she was having a \u201csecret affair with a married aide\u201d]. When they used to complain about it, I would say: \u2018Imagine doing that in a new culture, with no acknowledgement of your faith, and no ability to communicate.\u2019 It\u2019s a good disciplinary tool. Kids like mine can\u2019t complain because their mothers will always go back to their refugee stories.\u201d Was this new world racist? \u201cI grew up in a black world until I was 12, so I\u2019d never even had a conversation about being black \u2013 and even in Kenya, people were predominantly Muslim, so that wasn\u2019t talked about either. So arriving in the US was brutal, yes. Not only was I made aware that I was black and Muslim; I was also a refugee and a female. But being Muslim was the thing about me that was really noticed. Wearing a hijab was an odd thing. The other kids called it out, because that\u2019s what children do. I was made aware that I was not normal. I realised discrimination was part of the system.\u201d Nevertheless, she thrived. She read political science at university in North Dakota, after which she worked in child nutrition back in Minnesota. Having managed the campaigns of other local politicians, by 2016, she had been elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives herself, challenging an incumbent of 44 years; two years later, she stood for Congress. \u201cI think it speaks to something the people have acknowledged,\u201d she says, of her resounding victory in that election. \u201cBy sending me to Washington, they\u2019ve established a counter-narrative; I am an antidote to the rhetoric of Trump. That we have come into the ring is a loss for him, not for us.\u201d She\u2019s proud of what she has achieved. She is still only 37, after all. She sees the miracles here. But she\u2019s cautious, too; resolute. \u201cThis is a place that is designed to mould and change you. Except, we don\u2019t want to be changed. We want to change it \u2013 and we have.\u201d As one aide begins knocking at the door, and another begins gesturing for me to wind up, her hands go to her scarf. \u201cThere is room here for a hijab.\u201d How high does she want to go? Where does her ambition end? She says something pat about living in the present, but looking at her face, I can\u2019t help but notice that, just for a moment, she seems suddenly coy. \u201cWe can be as bold and courageous as we want,\u201d she says, in the seconds before she darts from the room. \u201cWe have\u2026 opportunities.\u201d This article was amended on 3 February 2020 to correct the fact that the assassination of Suleimani took place in Iraq and not in Iran.",

Jack Charlton broke a toe but had to hobble on regardless because no substitutions were allowed, and there was a pitch invasion at the end by giddy Scottish fans, who tore up and pocketed chunks of the turf as souvenirs. After losing in the quarter-finals in 1970 in Mexico, England failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup. In 2003 Jonny Wilkinson kicked his drop goal into the drizzling Sydney sky with seconds left on the clock, and England became the first \u2013 and to date only \u2013 northern-hemisphere winners of the Rugby World Cup. They were rewarded with an open-top bus tour, the freedom of Greater London from Ken Livingstone and at the very least an MBE \u2013 Martin Johnson got a CBE and the head coach Clive Woodward was knighted. Post-retirement, most of the team headed into coaching or the media, while Kyran Bracken won Dancing on Ice and Ben Cohen did a turn on Strictly, as did \u2013 less controversially \u2013 a Question of Sport\u2019s Matt Dawson. Mike Tindall married into the royal family. But, after a 22-game unbeaten run going into the World Cup, that invincible rugby side had gone. In their very next game, they lost 19-13 to Ireland in the Six Nations, the magic no longer quite there. If there\u2019s a message for England\u2019s cricket side in all of this, it may be: no fear. Or, perhaps: nothing will ever be quite as good again. After all, I don\u2019t know what those gracious runners-up New Zealand have done to deserve their groundhog days since July, this week losing two further matches to super overs to take the total to four in seven months. Sport, eh: what a malicious bastard.",

      "body": "<p>Last week, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-impeachment\" title=\"\">impeached US president</a> revealed his plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace, with an indicted Israeli prime minister at his side. Yet far from being a \u201chistoric\u201d peace plan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/no-deal-why-trumps-plan-for-palestine-will-only-create-more-conflict\" title=\"\">Donald Trump\u2019s initiative</a> is merely the repackaging of ideas from previous failed negotiations, including from the days in which I served as a legal adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team.</p> <p>Then, as now, Israeli plans had the same aim: to confine as many Palestinians as possible on as little land as possible, while legalising Israel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/us-israeli-settlements-no-longer-considered-illegal-palestinian-land-mike-pompeo\" title=\"\">illegal settlements</a> and depriving Palestinians their guaranteed right to return to their homeland. This is not a plan for peace but a demand that Palestinians agree to their perpetual subjugation.</p> <p>It would give Israel large swathes of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley, so it need not dismantle any of its illegal settlements. It provides that Jerusalem will be the undivided capital of Israel, with Palestinians relegated to some suburb as <em>their</em> capital. It demands that Palestinians give up the right of return and accept Israel as a \u201cJewish state\u201d.</p> <p>The Palestinian \u201cstate\u201d envisioned will be a collection of ghettoes, devoid of control over borders, airspace or natural resources. This plan has given the green light to Israel\u2019s drive for annexation and, indeed, last week Benjamin Netanyahu announced that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-annex-sovereignty.html\" title=\"\">he would begin the process</a> of illegally annexing the West Bank.</p> <p>Leading up to the plan\u2019s announcement, the US had all but outsourced it to the Israeli prime minister, ticking off item after item on his wishlist, including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, declaring that the occupied Syrian Golan Heights are part of Israel, cutting off aid to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the Palestinian Authority, and <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-officially-announces-closure-of-plo-mission-in-washington/\" title=\"\">the closure of the PLO office</a> in the US. It is therefore unsurprising that Netanyahu could not contain his glee, labelling the Trump plan as among the <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/full-text-of-netanyahus-speech-today-recalls-historic-day-of-israels-founding/\" title=\"\">most important days</a> in Israel\u2019s history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/trump-middle-east-plan-met-with-disgust-across-jordan\">'Things are getting worse': Trump plan met with disgust across Jordan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problems are not just with the content of the plan but also its process. Of the 13 million Palestinians worldwide, Trump and his team could not find even a handful to endorse his plan. Yet for Trump and his advisers, all of whom are supportive of Israel\u2019s settlements and expansionist policies, what Palestinians think and what law stipulates do not matter \u2013 all that matters is Israel.</p> <p>Throughout all of the negotiations of the past two decades, Israeli desires were always placed ahead of Palestinian rights. Israel always disguised its insatiable appetite for Palestinian land as being a \u201csecurity\u201d or \u201cdemographic\u201d concern \u2013 a polite way of saying that Israel does not want any non-Jewish Palestinians in its midst, which Palestinians were always required to accommodate. For example, while ample attention was always paid to Israeli security, Palestinians were to be content living in a demilitarised state, with no means of defence and with Israel and its armed settlers retaining the right to invade Palestinian cities as it pleases. Israel\u2019s \u201cdemographic concerns\u201d are to be met by redrawing boundaries in order to accommodate illegal Israeli settlements while denying Palestinians the right to return simply because they are not Jewish. Israel\u2019s desire to have Jerusalem as its \u201cundivided, eternal capital\u201d results in international law being ignored, and Palestine\u2019s capital is in a distant suburb cut off from holy sites and its economic hub.</p> <p>This attitude is reflected in the Trump plan\u2019s vision for Palestinian citizens of Israel as well. Since the establishment of Israel on 78% of Mandate Palestine in 1948, some leading Israelis have lamented that they did not expel all Palestinians, with 150,000 remaining in what became Israel. Those 150,000 now number 1.8 million, amounting to 21% of Israel\u2019s population, treated as a fifth column, with more than 60 laws discriminating against them.</p> <p>The Trump plan provides that major Palestinian towns inside Israel will become part of the \u201cPalestinian state\u201d. No Palestinians in Israel were consulted over the plan and Israeli officials appear shocked that Palestinians are not wholeheartedly endorsing this idea.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rewarding Israel for ethnically cleansing the indigenous Palestinian population will have untold consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This colonial attitude \u2013 in which Israel and the US know what is best for Palestinians \u2013 remained unchallenged for decades, during which time I often heard Israelis balk at the thought of equality, with representatives of the EU and other countries following suit. We were told how \u201cunrealistic\u201d it was to require Israel to comply with international law and how \u201cnecessary\u201d the US was in securing an agreement. Allowing this colonial attitude to prevail has led to more than five decades of Palestinians requiring Israeli permission for virtually all of life\u2019s necessities and pleasures \u2013 including things as commonplace as seeing loved ones, getting an education, accessing medical care, building a home or seeing the sea. It is cruel that Palestinians have had to endure this colonial arrogance, only to appease Israel\u2019s insatiable appetite for Palestinian land.</p> <p>To be clear, this is not just about Palestine, but about international legal order as we know it. Rewarding Israel for stealing Palestinian land and aiding Israel in ethnically cleansing the indigenous Palestinian population will have untold consequences internationally, with dictatorships around the world being sent the message that they, too, can do as they please and that they, too, will be rewarded.</p> <p>The world\u2019s colonial history and Israel\u2019s colonial present must become a thing of the past. But it isn\u2019t just Israel that must be held to account: all states that have ever demanded that Palestinians make \u201cconcessions\u201d for the sake of \u201cpeace\u201d should understand that peace cannot come through accommodating Israeli desires but by embracing equality.</p> <p>Just as the world would never accept that Tel Aviv become tradeable, so too Palestinian cities, towns and land are not tradeable. Just as the world would never accept a demilitarised Israel, it should not demand that Palestinians be unable to defend themselves from an aggressive Israel.</p> <p>As Israel pushes ahead with annexing the West Bank, I fear I will continue to hear the same international condemnations I\u2019ve heard for the past 25 years, since the start of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/sep/10/israel-plo-oslo-agreement-1993\" title=\"\">the Oslo process</a>. These will do nothing to change the colonial mentality of Israel and the US and will only continue to demonstrate to Palestinians that force, might and bullying \u2013 and not law \u2013 are paramount.</p> <p>\u2022Diana Buttu is a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and a former legal adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last week, an impeached US president revealed his plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace, with an indicted Israeli prime minister at his side. Yet far from being a \u201chistoric\u201d peace plan, Donald Trump\u2019s initiative is merely the repackaging of ideas from previous failed negotiations, including from the days in which I served as a legal adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team. Then, as now, Israeli plans had the same aim: to confine as many Palestinians as possible on as little land as possible, while legalising Israel\u2019s illegal settlements and depriving Palestinians their guaranteed right to return to their homeland. This is not a plan for peace but a demand that Palestinians agree to their perpetual subjugation. It would give Israel large swathes of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley, so it need not dismantle any of its illegal settlements. It provides that Jerusalem will be the undivided capital of Israel, with Palestinians relegated to some suburb as their capital. It demands that Palestinians give up the right of return and accept Israel as a \u201cJewish state\u201d. The Palestinian \u201cstate\u201d envisioned will be a collection of ghettoes, devoid of control over borders, airspace or natural resources. This plan has given the green light to Israel\u2019s drive for annexation and, indeed, last week Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he would begin the process of illegally annexing the West Bank. Leading up to the plan\u2019s announcement, the US had all but outsourced it to the Israeli prime minister, ticking off item after item on his wishlist, including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, declaring that the occupied Syrian Golan Heights are part of Israel, cutting off aid to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the Palestinian Authority, and the closure of the PLO office in the US. It is therefore unsurprising that Netanyahu could not contain his glee, labelling the Trump plan as among the most important days in Israel\u2019s history. The problems are not just with the content of the plan but also its process. Of the 13 million Palestinians worldwide, Trump and his team could not find even a handful to endorse his plan. Yet for Trump and his advisers, all of whom are supportive of Israel\u2019s settlements and expansionist policies, what Palestinians think and what law stipulates do not matter \u2013 all that matters is Israel. Throughout all of the negotiations of the past two decades, Israeli desires were always placed ahead of Palestinian rights. Israel always disguised its insatiable appetite for Palestinian land as being a \u201csecurity\u201d or \u201cdemographic\u201d concern \u2013 a polite way of saying that Israel does not want any non-Jewish Palestinians in its midst, which Palestinians were always required to accommodate. For example, while ample attention was always paid to Israeli security, Palestinians were to be content living in a demilitarised state, with no means of defence and with Israel and its armed settlers retaining the right to invade Palestinian cities as it pleases. Israel\u2019s \u201cdemographic concerns\u201d are to be met by redrawing boundaries in order to accommodate illegal Israeli settlements while denying Palestinians the right to return simply because they are not Jewish. Israel\u2019s desire to have Jerusalem as its \u201cundivided, eternal capital\u201d results in international law being ignored, and Palestine\u2019s capital is in a distant suburb cut off from holy sites and its economic hub. This attitude is reflected in the Trump plan\u2019s vision for Palestinian citizens of Israel as well. Since the establishment of Israel on 78% of Mandate Palestine in 1948, some leading Israelis have lamented that they did not expel all Palestinians, with 150,000 remaining in what became Israel. Those 150,000 now number 1.8 million, amounting to 21% of Israel\u2019s population, treated as a fifth column, with more than 60 laws discriminating against them. The Trump plan provides that major Palestinian towns inside Israel will become part of the \u201cPalestinian state\u201d. No Palestinians in Israel were consulted over the plan and Israeli officials appear shocked that Palestinians are not wholeheartedly endorsing this idea. This colonial attitude \u2013 in which Israel and the US know what is best for Palestinians \u2013 remained unchallenged for decades, during which time I often heard Israelis balk at the thought of equality, with representatives of the EU and other countries following suit. We were told how \u201cunrealistic\u201d it was to require Israel to comply with international law and how \u201cnecessary\u201d the US was in securing an agreement. Allowing this colonial attitude to prevail has led to more than five decades of Palestinians requiring Israeli permission for virtually all of life\u2019s necessities and pleasures \u2013 including things as commonplace as seeing loved ones, getting an education, accessing medical care, building a home or seeing the sea. It is cruel that Palestinians have had to endure this colonial arrogance, only to appease Israel\u2019s insatiable appetite for Palestinian land. To be clear, this is not just about Palestine, but about international legal order as we know it. Rewarding Israel for stealing Palestinian land and aiding Israel in ethnically cleansing the indigenous Palestinian population will have untold consequences internationally, with dictatorships around the world being sent the message that they, too, can do as they please and that they, too, will be rewarded. The world\u2019s colonial history and Israel\u2019s colonial present must become a thing of the past. But it isn\u2019t just Israel that must be held to account: all states that have ever demanded that Palestinians make \u201cconcessions\u201d for the sake of \u201cpeace\u201d should understand that peace cannot come through accommodating Israeli desires but by embracing equality. Just as the world would never accept that Tel Aviv become tradeable, so too Palestinian cities, towns and land are not tradeable. Just as the world would never accept a demilitarised Israel, it should not demand that Palestinians be unable to defend themselves from an aggressive Israel. As Israel pushes ahead with annexing the West Bank, I fear I will continue to hear the same international condemnations I\u2019ve heard for the past 25 years, since the start of the Oslo process. These will do nothing to change the colonial mentality of Israel and the US and will only continue to demonstrate to Palestinians that force, might and bullying \u2013 and not law \u2013 are paramount. \u2022Diana Buttu is a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and a former legal adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team",

Ovarian tissue storage! And not only for fertility-related reasons. Who\u2019d want a menopause? \u201cWill you be ready?\u201d the website challenges. \u201cYou never know what the future holds, so freeze the biological clock and prepare for the future.\u201d</p> <p>For many women, alas, the offer will be empty. The ProFaM clockstopping technique requires young ovarian tissue and costs up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/04/medical-procedure-delay-menopause\" title=\"\">\u00a37,000 for removal</a> (storage and reinstatement extra). \u201cAge 25-30 is optimal,\u201d the doctors say. Once reinstalled, the tissue is supposed to function as \u201cnatural HRT\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/menopause/\" title=\"\">average age</a> at menopause is 51. To defer the menopause \u2013 theoretically at least, via this method \u2013 women need to pay for an operation before they\u2019ve thought about middle age, or experienced its social construction as an affliction, or, probably, considered volunteering as guinea pigs in non-essential experiments. Nobody knows how long, how well or how safely thawed ovarian tissue will function once it\u2019s replaced in a much older body, because it hasn\u2019t been done yet.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe we are now in a position to offer the opportunity to postpone the menopause\u201d seems to be the closest ProFaM gets to closing the argument for costly speculative surgery. It\u2019s a bit like persuading very thin people to pay for an untrialled weight loss technique they might not need for a quarter of a century, if ever. And what if, one day, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2018/may/16/menopausal-how-an-ill-advised-analogy-left-the-bank-of-england-deputy-red-faced\" title=\"\">menopausal</a>\u201d ceased being an insult? Meanwhile, ProFaM needs healthy \u2013 and affluent \u2013 young women to pay up.</p> <p>Step forward Savannah Fishel, 22, the daughter of Dr Simon Fishel, a co-founder of ProFaM. In <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51269237\" title=\"\">BBC interviews</a> that may prefigure the corpororation\u2019s new non-inquisitorial style, father and daughter last week together made the case for using Fishel ovary-harvesting services, presumably, in Ms Fishel\u2019s case, at a discount.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Maybe we've all been a bit unfair to Gwyneth Paltrow and vaginal steaming</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen menopausal problems manifest themselves in family members,\u201d Ms Fishel offered, by way of objective scientific reasoning. The technique sounded, the BBC reporter hazarded, a bit experimental? One for the fertility expert. \u201cIt\u2019s experimental with a group of patients we want it to benefit,\u201d Mr Fishel said. \u201cBut in its own element, each element of it is not experimental, no.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help wondering at this point if we haven\u2019t all been a bit unfair to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/30/nhs-chief-simon-stevens-condemns-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness-products\" title=\"\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>. Is vaginal steaming so much more disreputable than minced ovary with still indeterminate menopause-postponing powers?</p> <p>It was left to another doctor, Dr Melanie Davies of Fertility Preservation UK, commenting separately, to confirm that Fishel\u2019s technique is unproven, to warn against \u201chealthy women going through surgery that would not otherwise be needed\u201d, and make the case, instead, for conventional hormone replacement therapy.</p> <p>More usefully for the Fishels, the BBC illustrated <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51269237\" title=\"\">its report</a> with one of those stock pictures of a tormented middle-aged woman who has stepped away from normal, happy people into private, menopausal hell. Unless Savannah Fishel\u2019s dynastic loyalty can substitute for peer-reviewed studies, sustained aversion to the menopause is likely to be as critical to ProFaM\u2019s prosperity as are misogyny and gerontophobia to buccaneering aesthetic surgery, and the cultural pressure to reproduce to the sale of unpromising IVF.</p> <p>Conversely, too much awareness about the significant number of women who are either unafflicted or only temporarily troubled by the menopause \u2013 or immeasurably more affected by other life events \u2013 could be disastrous for a business posited on a narrative of female biological doom. There can\u2019t be enough doom, or gloom, where no compelling argument exists. Have women realised, for instance, that female longevity is not the unqualified bonus they may have thought? \u201cAs women, for the first time in human history, are living so much longer in the post-fertile phase,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/uk-clinic-tries-out-new-procedure-to-delay-menopause-for-20-years#It-could-potentially-stave-off-menopause-related-health-issues\" title=\"\">Fishel likes to argue</a>, \u201cthey may be suffering much longer.\u201d</p> <p>But perhaps women define suffering \u2013 and indeed their reasons for existing \u2013 differently? Though one in four women, as <a href=\"https://menopausesupport.co.uk/?page_id=60\" title=\"\">a study suggested</a>, report severe menopausal symptoms, that suggests three out of four don\u2019t. Some actively exult. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-menopause-perceptions/culture-may-influence-how-women-experience-menopause-idUSKBN0OL1XH20150605\" title=\"\">US research</a> suggests that their experience will relate to prevailing cultural attitudes. \u201cIn societies where age is more revered and the older woman is the wiser and better woman, menopausal symptoms are significantly less bothersome,\u201d Yale\u2019s Dr Mary Jane Minkin has said. Should young women, not knowing into which category they will fall, pay, insurance style, for future interventions they may not want?</p> <p>Mercifully for Fishel\u2019s embryonic industry, a growing and welcome openness about the menopause seems to favour his version, in alighting predominantly on its potential to cause distress, as opposed to its potential \u2013 compared with other middle-aged afflictions \u2013 manageability.

      "bodyText": "Against a background of tasteful pastel \u2013 which signals from the off that we are in the land of discretionary spending on faulty female anatomy \u2013 the ProFaM website makes its unique bid for women\u2019s money. Ovarian tissue storage! And not only for fertility-related reasons. Who\u2019d want a menopause? \u201cWill you be ready?\u201d the website challenges. \u201cYou never know what the future holds, so freeze the biological clock and prepare for the future.\u201d For many women, alas, the offer will be empty. The ProFaM clockstopping technique requires young ovarian tissue and costs up to \u00a37,000 for removal (storage and reinstatement extra). \u201cAge 25-30 is optimal,\u201d the doctors say. Once reinstalled, the tissue is supposed to function as \u201cnatural HRT\u201d. The average age at menopause is 51. To defer the menopause \u2013 theoretically at least, via this method \u2013 women need to pay for an operation before they\u2019ve thought about middle age, or experienced its social construction as an affliction, or, probably, considered volunteering as guinea pigs in non-essential experiments. Nobody knows how long, how well or how safely thawed ovarian tissue will function once it\u2019s replaced in a much older body, because it hasn\u2019t been done yet. \u201cWe believe we are now in a position to offer the opportunity to postpone the menopause\u201d seems to be the closest ProFaM gets to closing the argument for costly speculative surgery. It\u2019s a bit like persuading very thin people to pay for an untrialled weight loss technique they might not need for a quarter of a century, if ever. And what if, one day, \u201cmenopausal\u201d ceased being an insult? Meanwhile, ProFaM needs healthy \u2013 and affluent \u2013 young women to pay up. Step forward Savannah Fishel, 22, the daughter of Dr Simon Fishel, a co-founder of ProFaM. In BBC interviews that may prefigure the corpororation\u2019s new non-inquisitorial style, father and daughter last week together made the case for using Fishel ovary-harvesting services, presumably, in Ms Fishel\u2019s case, at a discount. \u201cI\u2019ve seen menopausal problems manifest themselves in family members,\u201d Ms Fishel offered, by way of objective scientific reasoning. The technique sounded, the BBC reporter hazarded, a bit experimental? One for the fertility expert. \u201cIt\u2019s experimental with a group of patients we want it to benefit,\u201d Mr Fishel said. \u201cBut in its own element, each element of it is not experimental, no.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help wondering at this point if we haven\u2019t all been a bit unfair to Gwyneth Paltrow. Is vaginal steaming so much more disreputable than minced ovary with still indeterminate menopause-postponing powers? It was left to another doctor, Dr Melanie Davies of Fertility Preservation UK, commenting separately, to confirm that Fishel\u2019s technique is unproven, to warn against \u201chealthy women going through surgery that would not otherwise be needed\u201d, and make the case, instead, for conventional hormone replacement therapy. More usefully for the Fishels, the BBC illustrated its report with one of those stock pictures of a tormented middle-aged woman who has stepped away from normal, happy people into private, menopausal hell. Unless Savannah Fishel\u2019s dynastic loyalty can substitute for peer-reviewed studies, sustained aversion to the menopause is likely to be as critical to ProFaM\u2019s prosperity as are misogyny and gerontophobia to buccaneering aesthetic surgery, and the cultural pressure to reproduce to the sale of unpromising IVF. Conversely, too much awareness about the significant number of women who are either unafflicted or only temporarily troubled by the menopause \u2013 or immeasurably more affected by other life events \u2013 could be disastrous for a business posited on a narrative of female biological doom. There can\u2019t be enough doom, or gloom, where no compelling argument exists. Have women realised, for instance, that female longevity is not the unqualified bonus they may have thought? \u201cAs women, for the first time in human history, are living so much longer in the post-fertile phase,\u201d Fishel likes to argue, \u201cthey may be suffering much longer.\u201d But perhaps women define suffering \u2013 and indeed their reasons for existing \u2013 differently? Though one in four women, as a study suggested, report severe menopausal symptoms, that suggests three out of four don\u2019t. Some actively exult. US research suggests that their experience will relate to prevailing cultural attitudes. \u201cIn societies where age is more revered and the older woman is the wiser and better woman, menopausal symptoms are significantly less bothersome,\u201d Yale\u2019s Dr Mary Jane Minkin has said. Should young women, not knowing into which category they will fall, pay, insurance style, for future interventions they may not want? Mercifully for Fishel\u2019s embryonic industry, a growing and welcome openness about the menopause seems to favour his version, in alighting predominantly on its potential to cause distress, as opposed to its potential \u2013 compared with other middle-aged afflictions \u2013 manageability. To hear Dawn Butler, before the election, advancing Labour\u2019s case for dedicated menopause rooms and menopause leave, was to wonder why any woman should be expected to work through an enveloping fog of heat, mood changes, cognitive decline and misery. Not to mention why these arrangements should be more urgent than, say, carers\u2019 leave or bereavement rooms. If Labour\u2019s menopause policy did raise awareness, it probably did just as much to consolidate the view that this process is a scary, debilitating illness that regularly defies all treatment. Earlier media rejoicing about Fishel\u2019s evidence-light scheme had already indicated the degree to which the menopause is pathologised as a relentless biological curse on women, who await their saviour. Whether it is ethical for UK clinicians, in the absence of long-term trials, to monetise this kind of thinking is for professional bodies to decide. Maybe private ovary-freezing is no less respectable than other offers of inessential but encouraged \u201cself-optimising\u201d surgery? As a lay person I would only add that one of the unexpected benefits of a post-fertile existence turns out to be the protection it offers against ambitious male gynaecologists. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much for your company today - lots to get through from cycling to softball and plenty in between. If you\u2019re not sated there\u2019s still more to come with the men\u2019s final at the Australian Open on its way. We\u2019ll be back to do this all again soon. The Wanderers wrap things up in the last minute of stoppage time with a classic counterattacking goal. With the Mariners camped in Western Sydney territory a long ball into the box was cleared by Keanu Baccus, he intelligently fed the rapid Mo Adam who squared for Nicolai Muller to tee up debutant Simon Cox to smash beyond the helpless Mark Birighitti. The JP de Marigny era begins with three points. A-League: 83 mins: CCM 1-2 WSW: Two spot-kicks in the blink of an eye in Gosford! The Wanderers had barely finished celebrating their second goal when Pirmin Schewgler mistimed a challenge on Matt Simon and the big Mariner got up to drill the penalty low beyond Daniel Lopar. NBL: A curious state of affairs today in the NBL with a leaky roof ending play. A-League: And right on cue, the Wanderers make it 2-0 courtesy of a Mitch Duke Panenka penalty. Tommy Oar made a mess of a Wanderers ball over the top and in his desperation brought down Simon Cox. No arguments over the award of the spot kick that was cooly dispatched by the Western Sydney skipper. A penny for Markus Babbel\u2019s thoughts... A-League: It remains CCM 0-1 WSW with 15-minutes remaining in Gosford but there have been chances aplenty throughout the match. Cricket: Here\u2019s the match report from Manuka Oval on another day out for Ellyse Perry. Breaking: From the front of the paper (but related to sport) Bridget McKenzie has finally resigned. Cricket: Some lovely Shane Watson appreciation from former opening partner Ed Cowan. It ended up nervier than expected at Manuka Oval with Australia making heavy weather of their target of 104 to beat India. That they did owes plenty to another extraordinary performance for the incredible Ellyse Perry. She took match-best figures of 4/13 with the ball then top-scored with 49 to anchor the run-chase. All three sides now have one win and one defeat from their opening pair of matches. Cricket: Ellyse Perry will not see Australia over the line herself but she has set up what will ultimately be a narrow victory after a starring role with both bat and ball. A-League: Shortly before half-time Nicolai M\u00fcller has broken the deadlock in Gosford, giving the Wanderers the advantage. Hockey: A great afternoon for Australia\u2019s men against GB in the Pro League. The women\u2019s half of the double-header is up next. Cricket: Jess Jonassen has just holed out to long-on, leaving Australia 82-5 and making this Ellyse Perry v India battle even more awkward for the allrounder to navigate. 22 needed from 32 balls. Softball: A comprehensive victory for Japan in the final of the Australia Pacific Cup in Sydney. A-League: Goalless in the A-League after half-an-hour but there have been chances at both ends. Hockey: It\u2019s been a good day out for the Kookaburras in the Pro League. Cricket: Ellyse Perry is doing Ellyse Perry things again. After taking 4/13 earlier she is now 35 off 32 balls and making light work of what was becoming an awkward run-chase. 26 still required off 38 balls for Australia with six wickets in hand. Tennis: Defeat confirmed for Australian outsiders Saville and Purcell. Congratulations Salisbury and Ram! Cricket: It\u2019s getting nervy in Canberra. Ellyse Perry once again holds the key for Australia. Tennis: Ram and Salisbury have taken a firm grip on the Australian Open doubles final, breaking Purcell and Saville then holding serve to lead 3-1 in the second set after already securing the opening set. A-League: When too much sport is never enough... It\u2019s time for the A-League to join the party. Cricket: Make that 22 from 14 and out for Ashleigh Gardner. Australia in a spot of bother at 30-3. Time for another Ellyse Perry special. She\u2019s at the crease alongside stand-in skipper Rachael Haynes. Cricket: But it\u2019s more bad news from Canberra with Beth Mooney the second wicket to fall. Australia now 30-2 in pursuit of India\u2019s 103. Despite the loss of a couple of batting partners Ash Gardner is lighting up Manuka Oval with 22 from just 12 balls. Hockey: Half-time in the Pro League where it\u2019s much better news for Australia. Sydney Sevens: Make it stop! Tennis: 11th seeds Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury have taken the opening set of the men\u2019s doubles final at the Australian Open 6-4. Tough battle ahead for the Australian pair of Max Purcell and Luke Saville. Sydney Sevens: Yikes! Cricket: A tough run of minutes for Australian representatives in a variety of sports also includes Alyssa Healy falling early in the tri-series run-chase. Australia are 14-1 after three overs in pursuit of India\u2019s 103. Sydney Sevens: It\u2019s going from bad to worse at the rugby. Not a great all round for Australia\u2019s representatives at Parramatta Stadium. Sydney Sevens: Canada are on top of their semi-final with Australia at the break. Hockey: It\u2019s all happening in the Pro League. Tennis: Bad news for Purcell and Saville. They\u2019ve been broken by Ram and Salisbury and are now serving to stay in the opening set at 3-5. Tennis: It\u2019s on serve in the opening set of the men\u2019s doubles final at the Australian Open with Saville and Purcell leading 3-2. Hockey: It\u2019s quarter-time in the Pro League and Australia have taken the lead against GB. Cricket: India end their 20 overs on 103/9 at Manuka Oval. Perry finished with 4/13, Vlaeminck 3/13. Australia can be very happy with the first half of their day\u2019s work. Belgium\u2019s Dries Devenyns outlasts Pavel Sivakov to celebrate victory for the Deceuninck - Quick-Step Cycling Team in the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. Everything is heating up now around the country. There\u2019s under 10km to go in the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. The leaders still enjoy a 30-second advantage but Simon Yates has just launched a sprint to bring the peloton closer to the breakaway. Australia\u2019s women will soon be in action against Canada in the semi-finals of the Sydney Sevens. India are now 86-8 with three overs remaining against Australia in the tri-series at Canberra. The Pro League Hockey between the men of Australia and GB has just got underway. Japan continue to dominate the softball against Australia in Sydney. And it\u2019s time for the men\u2019s doubles final at the Australian Open, featuring Luke Saville and Max Purcell. Cricket: But Perry does make it three wickets for the over after Sharma chips to Beth Mooney, who holds on after a juggle at gully. And another one bites the dust when the rapid Vlaeminck returns to the attack India 82-7 now after 14.1. Cricket: Big wicket for Australia with Harmanpreet Kaur caught at third for 28 off the bowling of superstar Ellyse Perry. And another next ball! Taniya Bhatia chips to point to leave Perry on a hat-trick and reeling at India 78-5 after 13.2 overs. Deepti Sharma calmly denies Perry a hat-trick. Softball: Japan are now up 3-0 against Australia in the final of the Australia Pacific Cup in Sydney. Cycling: We\u2019re into the last 30km of the 171km Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. There\u2019s a six-strong breakaway group with a 25 second lead over the peloton. That breakaway features Australian Carter Turnbull. Cricket: Australia remain on top of their tri-series clash with India. The visitors are 58-3 at the halfway point of their innings in Canberra. Jess Jonassen has just removed the dangerous Smriti Mandhana but Harmanpreet Kaur remains at the crease. NFL: Around 10.30am tomorrow (AEST) the eyes of the world will be on Miami for the Super Bowl. It\u2019s the latest opportunity for Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes to state his credentials as the latest superstar of world sport. But there\u2019s something about Mahomes that seems accessible to everyone. It could be his teenage kisser or his Kermit-adjacent voice or the way he carves up his opponents with the warmest of smiles. It could be the sight of him swaggering into Arrowhead Stadium for an October kickoff in Satchel Paige\u2019s Kansas City Monarchs jersey \u2013 an incredible gesture that pays respect to his new town, his father (a former Major League pitcher) and the under-heralded legacy of Negro Leagues baseball in one fell swoop. Sydney Sevens: Probably the final update on Australia\u2019s men for this liveblog. They take on New Zealand at 7pm in a match to decide 5th place in this year\u2019s event. The Kiwis are ranked No 1 in World Rugby Sevens but got lumbered in a group of death alongside Fiji and had to settle for second place. Thanks Elizabeth, I\u2019ll add that to the list. Japan are currently leading 2-0 at the top of the fourth. Tennis: The major event later on is the men\u2019s final of the Australian Open. Dominic Thiem has made great strides over the past fortnight but Novak Djokovic is an immovable object on Rod Laver Arena. Cricket: Australia are on top early in their T20 tri-series contest with India. Stand-in skipper Rachel Haynes (deputising for the injured Meg Lanning) won the toss and sent India in to bat at Manuka Oval and she was rewarded with a brace of early wickets. India are currently 31/2 after five overs. Sydney Sevens: The news is much better for the Australian women\u2019s team. They\u2019re through to a semi-final date with Canada. That means two v three on the 2019\u201320 World Rugby Women\u2019s Sevens Series ladder. Sydney Sevens: The news for Australia\u2019s men is pretty catastrophic, I\u2019m afraid to report. After routine victories over Japan and Scotland, Australia were hammered 43-7 by the USA. That defeat means the hosts will not progress to the knockout phase. After three of ten rounds of the 2019-20 World Rugby Sevens Series Australia are ranked fifth of the 16 competing nations. In England\u2019s Premier League overnight Liverpool set a new record for dominance. While bitter rivals Manchester United continued to pay the price for years of poor ownership, despite the debut of the latest star signing expected to cure many strategic faults all by himself. Super Rugby is back for 2020 and Matt McILraith has filed an interesting story on Canterbury\u2019s all-conquering Crusaders. In the aftermath of the horrific shootings at the Al Noor Mosque and nearby Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch last March, which claimed 51 lives, the name of the country\u2019s champion rugby team, taken from the historical crusades of the middle ages, became a lightning rod for the raw emotion the attacks unleashed. Before we tuck into the day\u2019s activities lest look back on a huge night at Melbourne Park where Sofia Kenin became the latest major winner after hustling her way beyond Garbine Muguruza in the final of the Australian Open.

      "bodyText": "Strong winds and thunderstorms across New South Wales were generating dangerous conditions for firefighters on Sunday evening as more homes were reported lost in the Bega Valley. Cooler temperatures forecast for Monday and the chance of substantial rain was giving fire authorities hope that conditions would ease on the other side of a cool change in the weather. On Sunday morning, NSW Health told residents in several parts of the state to restrict outdoor activities after bushfire smoke and dust caused air quality problems. In the Bega Valley in south-eastern NSW, the 177,000-hectare Border fire pushed north late on Saturday, while three other blazes in the south-west had merged into one. The Bega Valley shire council mayor, Kristy McBain, said on Sunday more than 400 properties and homes had been lost after 34 days of fire activity in her area. An unconfirmed number of homes were lost in Wyndham and Tantawangalo in the latest blazes. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard for people because this has been going on for 34 days and counting. We had homes lost on day one and day 34 we are still losing homes.\u201d Late on Sunday afternoon there were still more than 60 fires burning across the state, with 30 not contained. McBain said cooler weather gave some reprieve to the community on Sunday but a big south-westerly wind is expected on Monday, which residents fear will cause more problems for the area. \u201cEveryone is just catching their breath today before tomorrow afternoon it flares up again,\u201d she said. The NSW Rural Fire Service told Guardian Australia on Sunday evening it had received reports of property losses in Bega Valley, but they were unable to confirm the reports as conditions were not safe enough for building impact assessment teams to enter the area. Thunderstorms breaking out in parts of NSW could create challenging conditions for Sunday evening, but there was some hope for better conditions on the other side of the cool change. The NSW RFS spokesperson Greg Allan said: \u201cWe are seeing areas with thunderstorm activity and that could make conditions on fire grounds erratic and dangerous.\u201d On Sunday afternoon, firefighters were working to control the Erskine Creek fire south of Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains. But Allan said forecasts were for damaging winds over the same Erskine Creek area on Sunday evening. \u201cThat will cause that fire ground to be very erratic. Conditions are still very dangerous even in the Bega Valley. \u201cFor the next 24 hours, people still need to be very vigilant,\u201d he said, adding people in bushfire-prone areas should continue to discuss their survival plans. Allan added: \u201cThe forecast is looking much better for next week with some thunderstorms, but also a substantial amount of rain.\u201d NSW Health issued a warning on Sunday morning for smoke haze and dust from the blazes, with Sydney suffering poor air quality. The department\u2019s medical adviser, Dr Adi Vyas, said dust from dust storms in western NSW may affect western Sydney. Residents were told to minimise their exposure to the conditions outside. People with chronic respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and heart disease were told to follow medical plans. Even when air quality had improved, symptoms could persist for several days if dust and smoke had been inhaled. She added: \u201cOngoing heatwave conditions means that we all need to take extra care over the coming days.\u201d In the ACT, the threat from the Orroral Valley fire eased. The fire wasn\u2019t controlled yet, but authorities downgraded the threat to \u201cadvice\u201d level as they waited for forecast storms that could either help or hinder conditions.",

Youngsters (five and over) can make their ultimate side-kick in puppet form, while older children can try using wire armature to make movable characters with plasticine. If you\u2019re in Norwich at the beginning of the half-term, catch the city\u2019s new light festival (13-15 Feb) Love Light Norwich: a trail of light and fire artworks, installations and performances will celebrate the city, on a theme of love and belonging. \u2022 visitnorwich.co.uk MINIBREAK: The Bard, bugs and boats, Stratford-upon-Avon Theatre, grisly Tudor exhibits, a 16th-century schoolroom, creepy crawlies \u2013 Stratford has more than enough attractions to entertain kids for a few days \u2013 all within a short walk of each other. There are still tickets available for the RSC\u2019s much-lauded Boy in the Dress musical (until 8 March), based on the David Walliams story with songs by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers. All five historic Shakespeare family homes (Shakespeare\u2019s Birthplace, Shakespeare\u2019s New Place, Hall\u2019s Croft, Anne Hathaway\u2019s Cottage and Mary Arden\u2019s Farm, \u00a323/\u00a315 for a combined ticket) put on family-friendly events and activities throughout the year, while Shakespeare\u2019s Schoolroom (\u00a37.65/\u00a34.95) gives kids a taste of Tudor discipline, with a chance to take part in a lesson led by a \u201cmaster\u201d. Beyond the Bard, the Tudor World museum offers an insight into life in the 16th century (grisly, smelly, dangerous); the Mechanical Art &amp; Design museum (\u00a37.80/\u00a35.20) is a collection of wonderful moving sculptures and models; and the Butterfly Farm is home to 2,000 free-flying butterflies plus creatures that crawl, jump and slither. There are also boat trips on the river and, for older children, evening ghost walks (\u00a37/\u00a35). Stay at the recently refurbished YHA, in a Georgian mansion with family rooms (from \u00a339 midweek) and a restaurant. WEEK BREAK: Off-season hideout, Cornwall Embrace winter hibernation at a cosy cottage in picturesque Fowey. From Par railway station (which has direct links with Bristol, Paddington and Cardiff), there\u2019s an hourly bus into the town, which swarms in summer but should be calm in February. For beaches, you\u2019re close to Readymoney Cove, below St Catherine\u2019s Castle and rocky National Trust beach Lansallos. Catch the ferry to pretty hillside Polruan for cobbled charm. Du Maurier Reach (from \u00a3356 for seven nights in February, sleeping four) is a recently updated former fisherman\u2019s cottage with river views. EASTER HOLIDAY DAY TRIP: Saxons, crafts and stargazing, South Downs Five miles from Petersfield railway station (on the no 37 bus towards Waterlooville), Butser Ancient Farm (\u00a39/\u00a35) is an archaeology site and farm in the South Downs national park, Hampshire. Its reconstructions of buildings from the stone age, iron age and Roman Britain will transport you to another era. This Easter, families can see craft demonstrations, cooking and combat displays and try DIY archaeology experiments such as mini-mosaic making and wattling, as well as meeting newborn lambs. Stay into the evening on 17 April for stargazing (\u00a38/\u00a35), in this dark sky reserve. DAY TRIP: Ancient treasure and pop art, London Mark 100 years since the discovery of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb with a visit to the Saatchi Gallery, which is exhibiting in spectacular style more than 150 pieces from the famous site (including 60 which have never previously left Egypt). Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh (from \u00a324.50/\u00a316.50) is on until 3 May \u2013 it\u2019s Hollywood but it works, says the Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Jones. An interesting contrast (for teens rather than little ones) will be the Andy Warhol exhibition (\u00a322), which opens at Tate Modern on 12 March. As well as Marilyn Monroes and Campbell\u2019s soup cans, there will be more rarely seen work such as a selection of his portraits of drag queens and trans women. Over at Tate Britain, pop into Steve McQueen\u2019s epic Year 3 exhibition and see if your kids recognise any of their mates. MINIBREAK: Fairies and chocolate in York You might not see any fairies at Northwood Trail Fairy Sanctuary (\u00a38.90/\u00a36.90), but the magic in its woodland air is palpable. A half-hour bus ride (no 10) westwards from York (followed by a 20-minute walk from Stamford Bridge, or a taxi ride). Sunlight dances through the canopy, and dotted along the track are fairy homes, doors and bridges between the trees \u2013 along with a maze and William Morris-styled cafe. Central York, which has announced plans to go car-free by 2023, is compact enough to walk around. Of the big attractions, the Railway Museum (free entry) is the most soothing, and the Chocolate Story (\u00a312.95/\u00a310.50) will not disappoint. Stay at new aparthotel Roomzzz (family rooms from \u00a399). MINIBREAK: Sands and squirrels, Merseyside Spring is a good time to see Formby and Crosby without the crowds, and Merseyrail\u2019s frequent Northern Line (Southport branch) runs along the Sefton coast, which is home to the longest sand dune system in the UK and buzzes with wildlife. Spot red squirrels in National Trust-maintained woodland at Formby, along with 15 species of orchid and lizards. And from April you can head out on a boat for seal spotting with Wirral Sailing Centre (\u00a335/\u00a325 for a two-hour trip, over-8s only). On dry land, take a train to Liverpool South Parkway, followed by bus nos 80A, 86 or 500 to get off close to National Trust property Speke Hall (\u00a314/\u00a37), a superb Tudor house and estate on the banks of the Mersey with a maze and extensive trails and events throughout the year. Stay at YHA Liverpool Albert Dock (from \u00a339 for a family room sleeping four). WEEK BREAK: Oban and the Hebrides Reached by train from Glasgow Queen Street, Oban is a small port town on the west coast that seems eternally quaint despite its popularity. Here, you\u2019ll find seafood restaurants galore, curio shops and wide views out to neighbouring islands. Catch a Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service to the beautiful islands of Mull, Lismore, Colonsay, Barra and Tiree, keeping eyes peeled for porpoises, eagles and seals along the way. West Coast Cottages has properties in and around Oban, including self-catering apartment Argyll Mansions (from \u00a3680 a week, sleeps five). MAY HALF-TERM DAY TRIP: Dress as a Saxon, Bury St Edmunds Suffolk has so much more to offer than its beaches. At Bury St Edmunds, take a picnic to the Abbey Gardens, admiring the ruins of a monastery founded by King Canute 1,000 years ago. There\u2019s also space to run around along with a children\u2019s play area, a sensory garden, walks along the river and a wildlife feeding spot. Meanwhile, Horrible Histories enthusiasts will love Moyse\u2019s Hall Museum (\u00a312/\u00a36 for a year combined with West Stow country park, or day ticket \u00a35/\u00a33), which is packed with insights into local superstitions and witchcraft. Or take the no 355 bus to West Stow country park for heathlands, nature trails and an adventure playground. The park encompasses a recreated Anglo-Saxon village on one of England\u2019s important archaeological sites, and children can dress up in dark ages garb and meet the rare breed pigs and chickens. MINIBREAK: Sand dunes and wildlife, Rye Rye Harbour nature reserve is one of the most biodiverse places in Britain, with 4,200 plant and animal species. In March, the reserve celebrates its 50th anniversary with a new Discovery Centre in association with Sussex Wildlife Trust. There\u2019s a host of activities, a cafe and a gallery \u2013 all aimed at promoting a deeper connection with nature. It\u2019s a good area for family cycling, with local rides to the reserve and Winchelsea Beach. Camber Sands and its dunes are on the doorstep, as are the atmospheric towns of Rye (with a railway station linking it to Ashford, Hastings and Eastbourne), Winchelsea and Tenterden. Kip Hideways has a nautically themed apartment in the heart of Rye (from \u00a3100 a night, sleeping four) with a double bedroom tucked into the eaves and a second bedroom with curtained cabin beds. WEEK BREAK: New aquapark, Isle of Wight The Isle of Wight tourist board recently launched a slow travel guide to the island including bus, walking and cycle routes. Late spring is the perfect time to see the island come alive before its summer influx. And its first outdoor, floating aquapark at Tapnell Farm is due to open with floating obstacles as well as kayaking, paddleboarding and swimming. Elsewhere, Goodleaf tree climbing centre (from \u00a328, over-8s only) is a 25-minute walk from Ryde ferry dock (ferry crossing from Portsmouth or Southampton from about \u00a355 return). Old Mill Holiday Park near Bembridge in the east of the island has caravans and apartments from \u00a3300 for four nights. With a day in Portsmouth, catch the no 3 or 23 bus south-east to cool Southsea for the rock gardens, boating pond, cute model railway and hot chocolate and cream teas at the excellent Tenth Hole cafe. SUMMER HOLIDAY DAY TRIP: Tree climbing and tropical wildlife, Cheshire For thrillseekers, Bewilderwood adventure park (prices tbc) is opening in the grounds of Cholmondeley Castle in south Cheshire in spring. Most parents will feel tired just looking at the maze of woodland ziplines, rope bridges, slides, treehouses and aerial walks \u2013 all of which will no doubt fill youngsters with glee. Wind down with a trip to Chester Zoo (\u00a320/\u00a315), where the UK\u2019s largest tropical house, Monsoon Forest, will reopen this summer after a fire in 2018 and features an enhanced habitat for critically endangered Sumatran orangutans and threatened Indonesian hornbills. DAY TRIP: Wildlife watching, Gloucestershire Slimbridge wetland wildlife reserve (\u00a312/\u00a37), founded by Sir Peter Scott (son of Antarctic explorer Captain Scott) in 1946, is going through a mega refurbishment and has 12 new attractions planned for this opening year. At Easter, the open-air Living Wetland Theatre will open, offering film screenings and interactive live shows as birds fly overhead, while Mission Possible charts how Scott Junior brought the Hawaiian goose back from the edge of extinction. An accessible walkway overlooking the Severn estuary is due to be completed by summer, offering a wheelchair-friendly place from which to spot dragonflies, frogs, birds and butterflies. MINIBREAK: Beaches and books, Newcastle Opening in May, the \u00a310.55m Horden railway station will open up the Durham Heritage Coast, making it easier to travel between Newcastle, Middlesbrough, Sunderland, Durham, Whitby and Saltburn-by-the-Sea. With Newcastle as your base, take the train to Tynemouth for Riley\u2019s Fish Shack\u2019s sublime fish and chips on the beach. Quieter South Shields has striking sculptures by Juan Mu\u00f1oz, a free-to-enter reconstruction of a Roman fort and two lighthouses, the curious-looking Herd Groyne and \u2013 towards Whitburn \u2013 the Souter, which visitors can climb. Journey south past Sunderland to Seaham for sea glass beaches and rock pools. Back in Newcastle, if it\u2019s a rainy day budding authors should head to Seven Stories (\u00a37.70/\u00a36.60), with its new permanent exhibition about children\u2019s literature from ideas stage to fruition. Sleeperz in central Newcastle has family rooms from \u00a360 a night. MINIBREAK: Waterways, Birmingham The Canal and River Trust and the National Trust plan to open the refurbed Birmingham Roundhouse on 7 May as a base for exploring the city on foot or by bike and boat. On Wednesday evenings throughout the summer, Ackers Adventure offers canoe and kayak lessons (family of four \u00a375) on the Grand Union Canal. For a drier day, visit the Botanical Gardens (\u00a37.50/\u00a35.25), the wonderfully eccentric Pen Museum (\u00a36/\u00a32.50). Bed down at Selina, a converted Victorian factory with rooms from \u00a315-\u00a3100 a night including bunk rooms suitable for families. MINIBREAK: Surfing and Brunel, Bristol This year marks the 50th anniversary of the return of Brunel\u2019s SS Great Britain\u2019s (\u00a317/\u00a310) to the city after being recovered from the Falkland Islands, where it had been scuttled. Children will love the real sights and smells recreated on the Victorian cruise liner (including a very pongy toilet). Elsewhere, visit Bristol\u2019s docks, home to Wapping Wharf, a bevy of restaurants in shipping containers, or the Clifton Observatory\u2019s cafe and play park with views of the eponymous Grade I-listed suspension bridge. Inland surf lake, The Wave, which opened last autumn, offers lessons for all abilities. Easy day trips by bus include Portishead open air pool, Clevedon Marine Lake (and beautiful Victorian pier) and Weston-Super-Mare for the very cool Lambretta Scooter Museum. Stay in a converted airstream caravan at Brooks Guesthouse from \u00a399 (sleep two or two + two kids). WEEK BREAK: Marine fun, Guernsey Reached by ferries from Poole, Guernsey\u2019s clean, powdery beaches and rocky inlets do a good job of making you feel as if you\u2019re abroad. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war and the island\u2019s liberation from Nazi forces, so visitors can expect festivities from April to October. Take a puffin-spotting kayak trip from Shell Beach (\u00a340/\u00a315), heading to Puffin Bay and calling in at the sanctuary on Herm. Active sorts might enjoy coasteering on Sark, with its magical caves and cavern systems, including the famous Gouliot Caves. Or head to the recently renovated La Valette bathing pools on Guernsey\u2019s east coast. Camp at Fauxquets Valley campsite, where a pre-pitched compact safari tent costs from \u00a3130 a night for a family of two adults and two children (five-night minimum). WEEK BREAK: Dolphin spotting, Ceredigion Everyone seems to be repurposing shipping containers these days, but here\u2019s a novel idea. The Ty Cwch Boat House (cabins \u00a3120 a night) is made up of three separate sleeping cabins (each for up to four people), with two shared bathrooms, a kitchen/living space downstairs and a deck for barbecues, so it\u2019s perfect for a large family group or group of friends. Local instructors can be booked through the property for hiking, cycling, kayaking and surfing, and it\u2019s right next to beautiful, bijou Cwmtydu beach. This year, the Wales Coast Path launches more than 50 new self-guided walking itineraries including one in this area, from nearby New Quay (on the coastal T5 bus route) along the Ceredigion Coast Path. The coastline is spectacular, and out to sea you may see a dolphin or two \u2013 the area has the highest number of sightings in the UK. OCTOBER HALF-TERM DAY TRIP: Childhood nostalgia, Derbyshire The Museum of Making opens on 19 September on the site of Derby\u2019s grand Old Silk Mill, and will celebrate the area\u2019s history with workshops, activities and events and exhibits from the area\u2019s industrial past. Meanwhile, nearby Sudbury Hall\u2019s Museum of Childhood (11 minutes by train from Derby to Tutbury &amp; Hatton, then a 10-minute ride on the hourly no 401 bus) is a great way to explore childhood in times gone by: children can dress up as a chimney sweep or a Victorian school pupil. Previous exhibitions have included the heady subjects of computer games, sweets and chocolate (entry from \u00a312/\u00a36). MINIBREAK: Fossils and Lego, Somerset From Taunton, take the no 28 bus to Watchet and walk a couple of miles west to St Audries Bay \u2013 a geologist\u2019s dream where the Quantock Hills meet the Bristol Channel; its moody beach is vast and shadowed by rocks and waterfalls. Stay in a static caravan, lodge or cottage overlooking the waves with views across the Bristol Channel to Wales at Home Farm Holiday centre (from \u00a3350 a week), which has direct access to the beach and a heated indoor swimming pool for rainy days. From Watchet town, take the West Somerset Railway for views of the Quantocks, head to Kilve (on the no 23B bus to Taunton) to hunt for ammonites and stroll round the harbour, where children will love the quirky Lego/bric-a-brac shop. Ten miles east of Bridgwater, the RSPB\u2019s Ham Wall wetland reserve (free entry), with views to Glastonbury Tor, is a great place to see starling murmurations, water voles, otters and kingfishers. The reserve is also on several cycle routes. WEEK BREAK: Lakes and trains, Cumbria Wrap up warm for a bracing week exploring the Lake District and Cumbrian coastline after the summer crowds die down. The area is fairly easy to get around, on foot, by bus and by train \u2013 all with dreamy views. With the village of Coniston as your base, take a cruise on Coniston Water aboard the National Trust\u2019s Steam Yacht Gondola (\u00a323/\u00a311) or visit Hawkshead for the Beatrix Potter Gallery (\u00a37/\u00a33.50). A 40-mile recreational trail from Whitehaven to Millom called Connecting Cumbria\u2019s Hidden Coast is due to open in September. Or explore by rail: take a bus from Coniston to Windermere to pick up the train to Oxenholme for a scenic ride. If you have your own wheels, head west to Ravenglass to ride the steam railway to Muncaster Castle or Dalegarth and its Roman ruins. Coppermines has a selection of self-catering cottages in Coniston (from \u00a3120 a night). Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2020. An earlier version of the section on Cumbria had misspelled Muncaster Castle, and had wrongly said that the train from Oxenholme went over viaducts and causeways. These have now been corrected. The section headline, which mentioned caves, has also been changed because no caves are featured in the story.",

The real story, like most of the revealed truths in the book, comes to Anderson in fragments that he must stitch together. He learns that, having enlisted on impulse to fight in the second world war, Joseph found himself spectacularly unsuited to military life and became a persistent deserter. Unmoored from the familiar, he seems to have been doggedly determined to find his way back home. When he eventually did return to Derry, altered by his exile, his sullied reputation continued to define him. \u201cJoseph,\u201d writes Anderson, \u201ccame to haunt his own life.\u201d</p> <p>As the narrative shifts to the late 1960s and the onset of the Troubles, Anderson recounts how Joseph\u2019s widow, known locally as \u201cNeedles\u201d for her sharp tongue, held the family together as their house was raided continually by soldiers of the same army her husband had served in. In one instance, on the eve of her daughter\u2019s wedding, one of her sons, who had been chosen to be best man, was taken in for questioning. Mockingly, the soldiers danced around her holding her daughter\u2019s wedding dress.</p> <p>\u201cNeedles lost her temper,\u201d writes Anderson. \u201cShe pulled down the picture of her dead husband, in his British army uniform, and smashed it on the floor, saying she was ashamed of it now.

      "body": "<p>Pieter Hugo\u2019s new series, La Cucaracha (The Cockroach), named after a traditional song made popular during the Mexican revolution, grew out of a visit to the country in 2018. He was invited there by a curator whose stipulation was that he make work on the theme of sex and mortality.</p> <p>\u201cMexico\u2019s anarchic, visceral energy got under my skin and sucked me in,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThere is an acceptance that life has no glorious victory, no happy ending. Humour, ritual, a strong sense of community and an embrace of the inevitable make it possible to live with tragic and often unacceptable situations.\u201d</p> <p>Hugo\u2019s approach shifted accordingly to reflect the flamboyance and gritty ordinariness of life there, his images filled with vibrant colours and often mysterious symbolism.

      "bodyText": "Pieter Hugo\u2019s new series, La Cucaracha (The Cockroach), named after a traditional song made popular during the Mexican revolution, grew out of a visit to the country in 2018. He was invited there by a curator whose stipulation was that he make work on the theme of sex and mortality. \u201cMexico\u2019s anarchic, visceral energy got under my skin and sucked me in,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThere is an acceptance that life has no glorious victory, no happy ending. Humour, ritual, a strong sense of community and an embrace of the inevitable make it possible to live with tragic and often unacceptable situations.\u201d Hugo\u2019s approach shifted accordingly to reflect the flamboyance and gritty ordinariness of life there, his images filled with vibrant colours and often mysterious symbolism. This portrait is a case in point. Entitled The Wedding Gift, it shows a young bride in Juchit\u00e1n de Zaragoza cradling an iguana, a creature considered a symbol of patience, understanding and kindness in Mexico. Conversely, the elaborately competitive mating rituals performed by the male of the species \u2013 head-bobbing, nudging, biting and even changing colour \u2013 have been mimicked in local song and dance, including a famous traditional ballet, La Iguana de Guerrero.

The room is quiet, the table discreet. The national stage is not. Over at the Capitol, in the impeachment trial, Donald Trump is on his way to acquittal. In Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders is surging again. Some fear that in answer to Trump\u2019s march to the right, Democrats are sliding too far left. O\u2019Malley is among them.</p> \n<p>\u201cBernie\u2019s still being given a bit of a free pass by the national media,\u201d he says. \u201cI do not believe that he would be a strong candidate for our party in the fall.

He may be 78 but he\u2019s popular with the young. Since leaving office, O\u2019Malley has taught at Johns Hopkins, Georgetown, Boston College and Carnegie Mellon.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would frequently tell my students, \u2018Look, I know in my own generation we fell for the Nigerian prince scam, but how do you all fall for the Bernie Sanders scam?\u2019 I don\u2019t get that.</p> \n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s a guy who has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/19/bernie-sanders-gun-control-hillary-clinton-democratic-debate\">a kind of stalwart of the National Rifle Association</a>, a man who <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nidhiprakash/bernie-sanders-immigration-record\">said immigrants steal our jobs</a> right up until he ran for president, a guy who said the sound of <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ilanbenmeir/bernie-sanders-despised-democrats-in-1980s-said-a-jfk-speech\">John Kennedy\u2019s voice made him nauseous</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>In conversation, O\u2019Malley can seem to slip behind an invisible podium, rapping out his points with dramatic cadences, frowns and smiles. If there is an air of the stump speech, he\u2019s given thousands. He did so again in 2017 and 2018, touring the country, supporting Democrats in midterm elections which swung hard the party\u2019s way.</p> \n<p>Of course, much of the energy that delivered such victories was determinedly progressive, akin to or directly supportive of Sanders and his transformative effect on the liberal cause.

But O\u2019Malley\u2019s lyrical side is never far from the surface and the book is shot through with stories from his time as mayor and governor.</p> \n<p>Some such stories, he says, feature in another manuscript, written with the guidance of the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/05/the-front-runner-film-gary-hart-hugh-jackman\">Richard Ben Cramer, the author of What It Takes</a>, \u201cthe definitive book about the 1988 presidential race\u201d in which Hart flew so high then fell. Its title is Baltimore: A Memoir and <a href=\"https://letterstomaryland.tumblr.com/post/133943672750/thanksgiving-gratitude-memory\">a piece of it</a> is out there on the web. Some want O\u2019Malley to rewrite it, he says, to tie his own story more closely to the idea he was the model for the mayor of Charm City <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/05/aidan-gillen-shadow-dancer-interview\">played by Aidan Gill</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/05/aidan-gillen-shadow-dancer-interview\">en</a> in The Wire, David Simon\u2019s groundbreaking HBO series.

As the only person in America who hasn\u2019t seen The Wire I don\u2019t have one, so he describes instead an invitation over to Ireland to sit with Gillen at a celebration of the life and music of Shane McGowan.

      "bodyText": "Four years ago, in Iowa, Martin O\u2019Malley withdrew from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. To some, he\u2019d seemed made for the job. Born in 1963, to working-class Democrats in the Washington suburbs, he was schooled in the Kennedy way. He volunteered for Gary Hart, the Colorado senator who was the party frontrunner for 1988 until scandal brought him down. Entering elected politics himself, O\u2019Malley was the mayor of Baltimore from 1999 to 2007 and the governor of Maryland from 2008 to 2015. He aimed at the White House as a happy warrior, a guitar-playing politico with a record of progressive policy achievement. But in the primary, he says, he found himself caught \u201cbetween a rock\u201d, meaning Hillary Clinton, \u201cand an angry place\u201d, meaning Bernie Sanders. There wasn\u2019t room to breathe and his campaign went nowhere: the middle candidate in an election that ended up with America deeply divided. A few days before Iowa votes again, O\u2019Malley walks a few blocks from his Washington office. The room is quiet, the table discreet. The national stage is not. Over at the Capitol, in the impeachment trial, Donald Trump is on his way to acquittal. In Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders is surging again. Some fear that in answer to Trump\u2019s march to the right, Democrats are sliding too far left. O\u2019Malley is among them. \u201cBernie\u2019s still being given a bit of a free pass by the national media,\u201d he says. \u201cI do not believe that he would be a strong candidate for our party in the fall. And, except for three months out of every four years, he\u2019s not even of our party.\u201d Sanders sits in the Senate as an independent, a democratic socialist, the \u201cd\u201d very much lower-case. He may be 78 but he\u2019s popular with the young. Since leaving office, O\u2019Malley has taught at Johns Hopkins, Georgetown, Boston College and Carnegie Mellon. \u201cI would frequently tell my students, \u2018Look, I know in my own generation we fell for the Nigerian prince scam, but how do you all fall for the Bernie Sanders scam?\u2019 I don\u2019t get that. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy who has been a kind of stalwart of the National Rifle Association, a man who said immigrants steal our jobs right up until he ran for president, a guy who said the sound of John Kennedy\u2019s voice made him nauseous.\u201d In conversation, O\u2019Malley can seem to slip behind an invisible podium, rapping out his points with dramatic cadences, frowns and smiles. If there is an air of the stump speech, he\u2019s given thousands. He did so again in 2017 and 2018, touring the country, supporting Democrats in midterm elections which swung hard the party\u2019s way. Of course, much of the energy that delivered such victories was determinedly progressive, akin to or directly supportive of Sanders and his transformative effect on the liberal cause. But O\u2019Malley is as much a pillar of the party as Sanders is not. \u201cI respect the fact that he\u2019s been saying the same things, mostly, since 1952, albeit dialing down his hatred for John Kennedy and his disdain for immigrants, but I just don\u2019t get the appeal. \u201cHe\u2019s a man who never has accomplished anything in public office, who has I believe demonstrated his inability to forge a governing consensus, let alone hold a governing consensus. And I think he\u2019d be an awful choice as our party\u2019s nominee.\u201d He smiles. \u201cDo you want me to speak more frankly?\u201d O\u2019Malley has irons in many fires, teaching, consulting, campaigning. He\u2019s written a book, Smarter Government: How to Govern for Results in the Information Age. It\u2019s a textbook, built on a use of data in government well known among policy geeks. But O\u2019Malley\u2019s lyrical side is never far from the surface and the book is shot through with stories from his time as mayor and governor. Some such stories, he says, feature in another manuscript, written with the guidance of the late Richard Ben Cramer, the author of What It Takes, \u201cthe definitive book about the 1988 presidential race\u201d in which Hart flew so high then fell. Its title is Baltimore: A Memoir and a piece of it is out there on the web. Some want O\u2019Malley to rewrite it, he says, to tie his own story more closely to the idea he was the model for the mayor of Charm City played by Aidan Gillen in The Wire, David Simon\u2019s groundbreaking HBO series. He\u2019s not keen. \u201cEveryone gets one Wire question,\u201d he says, laughing a little ruefully. As the only person in America who hasn\u2019t seen The Wire I don\u2019t have one, so he describes instead an invitation over to Ireland to sit with Gillen at a celebration of the life and music of Shane McGowan. O\u2019Malley still plays in his own eponymous band. He says he wrote his textbook \u201cbecause democracy\u2019s in a crisis and the crisis is democracy itself. Whether governments of and by the people can still deliver the things that make a republic worth having, in essence lives with greater safety, security and opportunity for ourselves and our kids. That\u2019s the question on the table. \u201cAnd set against the declining trust that Americans express in their national government is a quieter story that\u2019s rising across the country, from cities that are well-governed. And that\u2019s a story of rising trust, of smarter government, of taking advantage of the tools that no prior generation has had, to model, measure and map changing human dynamics in ways that allow us to make better and more timely decisions. \u201cWhether those better results are improving student achievement or reducing violent crime or turning around a 300-year decline in the health of the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, I consider myself to have been very fortunate and blessed to have served at a time when this new way of governing was just emerging.\u201d Such focus seems timely: with the federal government in Trump\u2019s sclerotic grip, cities in particular have begun to take a lead. On climate change, for example, some US mayors have reacted to Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris deal by saying they will simply pursue its aims themselves. That showed one way Trumpism might be challenged, away from the polls and the corridors of power. It is also challenged on the streets of the cities themselves. On the night before Thanksgiving, O\u2019Malley went as he does every year to the Dubliner, a Capitol Hill pub, with other graduates of Gonzaga, a Washington Jesuit high school. Then another member of an 80s class walked in: Ken Cuccinelli, formerly attorney general of Virginia, now the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services for the hardline president. The Gonzaga gathering, O\u2019Malley says, is a friendly one, a chance for the old boys \u201cto ask, \u2018Hey, how are you doing? How\u2019s your wife? How\u2019s your kids? What are you up to?\u2019 \u201cAnd into the bar walked Donald Trump\u2019s child-taker in chief.\u201d That is a reference to the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policies at the southern border, of which O\u2019Malley has been a vocal opponent. Cuccinelli was soon walking back out of the Dubliner, driven back on to Massachusetts Avenue by a blast of Baltimorean anger. \u201cWe recognized each other from the Sunday shows and having served together. We shook hands \u2026 but it was not a moment for me to simply say, \u2018Hey, how\u2019s work?\u2019 I know how work is with him. \u201cWork with him is really bad for a lot of human beings because he shoves those cages on the south-west border full with as many brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking, mostly Catholic people as he possibly can. \u201cI told him he was a coward and he put the little kids in cages. And when he tried to get a drink at the bar, other people started telling him the same thing. So after the patrons drove him from the place, someone at the bar decided to tweet it out and then it went kind of viral.\u201d The Washington Post picked up the story and for a while it fuelled debate around such public confrontations: do opponents of the Trump administration owe it a debt of civility? \u201cEach of us has to make our own decision in these unprecedented times,\u201d O\u2019Malley says, \u201cabout whether we want to be silent in the face of suffering being inflicted on other people at the hands of our government, or whether we stand up to it. \u201cAnd some of us will stand up to it by running as candidates, others will stand up to it as elected officials, others will stand up to it as lawyers, others will stand up to it in social settings. And for me at that moment in time, I couldn\u2019t look myself in the mirror in the morning if I missed the opportunity to let him know that he wasn\u2019t welcome. And so I did. \u201cThe day we become passive in the face of that sort of immorality, injustice, that sort of systemic child abuse exercise by our own government, that\u2019s the day we lose our republic.\u201d Cuccinelli, needless to say, saw the evening differently. But viral fame recedes quickly and O\u2019Malley is back in milder climes, publishing op-eds in the Post, concerned with the push against Trump at the polls. After 2016, he considered running for chair of the Democratic National Committee but stepped back when he sensed a \u201ca proxy echo of the Sanders-Clinton clash and there wasn\u2019t oxygen there\u201d. Tom Perez, once the Maryland secretary of labor, ended up in the role but O\u2019Malley supported a young mayor from the Republican heartlands: Pete Buttigieg, now a challenger in the presidential primary. For Buttigieg, O\u2019Malley says, \u201cthat race really wasn\u2019t about DNC. That race was about putting on the sneakers and getting around the track\u201d. The younger man, he says, has gone on to beat all expectations. But in an echo of the frustrations of 2016, O\u2019Malley criticises the way the DNC has run the primary, particularly the way debate qualifications based on polling data and donor numbers \u2013 changed this week \u2013 have kept the likes of the former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick (\u201ca friend\u201d to whom O\u2019Malley has donated) and the Montana governor Steve Bullock firmly out of the spotlight. O\u2019Malley isn\u2019t ready to endorse again \u2013 he first backed Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 but he expresses a wish to \u201chear more from\u201d Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor whose self-funded campaign has kept him off the debate stage too. He thinks that wish is shared by others. \u201cI would think Bloomberg\u2019s opening,\u201d he says, \u201cis if there\u2019s a muddled finish [in Iowa and New Hampshire] or an unelectable leftist.

Our relationship with the trade unions is clandestine and needs a complete rewiring to reflect the modern world of work. Labour\u2019s structures and campaign machine are hopelessly outdated and incompetent. The organisation needs a radical overhaul. After a lost decade, we must be brutally honest about why we failed, and unflinching in charting where we go next. If we fail in this, the last Labour government will be just that \u2013 the last Labour government. Margaret Hodge is the Labour MP for Barking",

With products that treat dark spots, etc, you need sunscreen to protect the skin otherwise you\u2019ll be going round in circles. The second question I ask is: what product are you using? You need something with a clever formula and this Dr Dennis Gross offering is one of the best \u2013 and fastest acting \u2013 products I have come across in a long while. It is formulated with i-ascorbic acid (essentially vitamin C in its pure form), lactic acid, kojic acid and liquorice extract, which are all very powerful for battling hyperpigmentation and uneven spots. This serum also brightens, reduces the look of fine lines and wrinkles, and softens. I noticed changes to my overall skin texture overnight and the more you use it, the better the results. (If your pigmentation issues are pronounced, I would recommend seeing a good aesthetician every couple of months in conjunction with using this product.) Now for some caveats. The texture is a little sticky, but it doesn\u2019t stay that way. The scent, like any great vitamin C product, is reminiscent of hot dog water. It\u2019s pricey but a worthy investment because it works. And quickly.

The prime minister confirmed the departure of the besieged deputy leader of the Nationals late on Sunday after receiving advice from his departmental head and former chief of staff, Phil Gaetjens, and after a meeting with the governance committee of cabinet. Sunday\u2019s news follows weeks of bad press about the community sports infrastructure program, sparked by a scathing auditor general\u2019s report that found the program conducted under McKenzie, the former sport minister, skewed the grants towards marginal seats.

Morrison declined to release the Gaetjens advice, which contains a significantly different interpretation of McKenzie\u2019s administration of the sports grants program, and whether the grants were made with proper legal authority, than the interpretation of the auditor general.

Martin O'Malley on the Democrats and Iowa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But why are we so divided? We\u2019re not fighting a hugely unpopular war on the scale of Vietnam. We\u2019re not in a deep economic crisis like the Great Depression. Yes, we disagree about guns, gays, abortion and immigration, but we\u2019ve disagreed about them for decades. Why are we so divided <em>now?</em></p> <p>Part of the answer is Trump himself. The Great Divider knows how to pit native-born Americans against immigrants, the working class against the poor, whites against blacks and Latinos, evangelicals against secularists, keeping almost everyone stirred up by vilifying, disparaging, denouncing, defaming and accusing others of the worst. Trump thrives off disruption and division.</p> <p>But that begs the question of why we have been so ready to be divided by Trump. The answer derives in large part from what has happened to wealth and power.</p> <p>In the fall of 2015, I visited Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Missouri and North Carolina, for a research project on the changing nature of work. I spoke with many of the people I had met 20 years before when I was secretary of labor, as well as with some of their grown children.</p> <p>What I heard surprised me. Twenty years before, many said they\u2019d been working hard and were frustrated they weren\u2019t doing better. Now they were angry \u2013 angry at their employers, the government, Wall Street.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Something very big happened, and it wasn\u2019t due to Sanders\u2019 magnetism or Trump\u2019s likability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many had lost jobs, savings or homes in the Great Recession following the financial crisis of 2008, or knew others who had. Most were back in jobs but the jobs paid no more than they had two decades before, in terms of purchasing power.</p> <p>I heard the term \u201crigged system\u201d so often I began asking people what they meant. They spoke about flat wages, shrinking benefits, growing job insecurity. They talked about the bailout of Wall Street, political payoffs, insider deals, soaring CEO pay, and \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d.</p> <p>These complaints came from people who identified themselves as Republicans, Democrats and independents. A few had joined the Tea Party. A few had briefly been involved in the Occupy movement.</p> <h2>The 2016 rebellion is ongoing</h2> <p>With the 2016 political primaries looming, I asked which candidates they found most attractive. At the time, the leaders of the Democratic party favored Hillary Clinton and Republican leaders favored Jeb Bush. Yet no one I spoke with mentioned Clinton or Bush.</p> <p>They talked instead about Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. When I asked why, they said Sanders or Trump would \u201cshake things up\u201d or \u201cmake the system work again\u201d or \u201cstop the corruption\u201d or \u201cend the rigging\u201d.</p> <p>In the following year, Sanders \u2013 a 74-year-old Jew from Vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist and wasn\u2019t even a Democrat until the primaries \u2013 came within a whisker of beating Clinton in Iowa, routed her in New Hampshire, and ended up with 46% of the pledged delegates from Democratic primaries and caucuses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"195d0105c704812387e4a9ef5db2f0fa9fc44c42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/195d0105c704812387e4a9ef5db2f0fa9fc44c42/0_0_4871_3248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders speaks in Perry, Iowa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders speaks in Perry, Iowa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump \u2013 a 69-year-old egomaniacal billionaire reality-TV star who had never held elective office or had anything to do with the Republican party and who lied compulsively about everything \u2013 won the primaries and went on to beat Clinton, one of the most experienced and well-connected politicians in modern America (although he didn\u2019t win the popular vote, and had some help from the Kremlin).</p> <p>Something very big had happened, and it wasn\u2019t due to Sanders\u2019 magnetism or Trump\u2019s likability. It was a rebellion against the establishment. That rebellion is still going on, although much of the establishment still denies it. They prefer to attribute Trump\u2019s rise solely to racism.</p> <p>Racism did play a part. But to understand why racism had such a strong impact in 2016, especially on the voting of whites without college degrees, it\u2019s important to see what drove it. After all, racism in America dates back long before the founding of the Republic, and even modern American politicians have had few compunctions about using racism to boost their standing.</p> <p>What gave Trump\u2019s racism \u2013 as well as his hateful xenophobia, misogyny and jingoism \u2013 particular virulence was his capacity to channel the intensifying anger of the white working class into it. It is hardly the first time in history that a demagogue has used scapegoats to deflect public attention from the real causes of distress.</p> <h2>Democrats did nothing to change a rigged system</h2> <p>Aided by Fox News and an army of rightwing outlets, Trump convinced many blue-collar workers feeling ignored by Washington that he was their champion. Clinton did not convince them that she was. Her decades of public service ended up being a negative, not a positive. She was indubitably part of the establishment, the epitome of decades of policies that left these blue-collar workers in the dust. (It\u2019s notable that during the primaries, Sanders did far better than Clinton with blue-collar voters.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump galvanized millions of blue-collar voters in communities that faced a tidal wave of factory closings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump galvanized millions of blue-collar voters living in communities that never recovered from the tidal wave of factory closings. He promised to bring back jobs, revive manufacturing and get tough on trade and immigration.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said at one rally. \u201cIn five, 10 years from now, you\u2019re going to have a workers\u2019 party. A party of people that haven\u2019t had a real wage increase in 18 years, that are angry.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking at a factory in Pennsylvania in June 2016, he decried politicians and financiers who had betrayed Americans by \u201ctaking away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families\u201d.</p> <p>Democrats had occupied the White House for 16 of the 24 years before Trump\u2019s election, and in that time scored some important victories for working families: the Affordable Care Act, an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit and the Family and Medical Leave Act, for example. I take pride in being part of a Democratic administration during that time.</p> <p>But Democrats did nothing to change the vicious cycle of wealth and power that had rigged the economy for the benefit of those at the top and undermined the working class. As Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg concluded after the 2016 election, \u201cDemocrats don\u2019t have a \u2018white working-class\u2019 problem. They have a \u2018working class problem\u2019 which progressives have been reluctant to address honestly or boldly.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that Democrats have lost support with <em>all </em>working-class voters across the electorate.\u201d</p> <h2>Clinton and Obama chose not to wrest power back from the oligarchy. Why?</h2> <p>In the first two years of the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations, Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. Yet both Clinton and Obama advocated free trade agreements without providing millions of blue-collar workers who consequently lost their jobs any means of getting new ones that paid at least as well. Clinton pushed for Nafta and for China joining the World Trade Organization, and Obama sought to restore the \u201cconfidence\u201d of Wall Street instead of completely overhauling the banking system.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"691e246bd4ead03c4168667decf88773ffb01298\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/691e246bd4ead03c4168667decf88773ffb01298/0_44_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill and Hillary campaign in Nashua, New Hampshire in 1992.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill and Hillary Clinton campaign in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia Johnson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both stood by as corporations hammered trade unions, the backbone of the white working class. They failed to reform labor laws to allow workers to form unions with a simple up-or-down majority vote, or even to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violated labor protections. Clinton deregulated Wall Street before the crash; Obama allowed the Street to water down attempts to re-regulate it after the crash. Obama protected Wall Street from the consequences of its gambling addiction through a giant taxpayer-funded bailout, but allowed millions of underwater homeowners to drown.</p> <p>Both Clinton and Obama turned their backs on campaign finance reform. In 2008, Obama was the first presidential nominee since Richard Nixon to reject public financing in his primary and general election campaigns, and he never followed up on his re-election promise to pursue a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United vs FEC<em>,</em> the 2010 supreme court opinion opening wider the floodgates to big money in politics.</p> <p>Although Clinton and Obama faced increasingly hostile Republican congresses, they could have rallied the working class and built a coalition to grab back power from the emerging oligarchy. Yet they chose not to. Why?</p> <h2>There is no longer a left or right. There is no longer a moderate \u2018center\u2019</h2> <p>My answer is not just hypothetical, because I directly witnessed much of it: it was because Clinton, Obama and many congressional Democrats sought the votes of the \u201csuburban swing voter\u201d \u2013 so-called \u201csoccer moms\u201d in the 1990s and affluent politically independent professionals in the 2000s \u2013 who supposedly determine electoral outcomes, and turned their backs on the working class. They also drank from the same campaign funding trough as the Republicans \u2013 big corporations, Wall Street and the very wealthy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/31/bernie-sanders-democrats-poll-standing-iowa-moderates\">Sanders faces mounting attacks from anxious moderates as Iowa vote nears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A direct line connects the four-decade stagnation of wages with the bailout of Wall Street, the rise of the Tea Party (and, briefly, Occupy), and the successes of Sanders and Trump in 2016. As Eduardo Porter of the New York Times notes, since 2000 Republican presidential candidates have steadily gained strength in America\u2019s poorer counties while Democrats have lost ground. In 2016, Trump won 58% of the vote in the counties with the poorest 10% of the population.

      "bodyText": "An impeached president who is up for re-election will this week deliver a State of the Union address to the most divided union in living memory. But why are we so divided? We\u2019re not fighting a hugely unpopular war on the scale of Vietnam. We\u2019re not in a deep economic crisis like the Great Depression. Yes, we disagree about guns, gays, abortion and immigration, but we\u2019ve disagreed about them for decades. Why are we so divided now? Part of the answer is Trump himself. The Great Divider knows how to pit native-born Americans against immigrants, the working class against the poor, whites against blacks and Latinos, evangelicals against secularists, keeping almost everyone stirred up by vilifying, disparaging, denouncing, defaming and accusing others of the worst. Trump thrives off disruption and division. But that begs the question of why we have been so ready to be divided by Trump. The answer derives in large part from what has happened to wealth and power. In the fall of 2015, I visited Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Missouri and North Carolina, for a research project on the changing nature of work. I spoke with many of the people I had met 20 years before when I was secretary of labor, as well as with some of their grown children. What I heard surprised me. Twenty years before, many said they\u2019d been working hard and were frustrated they weren\u2019t doing better. Now they were angry \u2013 angry at their employers, the government, Wall Street. Many had lost jobs, savings or homes in the Great Recession following the financial crisis of 2008, or knew others who had. Most were back in jobs but the jobs paid no more than they had two decades before, in terms of purchasing power. I heard the term \u201crigged system\u201d so often I began asking people what they meant. They spoke about flat wages, shrinking benefits, growing job insecurity. They talked about the bailout of Wall Street, political payoffs, insider deals, soaring CEO pay, and \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d. These complaints came from people who identified themselves as Republicans, Democrats and independents. A few had joined the Tea Party. A few had briefly been involved in the Occupy movement. The 2016 rebellion is ongoing With the 2016 political primaries looming, I asked which candidates they found most attractive. At the time, the leaders of the Democratic party favored Hillary Clinton and Republican leaders favored Jeb Bush. Yet no one I spoke with mentioned Clinton or Bush. They talked instead about Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. When I asked why, they said Sanders or Trump would \u201cshake things up\u201d or \u201cmake the system work again\u201d or \u201cstop the corruption\u201d or \u201cend the rigging\u201d. In the following year, Sanders \u2013 a 74-year-old Jew from Vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist and wasn\u2019t even a Democrat until the primaries \u2013 came within a whisker of beating Clinton in Iowa, routed her in New Hampshire, and ended up with 46% of the pledged delegates from Democratic primaries and caucuses. Trump \u2013 a 69-year-old egomaniacal billionaire reality-TV star who had never held elective office or had anything to do with the Republican party and who lied compulsively about everything \u2013 won the primaries and went on to beat Clinton, one of the most experienced and well-connected politicians in modern America (although he didn\u2019t win the popular vote, and had some help from the Kremlin). Something very big had happened, and it wasn\u2019t due to Sanders\u2019 magnetism or Trump\u2019s likability. It was a rebellion against the establishment. That rebellion is still going on, although much of the establishment still denies it. They prefer to attribute Trump\u2019s rise solely to racism. Racism did play a part. But to understand why racism had such a strong impact in 2016, especially on the voting of whites without college degrees, it\u2019s important to see what drove it. After all, racism in America dates back long before the founding of the Republic, and even modern American politicians have had few compunctions about using racism to boost their standing. What gave Trump\u2019s racism \u2013 as well as his hateful xenophobia, misogyny and jingoism \u2013 particular virulence was his capacity to channel the intensifying anger of the white working class into it. It is hardly the first time in history that a demagogue has used scapegoats to deflect public attention from the real causes of distress. Democrats did nothing to change a rigged system Aided by Fox News and an army of rightwing outlets, Trump convinced many blue-collar workers feeling ignored by Washington that he was their champion. Clinton did not convince them that she was. Her decades of public service ended up being a negative, not a positive. She was indubitably part of the establishment, the epitome of decades of policies that left these blue-collar workers in the dust. (It\u2019s notable that during the primaries, Sanders did far better than Clinton with blue-collar voters.) Trump galvanized millions of blue-collar voters living in communities that never recovered from the tidal wave of factory closings. He promised to bring back jobs, revive manufacturing and get tough on trade and immigration. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said at one rally. \u201cIn five, 10 years from now, you\u2019re going to have a workers\u2019 party. A party of people that haven\u2019t had a real wage increase in 18 years, that are angry.\u201d Speaking at a factory in Pennsylvania in June 2016, he decried politicians and financiers who had betrayed Americans by \u201ctaking away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families\u201d. Democrats had occupied the White House for 16 of the 24 years before Trump\u2019s election, and in that time scored some important victories for working families: the Affordable Care Act, an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit and the Family and Medical Leave Act, for example. I take pride in being part of a Democratic administration during that time. But Democrats did nothing to change the vicious cycle of wealth and power that had rigged the economy for the benefit of those at the top and undermined the working class. As Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg concluded after the 2016 election, \u201cDemocrats don\u2019t have a \u2018white working-class\u2019 problem. They have a \u2018working class problem\u2019 which progressives have been reluctant to address honestly or boldly. \u201cThe fact is that Democrats have lost support with all working-class voters across the electorate.\u201d Clinton and Obama chose not to wrest power back from the oligarchy. Why? In the first two years of the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations, Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. Yet both Clinton and Obama advocated free trade agreements without providing millions of blue-collar workers who consequently lost their jobs any means of getting new ones that paid at least as well. Clinton pushed for Nafta and for China joining the World Trade Organization, and Obama sought to restore the \u201cconfidence\u201d of Wall Street instead of completely overhauling the banking system. Both stood by as corporations hammered trade unions, the backbone of the white working class. They failed to reform labor laws to allow workers to form unions with a simple up-or-down majority vote, or even to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violated labor protections. Clinton deregulated Wall Street before the crash; Obama allowed the Street to water down attempts to re-regulate it after the crash. Obama protected Wall Street from the consequences of its gambling addiction through a giant taxpayer-funded bailout, but allowed millions of underwater homeowners to drown. Both Clinton and Obama turned their backs on campaign finance reform. In 2008, Obama was the first presidential nominee since Richard Nixon to reject public financing in his primary and general election campaigns, and he never followed up on his re-election promise to pursue a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United vs FEC, the 2010 supreme court opinion opening wider the floodgates to big money in politics. Although Clinton and Obama faced increasingly hostile Republican congresses, they could have rallied the working class and built a coalition to grab back power from the emerging oligarchy. Yet they chose not to. Why? There is no longer a left or right. There is no longer a moderate \u2018center\u2019 My answer is not just hypothetical, because I directly witnessed much of it: it was because Clinton, Obama and many congressional Democrats sought the votes of the \u201csuburban swing voter\u201d \u2013 so-called \u201csoccer moms\u201d in the 1990s and affluent politically independent professionals in the 2000s \u2013 who supposedly determine electoral outcomes, and turned their backs on the working class. They also drank from the same campaign funding trough as the Republicans \u2013 big corporations, Wall Street and the very wealthy. A direct line connects the four-decade stagnation of wages with the bailout of Wall Street, the rise of the Tea Party (and, briefly, Occupy), and the successes of Sanders and Trump in 2016. As Eduardo Porter of the New York Times notes, since 2000 Republican presidential candidates have steadily gained strength in America\u2019s poorer counties while Democrats have lost ground. In 2016, Trump won 58% of the vote in the counties with the poorest 10% of the population. His share was 31% in the richest. By 2016, Americans understood full well that wealth and power had moved to the top. Big money had rigged our politics. This was the premise of Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign. It was also central to Trump\u2019s appeal \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m so rich I can\u2019t be bought off\u201d \u2013 although once elected he delivered everything big money wanted. The most powerful force in American politics today continues to be anti-establishment fury at a rigged system. There is no longer a left or right. There\u2019s no longer a moderate \u201ccenter\u201d. There\u2019s either Trump\u2019s authoritarian populism or democratic \u2013 small \u201cd\u201d \u2013 populism. Democrats cannot defeat authoritarian populism without an agenda of radical democratic reform, an anti-establishment movement. Trump has harnessed the frustrations of at least 40% of America. Although he\u2019s been a Trojan horse for big corporations and the rich, giving them all they\u2019ve wanted in tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks, the working class continues to believe he\u2019s on their side.

We ask to weigh one in our hand. It\u2019s the real thing: a solid piece of brass designed for rupturing skin and fracturing bone in a moment of ultra-violence. It\u2019s a nasty weapon repurposed as an oh-so-witty fashion accessory. I suggest you consider that a symbol for everything that\u2019s wrong about this unappealing, ill-conceived and graspingly overpriced catering operation.</p> <p>It\u2019s a head-scratcher. The Yard may well be the worst new restaurant from a critically acclaimed chef I have ever reviewed. Robin Gill has been widely praised for the good-value, boisterous cooking at the <a href=\"knuckle duster\" title=\"\">Dairy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sorellarestaurant.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sorella</a> in Clapham and for <a href=\"https://www.darbys-london.com/\" title=\"\">Darby\u2019s</a>, a New York-inspired oyster and steak place close to the new American Embassy.

And now his name is all over this demonstration of the misguided in three courses. Then again, the restaurant is only described as being under his \u201cguidance\u201d. Perhaps it\u2019s just some consultancy job; an irresistible shake of the big fat money tree, which meant he didn\u2019t argue when someone suggested he charge \u00a326 for a dreary plate of fried dough and cauliflower. We\u2019ll come back to that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3e115a502b67a5623f5cb9e2e2aa99289b2daa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3e115a502b67a5623f5cb9e2e2aa99289b2daa0/365_198_4930_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Doughy fried gnocchi like dental swabs come with roasted cauliflower florets, \u00a326\u2019: gnocchi with cauliflower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Doughy fried gnocchi like dental swabs come with roasted cauliflower florets, \u00a326\u2019: gnocchi with cauliflower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the name implies, the Great Scotland Yard Hotel by Hyatt occupies the building that was once the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police. Foul crimes were investigated here. Suspects implicated in appalling murders were detained here. A nod to that makes sense, but they\u2019ve gone all in. I find the glass case in the foyer with an antique police truncheon disconcerting; likewise, the poor waiters\u2019 <em>Peaky Blinders</em>-vintage utility-wear \u201ccostumes\u201d. You can spot who the most senior staff are. Their trousers are allowed to reach their shoes; the others have to wear them rolled above the ankle.</p> <p>More troubling is the display of paintings and sculpture by current UK prison inmates, purchased from the charity <a href=\"https://www.koestlerarts.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Koestler Arts</a>, which helps people in the criminal justice system change their lives through art. Rehabilitation through art is obviously laudable. So is the sale of that often-harrowing work. But context is everything. Here they sit, these expressions of isolation, of broken families, emotional trauma and dismal consequence, bang outside the door to a restaurant charging \u00a315 for starters and \u00a330 for mains; where wines start at \u00a338 a bottle. Here, the art doesn\u2019t feel transformative. It feels exploitative. Oh look! How profound. How moving. Now let\u2019s go spaff \u00a375 a head on dinner. Not that I was aware of the cost because unusually, at opening, they hadn\u2019t posted the menu online, perhaps because the pricing is so at odds with everything else Gill has done. Most of the dishes at the Dairy are roughly half the price of those here.</p> <p>As ever, the money could be justified if it was all \u201cpraise be\u201d and \u201challelujah\u201d, and there are a couple of dishes that get the nod. There\u2019s a very jolly long-cooked pork jowl, pan-burnished, sticky-glazed and laid under a crisp crumb; a louche version of a Japanese tonkatsu breaded pork cutlet. It\u2019s \u00a328. There\u2019s a clever chocolate mousse in a crisp pastry shell and a lemon custard tart with sticks of meringue and mascarpone ice-cream. Both feel like consolation prizes. Both are \u00a39.50.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d42f0e8fc8ff55c670b9ca56ecc4040da4a6783a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d42f0e8fc8ff55c670b9ca56ecc4040da4a6783a/55_317_5404_3242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Cloyingly sweet\u2019: cavatelli with pumpkin sauce and amaretto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Cloyingly sweet\u2019: cavatelli with pumpkin sauce and amaretto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other things make us joke that the building where crimes were once investigated, is now where they are being committed. Too often the kitchen tries to declare victory through the application of dairy fats. To start we are given a cup of a ludicrously creamy Jerusalem artichoke soup, which they\u2019ve attempted to make interesting via the tiresome punch of truffle oil. It reminds me of the savoury \u201ccappuccinos\u201d that were served in fancy Mayfair restaurants back at the turn of the millennium, and not in a fond way. A sea bass ceviche should be about acidity and sprightliness. Here the thinly sliced fish wallows in a pond of creamy sauce. There is none of the advertised wasabi hit, no citrus punch.</p> <p>Most infuriating is a \u00a314 bowl of curling cavatelli pasta, on a cloyingly sweet pumpkin sauce with amaretto and underpickled Thai shallots that are more sugar than acid. It\u2019s 2020 and the vegetarian option is: a bowl of bloody pasta. Gill is better than this. Meanwhile, the cream-ballasted sauce around a well-made beef short rib raviolo leaves us reeling from buttery overkill.</p> <p>It\u2019s the vegetarian main that has me eyeing the knuckle-dusters; don\u2019t blame me, I\u2019m not the one who put weapons in the dining room. It\u2019s a plate of doughy fried gnocchi like those dental swabs inserted between teeth and gum. They come with roasted cauliflower florets, leaves which are less bitter than we\u2019re quickly becoming, and that \u00a326 price tag. It tastes of laziness and gross profit margin. The main courses top out at \u00a330, for two small pieces of monkfish with XO sauce, a condiment that makes me think lunch up the road in Chinatown would be delightful right now. The desserts include a deconstructed tarte tatin. The point of a tarte tatin is the sticky, caramelised edges to the buttery pastry from the roasted apples and sugar. If you serve the pastry separately, it\u2019s just a disc of dry pastry, however clever the undulations you\u2019ve achieved. Stop it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20309a87056637df60bb013a02b4e13c9736d5df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20309a87056637df60bb013a02b4e13c9736d5df/286_476_4516_2709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If you serve the pastry separately, it\u2019s just a disc of dry pastry\u2019: tarte tatin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you serve the pastry separately, it\u2019s just a disc of dry pastry\u2019: tarte tatin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bill for three arrives. It\u2019s an asphyxiating \u00a3288. I squint at it. They appear to have charged me \u00a375 for a \u00a339 bottle of white Burgundy. I question this. The mistake, it seems, is all mine. When I pointed at the \u00a339 price tag and said \u201cI\u2019ll have a bottle of that\u201d I didn\u2019t clock that \u00a339 was actually for a half-bottle carafe, because I am simple and do not understand the cost of things. Equally, they didn\u2019t point out my error. I say fine, I\u2019ll pay, but they insist on charging me only \u00a339 because of the \u201cconfusion\u201d. Obviously, this has nothing to do with who I am. The bill returns and, because this is a hotel restaurant, as well as adding a 12.5% service charge of \u00a327.50, they have left open a space for an extra tip. I decline to pay more \u2013 \u00a382.50 each is already taking the piss and my bladder is completely empty. Would somebody mind calling the emergency services?</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>For a more successful take on the hotel restaurant, try chef Tristan Welch\u2019s British brasserie at the Parker\u2019s Tavern, inside the University Arms, Cambridge.

      "bodyText": "The Yard by Robin Gill, 3-5 Great Scotland Yard, London SW1A 2HN (020 7925 4749). Starters \u00a314-\u00a316, mains \u00a326-\u00a330, desserts \u00a39.50, wines from \u00a338 Dangling on a chain from the waitress\u2019s outfits at the Yard by Robin Gill, the restaurant tucked inside the new Great Scotland Yard Hotel just off London\u2019s Whitehall, is a knuckle-duster. We ask to weigh one in our hand. It\u2019s the real thing: a solid piece of brass designed for rupturing skin and fracturing bone in a moment of ultra-violence. It\u2019s a nasty weapon repurposed as an oh-so-witty fashion accessory. I suggest you consider that a symbol for everything that\u2019s wrong about this unappealing, ill-conceived and graspingly overpriced catering operation. It\u2019s a head-scratcher. The Yard may well be the worst new restaurant from a critically acclaimed chef I have ever reviewed. Robin Gill has been widely praised for the good-value, boisterous cooking at the Dairy and Sorella in Clapham and for Darby\u2019s, a New York-inspired oyster and steak place close to the new American Embassy. I loved his now closed Paradise Garage. And now his name is all over this demonstration of the misguided in three courses. Then again, the restaurant is only described as being under his \u201cguidance\u201d. Perhaps it\u2019s just some consultancy job; an irresistible shake of the big fat money tree, which meant he didn\u2019t argue when someone suggested he charge \u00a326 for a dreary plate of fried dough and cauliflower. We\u2019ll come back to that. As the name implies, the Great Scotland Yard Hotel by Hyatt occupies the building that was once the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police. Foul crimes were investigated here. Suspects implicated in appalling murders were detained here. A nod to that makes sense, but they\u2019ve gone all in. I find the glass case in the foyer with an antique police truncheon disconcerting; likewise, the poor waiters\u2019 Peaky Blinders-vintage utility-wear \u201ccostumes\u201d. You can spot who the most senior staff are. Their trousers are allowed to reach their shoes; the others have to wear them rolled above the ankle. More troubling is the display of paintings and sculpture by current UK prison inmates, purchased from the charity Koestler Arts, which helps people in the criminal justice system change their lives through art. Rehabilitation through art is obviously laudable. So is the sale of that often-harrowing work. But context is everything. Here they sit, these expressions of isolation, of broken families, emotional trauma and dismal consequence, bang outside the door to a restaurant charging \u00a315 for starters and \u00a330 for mains; where wines start at \u00a338 a bottle. Here, the art doesn\u2019t feel transformative. It feels exploitative. Oh look! How profound. How moving. Now let\u2019s go spaff \u00a375 a head on dinner. Not that I was aware of the cost because unusually, at opening, they hadn\u2019t posted the menu online, perhaps because the pricing is so at odds with everything else Gill has done. Most of the dishes at the Dairy are roughly half the price of those here. As ever, the money could be justified if it was all \u201cpraise be\u201d and \u201challelujah\u201d, and there are a couple of dishes that get the nod. There\u2019s a very jolly long-cooked pork jowl, pan-burnished, sticky-glazed and laid under a crisp crumb; a louche version of a Japanese tonkatsu breaded pork cutlet. It\u2019s \u00a328. There\u2019s a clever chocolate mousse in a crisp pastry shell and a lemon custard tart with sticks of meringue and mascarpone ice-cream. Both feel like consolation prizes. Both are \u00a39.50. Other things make us joke that the building where crimes were once investigated, is now where they are being committed. Too often the kitchen tries to declare victory through the application of dairy fats. To start we are given a cup of a ludicrously creamy Jerusalem artichoke soup, which they\u2019ve attempted to make interesting via the tiresome punch of truffle oil. It reminds me of the savoury \u201ccappuccinos\u201d that were served in fancy Mayfair restaurants back at the turn of the millennium, and not in a fond way. A sea bass ceviche should be about acidity and sprightliness. Here the thinly sliced fish wallows in a pond of creamy sauce. There is none of the advertised wasabi hit, no citrus punch. Most infuriating is a \u00a314 bowl of curling cavatelli pasta, on a cloyingly sweet pumpkin sauce with amaretto and underpickled Thai shallots that are more sugar than acid. It\u2019s 2020 and the vegetarian option is: a bowl of bloody pasta. Gill is better than this. Meanwhile, the cream-ballasted sauce around a well-made beef short rib raviolo leaves us reeling from buttery overkill. It\u2019s the vegetarian main that has me eyeing the knuckle-dusters; don\u2019t blame me, I\u2019m not the one who put weapons in the dining room. It\u2019s a plate of doughy fried gnocchi like those dental swabs inserted between teeth and gum. They come with roasted cauliflower florets, leaves which are less bitter than we\u2019re quickly becoming, and that \u00a326 price tag. It tastes of laziness and gross profit margin. The main courses top out at \u00a330, for two small pieces of monkfish with XO sauce, a condiment that makes me think lunch up the road in Chinatown would be delightful right now. The desserts include a deconstructed tarte tatin. The point of a tarte tatin is the sticky, caramelised edges to the buttery pastry from the roasted apples and sugar. If you serve the pastry separately, it\u2019s just a disc of dry pastry, however clever the undulations you\u2019ve achieved. Stop it. The bill for three arrives. It\u2019s an asphyxiating \u00a3288. I squint at it. They appear to have charged me \u00a375 for a \u00a339 bottle of white Burgundy. I question this. The mistake, it seems, is all mine. When I pointed at the \u00a339 price tag and said \u201cI\u2019ll have a bottle of that\u201d I didn\u2019t clock that \u00a339 was actually for a half-bottle carafe, because I am simple and do not understand the cost of things. Equally, they didn\u2019t point out my error. I say fine, I\u2019ll pay, but they insist on charging me only \u00a339 because of the \u201cconfusion\u201d. Obviously, this has nothing to do with who I am. The bill returns and, because this is a hotel restaurant, as well as adding a 12.5% service charge of \u00a327.50, they have left open a space for an extra tip. I decline to pay more \u2013 \u00a382.50 each is already taking the piss and my bladder is completely empty. Would somebody mind calling the emergency services? News bites For a more successful take on the hotel restaurant, try chef Tristan Welch\u2019s British brasserie at the Parker\u2019s Tavern, inside the University Arms, Cambridge. This is robust, unprissy cooking: it\u2019s fishcakes with lemon butter sauce or truffled duck egg on toast; it\u2019s nut-brown buttered sole with brown shrimps or braised suckling pig with crackling and braised fennel.

It\u2019s a way of warding off the dark and cold that feels healthier (or at least less stupefying) than rich meaty stews, and which involves cooking with citrus fruits and Middle Eastern herbs and spices, roasting aubergine and celeriac, and rediscovering the joys of yoghurt and the chickpea. Given the origins of this sort of food in the eastern Mediterranean, it\u2019s not all that surprising that the wines that I crave to go with it hail from a similar locale. From Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley, for example, the home of the Hochar family of Ch\u00e2teau Musar fame, who make this gloriously warming, supple, rich but plum-tangy and subtly spicy (and vegan) red from a blend of four southern French grape varieties grown in a single sun-kissed vineyard.</p> <p><strong>Schuchmann Saperavi, Telavi, Georgia 2018 (from \u00a313.99, <a href=\"http://butlers-winecellar.co.uk\">Butlers</a>; <a href=\"http://bottleapostle.com\">Bottle Apostle</a>)</strong> The food culture in Georgia on the Black Sea has much in common with the cusines of the Mediterranean. As Carla Capalbo puts it in her encyclopaedic (and much recommended) <em>Tasting Georgia: A Food and Wine Journey in the Caucusus</em>, the food is \u201cexotic yet familiar, rich in fresh vegetables and salads, subtly spiced and vibrantly flavoured, with more nuts and fresh herbs in one meal than we use in a month\u201d. The wines that have evolved (over 8,000 vintages; this being the birthplace of wine) to match these foods are similarly \u201cexotic yet familiar\u201d and, in another Capalbo observation, ancient but modern-feeling. Schuchmann\u2019s Saperavi, for example, is made from the country\u2019s indigenous saperavi grape, which is a teinturier grape, where the flesh, as well as the skin, is pigmented. It gives an inky dark, wild blackberry and black cherry-scented, pleasingly grippy and lipsmackingly acidic, food-matchingly versatile red.</p> <p><strong>Domaine Vourvoukeli Limnio, Avdir\u00e1, Greece 2016 (from \u00a318.40, <a href=\"http://maltbyandgreek.com\">Maltby and Greek</a>; <a href=\"http://harveynichols.com\">Harvey Nichols</a>)</strong> A feature of Georgian and Lebanese food is to present an array of small dishes rather than a single main dish; and that\u2019s true of the Greek meze too. That style of eating might seem to go against the very idea of the fussy food and wine match: are you really going to choose eight wines to go perfectly with each of those eight dishes? And are you going to drink them sequentially, and thus entirely miss the eclectic point of the meze, or are you going to pour yourself eight individual glasses and thus turn the meal into a kind of decadent spectacle? Fortunately, many Greek wines have the kind of structure that gives them multi-food-matching appeal, among them this superb red from the north of the country, which is made from local variety Limnio, and is full of brambly red fruit, thyme and peppery spice.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

The wines that have evolved (over 8,000 vintages; this being the birthplace of wine) to match these foods are similarly \u201cexotic yet familiar\u201d and, in another Capalbo observation, ancient but modern-feeling. Schuchmann\u2019s Saperavi, for example, is made from the country\u2019s indigenous saperavi grape, which is a teinturier grape, where the flesh, as well as the skin, is pigmented. It gives an inky dark, wild blackberry and black cherry-scented, pleasingly grippy and lipsmackingly acidic, food-matchingly versatile red. Domaine Vourvoukeli Limnio, Avdir\u00e1, Greece 2016 (from \u00a318.40, Maltby and Greek; Harvey Nichols) A feature of Georgian and Lebanese food is to present an array of small dishes rather than a single main dish; and that\u2019s true of the Greek meze too. That style of eating might seem to go against the very idea of the fussy food and wine match: are you really going to choose eight wines to go perfectly with each of those eight dishes? And are you going to drink them sequentially, and thus entirely miss the eclectic point of the meze, or are you going to pour yourself eight individual glasses and thus turn the meal into a kind of decadent spectacle? Fortunately, many Greek wines have the kind of structure that gives them multi-food-matching appeal, among them this superb red from the north of the country, which is made from local variety Limnio, and is full of brambly red fruit, thyme and peppery spice.

      "body": "<p>So it is done. On Friday night, 47 years of British membership of the European Union and its forebears came to an end. It was a moment that will irrevocably shape the course of our nation\u2019s history, but in quite what direction it is impossible to tell. The paradox of Brexit lives on. Britain has taken a monumental decision from which there is no retreat in the foreseeable future. And yet, three and a half years on from the referendum that heralded our departure, nothing of substance about what it means for our future has been resolved. Brexit continues to be defined by its champions\u2019 hostility to the EU, rather than a realistic vision of what we could become.</p> <p>For some, it is a new beginning; for others, a historic mistake. Some are jubilant at the prospect of a sovereign nation unbound; others grieve for the enforced separation from allies and from the values the European project represents. Where joyful pride and optimism soar, so too in equal measure do hearts sink at narrowing horizons and a shrivelled vision of greatness. Generationally and geographically, Britain remains as divided as ever on Europe. The prime minister\u2019s responsibility is to chart a course that can heal divisions and bring the UK together. That is the rhetoric that infuses his every speech. But the smoke signals point to a different approach. Boris Johnson, they suggest, continues to see Brexit through the prism of the ideological project he used to catapult himself into Downing Street.</p> <h2>What cost a \u2018clean break\u2019?<br></h2> <p>Britain now faces the same existential choice it did this time last month, or indeed for the past three years. The act of leaving the EU has only made it more urgent. Is our country to be more closely aligned to the diplomatic and economic worldview of our closest neighbours and allies, with whom we have a shared legacy of beliefs, instincts and values? Or will we try to hitch our wagon to a global superpower like the US, or even China, whose approaches to rights and standards are so fundamentally different to our own?</p> <p>The promise from the Brexiters was always that no such choice is necessary, that Britain has the economic clout to be a superpower in its own right, to dictate its own terms of trade to the rest of the world. Realists who challenge this fantasy stand accused of talking down the country. But loving your country surely has to involve more than harking back to a glorious imperial past. Here in the present, we face tough decisions about our post-Brexit future. The trade-off at the heart of Brexit remains as immutable as ever. We can stay close to the EU, following its rules in order to minimise the economic impact of Brexit, but now without a say over them. Or we can go for a bare-bones agreement of the sort Johnson will outline in a speech tomorrow, along with a set of churlish demands for the next stage of negotiations.</p> <p>The decisive parliamentary majority Johnson secured at the end of last year means he could easily choose the more pragmatic and unifying path. But he seems determined instead to govern as if he were in hock to the hard Eurosceptic flank of his party. His Brexit vision is riddled with flaws. \u201cTake back control\u201d was a great campaign slogan, but it means little in an interconnected world that renders 19th-century notions of sovereignty hopelessly outdated. Our economy is not large enough to allow Britain to dictate its terms of trade to competing economic giants and huge trading blocs. The question is not whether Brexit Britain will become a rule taker, but whose rules we will be obliged to obey. For the Conservative hard right, the whole point of Brexit was to achieve closer alignment with the low-tax, low-regulation United States. Pressure to lower food standards and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/trump-will-put-us-interests-first-in-trade-talks-says-kim-darroch-ambassador\" title=\"\">relax NHS controls on drug prices</a> is inevitably where hard Brexit and a US free-trade deal leads.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be5adb8ca20140f40324df5afa6ad4a004ff5b8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be5adb8ca20140f40324df5afa6ad4a004ff5b8b/0_0_6537_4438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson rings the changes at Downing Street at 11pm on Brexit day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson rings the changes at Downing Street at 11pm on Brexit day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/No10 Downing Street/Crown Copyright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moreover, the <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-economic-impact-of-Boris-Johnsons-Brexit-proposals.pdf\" title=\"\">economic costs of a hard Brexit</a> will be felt most sharply in less affluent areas of the country. Far from \u201clevelling up\u201d, a Canada-style free-trade deal of the kind the prime minister will champion in his speech will widen regional inequalities, already among the highest in Europe. Worst of all, it undermines the Good Friday agreement, which created a fragile peace in Northern Ireland that was predicated on both Ireland and the UK being part of the single market and customs union. That alone should be enough to seek a relationship that avoids any need for a customs or regulatory border on Ireland or in the Irish Sea. Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement shows he has no qualms about putting that in peril. A hard Brexit will also give succour to the movement for Scottish independence. The price of realising the Brexiter fantasy of a \u201cclean break\u201d with Europe may well be the imminent breakup of the United Kingdom.</p> <h2>Trade-offs with authoritarian regimes</h2> <p>Brexit will also fundamentally alter our role in the world. Britain\u2019s most pressing diplomatic challenge will be how to deal with the US at a time when there has never been a more hostile president. Trump lobbied for Brexit because he regarded it as in America\u2019s interests. He saw in it the potential to weaken Europe, while rendering Britain more compliant with American demands. Trump has already demonstrated that he expects high fidelity, if not subservience, from Britain in his approach to Iran and Palestine. Which side will Britain choose if Trump decides to ramp up US tariffs and sanctions with the EU?</p> <p>In the coming months, Britain will have to pick a careful path in the shadow of an increasingly for-or-against-us president. US bullying over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/huawei?page=2\" title=\"\">Huawei</a> \u201csecurity risk\u201d and digital taxes on the technology giants is a sure sign of things to come. The other big challenge concerns Britain\u2019s future dealings with China and other authoritarian regimes such as Russia, Brazil, Israel, Turkey and some of the Gulf states. The government covets a trade deal with China and investment from Beijing, but how will it trade off China\u2019s bulging chequebook with its deplorable record on human rights and free speech? And how would greater cooperation sit with a US that is increasingly hostile to China? If Johnson creates a diplomatic gulf with Europe through the course of the Brexit negotiations, it would be to our peril. Britain could find itself caught between two superpowers without the protective shield of European solidarity to fall back upon.</p> <h2>Hell-bent on a hard Brexit</h2> <p>Brexit will also have an impact on our political system. The root causes of the Leave vote are complex and multifaceted, but in some areas of the country it was motivated by a sense of alienation from Westminster and a growing disenchantment with the regional inequalities created by decades of deindustrialisation and compounded by 10 years of austerity. This should have long ago prompted some deep political shifts towards meaningful economic reforms to rebalance the economy and a refashioning of our constitutional settlement to relocate power closer to people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>But Johnson and the Vote Leave crew now running Number 10 look set to take precisely the wrong lessons from the past three years. Like Tory chancellors before him, Sajid Javid is set to reinforce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/29/ministers-told-to-find-5-savings-to-refocus-on-pms-priorities\" title=\"\">spending cuts</a>. Even as he promises new investment for the north, Johnson is hell-bent on pursuing the hardest of Brexits that will widen regional gulfs and wreak havoc with our manufacturing industries. He will no doubt take last year\u2019s election result as an endorsement of the effectiveness of his political strategy: putting out untrue claims about his opponents, blaming them for events that happened on his party\u2019s watch, and avoiding scrutiny from parliament and the media. At least the size of his majority means he can no longer blame others for his ineffectiveness and incompetence. If, in a decade, Britain is still suffering the ill effects of a hard Brexit, the responsibility will lie with him alone.</p> <h2>Europe is still our neighbour</h2> <p>We may have left the EU. We may have severed our formal ties with its political institutions and processes. But we have not left Europe. Britons will continue to holiday on the continent, to work and study there, to fall in love there. Britain has always been able to enjoy the benefits of its island status, and its status as a bridge between the US and continental Europe. But in unmooring us in an unstable world, Brexit will \u2013 regrettably \u2013 increasingly force us to make a choice between our European neighbours a few miles east across the English Channel, and a distant and unpredictable power across the Atlantic.</p> <p>We have always acknowledged that the EU is imperfect and far from beyond reproach. It faces huge challenges of its own: to resolve, for instance, its divisions over immigration and population movements and to find the right trade-off between economic integration and democratic legitimacy. But there is no more successful example of transnational cooperation by liberal democracies in the face of challenges that have no respect for national borders, from climate change to microbial resistance, from curbing the power of giant multinationals to avoiding devastating global conflict. Britain\u2019s success and security is no less dependent on a robust and flourishing union of European nations after Brexit than it was before.</p> <p>And so we wish our European allies and neighbours nothing but the best. We can hold on to the knowledge that our ties of history and culture, of hearts and kinship, cannot be severed with a tawdry light show, a smirking boast and a toast. They are vital bonds that, with tending, will endure and, we hope, one day, with good grace and rediscovered wisdom, will be reinvigorated to the benefit of us all.</p>",

For a small mention of a cosmetics brand in one of his YouTube videos, he would charge $3,000 (\u00a32,260). For a \u201cdedicated video\u201d, it would be more like $14,000. Once his subscriber numbers go up, and with them the number of views on his videos, \u201cI could get, like, $20,000.\u201d Good for him, I suppose. But also, isn\u2019t this extraordinary?</p> <p>In the first of this three-part BBC Three documentary, four young people are investigating the beauty industry, which has seen huge levels of growth in recent years. Beneath the glossy surface, it\u2019s pretty grim. Chloe, a makeup artist and influencer from Belfast, and Casey, who thinks men are under-represented in the beauty business, seem the most invested and impressed with this world. Resh, 23, from Manchester, is more sceptical but understands the power of makeup to transform one\u2019s confidence \u2013 she is the survivor of a horrific acid attack.

Pretty much all she has packed for the trip to California is some shampoo and deodorant. The beauty industry, she says, exists \u201cto make people feel insecure and sell products\u201d. I like Queenie. At the Beautycon event, where brands gather and 30,000 visitors hope to pose in selfies with one of the 300 \u201cinfluencers\u201d, she seems genuinely shocked. \u201cBut who is he?\u201d she says of one of the biggest beauty stars, Bretman Rock. \u201cWhat does he represent?

It is tightly controlled by PR \u2013 an off-screen voice stops Erin Lindsay, who works in product development and shows our foursome around the factory, from talking about whether their glitter is biodegradable (it\u2019s not) and whether or not she knows how much the minimum wage is (she doesn\u2019t). \u201cColourPop really promoted the fact we could ask Erin anything and there were certain questions they were a wee bit weird about,\u201d says Chloe. \u201cI feel like it sugarcoats everything.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/14/sali-hughes-40-best-sustainable-beauty-brands\">Sali Hughes's 40 best sustainable beauty brands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is some nifty polishing.

Instead, the South Korean artist is keen to be devoured \u2013 which is why she has designed a burial suit that, in her own words, looks like \u201cninja pyjamas\u201d. Covering every part of her body, the outfit is black with white, branch-like patterns forking down it. The lining, she goes on to explain in an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7rS_d1fiUc\">intriguing video</a> posted online in 2011, will be filled with mushroom spores that have been \u201ctrained\u201d to recognise her as food, thanks to having being fed bits of Lee\u2019s shed skin, hair and nails. After she dies, she will be placed in the suit and these cultivated mushrooms will \u2013 hopefully \u2013 eat her.

British designer Tom Dixon is making a prototype chair out of mycelium, the mass of thin threads that make up the body of a fungus. German conceptual artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/carsten-holler\">Carsten H\u00f6ller</a> has come up with a solar-powered mushroom suitcase.

Even the typeface used on the gallery walls was \u201cgrown\u201d using an algorithm that mimics fungal growth.</p> <p>You might think that finding so many mushroom-influenced artists would take quite a bit of foraging, but Gavin says it couldn\u2019t have been easier. In fact, this is her second mushroom-themed exhibition, a smaller one having already been a success in Paris. She says she could have made this show much bigger had she wished: \u201cType in the name of any artist of the last five years with the word \u2018mushroom\u2019 and you\u2019ll find plenty of work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b2ad41379983701956a92151ed013db7415c3f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b2ad41379983701956a92151ed013db7415c3f0/0_0_2363_2363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Five Amazing Tricks to Get Rid of Perception.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Five Amazing Tricks to Get Rid of Perception by The Mycological Twist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Somerset House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of those artists is David Fenster, who likes mushrooms so much he sometimes dresses as one.

They\u2019re overlooked, especially in fungiphobic cultures like ours, which is probably why artists are so interested in them.\u201d</p> <p>Fenster is a film-maker and the costume features in one of his pieces, Fly Amanita, in which the mushroom reflects on the way it\u2019s been treated by human beings over the years. \u201cPeople used to mix my ancestors in a bowl with milk and put the mixture out to kill flies,\u201d it says at one point, before bemoaning the way pop culture has warped its public image. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise that this thing they see in a Mario Bros game is a representation of a real mushroom that actually exists!\u201d As Fenster puts it: \u201cI thought it would be funny to make a film about an anthropomorphised mushroom complaining about how humans have anthropomorphised nature.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76beafd834963cf5f71511eb9b734b005e665060\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76beafd834963cf5f71511eb9b734b005e665060/0_345_4383_2629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Growth industry \u2026 Cochlea Brick Tuft by Hamish Pearch, which features in the show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Growth industry \u2026 Cochlea Brick Tuft by Hamish Pearch, which features in the show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hamish Pearch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mushrooms have long fascinated artists. There are all sorts of examples, from 17th-century Flemish and German baroque art to Victorian fairy paintings, on the <a href=\"https://namyco.org/art_registry.php\">North American Mycological Association website</a>. But fungi have perhaps never been seen as a key muse. A new book, <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/feast-fast-9781781301029/\">Feast &amp; Fast: The Art of Food in Europe 1500-1800</a>, doesn\u2019t even give them a mention in its index.</p> <p>Over the last half a century, however, they\u2019ve provided much nourishment for artistic minds. Cy Twombly painted them; Andy Warhol filmed painter Robert Indiana chomping on one in his 1963 film Eat; John Cage even co-wrote a book about them, Mushroom Book (1972), which now resides in MoMA\u2019s collection. Cage was particularly obsessed \u2013 writing mushroom poems, creating <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/haute-cuisine-john-cage-recipes-vogue\">mushroom ketchup recipes for Vogue magazine</a> and, in 1962, even founding the most recent incarnation of the New York Mycological Society. \u201cI have come to the conclusion that much can be learned about music by devoting oneself to the mushroom,\u201d Cage explained in the Music Lovers\u2019 Field Companion (1954).</p> <p>Around the turn of the century, I even had my own mushroom mania moment when, writing in the NME, I coined the term <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/2360346-2360346\">shroomadelica</a>: a short-lived genre for such bands as the Delays and the Zutons, whose light psychedelia chimed with the legal loophole that allowed people to ingest magic mushrooms in the UK.

This shows a bearded, slightly crazed-looking man wearing a tuxedo standing in a field holding a trumpet and a bunch of mushrooms. The text mixes traditional field guide information with jokes and poetry \u2013 and it so enraptured Fenster that he made a film about its author called, fabulously, The Michael Jordan of Mycology (confusingly, there is also a British mycologist called \u2026 Michael Jordan).</p> <p>The show will also feature The Mycological Twist, AKA Elo\u00efse Bonneviot and Anne de Boer, who were drawn into the world of mushrooms after reading an article that suggested fungi could break down the waste caused by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It inspired the pair to look into doing the same in a patch of garden at the London exhibition space JupiterWoods. More recent fungal projects include Respawn, a science-fiction movie told from the perspective of mushrooms; and Foraging Bags, an attempt to create portraits of a space\u2019s local ecology using thin fabric bags, mushroom spores and edibles gathered from parks.</p> <p>\u201cThe urgency of the climate crisis is more palpable every day,\u201d say the pair over email. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for an artist to create any other work. There\u2019s a growing interest in veganism, Extinction Rebellion and cutting back single-plastic use, and foraging for mushrooms definitely belongs in this list. Because they are so entangled into ecosystems, they have a potential to be subversives. They remain mysterious, resisting labelling and understanding. They are something you collaborate with rather than simply use.\u201d</p> <p>Lee\u2019s burial suit was conceived along the same lines. She wanted to be eaten by mushrooms because she was concerned about the many toxins left in our body after we die, from BPA (bisphenol A) picked up from plastic packaging to the mercury in fillings.

I\u2019m going to leave you with some news from Guardian Australia photographer Mike Bowers, who got stuck at the property of Claire and Laurence Cowie along with reporter Christopher Knaus on Saturday. Aside from the drama, there were two bits of the story readers will remember \u2013 they involved horses and beer. Mike captured a dramatic picture of horses Charm, Billy and Obe as they bolted from the flames at Tallabrook Lodge. Claire and Laurence spent Saturday putting out fires around their property, but Laurence also made sure they had beer on ice for when the work was done. Mike has been back to the property today with a trailer of lucerne and feed for the horses. And also, I\u2019m told, some beer. Some good news on a couple of fire fronts. The threat from the ACT\u2019s Orroral Valley fire is easing. The fire isn\u2019t controlled yet, but authorities have downgraded the threat to \u201cadvice\u201d level. Conditions have also improved at the three fires in the Bega Valley in NSW, although residents are being told it\u2019s still not safe to return. The NSW Rural Fire Service says fire activity has increased at the Clear Range Fire, which is now at \u201cwatch and act\u201d. The authority says there are several fires in the Michelago and Bredbo areas that started as a result of the Orroral Valley fire over the border in ACT. The fires are spreading in a south-easterly direction. Anyone in the Colinton and Michelago areas are asked to monitor conditions. People in Tinderry, Anembo, Jerangle, Chakola have been told that embers are being thrown ahead of the fire. A quick recap. The ACT\u2019s fire authorities are waiting for forecast storms that could either help or hinder conditions there. The Orroral Valley Fire in the ACT that could be impacted by predicted storms this afternoon remains at watch and act level. Health authorities in NSW issued a health warning this morning as smoke and dust created poor air quality. Eastern parts of Sydney, the Illawarra, Central Coast and Newcastle could all be impacted. The NSW Big Jack Mountain fire, which merged with the Postmans Trail and Creewah Road fires overnight, remains at watch and act. We\u2019re also watching for the expected storm activity this afternoon. Looks like the forecast rain is heading over Canberra. We\u2019ll wait to hear if this helps or hinders the firefighting efforts. Fire authorities in the ACT are warning that conditions there could change quickly, with the prospect of a storm this afternoon creating uncertainty. There\u2019s a fire burning at the southern end of the territory. The ACT Emergency Services Agency commissioner, Georgeina Whelan, has been speaking to reporters about the storm. News agency AAP is reporting the comments. Perfect storm conditions for us would be rain and no thunder and no wind in the gap of land that has not been burnt between our southern borders. However, this cannot be guaranteed. Our community needs to be prepared for the impact this storm may have on our southern and western suburbs. ACT remains in a state of emergency that will remain until at least Monday. The chief minister, Andrew Barr, told reporters there had been no loss of life or property thanks to the efforts of government agencies and the ADF. Some property had been lost across the border into NSW at Bumbalong. More on the warning from NSW Health about air quality in parts of the state. There are two issues going on at the same time \u2013 smoke from the bushfires, and dust being whipped up from inland storms and blowing east. Eastern parts of Sydney, the Illawarra, and possibly the Central Coast and Newcastle could all be impacted. NSW Health medical advisor Dr Adi Vyas says people should minimise their exposure. \u201cPeople with chronic respiratory and cardiovascular conditions should avoid outdoor physical activity and those with asthma should also follow their Asthma Action Plan and carry their reliever medication with them.\u201d \u201cMinimising physical activity, staying indoors and knowing your treatment plan are important ways to reduce the risk of dust and smoke-related illness.\u201d The conditions could aggravate existing heart and lung conditions. The air could also cause eye irritation and coughing. Anyone with conditions including asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and heart disease should be extra careful. Guardian Australia\u2019s photographer Mike Bowers and reporter Christopher Knaus had a dramatic day yesterday. Along with other journalists, Mike and Chris were cut off by fire on Claire and Laurence Cowie\u2019s property 100km from Canberra. Here\u2019s their account as the drama unfolded and how the Cowies kept the beer on ice. Here\u2019s the video from Mike\u2019s camera as the flames moved in. There\u2019s going to be thunderstorms for many parts of NSW, including Sydney, starting this afternoon and going into the evening. Storms inland could also pick up dust and drag that across towards Sydney. Combined with the smoke from bushfires, it\u2019s already having an impact on air quality. It\u2019s going to be hot and smoky in the west, with Penrith forecast to reach 41C. Overnight temperatures in Canberra have been remarkable, with some preliminary data suggesting the parts of the city had a record-breaking warm evening. Good morning to all and welcome to our live coverage of the bushfire crisis. The awful weather conditions in the ACT yesterday are forecast to be only slightly better today. The 55,000 hectare Orroral Valley fire south of Canberra is still out of control, but conditions on firegrounds have also eased. Authorities are asking people in the Apollo Road, Boboyan Road, Naas Road and Top Naas Road areas to \u201cremain vigilant\u201d. The ACT\u2019s total fire ban remains in place for Sunday across the ACT. Health authorities in NSW are warning that smoke from fires as well as dust is going to cause air quality problems around the state, including Sydney.",

We can too often forget the enormity of Auschwitz, and for once \u201cenormity\u201d can be taken as both the modern (wrong) sense of size and the dictionary meaning: something terrible and frightening.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ll spare you my usual rant about BBC drama, as I\u2019ve said the same things for years and, you know, <em>boooorrrriiiing</em>. (Summary: old-fashioned, twee, too much acting with a capital A.) And anyway, there is much evidence now that the BBC is shifting to a different approach. Its commissioning of super-scary podcast, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06spcbl\" title=\"\"><em>The Case of Charles Dexter Ward</em></a> and its follow-up <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06spb8w/episodes/player\" title=\"\"><em>The Whisperer </em><em>in Darkness</em></a> was a genius move; as was futuristic nature/sci-fi epic <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06tqsg3\" title=\"\"><em>Forest 404</em></a>, with all its spin-off talks and immersive soundscapes. In fact, there are several green shoots of ambition and creativity in BBC audio fiction, especially if you move away from the established radio drama slots to the places where independent producers can get freaky.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07w07fy/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\"><em>Murmurs</em></a><em> </em>is one of these places. A BBC Sounds series, it\u2019s designed for podcast listening, rather than radio listening: meaning, on headphones in bed, rather than on speakers when you\u2019re making the kids\u2019 tea. Guided by head producer James Robinson and series consultant Ella Watts, the writers come from the BBC\u2019s Writersroom and from established independent fiction podcasts. Co-writer of the hit audio drama <a href=\"https://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires\" title=\"\"><em>Within the Wires</em></a> Janina Matthewson pitched for one of the episodes and her idea was expanded into the shared universe of the series. Her premise is that our world brushes up against other worlds, and something is leaking through, affecting ordinary people and their lives. Matthewson also wrote three of the episodes.</p> <p>The problem for the listener is that we\u2019re not told whether or not the stories interlink. <em>Murmurs</em> is called \u201ca new 10-part drama\u201d one minute and \u201c10 mind-altering tales\u201d the next. Is this <em>Tales of the Unexpected</em> or <em>Stranger Things</em>? We\u2019re never sure. Plus the supernatural effects of brushing up against these worlds vary wildly from one episode to the next.</p> <p>Sometimes they\u2019re an actual physical portal to another world, sometimes just a strange happening (a plant growing on a wall; someone gradually disappearing; a big dog appearing at the end of a bed). Would there be a Big Reveal, something that would explain everything that was going on? No. The series, which I expected to build to a climax, just kept restarting over and over.</p> <p>This variety leads to an unevenness of tone. Though the audio \u201cfurniture\u201d of the programmes is consistent \u2013 rewinding of speech, repetition of phrases, spooky noises \u2013 the way the stories are told is very different. Some episodes are straightforward drama, so we hear what\u2019s going on as though we\u2019re in the room; others are told through recordings \u2013 voice messages, digital recordings \u2013 as though they\u2019re a \u201cfound\u201d tale, pieced together later. In the first episode, we hear from a supernatural character. But that never happens again. The rest of the spooks remain mute.</p> <p>Aside from this, there are some interesting ideas and lovely acting. Almost all the episodes have youngish women as their main character, and often, the plot concerns their life slipping out of whack. I really enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p080g5s7\" title=\"\">episode six</a>, about the homeless Germaine, and there were some gorgeous moments in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p080gft9\" title=\"\">episode three</a> between Precious and her friend, who are investigating why a tree on their estate keeps moving around. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p080g7bb\" title=\"\">Episode nine</a>, written by detective comedy podcast <a href=\"https://www.victoriocity.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Victoriocity</em></a>\u2019s Jen and Chris Sugden, concerning a strange woman who knows all the answers, is a perfect thing, a non-tech <em>Black Mirror</em>. Matthewson\u2019s episodes, two, five and 10, are three parts of a single story and are also excellent, though the final reveal is underwhelming. (And why aren\u2019t they placed one after the other, like a mini series?)</p> <p>Am I being pernickety? A bit. There are lots of phone calls (this is an audio medium, after all) and it would have been nice for the producers to have invested in slightly different phone pick-up and cut-off tones, rather than use the same ones for every call. That\u2019s how pernickety I can be. But it\u2019s good to hear ambition in a project, to be overwhelmed by too many ideas and styles, a surfeit of notions and writing approaches. A stronger hand in managing audience expectations and in evening out the overall tone would have made this interesting series truly excellent.</p> <h2>Three unlikely partnerships that work well</h2> <p><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/Ricky-and-Tony-Pop-Detectives/tag%3Aaudioboom.com%2C2020-01-27%3A%2Fposts%2F7488508\" title=\"\">Ricky and Tony, Pop Detectives</a><br>A brand new show featuring Tony Blackburn and Ricky Wilson of Kaiser Chiefs, this is a surprisingly delightful listen.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll spare you my usual rant about BBC drama, as I\u2019ve said the same things for years and, you know, boooorrrriiiing. (Summary: old-fashioned, twee, too much acting with a capital A.) And anyway, there is much evidence now that the BBC is shifting to a different approach. Its commissioning of super-scary podcast, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward and its follow-up The Whisperer in Darkness was a genius move; as was futuristic nature/sci-fi epic Forest 404, with all its spin-off talks and immersive soundscapes. In fact, there are several green shoots of ambition and creativity in BBC audio fiction, especially if you move away from the established radio drama slots to the places where independent producers can get freaky. Murmurs is one of these places. A BBC Sounds series, it\u2019s designed for podcast listening, rather than radio listening: meaning, on headphones in bed, rather than on speakers when you\u2019re making the kids\u2019 tea. Guided by head producer James Robinson and series consultant Ella Watts, the writers come from the BBC\u2019s Writersroom and from established independent fiction podcasts. Co-writer of the hit audio drama Within the Wires Janina Matthewson pitched for one of the episodes and her idea was expanded into the shared universe of the series. Her premise is that our world brushes up against other worlds, and something is leaking through, affecting ordinary people and their lives. Matthewson also wrote three of the episodes. The problem for the listener is that we\u2019re not told whether or not the stories interlink. Murmurs is called \u201ca new 10-part drama\u201d one minute and \u201c10 mind-altering tales\u201d the next. Is this Tales of the Unexpected or Stranger Things? We\u2019re never sure. Plus the supernatural effects of brushing up against these worlds vary wildly from one episode to the next. Sometimes they\u2019re an actual physical portal to another world, sometimes just a strange happening (a plant growing on a wall; someone gradually disappearing; a big dog appearing at the end of a bed). Would there be a Big Reveal, something that would explain everything that was going on? No. The series, which I expected to build to a climax, just kept restarting over and over. This variety leads to an unevenness of tone. Though the audio \u201cfurniture\u201d of the programmes is consistent \u2013 rewinding of speech, repetition of phrases, spooky noises \u2013 the way the stories are told is very different. Some episodes are straightforward drama, so we hear what\u2019s going on as though we\u2019re in the room; others are told through recordings \u2013 voice messages, digital recordings \u2013 as though they\u2019re a \u201cfound\u201d tale, pieced together later. In the first episode, we hear from a supernatural character. But that never happens again. The rest of the spooks remain mute. Aside from this, there are some interesting ideas and lovely acting. Almost all the episodes have youngish women as their main character, and often, the plot concerns their life slipping out of whack. I really enjoyed episode six, about the homeless Germaine, and there were some gorgeous moments in episode three between Precious and her friend, who are investigating why a tree on their estate keeps moving around. Episode nine, written by detective comedy podcast Victoriocity\u2019s Jen and Chris Sugden, concerning a strange woman who knows all the answers, is a perfect thing, a non-tech Black Mirror. Matthewson\u2019s episodes, two, five and 10, are three parts of a single story and are also excellent, though the final reveal is underwhelming. (And why aren\u2019t they placed one after the other, like a mini series?) Am I being pernickety? A bit. There are lots of phone calls (this is an audio medium, after all) and it would have been nice for the producers to have invested in slightly different phone pick-up and cut-off tones, rather than use the same ones for every call. That\u2019s how pernickety I can be. But it\u2019s good to hear ambition in a project, to be overwhelmed by too many ideas and styles, a surfeit of notions and writing approaches. A stronger hand in managing audience expectations and in evening out the overall tone would have made this interesting series truly excellent. Three unlikely partnerships that work well Ricky and Tony, Pop Detectives A brand new show featuring Tony Blackburn and Ricky Wilson of Kaiser Chiefs, this is a surprisingly delightful listen. The premise is that Tony is a pop detective and Ricky his protege, learning how to solve pop mysteries. First up: did Debbie Harry ever meet the serial killer Ted Bundy? They talk to a Bundy expert, Ricky enables Tony\u2019s rubbish jokes (\u201cI was talking to myself in Dorset and then they invented radio\u201d), Tony teases Ricky (\u201cThat is the most fantastic story. Is there an element of truth in it?\u201d) and, honestly, it\u2019s lovely. Cheerful Book Club Launched last week, this is a spin-off from Reasons to Be Cheerful, the successful political podcast featuring broadcaster Geoff Lloyd and politician turned broadcaster Ed Miliband. The show will focus on nonfiction, as opposed to novels, so it really is a spin-off (Reasons to Be Cheerful examines political theories) and the new series kicks off with Rana Foroohar, who wrote Don\u2019t Be Evil: The Case Against Big Tech. Foroohar is thoroughly engaging, pulling apart Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s calls for a better education system in America, while Apple barely pays tax. Lloyd and Miliband are great, as ever. For the Many This political podcast from LBC has been going for a couple of years now and is presented by the station\u2019s Iain Dale, who hosted the Conservative leadership hustings last year, and former Labour home secretary Jacqui Smith. Smith is Blairite and Dale a fairly centrist Tory (though pro-Brexit), so this is not one of those awful programmes where people shout their opinions at each other as though they\u2019re bellowing across a crowded pub. Instead, there are some bawdy jokes, lots of political banter and listener questions answered with gossipy insight. Far more fun than you might expect.",

Divided into 23 segments, each performance unrolls in a different order. But talking about genomes and sequenced chunks makes the project seem oblique, mechanistic. In fact, the work is highly accessible \u2013 probably why it\u2019s already enjoying its second revival. <em>Autobiography</em> is not just the story of one man, but a heady digestion of all postwar dance and movement trends, from Jane Fonda gym culture to experimental performance art.</p> <p>The scenes the 10 dancers act out are universal, even obvious ones about competition and cooperation, trying and failing, accord and conflict. There are lovers\u2019 quarrels, rehearsal-room jockeying, tortured ambitions, even abusive relationships. Different interpretations of similar moves flex through each combination: a stretch turns into an arabesque <em>en attitude</em>, which turns into an extended yoga hold, an acrobatic contortion and a streety, swaggering squat, before loosening off in a quick run.

      "bodyText": "Devised in 2017, Autobiography is supposedly based on Wayne McGregor\u2019s genetic code. Divided into 23 segments, each performance unrolls in a different order. But talking about genomes and sequenced chunks makes the project seem oblique, mechanistic. In fact, the work is highly accessible \u2013 probably why it\u2019s already enjoying its second revival. Autobiography is not just the story of one man, but a heady digestion of all postwar dance and movement trends, from Jane Fonda gym culture to experimental performance art. The scenes the 10 dancers act out are universal, even obvious ones about competition and cooperation, trying and failing, accord and conflict. There are lovers\u2019 quarrels, rehearsal-room jockeying, tortured ambitions, even abusive relationships. Different interpretations of similar moves flex through each combination: a stretch turns into an arabesque en attitude, which turns into an extended yoga hold, an acrobatic contortion and a streety, swaggering squat, before loosening off in a quick run. Sports moves are infused with earthy allure, while classical notations blend into clubland shapes and circus finesse. Dancers imitate a Regency assembly room dance, then pile up like the world\u2019s most elegant game of Twister. Sometimes the expression is sincere, at other times \u2013 as when a Swan Lake-like swoop turns into a preening display \u2013 it is satirical. The dark classiness of Trinity Laban\u2019s performance venue suits this rigorous work, boosted immeasurably by Lucy Carter\u2019s lighting design, in which a grid of tube lights snaps like a nightclub strobe, glows ochre like urban street lamps at midnight, or l owers into flashing points like an obstacle course from The Crystal Maze, under which dancers scramble and slither.

Following his taut 2015 debut feature, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/13/the-witch-film-review-robert-eggers\" title=\"\">The Witch</a></em>, cult indie production company A24 has given him carte blanche and, to his credit, Eggers hasn\u2019t held back. A spooky, late-Victorian period piece, shot in black and white on location in Nova Scotia, this two-hander features Willem Dafoe as bossy, flatulent lighthouse keeper Thomas Wake, and Robert Pattinson as his younger, more taciturn apprentice, Ephraim Winslow. The island\u2019s quirks include appalling weather, a belligerent seagull, and a stash of kerosene for when the rum runs dry.

Yet increasingly these devices begin to feel like technical exercises that dazzle while obscuring the story \u2013 or lack thereof. The lighthouse itself is a liminal space between land and sea that works as a kind of purgatory, though the assaulting whirr of machinery suggests the churning cogs of hell. The narrative tracks the disintegration of a man\u2019s spirit, but Eggers is interested in his guts (the film is ripe with sewage, semen and chamber pots of shit), not his soul. Frat boy humour is dressed up in an expensive, arthouse jacket.</p> <p>Dafoe is credible as a man dotty with power, but Pattinson, despite his go-for-broke energy, strains to keep up. The lewd, overwrought, Herman Melville-inspired dialogue is alternately mumbled and shouted, the intense, grand guignol performances more interesting as an experiment (what if we could get Willem Dafoe to bark like a dog?) than conducive to eliciting meaning.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogp0znSUWAM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ogp0znSUWAM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogp0znSUWAM\">Watch a trailer for The Lighthouse.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>A few years ago, following the release of her widely acclaimed 2016 album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/04/angel-olsen-my-woman-review-shut-up-kiss-me\" title=\"\">My Woman</a></em>, <a href=\"https://angelolsen.com/\" title=\"\">Angel Olsen</a> started noticing celebrities turning up at her live shows.</p> <p>Christina Hendricks, of <em>Mad Men</em> fame, came to a concert in Los Angeles and swayed along to Olsen\u2019s smouldering, deeply felt folk-rock. She stuck around to say hello afterwards, as did the actor Brie Larson, who proved herself to be, in Olsen\u2019s assessment, \u201csuper down-to-earth and really normal and just chill\u201d.</p> <p>Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, called up ahead of one LA gig and was duly granted a parking space, her own green room and a prime viewing position at the side of the stage. \u201cIt was really sweet,\u201d Olsen recalls. \u201cShe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/minmaxmgmt/status/831962778965467136/photo/1\" title=\"\">took selfies with everybody</a>, with my record in her mouth. I was like: \u2018This is so stupid!\u2019 It was a fun time.\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019d think the Missouri-born singer-songwriter, who had built up a passionate following but was still at a remove from the mainstream, would have been gratified by all this starry attention. But Olsen, who has a bone-dry sense of humour, which she expresses in perfect deadpan, recalls the surge of interest that followed <em>My Woman</em> with a raised eyebrow. \u201cThere were a lot of people coming out of the woodwork going: \u2018I loved the <em>My Woman</em> record.\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018Yeah\u2026\u2019\u201d She affects to look supremely unmoved. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve made records before.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>By then, Olsen had been putting out music for the best part of a decade. She released her first solo EP in 2010 and followed it with an album of raw, acoustic folk songs entitled <em>Half Way Home</em>. On 2014\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/16/burn-fire-no-witness-angel-olsen-review\" title=\"\">Burn Your Fire </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/16/burn-fire-no-witness-angel-olsen-review\" title=\"\">for No Witness</a></em>, she shifted up a gear, embracing the buzz of electric guitars and giving full vent to her extraordinary, multifaceted voice. The <em>NME</em> gave the record 9/10 and called it \u201csublime\u201d, while Pitchfork, rounding up the best albums of the past decade in December, <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-200-best-albums-of-the-2010s/\" title=\"\">ranked it</a> at No 26.</p> <p>But it was <em>My Woman</em>, her third full-length, that brought Olsen to a wider audience, breaking the <em>Billboard</em> top 50 and landing her high-profile festival slots at Glastonbury and Primavera. In an era when pop careers go stratospheric on the strength of a single track, such a gradual rise seems positively old-fashioned \u2013 but that\u2019s only fitting for an artist who takes much of her musical inspiration, along with a penchant for beehive hairstyles and sequinned dresses, from the middle decades of the 20th century.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JLRDouvsy4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7JLRDouvsy4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JLRDouvsy4\">Watch Angel Olsen perform Chance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Last October, Olsen released <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/06/angel-olsen-all-mirrors-review\" title=\"\">All Mirrors</a></em>, her biggest, boldest album to date. A brooding, synth-laden opus that harnesses the full firepower of a 12-piece string section, it has been universally acclaimed \u2013 for Olsen\u2019s risk-taking as much as the shimmering beauty of her arrangements. \u201cIt\u2019s an album that keeps taking ostensibly recognisable musical forms and twisting them out of shape into something challenging and intriguing,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/03/angel-olsen-all-mirrors-review\" title=\"\">wrote the Guardian\u2019s Alexis Petridis</a>.</p> <p>We meet in Lisbon, where Olsen has just kicked off a three-week European tour to promote the album, culminating with three English dates and a Valentine\u2019s Day finale in Glasgow. Last night at Capit\u00f3lio, a cuboid art deco building in the city\u2019s theatre district, Olsen and her six-piece band made a heroic effort to reproduce the orchestral swoon of <em>All Mirrors</em> in a live setting. The thousand or so audience members may not have noticed a few rough edges in the performance, but Olsen felt the need to account for it. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little loose tonight,\u201d she confessed at one point in the set. \u201cWe haven\u2019t played together for a month.\u201d</p> <p>The next morning, when we meet at a kiosk on Pra\u00e7a das Flores, last night\u2019s niggles are still playing on her mind. I try to reassure her by saying that slightly imperfect live shows are often more interesting than fully polished ones, but I\u2019m not certain this has the desired effect.</p> <p>It probably doesn\u2019t help that she\u2019s a little bleary-eyed from post-show birthday celebrations \u2013 Olsen turned 33 yesterday and her band marked it by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B7qlsH-hHO7/\" title=\"\">lighting candles</a> in a plateful of Portuguese custard tarts. \u201cWe had a nightcap afterwards and then I realised it was three o\u2019clock,\u201d she winces as I order her an emergency cappuccino.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1db07d3e0b74b426e58ee685666b0a00ac532b84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1db07d3e0b74b426e58ee685666b0a00ac532b84/0_0_1427_2135/668.jpg\" alt=\"Angel Olsen\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All Mirrors felt like the end of a chapter\u2019: Angel Olsen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron McCool</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We retreat to a quieter part of the square, away from the traffic, and settle on a weather-beaten bench where Olsen chats freely about the pitfalls of touring and the occasional excesses of her fans, a number of whom have had her face tattooed on their bodies (\u201cThat\u2019s really weird to me,\u201d she says). In person, she is warm, funny \u2013 and impressively composed, considering the lack of sleep. She tells me she felt nervous last night, but on stage Olsen struck me as imperturbable, even when the entire room interrupted her to sing happy birthday.</p> <p>Unlike many musicians, she doesn\u2019t seem to mind discussing the (often very intimate) experiences that feed into her songwriting. Later, as we talk about the painful genesis of <em>All Mirrors</em>, I ask if she ever finds herself thinking, in the middle of a full-blown romantic crisis, that she might get some good material from it.</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd I think that anyone who dares to date an artist or a writer shouldn\u2019t be surprised if they end up in their art in some form.\u201d</p> <p>Does she ever get people saying: \u201cThat was about me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had people ask, and then I say: \u2018Huh.\u2019\u201d Long pause. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s interesting that you think that.\u2019\u201d She deploys her finest withering stare. \u201c\u2018Hmm\u2026 I do care about you but\u2026 No. It has nothing to do with you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><em>All Mirrors</em> contains plenty of material to get ex-partners in a lather, but right now Olsen\u2019s concerns are focused on the tour ahead. It can be tough going, she says. You don\u2019t know when your next laundry opportunity will be. You end up drinking terrible coffee at motorway service stations. After eight solid weeks on the road in late 2016, she says: \u201cI was not fun to be around. I was drinking a lot. And I just felt so responsible for everyone\u2019s happiness.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t feel the need to get crazy drunk any more. My life is calm. But I almost miss the drama a little bit. You know?</p> <footer> <cite>Angel Olsen</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The secret of a successful tour, she has learned, is to keep it short. \u201cFive weeks max. You take the financial hit, so that people aren\u2019t struggling. I really have to consider the people who are playing with me and how [too much time on the road] affects their lives. But I also don\u2019t want to be gone that long. I don\u2019t want to hate playing music.\u201d</p> <p>Learning hard lessons, and taking charge of her life to minimise future bitterness, is one of the central themes of the latest album. After <em>My Woman</em> came out, as Miley Cyrus et al were queuing up to show their love, Olsen went through a painful breakup with a boyfriend she would rather not name. Around the same time, she started reassessing old friendships that were causing her more grief than happiness.</p> <p>\u201cI spent a lot of time feeling really bitter and disappointed about the way people in my life saw me or interpreted me,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, <em>All Mirrors</em> is about letting go of toxic relationships, and also forgiving yourself for making mistakes, and not expecting that everyone is measuring you the way you\u2019re measuring yourself. And if some people are, do you really need them around?\u201d</p> <p>This subject is blown up to near-operatic proportions on <em>All Mirrors\u2019s</em> opening track, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uaN60k0-zY\" title=\"\">Lark</a>, in which Olsen lets rip at a partner who professes his devotion even as he moves to smother her creative ambitions. \u201cYou say you love/ Every single part,\u201d she sings over a cascade of wailing strings. \u201cWhat about my dreams? What about the heart?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aceffd33d96a13310a07d700d4da3cf57cfdb237\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aceffd33d96a13310a07d700d4da3cf57cfdb237/0_274_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angel Olsen backstage on her 2017 tour with superfans Miley Ray Cyrus (left) and Sarah Barthel of Phantogram.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angel Olsen backstage on her 2017 tour with superfans Miley Ray Cyrus (left) and Sarah Barthel of Phantogram.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: twitter / @minmaxmgmt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Olsen\u2019s dream of making music, and the single-minded focus she applied to it, arrived early. Adopted aged three by a couple who had fostered her soon after her birth, she grew up in St Louis, a midwestern city she remembers as \u201ckind of depressing\u201d. Her family were poor, relying on her father\u2019s income from the car manufacturer Chrysler, but she had access to guitar and piano lessons \u2013 \u201cand I did end up going to rock shows at a really young age,\u201d she says, \u201cso that was fun\u201d.</p> <p>Her adoptive parents, who already had seven children, were much older \u2013 they are now in their 70s and 80s \u2013 and Olsen recalls searching for ways to bridge the generation gap. \u201cI started listening to music from the time they grew up in,\u201d she says (the influence of artists such as Patsy Cline and Roy Orbison is often discerned in her work). \u201cI was trying to understand my parents a little bit and think about what they would have been like at my age.\u201d</p> <p>She also began making music of her own. \u201cI had a little Panasonic handheld tape recorder that I would take everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I was pretty private about it. My mom would say: \u2018I heard you working on a song, that sounds nice.\u2019 And I\u2019d be like\u201d \u2013 she adopts a stern expression \u2013 \u201c\u2018Please don\u2019t listen. I\u2019m working on it. It\u2019s not done yet.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Moving to Chicago aged 20, she enrolled in and dropped out of a massage therapy course, released an EP on cassette, and fell in with folk eccentric <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/30/angel-olsen-learn-someone-elses-songs-bonnie-prince-billy\" title=\"\">Will Oldham</a>, who recruited her to perform in his covers band the Babblers and sing backing vocals for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bonnie-prince-billy\" title=\"\">Bonnie \u201cPrince\u201d Billy</a> alias.</p> <p>By the time she released her debut album, Olsen\u2019s voice seemed fully formed: she sang about death and betrayal with an intimacy that made her listeners feel like she was confiding in them directly. But with each subsequent record her sound took an unexpected leap. Whereas <em>Burn Your Fire</em> fizzed with a lo-fi rock energy, its successor was more polished, more immediate, veering towards full-on pop on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nleRCBhLr3k\" title=\"\">Shut Up Kiss Me</a>, still Olsen\u2019s most popular track (and the one she most resents having to play live).</p> <p>\u201cFor <em>My Woman</em>, I was like, I want to make a classic rock\u2019n\u2019roll record,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to have all these crazy harmonies and make it sound like something from the 60s or 70s.\u201d With <em>All Mirrors</em>, by contrast, she had no such plans. \u201cThe pieces were coming in one day at a time. It was really scary. I also knew that this material wasn\u2019t as happy or upbeat and it wasn\u2019t going to be immediate with some of my fans who loved the previous record.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c<em>All Mirrors</em> felt like an end of a chapter in a way,\u201d says Olsen. The album moves from the fury and anguish of Lark to the realisation, on Tonight, that being in a relationship isn\u2019t a necessary precondition for happiness. \u201cI like the life that I lead,\u201d she sings breathily in the opening verse, before delivering the crushing payoff: \u201cWithout you.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjt698Zv5jQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jjt698Zv5jQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjt698Zv5jQ\">Watch the video for All Mirrors by Angel Olsen.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A big moment on this path, for Olsen, was buying herself a house in Asheville, the easygoing North Carolina city she moved to in 2013. Having a place of her own to retreat to after weeks on the road underlined for Olsen the pleasures of solitude.</p> <p>\u201cI joke around about it, but I just don\u2019t really want anyone in my house,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to wake up next to me. In my mind I\u2019d be thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t wait till you leave so I can shower and play the music I want.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s in no rush to get into another romantic tangle \u2013 and anyway, she laughs: \u201cThe dating scene in Asheville is pretty bleak. It\u2019s like: \u2018Did we date already? Or was it my friend that dated you?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she goes on, \u201cmaybe there will be some more drama in my life later. But I don\u2019t really feel the need to get crazy drunk any more. I don\u2019t want to go out all the time. I feel boring. My life is calm. And that\u2019s good. But I almost miss the drama like a little bit. You know? Paul, who is playing guitar with me, was like: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, something dramatic will happen to you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>We get on to talking about politics, where there is an excess of drama at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a TV show,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the world is a TV show, with alt-right leaders. And they\u2019re all like trying to be like each other. It\u2019s really strange. But at the same time, I\u2019ve personally seen a lot of younger people become more political. That makes me happy. It makes me look forward to the next election in the US. I have some hope.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e984b958c09f57766a2a5b72a967d0e07c23512\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e984b958c09f57766a2a5b72a967d0e07c23512/1359_1025_3946_2368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angel Olsen performing in Lisbon last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I hope to keep growing as an artist\u2019: Angel Olsen performing in Lisbon last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vera Marmelo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does she see a Democratic candidate who could deliver on that hope?</p> <p>\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d She seems reluctant to specify, so I prompt her. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m for Bernie,\u201d she says. \u201cBut of course, we have to keep him alive for a while.\u201d</p> <p>She sighs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard.

Christina Hendricks, of Mad Men fame, came to a concert in Los Angeles and swayed along to Olsen\u2019s smouldering, deeply felt folk-rock. She stuck around to say hello afterwards, as did the actor Brie Larson, who proved herself to be, in Olsen\u2019s assessment, \u201csuper down-to-earth and really normal and just chill\u201d. Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, called up ahead of one LA gig and was duly granted a parking space, her own green room and a prime viewing position at the side of the stage. \u201cIt was really sweet,\u201d Olsen recalls. \u201cShe took selfies with everybody, with my record in her mouth. I was like: \u2018This is so stupid!\u2019 It was a fun time.\u201d You\u2019d think the Missouri-born singer-songwriter, who had built up a passionate following but was still at a remove from the mainstream, would have been gratified by all this starry attention. But Olsen, who has a bone-dry sense of humour, which she expresses in perfect deadpan, recalls the surge of interest that followed My Woman with a raised eyebrow. \u201cThere were a lot of people coming out of the woodwork going: \u2018I loved the My Woman record.\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018Yeah\u2026\u2019\u201d She affects to look supremely unmoved. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve made records before.\u2019\u201d By then, Olsen had been putting out music for the best part of a decade. She released her first solo EP in 2010 and followed it with an album of raw, acoustic folk songs entitled Half Way Home. On 2014\u2019s Burn Your Fire for No Witness, she shifted up a gear, embracing the buzz of electric guitars and giving full vent to her extraordinary, multifaceted voice. The NME gave the record 9/10 and called it \u201csublime\u201d, while Pitchfork, rounding up the best albums of the past decade in December, ranked it at No 26. But it was My Woman, her third full-length, that brought Olsen to a wider audience, breaking the Billboard top 50 and landing her high-profile festival slots at Glastonbury and Primavera. In an era when pop careers go stratospheric on the strength of a single track, such a gradual rise seems positively old-fashioned \u2013 but that\u2019s only fitting for an artist who takes much of her musical inspiration, along with a penchant for beehive hairstyles and sequinned dresses, from the middle decades of the 20th century. Last October, Olsen released All Mirrors, her biggest, boldest album to date. A brooding, synth-laden opus that harnesses the full firepower of a 12-piece string section, it has been universally acclaimed \u2013 for Olsen\u2019s risk-taking as much as the shimmering beauty of her arrangements. \u201cIt\u2019s an album that keeps taking ostensibly recognisable musical forms and twisting them out of shape into something challenging and intriguing,\u201d wrote the Guardian\u2019s Alexis Petridis. We meet in Lisbon, where Olsen has just kicked off a three-week European tour to promote the album, culminating with three English dates and a Valentine\u2019s Day finale in Glasgow. Last night at Capit\u00f3lio, a cuboid art deco building in the city\u2019s theatre district, Olsen and her six-piece band made a heroic effort to reproduce the orchestral swoon of All Mirrors in a live setting. The thousand or so audience members may not have noticed a few rough edges in the performance, but Olsen felt the need to account for it. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little loose tonight,\u201d she confessed at one point in the set. \u201cWe haven\u2019t played together for a month.\u201d The next morning, when we meet at a kiosk on Pra\u00e7a das Flores, last night\u2019s niggles are still playing on her mind. I try to reassure her by saying that slightly imperfect live shows are often more interesting than fully polished ones, but I\u2019m not certain this has the desired effect. It probably doesn\u2019t help that she\u2019s a little bleary-eyed from post-show birthday celebrations \u2013 Olsen turned 33 yesterday and her band marked it by lighting candles in a plateful of Portuguese custard tarts. \u201cWe had a nightcap afterwards and then I realised it was three o\u2019clock,\u201d she winces as I order her an emergency cappuccino. We retreat to a quieter part of the square, away from the traffic, and settle on a weather-beaten bench where Olsen chats freely about the pitfalls of touring and the occasional excesses of her fans, a number of whom have had her face tattooed on their bodies (\u201cThat\u2019s really weird to me,\u201d she says). In person, she is warm, funny \u2013 and impressively composed, considering the lack of sleep. She tells me she felt nervous last night, but on stage Olsen struck me as imperturbable, even when the entire room interrupted her to sing happy birthday. Unlike many musicians, she doesn\u2019t seem to mind discussing the (often very intimate) experiences that feed into her songwriting. Later, as we talk about the painful genesis of All Mirrors, I ask if she ever finds herself thinking, in the middle of a full-blown romantic crisis, that she might get some good material from it. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd I think that anyone who dares to date an artist or a writer shouldn\u2019t be surprised if they end up in their art in some form.\u201d Does she ever get people saying: \u201cThat was about me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had people ask, and then I say: \u2018Huh.\u2019\u201d Long pause. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s interesting that you think that.\u2019\u201d She deploys her finest withering stare. \u201c\u2018Hmm\u2026 I do care about you but\u2026 No. It has nothing to do with you.\u2019\u201d All Mirrors contains plenty of material to get ex-partners in a lather, but right now Olsen\u2019s concerns are focused on the tour ahead. It can be tough going, she says. You don\u2019t know when your next laundry opportunity will be. You end up drinking terrible coffee at motorway service stations. After eight solid weeks on the road in late 2016, she says: \u201cI was not fun to be around. I was drinking a lot. And I just felt so responsible for everyone\u2019s happiness.\u201d The secret of a successful tour, she has learned, is to keep it short. \u201cFive weeks max. You take the financial hit, so that people aren\u2019t struggling. I really have to consider the people who are playing with me and how [too much time on the road] affects their lives. But I also don\u2019t want to be gone that long. I don\u2019t want to hate playing music.\u201d Learning hard lessons, and taking charge of her life to minimise future bitterness, is one of the central themes of the latest album. After My Woman came out, as Miley Cyrus et al were queuing up to show their love, Olsen went through a painful breakup with a boyfriend she would rather not name. Around the same time, she started reassessing old friendships that were causing her more grief than happiness. \u201cI spent a lot of time feeling really bitter and disappointed about the way people in my life saw me or interpreted me,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, All Mirrors is about letting go of toxic relationships, and also forgiving yourself for making mistakes, and not expecting that everyone is measuring you the way you\u2019re measuring yourself. And if some people are, do you really need them around?\u201d This subject is blown up to near-operatic proportions on All Mirrors\u2019s opening track, Lark, in which Olsen lets rip at a partner who professes his devotion even as he moves to smother her creative ambitions. \u201cYou say you love/ Every single part,\u201d she sings over a cascade of wailing strings. \u201cWhat about my dreams? What about the heart?\u201d Olsen\u2019s dream of making music, and the single-minded focus she applied to it, arrived early. Adopted aged three by a couple who had fostered her soon after her birth, she grew up in St Louis, a midwestern city she remembers as \u201ckind of depressing\u201d. Her family were poor, relying on her father\u2019s income from the car manufacturer Chrysler, but she had access to guitar and piano lessons \u2013 \u201cand I did end up going to rock shows at a really young age,\u201d she says, \u201cso that was fun\u201d. Her adoptive parents, who already had seven children, were much older \u2013 they are now in their 70s and 80s \u2013 and Olsen recalls searching for ways to bridge the generation gap. \u201cI started listening to music from the time they grew up in,\u201d she says (the influence of artists such as Patsy Cline and Roy Orbison is often discerned in her work). \u201cI was trying to understand my parents a little bit and think about what they would have been like at my age.\u201d She also began making music of her own. \u201cI had a little Panasonic handheld tape recorder that I would take everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I was pretty private about it. My mom would say: \u2018I heard you working on a song, that sounds nice.\u2019 And I\u2019d be like\u201d \u2013 she adopts a stern expression \u2013 \u201c\u2018Please don\u2019t listen. I\u2019m working on it. It\u2019s not done yet.\u2019\u201d Moving to Chicago aged 20, she enrolled in and dropped out of a massage therapy course, released an EP on cassette, and fell in with folk eccentric Will Oldham, who recruited her to perform in his covers band the Babblers and sing backing vocals for his Bonnie \u201cPrince\u201d Billy alias. By the time she released her debut album, Olsen\u2019s voice seemed fully formed: she sang about death and betrayal with an intimacy that made her listeners feel like she was confiding in them directly. But with each subsequent record her sound took an unexpected leap. Whereas Burn Your Fire fizzed with a lo-fi rock energy, its successor was more polished, more immediate, veering towards full-on pop on Shut Up Kiss Me, still Olsen\u2019s most popular track (and the one she most resents having to play live). \u201cFor My Woman, I was like, I want to make a classic rock\u2019n\u2019roll record,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to have all these crazy harmonies and make it sound like something from the 60s or 70s.\u201d With All Mirrors, by contrast, she had no such plans. \u201cThe pieces were coming in one day at a time. It was really scary. I also knew that this material wasn\u2019t as happy or upbeat and it wasn\u2019t going to be immediate with some of my fans who loved the previous record.\u201d \u201cAll Mirrors felt like an end of a chapter in a way,\u201d says Olsen. The album moves from the fury and anguish of Lark to the realisation, on Tonight, that being in a relationship isn\u2019t a necessary precondition for happiness. \u201cI like the life that I lead,\u201d she sings breathily in the opening verse, before delivering the crushing payoff: \u201cWithout you.\u201d A big moment on this path, for Olsen, was buying herself a house in Asheville, the easygoing North Carolina city she moved to in 2013. Having a place of her own to retreat to after weeks on the road underlined for Olsen the pleasures of solitude. \u201cI joke around about it, but I just don\u2019t really want anyone in my house,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to wake up next to me. In my mind I\u2019d be thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t wait till you leave so I can shower and play the music I want.\u2019\u201d She\u2019s in no rush to get into another romantic tangle \u2013 and anyway, she laughs: \u201cThe dating scene in Asheville is pretty bleak. It\u2019s like: \u2018Did we date already? Or was it my friend that dated you?\u2019 \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she goes on, \u201cmaybe there will be some more drama in my life later. But I don\u2019t really feel the need to get crazy drunk any more. I don\u2019t want to go out all the time. I feel boring. My life is calm. And that\u2019s good. But I almost miss the drama like a little bit. You know? Paul, who is playing guitar with me, was like: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, something dramatic will happen to you.\u2019\u201d We get on to talking about politics, where there is an excess of drama at the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s like a TV show,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the world is a TV show, with alt-right leaders. And they\u2019re all like trying to be like each other. It\u2019s really strange. But at the same time, I\u2019ve personally seen a lot of younger people become more political. That makes me happy. It makes me look forward to the next election in the US. I have some hope.\u201d Does she see a Democratic candidate who could deliver on that hope? \u201cYes, I think so.\u201d She seems reluctant to specify, so I prompt her. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m for Bernie,\u201d she says. \u201cBut of course, we have to keep him alive for a while.\u201d She sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. And it\u2019s a weird time to be self-promotional about your record and to go on tour and pretend that these things aren\u2019t affecting you on a daily basis.\u201d But doesn\u2019t music have the ability to help in some way? \u201cI think it does.\u201d She nods. \u201cI think music has always been used as a way of healing, of encouraging people to take a moment and be reflective.\u201d One piece of music that affected her recently is by the American soul singer Alice Smith. \u201cMy friend showed me her live performance on YouTube, a cover of I Put a Spell on You. It\u2019s insane. It\u2019s been a long time since I saw or heard something like that. It\u2019s really, really special. When I hear performances like that, I\u2019m like: \u2018OK, I need to go home and work on my shit.\u2019\u201d Which brings us to the question of goals. Now that she\u2019s reached the end of a chapter with All Mirrors, and bought herself a house, and a cat, and resolved a bunch of issues and achieved some calm in her life, what\u2019s driving her? What are her musical ambitions going forward? \u201cI\u2019m just happy it\u2019s lasted this long,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope to keep growing as an artist, and it\u2019s really cool to see that people want to come and listen to my music. But I don\u2019t really want to be a pop star. I don\u2019t want to merge into that world. It\u2019s fun to collaborate with pop stars sometimes\u201d \u2013 she recorded a track, True Blue, with Mark Ronson last summer \u2013 \u201cand have a good time, and joke with people about it\u2026\u201d But in terms of exposure, has she reached a level she\u2019s satisfied with? Is she happy to continue attracting celebrities to her shows without actually becoming one herself? She doesn\u2019t give it a second\u2019s thought. \u201cYeah,\u201d she says flatly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if my label or manager would agree, but yeah. I would be OK with that.\u201d Angel Olsen plays Bristol, London, Manchester and Glasgow, 10-14 Feb. All Mirrors is out now on Jagjaguwar",

While globally there were more than 14,000 cases of coronavirus, and more than 300 deaths as of Sunday afternoon, there are still just 12 confirmed cases of the virus in Australia \u2013 four in New South Wales, four in Victoria, two in Queensland, and two in South Australia. Health minister Greg Hunt said three of those in NSW have been discharged from hospital having been cleared. See this explainer to find out how this coronavirus spreads and how to protect yourself. What travel restrictions apply between Australia and China? On Saturday evening, prime minister Scott Morrison announced that except for Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family, legal guardians and spouses, anyone travelling from or through China to Australia will not be allowed to enter in a bid to contain coronavirus. The federal government cancelled the visas of 71 people who were attempting to fly out of China to Australia overnight, as the travel ban took effect. People on flights that were in transit when the policy change was announced were allowed to enter Australia. More than 700 people arrived in Melbourne and at least 70 in Brisbane, according to Australian Border Force commissioner Michael Outram. \u201cThey\u2019ve been met on those flights by biosecurity officers, and they\u2019ve been asked questions and they\u2019ve been subject to health screening, including by state and territory health officials,\u201d he said. \u201cA small number of people, as I understand it, were then taken for further screening at a hospital, but that\u2019s a handful \u2013 two or three.\u201d Twelve flights out of China to Australia have been cancelled since the travel ban was put in place. Outram said any non-citizen or non-resident who arrives in Australia having travelled through China will have their visa cancelled and they will be put into detention for the quarantine period. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said the extreme measure was taken in order to contain the spread of the virus. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to contain the spread of the virus in Australia. We don\u2019t apologise, but we do understand that this could be a significant imposition on many people.\u201d Have Australians in Hubei province been evacuated? The government is still attempting to get about 600 Australian citizens or permanent residents in the Hubei province back to Australia. They will still be taken to Christmas Island for a 14-day quarantine period, once China has agreed to allow a flight in. An Australian medical assistance team and a mobile hospital has arrived on Christmas Island, and the flight to collect people from Wuhan is expected to leave in the next 24 hours. Hunt said it wasn\u2019t expected any of these people would have coronavirus, but the medical team was prepared for that. The airline crew that will fly in to Wuhan will not be required to be quarantined, but will be wearing face masks and gloves during the flight, and will be subject to a health screening upon arrival in Australia. Will people be charged for their evacuation? The government has backed down on plans to charge people up to $1,000 to be evacuated to Christmas Island, with treasurer Josh Frydenberg telling the ABC that the department of foreign affairs gave the government incorrect information about the charge. \u201cWe won\u2019t be charging. Those people will be able to come to Australia with no cost incurred,\u201d he said. This came despite home affairs minister Peter Dutton saying an hour earlier that people would still be charged. The government had said previous governments had charged for airlifts such as those run out of Lebanon in 2006, and Egypt in 2011. But that claim was contradicted by Julia Gillard, who was prime minister at the time, and Kevin Rudd, who was foreign minister. Is there medical advice for travel to any other country? No. Australians have been told not to travel to China, but Dutton went one step further and suggested Australians about to leave for any overseas holiday should reconsider their travel. The chief medical officer said the medical advice around travel was currently limited to China. What is the advice for students attending school or university? Prior to 1 February, students who had travelled from the Hubei province were told to stay home for a 14-day quarantine period. From 1 February, this now extends to any student who has travelled from mainland China on or since 1 February.",
