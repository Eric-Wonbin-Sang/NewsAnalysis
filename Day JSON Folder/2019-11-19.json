      "bodyText": "No sooner had the cameras stopped recording Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson than their proxies rushed on to the airwaves to reinforce their messages. Labour figures stressed the laughter at Johnson\u2019s claim that he was truthful, while senior Tories repeatedly attacked Corbyn for failing to give an answer to how he would campaign on Brexit. And they were much punchier than their bosses. Dawn Butler, a senior Labour shadow minister, spilled over with frustration as she laid into Johnson, accusing him of putting himself before the country. \u201cLet\u2019s tell the country the truth. I am so irritated by that man, I cannot tell you,\u201d she said. Barry Gardiner, the shadow energy secretary, said Johnson was guilty of \u201clie, after lie, after lie\u201d, while Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, condemned the prime minister for \u201crefusing to answer a question straight and trying to make every question about Brexit when this is a general election.\u201d Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, claimed that Corbyn \u201cfailed to answer the central question on Brexit nine times\u201d.

Appearing on television beside Corbyn\u2019s campaign coordinator, Andrew Gwynne, he argued Corbyn would soon be out of a job and his fellow Labour guest would make a more successful replacement. As well as attacking Labour over Brexit, senior Tories had been instructed to bring up Corbyn\u2019s policy of a four-day week without prompting, indicating they do not believe voters find the offer attractive. Spinners for both the leaders claimed to be happy with their performances, which contained no breakthrough moments or debilitating gaffes. The Tories were privately pleased as they felt Corbyn\u2019s appearance would not move the dial with the national polls, while Labour was very happy about its leader\u2019s opportunity to confront Johnson with papers suggesting the NHS would be up for discussion in trade talks with the US.

The way she tells it in her new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/nothing-new-a-history-of-second-hand\">Nothing New: A History of Second-Hand</a></em>, the Industrial Revolution changed everything. Before then most of humanity wore secondhand. \u201cThere was a limited amount of stuff to go around,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Once factory-made clothes came on the market, \u201cpeople were encouraged to buy new stuff and to want new stuff and to afford new stuff,\u201d Annear says. The quality wasn\u2019t always amazing, but new clothes were marketed as respectable, hygienic, even patriotic. Of course, they were also on budget, and on-trend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/nov/06/how-to-look-modern-in-vintage\">How to look modern in vintage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because the new stuff looked so new, it made the old stuff look <em>old</em>. So secondhand became a charity case, fit only for those who had no other choice. In the popular western imagination, old clothes symbolised poverty or sloppiness or neglect. The taint of the op-shop lingered worse than the whiff of mothballs.</p> <p>But now that stereotype has grown a bit old too. <a href=\"https://www.thredup.com/resale\">One recent study</a> from the US online thrifting platform thredUP predicted that America\u2019s secondhand apparel market will double in the five years from 2018 (US$24bn) to 2023 (US$51bn). This includes everything from op-shops, garage sales and flea markets to the higher end of vintage resale: curated boutiques online and off which might stock designer labels or otherwise covetable stuff.</p> <p>So what makes secondhand work for 21st-century eyes used to novelty and mass production? The thredUP model is geared towards an Instagram-friendly, outfit of the day churn, where customers update their looks fast. Ownership doesn\u2019t last forever. The secondhand outfit is purchased, worn, enjoyed, uploaded to socials, and then recycled back into the sales network.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/oct/09/i-go-with-my-instincts-queen-of-vintage-kate-moss-on-how-to-shop-secondhand\">\u2018I go with my instincts\u2019: queen of vintage Kate Moss on how to shop secondhand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Likewise the rise of Instagram resellers, such as Melbournes <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/the_drobe/\">The Drobe</a>, or curated clothing exchanges such as <a href=\"https://swop.net.au\">SWOP</a>, bring some of that shiny newness to the act of shopping for secondhand threads. And more certainty to wearing them, too. Those of us who lack the confidence to style ourselves in an oppie outfit can shop pre-approved secondhand looks curated by people who are professionally far more modish.</p> <p>Annear says we\u2019re now in \u201cpeak secondhand\u201d. Consumers are driven by a desire for sustainability, sure. But they\u2019re also being tempted by barely worn wares. \u201cA lot more people have twigged to the fact that the stuff in secondhand shops is barely used and not necessarily \u2018old\u2019,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5B1YYMhYCz/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Thanks to @mattfitza for making me a weird shoe to hold the remote in place. \ud83d\udc9b // Come mend with me! Enrolments are now open for my next mending masterclass, Tuesday nights in July and August in Thornbury (link in profile). Learn stitching, patching, darning, machine darning, needle felting and heaps of miscellaneous tricks like covering stains with fabric paint. The last three terms sold out weeks in advance, so be quick if you don&#39;t want to miss out. // Did you know I also have a Facebook group where you can crowdsource the answers to specific mending questions? It&#39;s called Modern Mending Club and anyone can join - I&#39;ve popped the link in my profile.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/erinlewisfitzgerald/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Erin Lewis-Fitzgerald</a> (@erinlewisfitzgerald) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-06-10T12:40:32+00:00\">Jun 10, 2019 at 5:40am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe interest is definitely growing very quickly around the world with what other people are doing with their mending,\u201d Lewis-Fitzgerald says. Closer to home, the event marketing website Eventbrite reports that clothing swap events and repair courses have grown 296% over the past five years. Lewis-Fitzgerald\u2019s advice to would-be remakers is to do your research, get creative and practise. She also acknowledges that not everyone has the time, patience or skills to mend their own clothes. That\u2019s when your local clothing alterations and repair shop can come in handy. Or perhaps a helpful bottle of fabric dye.</p> <p>In 2019 \u201csecondhandness\u201d is really a state of mind. Things that aren\u2019t new aren\u2019t necessarily old. And with a bit of clever stitching old things can be made better than new.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5CJMWqAV-W/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "When it comes to fashion, we didn\u2019t always have a fetish for newness. Just ask historian Robyn Annear. The way she tells it in her new book, Nothing New: A History of Second-Hand, the Industrial Revolution changed everything. Before then most of humanity wore secondhand. \u201cThere was a limited amount of stuff to go around,\u201d she says. Once factory-made clothes came on the market, \u201cpeople were encouraged to buy new stuff and to want new stuff and to afford new stuff,\u201d Annear says. The quality wasn\u2019t always amazing, but new clothes were marketed as respectable, hygienic, even patriotic. Of course, they were also on budget, and on-trend. Because the new stuff looked so new, it made the old stuff look old. So secondhand became a charity case, fit only for those who had no other choice. In the popular western imagination, old clothes symbolised poverty or sloppiness or neglect. The taint of the op-shop lingered worse than the whiff of mothballs. But now that stereotype has grown a bit old too. One recent study from the US online thrifting platform thredUP predicted that America\u2019s secondhand apparel market will double in the five years from 2018 (US$24bn) to 2023 (US$51bn). This includes everything from op-shops, garage sales and flea markets to the higher end of vintage resale: curated boutiques online and off which might stock designer labels or otherwise covetable stuff. So what makes secondhand work for 21st-century eyes used to novelty and mass production? The thredUP model is geared towards an Instagram-friendly, outfit of the day churn, where customers update their looks fast. Ownership doesn\u2019t last forever. The secondhand outfit is purchased, worn, enjoyed, uploaded to socials, and then recycled back into the sales network. Likewise the rise of Instagram resellers, such as Melbournes The Drobe, or curated clothing exchanges such as SWOP, bring some of that shiny newness to the act of shopping for secondhand threads. And more certainty to wearing them, too. Those of us who lack the confidence to style ourselves in an oppie outfit can shop pre-approved secondhand looks curated by people who are professionally far more modish. Annear says we\u2019re now in \u201cpeak secondhand\u201d. Consumers are driven by a desire for sustainability, sure. But they\u2019re also being tempted by barely worn wares. \u201cA lot more people have twigged to the fact that the stuff in secondhand shops is barely used and not necessarily \u2018old\u2019,\u201d she says. Erin Lewis-Fitzgerald, a mending advocate and author of the upcoming book Modern Mending, seconds this: \u201cWhen someone asks me, \u2018Does it matter if someone wears secondhand clothes?\u2019 The first thing I think is: is anyone gonna know?\u201d Lewis-Fitzgerald\u2019s specialty is visible mending \u2013 clothing repair using fancy stitches or patches that look intentional and stylish rather than frumpy and \u2018make do\u2019. Her aim, she says, is to make old clothes look better than new ones. Which is another way of making secondhand compete with fast fashion. Make it cooler, make it more individual. \u201cThe interest is definitely growing very quickly around the world with what other people are doing with their mending,\u201d Lewis-Fitzgerald says. Closer to home, the event marketing website Eventbrite reports that clothing swap events and repair courses have grown 296% over the past five years. Lewis-Fitzgerald\u2019s advice to would-be remakers is to do your research, get creative and practise. She also acknowledges that not everyone has the time, patience or skills to mend their own clothes. That\u2019s when your local clothing alterations and repair shop can come in handy. Or perhaps a helpful bottle of fabric dye. In 2019 \u201csecondhandness\u201d is really a state of mind. Things that aren\u2019t new aren\u2019t necessarily old. And with a bit of clever stitching old things can be made better than new. Only the wearer knows where that cute linen blouse or on-trend sports coat came from. Or whether that embellishment is hiding an ink stain that won\u2019t come out. It\u2019s up to us whether we broadcast that or not. Some of us claim a certain amount of social cred by crying \u201cOh this? It\u2019s from Salvos!\u201d Some of us aren\u2019t quite there yet. So how do we make secondhand work for us now? We shop smart, we mend and embellish and, if needed, we lie. The cult of newness hasn\u2019t unravelled just yet. But its secondhand challenger isn\u2019t looking too shabby, either.",

Throughout the debate, Johnson continually tried to bring the focus back to Brexit, on which Corbyn repeatedly declined to say how he would campaign in a second EU referendum, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> leader attacked the prime minister over the NHS and public services.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn has used the debate to argue that the institution of the monarchy needs improvement.</strong> The topic came up during a round of quickfire questions, to which short answers were required, and Corbyn was asked if the monarchy was fit for purpose. He replied: \u201cNeeds a bit of improvement.\u201d Replying to the same question, Johnson replied: \u201cThe institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach.\u201d The audience cheered Corbyn\u2019s reply, but Johnson\u2019s left them silent. Both men were then asked specifically about Prince Andrew, but in their answers they both focused primarily on the importance of addressing the needs of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s victims, rather than criticising the prince directly.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A snap poll for YouGov suggests that, by a margin of 51% to 49%, viewers thought Johnson won the debate</strong>.

Johnson may have been focused and effective, but for much of the debate he sounded like a stuck record, constantly returning to a not-entirely-plausible sounding refrain about getting Brexit done, while Corbyn had a wider and uplifting agenda, focusing on health, work and ending austerity. Regardless of the YouGov verdict, one suspects that Labour won\u2019t be disappointed with Corbyn\u2019s performance. The Conservatives are entitled to be relieved, but certainly not overjoyed.</p> \n  <p>What was surprising was how little Johnson had to say on domestic policy. As well as frequently over-running his time, he ended up being reprimanded several times in the second half of the programme (which was not meant to be about Brexit) for returning to his EU withdrawal talking points \u2013 the ones that he usefully telegraphed in advance. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd445868f083aa6d57872ea#block-5dd445868f083aa6d57872ea\">7.44pm.)</a></p> \n  <p>The debate was better-natured than many people might have expected (Julie Etchingham\u2019s decision to get them to shake hands on a good behaviour pledge seemed unnecessary on the night, as well as being of pointless long-term value, and ended up looking like a gimmick). And although this meant the audience never got to see the meaner side of Johnson, it also meant Corbyn got an easier ride than he might have expected. A constant Tory attack line against him is that he is a terrorist sympathiser who sided with Russia over the Salisbury poisonings. There was not a word about that tonight (apart from Brexit, foreign affairs barely featured) and viewers whose only knowledge of Corbyn comes from negative newspaper copy may have been pleasantly surprised. As argued earlier (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd451518f083aa6d578734d#block-5dd451518f083aa6d578734d\">8.36pm)</a>, the most uplifting moment of the debate (there wasn\u2019t a wide choice) was probably his riff about how he would be a leader who listens.</p> \n  <p>There was not a single exchange that defined the whole debate. Corbyn\u2019s \u201cwe have had nine years of chaotic coalition\u201d was a good reply to Johnson\u2019s claim about the threat posed by a Labour/SNP alliance, and Johnson was uncomfortable when being challenged about his record on not keeping his promises. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd44fd98f080fd59fb13729#block-5dd44fd98f080fd59fb13729\">8.28pm.)</a> He could have been pushed much harder on this, given that in the last election he fought, for the Tory leadership, his entire campaign was built around a promise he failed to keep (achieving Brexit by 31 October).</p> \n  <p>But although Corbyn had a broader and more positive message, Johnson did have a clear one \u2013 about Labour delaying Brexit \u2013 and if he kept coming back to this point endlessly, he was doing so for a reason. It might not have been impressive debating, but it was very good message discipline, it was consistent with the whole thrust of the Conservative campaign so far, and it did the trick tonight.

Although debates have been a feature of British elections since 2010, this is the first one featuring just the prime minister and the leader of the opposition.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/the-itv-election-debate-your-complete-guide-to-johnson-v-corbyn\">The ITV election debate: your complete guide to Johnson v Corbyn</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And here are five important things to remember before watching the debate tonight.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) Election debates normally don\u2019t involve much debating. </strong>We call them debates, but in reality they are mostly exercises in soundbite regurgitation, rather than exercises involving rigorous engagement with argument. <strong>David Cameron</strong> explains this well in his autobiography, For the Record, where he writes this about preparing for the 2010 debates.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Bill Knapp and Anita Dunn, the US experts I had hired to help me prepare for the coming ordeal, were brutally frank about the reality I was about to encounter: to my disappointment, they told me that these wouldn\u2019t really be debates at all. You don\u2019t want to engage with your opponents\u2019s argument, you just want to put your own point across. You should focus your efforts on delivering your pre-prepared soundbite down the camera lens. Avoid too much spontaneity in taking apart opponents\u2019 arguments; it\u2019s far too risky. Just get your \u2018zinger - a one-liner destined for the headlines on the news programmes after the show - ready beforehand, and deploy it as soon as you can.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>2) Almost certainly, there won\u2019t be any so-called \u201cknockout blow\u201d.</strong> See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd3f4758f083aa6d5786f54#block-5dd3f4758f083aa6d5786f54\">2.33pm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd41d918f083aa6d578712d#block-5dd41d918f083aa6d578712d\">4.55pm.</a></p> \n  <p><strong>3) And even if there is something approaching a defining moment, the pundits might miss it.</strong> Sometimes a candidate says something in a debate that subsequently gets cited as having a decisive impact on voters - even if that is mostly because it\u2019s an answer that reinforces a negative perception that was already well entrenched. There was a good example in 2015 when Ed Miliband was asked if he thought Labour spent too much when it was last in power, and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IldMnsymDo0\"> he said no. </a>In subsequent analyses of the election, this was seen as an appalling error because it confirmed that Miliband could not be trusted on the economy. But on the night this was not apparent to many pundits, partly because Miliband had made this argument many times before (so, to the commentariat, he was not saying anything new), and party because what he said was true (at least to the extent that Labour\u2019s spending policies did not cause the financial crash, or even have much bearing on how well the UK was equipped to cope with it).</p> \n  <p><strong>4) Any assessment about who \u201cwon\u201d should be treated with some caution.</strong> Sometimes a debate takes place and there is a clear consensus amongst the public, if there is a poll, and amongst commentators as to who won. The best example in British politics is the first leaders\u2019 debate in 2010, which was clearly won by Nick Clegg. But more often the result is less clear-cut, with people\u2019s views as to who did best mostly overlapping with who they supported most in the first place. Boris Johnson easily outperforms Jeremy Corbyn in opinion polls at the moment, and so it is not surprising that a YouGov poll found that more people expect Johnson to perform well tonight than expect Corbyn to perform well tonight.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1196764209733865473\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Who do Britons think is going to perform best in tonight's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ITVdebate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ITVdebate</a>?<br><br>Boris Johnson - 37%<br>Jeremy Corbyn - 23%<br>Don't know - 39%<br><br>YouGov will be releasing a snap poll immediately following the debate to see who people think won, so stay tuned!<a href=\"https://t.co/Y63L92mAe6\">https://t.co/Y63L92mAe6</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/oZpVskC3TH\">pic.twitter.com/oZpVskC3TH</a></p>\u2014 YouGov (@YouGov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1196764209733865473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But the betting companies, which make their forecasts based on where people are placing bets, expect Corbyn to win. YouGov is going to publish a snap poll tonight soon after the debate ends, asking people who performed best, and William Hill, Paddy Power and Coral have all sent out press releases today saying they have Corbyn the narrow favourite to win (ie, in the YouGov poll).</p> \n  <p>How to you explain the discrepancy between the public\u2019s expectations and punters\u2019 expectations? Quite easily. People who place bets on an election tend to follow politics closely, and they may well have noticed that Corbyn is a better debater than people realise. See the New Statesman\u2019s <strong>Stephen Bush</strong> on this at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd41a1b8f083aa6d578710b#block-5dd41a1b8f083aa6d578710b\">4.37pm.</a> Also, because Corbyn is going into this widely perceived as the underdog, it will be easier for him to outperform expectations.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) Even if you do win a debate, it won\u2019t necessarily win you an election. </strong>That\u2019s because elections are decided by multiple factors, and even if a TV debate makes an impact, it is never going to be wholly decisive. Clegg knows this as well as anyone. His debate triumph in 2010 resulted in the Lib Dems soaring in the polls for a few days, and a brief obsession with \u201cCleggmania\u201d (remember that?), but by the end of the election he was more or less back where he started, and his party ended up losing seats.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd42ac38f083aa6d57871e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-19T17:52:54.218Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There are two new polls around this afternoon.</p> \n  <p><strong>YouGov</strong> has the Conservatives 12 points ahead of Labour.

Instead there should be a \u201cperiod of reflection\u201d, McCluskey said. </p> \n  <p>Asked if Corbyn would have to resign if he lost, McCluskey said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, obviously I\u2019m not expecting Jeremy to lose. Jeremy would have to make a decision, along with other sections of the party. We would have to look at things \u2013 that\u2019s why I say a period of reflection. Back in 2015, Ed Miliband resigned the following day. I think that was wrong of him to do that. You always need a period of reflection. </p> \n   <p>The one thing I know about Jeremy Corbyn is that his election four years ago has changed British politics forever, and therefore we need to consider what this all means. We need to consider the election result. If it was a defeat \u2013 a defeat that I\u2019m not expecting \u2013 then we\u2019d have to look at the scale of that, and where it happened. That requires some calm deliberation. </p> \n   <p>So whilst I don\u2019t expect it, I certainly feel that there would have to be a proper debate and discussion.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But McCluskey also insisted that what was on offer in Labour\u2019s manifesto (out on Thursday) was so inspiring that the party deserved to win a massive landslide. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Committing to build a million homes over a decade. Tackling homelessness. Lifting the student debt off our young people\u2019s shoulders. All of these things Labour is promising. The deal that they\u2019re going to put to people is unbelievable. Free prescriptions. Free parking in hospitals, I mean, that might sound small beer, but do you know what? I know, and you\u2019ll know, and everyone reading your thing will know hundreds, thousands of people who\u2019ll be infuriated that they get fleeced every time they go and visit their loved ones who are sick. </p> \n   <p>All of these things add up to an unbelievable offer that Labour is going to be making, one that will transform our society.</p> \n   <p>When you look at Labour\u2019s programme \u2013 oh my god. You would think that we would end up with a massive landslide, because it speaks to so many people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McCluskey\u2019s comment about how the manifesto will contain plans to spare young people from the burden of student debt may be a hint that, as well as abolishing tuition fees, Labour may promise to cut or write off the debts built up since tuition fees were raised to the level of \u00a39,000 a year. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40697326\">Corbyn floated this idea during the 2017 general election campaign</a>, but without making a firm commitment.</p> \n  <p>This morning, in his interview on the Today programme, <strong>John McDonnell</strong>, the shadow chancellor, also hinted that the party might cut debts for students who have already graduated. <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/education/universities/news/108073/labour-manifesto-could-pledge-write-student-debts-john\">As PoliticsHome reports,</a> he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In terms of the system, the debt that has been piled up already, I\u2019ve been trying to say to the government they\u2019ve got a problem here that we\u2019ve all got to accept.

The unprecedented move could cost the NHS between tens and hundreds of millions of pounds. </p> \n  <p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the BMA\u2019s ruling council, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>These proposals under discussion could, if properly implemented, provide the respite needed to enable significant numbers of doctors to increase the work they are doing, giving vital patient care at a time of unprecedented demand. </p> \n   <p>However, we don\u2019t yet have important details about how such a scheme will work; details that are crucial to the BMA and to the tens of thousands of doctors that we represent in order to provide the necessary reassurance that doctors can take on additional work without this resulting in any financial penalty.</p> \n   <p>We look forward to having those details in the very near future, and call on the next government to urgently scrap the annual allowance in defined benefit schemes such as the NHS, a solution proposed by their own advisory body, the Office for Tax Simplification.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>However, EveryDoctor, which campaigns to improve medics\u2019 working conditions in the NHS, dismissed the plan as a \u201cshort-term fix\u201d that would not solve the problem of an estimated 40% of doctors reducing their workloads in order to avoid being hit by a bill for up to \u00a3100,000. </p> \n  <p>A spokesperson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The pressures on the NHS are no longer isolated to the winter months. We are in a constant, spiralling recruitment crisis and the NHS is 10,000 doctors short.</p> \n   <p>Vast swathes of UK doctors have been forced out of work by the 2016 punitive tax rules. A short-term fix to cover the winter period will not solve this problem. The government instead needs to create a long-term, sustainable solution which safeguards the NHS and its hard-working staff.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-19T09:24:21.954Z\">at 9.24am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd3a8da8f083559fb1cdf1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-19T08:37:10.902Z\">8.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Green party is formally launching its manifesto this morning.

Feel free to get in touch: alison.rourke@theguardian.com.</p> \n  <p>First up and NHS bosses have made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/19/nine-in-10-nhs-bosses-say-staffing-crisis-endangering-patients\">dramatic intervention into the campaign</a>, with nine out of 10 saying the staffing crisis is endangering patients.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over which of them is best placed to safeguard the NHS if they win the general election, with the Labour leader accusing the prime minister of being ready to sell it off to US corporations. As my colleagues Heather Stewart, Rowena Mason and Peter Walker report, in a testy live debate on ITV, during which the prime minister repeatedly returned to the claim that he would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, both men lavished praise on the NHS, but Corbyn said Johnson would put it up for sale. Throughout the debate, Johnson continually tried to bring the focus back to Brexit, on which Corbyn repeatedly declined to say how he would campaign in a second EU referendum, while the Labour leader attacked the prime minister over the NHS and public services. Corbyn has used the debate to argue that the institution of the monarchy needs improvement. The topic came up during a round of quickfire questions, to which short answers were required, and Corbyn was asked if the monarchy was fit for purpose. He replied: \u201cNeeds a bit of improvement.\u201d Replying to the same question, Johnson replied: \u201cThe institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach.\u201d The audience cheered Corbyn\u2019s reply, but Johnson\u2019s left them silent. Both men were then asked specifically about Prince Andrew, but in their answers they both focused primarily on the importance of addressing the needs of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s victims, rather than criticising the prince directly. A snap poll for YouGov suggests that, by a margin of 51% to 49%, viewers thought Johnson won the debate. (See 9.10am.) But the same poll found that more people thought Corbyn did better than Johnson \u2013 a different measure \u2013 and, as ITV\u2019s Robert Peston points out, Corbyn did better on this question with Tory supporters than Johnson did with Labour supporters. The Conservatives have been accused of misleading the public after they rebranded their official Twitter account as \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d during the televised leaders\u2019 debate and used it to publish anti-Labour posts. The Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake described this as a tactic worthy of Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. He said: This is straight out of Donald Trump or Putin\u2019s playbook. Not content with excluding the voice of remain from this debate, the Tories are now resorting to deliberately misleading the public. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here are some of the newspaper front pages from tomorrow. And this is what Nigel Farage,the Brexit party leader, said about the ITV debate. Well, there is no doubt that Jeremy Corbyn is a better debater than Boris Johnson. But on the key issue of the day, Brexit, nine times Jeremy Corbyn would not say as prime minister that a second referendum that he\u2019d call, whether he\u2019d vote leave or remain. That is a failure of leadership. Here is Sian Berry, the Green party co-leader, on the ITV debate. She said: I actually can\u2019t believe that climate chaos was relegated to the quickfire round in that debate. That neither of those two men who want to run the country brought it up as part of their main points. This is the most important issue that we face, alongside Brexit, and yet it wasn\u2019t part of the debate. And here is a Guardian panel with verdicts on the debate from Owen Jones, Jonathan Freedland, Katy Balls and Sonia Sodha. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s take on who won. And here is her verdict. Corbyn: The Labour leader gave a solid performance with no big slip-ups, but no breakthrough moment that caught Johnson on the hop. He also did not attack Johnson personally on scandals such as his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri, or having been sacked for lying. Johnson: The Tory spinners will most likely be pleased with his performance, given they sent him out with the primary objective of not creating much news. He was also able to repeatedly press home his key attack lines on Brexit. But they may be worried about his inability to be convincing on matters of trust. Here is my colleague John Crace\u2019s sketch about the debate. And this is how it ends. Yet despite all this, the debate had revealed something. That voters hold both leaders in open contempt and are in despair that one of them will end up as prime minister. Given the chance to show off their best selves, Johnson and Corbyn had merely proved they didn\u2019t have one. The country was even more screwed than anyone had previously imagined. Matthew Smith from YouGov has got a full write-up of its poll findings here. Curiously, although more people thought Boris Johnson won, according to the survey, more people also thought Corbyn did well. That may sound irrational (and often people are irrational), but doing well in a debate is not necessarily the same as winning. And here is Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minster and the SNP leader, on the debate. The clear takeaway for Scotland from this debate is that neither of these men should be able to determine Scotland\u2019s future. Jeremy Corbyn can\u2019t decide if he is leave or remain and Boris Johnson is determined to take Scotland out of the EU against our will. Only a vote for the SNP in this election can help Scotland escape from Brexit \u2013 and secure our right to choose a better future as an independent country. Here is Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, on the debate. People watching at home deserve so much better than what was on offer tonight. Both people on that stage want Brexit and there was no one on that stage arguing to remain in the European Union. Staying in the EU is better for our economy, better for our environment, and better for our NHS. A brighter future is possible, but it is not on offer from either of the two old, tired parties. And here are the more detailed figures from the YouGov poll. YouGov surveyed 1,646 people who watched the debate. Boris Johnson won on Brexit, being prime ministerial, being likeable and government spending. Jeremy Corbyn won on being in touch with ordinary people, on the NHS, on being trustworthy and on other issues. Issues on which Johnson won Who do you think came across as more likeable? 54% Boris Johnson, 37% Jeremy Corbyn, 10% Don\u2019t know Who do you think came across as more prime ministerial? 54% Boris Johnson, 29% Jeremy Corbyn, 17% Don\u2019t know Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on Brexit? 63% Boris Johnson, 27% Jeremy Corbyn, 10% Don\u2019t know Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on government spending? 50% Boris Johnson, 35% Jeremy Corbyn, 15% Don\u2019t know Issues on which Corbyn won Who do you think came across as more trustworthy? 40% Boris Johnson, 45% Jeremy Corbyn, 15% Don\u2019t know Who do you think came across as more in touch with ordinary people? 25% Boris Johnson, 59% Jeremy Corbyn, 16% Don\u2019t know Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on NHS? 38% Boris Johnson, 54% Jeremy Corbyn, 8% Don\u2019t know Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on other issues [ie, not Brexit, NHS or spending]? 39% Boris Johnson, 46% Jeremy Corbyn, 15% Don\u2019t know YouGov has sent out a more detailed news release about its poll. (See 9.10pm.) It points out that the 51% to 49% result is \u201cso close as to be within the margin of error\u201d. And this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the debate. In summary, it\u2019s very mixed. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman From the BBC\u2019s Alex Forsyth From the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne From Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton From the Manchester Evening News\u2019 Jennifer Williams From the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire From Good Morning Britain\u2019s Piers Morgan From the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam From Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From the Observer\u2019s Sonia Sodha Claim: Johnson said Corbyn would \u201cwhack\u201d corporation tax up to the \u201chighest in Europe\u201d. Reality: Corbyn said he would return corporation tax to the levels of 2010 when it was 28%, which would make it one of the highest, but not the highest in the EU. France\u2019s corporation tax is 31% for companies with an annual turnover below \u20ac250m, and 33.33% for companies with an annual turnover of \u20ac250m and above. Combined corporation tax in Germany is between 30% and 33%. A win\u2019s a win, and the YouGov poll probably does give us a reasonably good idea as to what people who were watching the debate this evening felt about it, but it does not necessarily tell the whole story, and 51% to 49% is not much of a margin over someone whom the Tories regularly denounce as being unfit to lead the country. Johnson may have been focused and effective, but for much of the debate he sounded like a stuck record, constantly returning to a not-entirely-plausible sounding refrain about getting Brexit done, while Corbyn had a wider and uplifting agenda, focusing on health, work and ending austerity. Regardless of the YouGov verdict, one suspects that Labour won\u2019t be disappointed with Corbyn\u2019s performance. The Conservatives are entitled to be relieved, but certainly not overjoyed. What was surprising was how little Johnson had to say on domestic policy. As well as frequently over-running his time, he ended up being reprimanded several times in the second half of the programme (which was not meant to be about Brexit) for returning to his EU withdrawal talking points \u2013 the ones that he usefully telegraphed in advance. (See 7.44pm.) The debate was better-natured than many people might have expected (Julie Etchingham\u2019s decision to get them to shake hands on a good behaviour pledge seemed unnecessary on the night, as well as being of pointless long-term value, and ended up looking like a gimmick). And although this meant the audience never got to see the meaner side of Johnson, it also meant Corbyn got an easier ride than he might have expected. A constant Tory attack line against him is that he is a terrorist sympathiser who sided with Russia over the Salisbury poisonings. There was not a word about that tonight (apart from Brexit, foreign affairs barely featured) and viewers whose only knowledge of Corbyn comes from negative newspaper copy may have been pleasantly surprised. As argued earlier (see 8.36pm), the most uplifting moment of the debate (there wasn\u2019t a wide choice) was probably his riff about how he would be a leader who listens. There was not a single exchange that defined the whole debate. Corbyn\u2019s \u201cwe have had nine years of chaotic coalition\u201d was a good reply to Johnson\u2019s claim about the threat posed by a Labour/SNP alliance, and Johnson was uncomfortable when being challenged about his record on not keeping his promises. (See 8.28pm.) He could have been pushed much harder on this, given that in the last election he fought, for the Tory leadership, his entire campaign was built around a promise he failed to keep (achieving Brexit by 31 October). But although Corbyn had a broader and more positive message, Johnson did have a clear one \u2013 about Labour delaying Brexit \u2013 and if he kept coming back to this point endlessly, he was doing so for a reason. It might not have been impressive debating, but it was very good message discipline, it was consistent with the whole thrust of the Conservative campaign so far, and it did the trick tonight. Three weeks on Thursday, it may well work again too. \u201cLeaving politics aside\u201d during the ITV leaders\u2019 debate, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn told the British public what they would get each other for Christmas: Here is the result of the YouGov snap poll. Claim: Boris Johnson said the rate at which Labour would borrow would \u201cpush up interest rates for every household in the country\u201d. Reality: The Conservatives have argued that Labour will spend an additional \u00a31.2tn over five years. However, it did not base its claims on Labour\u2019s manifesto and used estimates that have been disputed as incorrect. The government\u2019s borrowing costs \u2013 interest rates \u2013 are at historical lows and economists do not expect a dramatic rise soon. Both Labour and the Tories plan to raise public spending back to 1970s levels, according to the Resolution Foundation. The outcome of Brexit will also have an impact on interest rates and the government\u2019s budget deficit \u2013 the annual shortfall between income from taxes and government spending. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal will leave the economy \u00a370bn smaller after a decade and would weaken the public finances. Further information here: They are now on final statements. Corbyn urges people to register to vote, and to vote for change. Johnson says we need to get Brexit done. He says if Corbyn cannot answer whether or not he would vote for Brexit, or whether he would do a deal with the SNP, he is not fit to govern. He says he will get Brexit done, and allow parliament to move on to other things. Q: What present would you give each other for Christmas? Corbyn says he would give Johnson a copy of A Christmas Carol. Johnson says he would give Corbyn a copy of his Brexit deal. When Etchingham insists on a non-political gift, he says a pot of damson jam. Q: Which foreign leader do you admire most? The EU27, because they did me a fantastic deal, says Johnson. Corbyn says it is the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, because he is trying to bring people together. Q: Is climate change the biggest crisis facing the UK? Johnson says it is the biggest crisis facing the world. That is why we must get Brexit done. Corbyn says this is the biggest problem for the world. Q: Is the monarchy fit for purpose? It needs a bit of improvement, says Corbyn. Johnson says it is beyond reproach. Q: Is Prince Andrew fit for purpose? Corbyn says we should think about the victims of Jeffrey Epstein first. Johnson agrees. Etchingam points out that all of this depends on what sort of Brexit deal is achieved. She seems to be making the point that comparing domestic spending plans without taking into account what sort of Brexit we will have is a mistake, because that will affect tax revenues. Claim: Boris Johnson claims the Conservatives are \u201cbuilding 40 new hospitals\u201d. Reality: The Conservatives earmarked \u00a33bn earlier this autumn, saying they would build 40 new hospitals. However, it emerged the majority of the funds will go to just six NHS trusts, which each have a major hospital badly in need of rebuilding and have had plans waiting for approval. A further 21 NHS Trusts will get \u00a3100m seed funding between them for building works on 34 hospitals they need for 2025-30. Further details from our colleagues reporting on this in September: Etchingham asks if Johnson has found a magic money tree, and if Corbyn has found more than one of them. Johnson says Corbyn has found a forest of them. Corbyn says the levels of poverty caused by austerity must change. Corbyn says: We are a society of billionaires, and the very poor - neither of which are right. Q: You say there is plenty to spend. But I\u2019m worried you will throw it away on silly election giveaways. What can you say to reassure me? Corbyn says we have had a decade of austerity. He says he wants a \u00a310 an hour living wage. He thinks this election will be a turning point in terms of handling the economy. Johnson says the question was about handling the public finances. He has shelved a corporation tax cut, saving \u00a36bn for public services. He says if we fail to get Brexit done, we will have more deadlock and division. Q: Is austerity over? Corbyn says: We will end austerity. I\u2019m absolutely clear about that. Johnson says he wants a dynamic economy. Corbyn has said he wants to overthrow capitalism. That would be disastrous, he says. Q: Will you rule out privatisation for the NHS? Corbyn says the internal market must go. And social care problems are not being addressed. Q: Will there be a social care policy in the Tory manifesto? Yes, says Johnson. He says no one should have to sell their home to pay for social care. Johnson says nothing could be more ruinous to the NHS than a \u201ccrackpot\u201d four-day working week. Corbyn says Labour\u2019s plan is for shorter working hours across the economy, paid for by productivity increases. This prompts some laughter. Corbyn says shorter working hours are good for people\u2019s health. He says the Johnson claim about there being 40 new hospitals has turned out to be false. Johnson says the government is working on six new hospitals now, but has plans for 40. He says the biggest threat to the NHS is not getting Brexit done. They\u2019re back. And the rest of the questions are on domestic issues. Q: How will you ensure the NHS meets its demands? And should there be any more privatisation? Corbyn says the NHS is under great pressure. Yesterday a friend of his died from secondary breast cancer. She had gone to the hospital earlier, but the nurses had been under pressure. She recorded a video of her experience. This must be the video. Corbyn seems to be getting the upper hand. His worst moment came when the audience laughed as he claimed his Brexit position was clear, and Johnson was pushing him relentlessly on this, but this did not seem quite as bad as Johnson\u2019s unconvincing claims to be someone who keeps his promises. Corbyn has also been strikingly more positive, and his riff about being a leader who listens was about the most uplifting thing in the debate so far (a low bar). Claim: Boris Johnson claims voting in a Labour government would mean two referendums next year, one on the EU and one on Scottish independence. Reality: Labour\u2019s policy is to renegotiate a Brexit deal with the EU and then put it to UK voters in a second referendum within six months. Corbyn did not say which way Labour would campaign. Should Labour fail to win a majority next month, it could need the support of minority parties to form a government, including the Scottish National party. Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants an independence referendum before 2021. However, Corbyn has said he would not allow a vote in the \u201cearly years\u201d of a Labour government. He also says no deals have been struck with the SNP. Q: [To Johnson] You promised 40 times that we would be out of the EU on 31 October. One of your staff once said you had betrayed everyone who worked with you. And, Mr Corbyn, can you take responsibility for antisemitism in your party? Corbyn says antisemitism is a scourge. He has taken steps to deal with it. He understands the desperate history of antisemitism. Johnson says he was \u201copen mouthed\u201d listening to Corbyn. Etchingham asks him to address the points she put to him. Johnson tries to talk about Labour\u2019s Brexit policy. Etchingham tries again, and says the nastiness seems to be getting out of control. Q: Will you promise to improve the nature of debate if you become PM? Corbyn says the recent quality of debate in parliament was horrible. He called for a meeting for it to be improved. Etchtingham asks them both to make this a pledge. They do shake hands. And now we have the ad break. Claim: Jeremy Corbyn says Boris Johnson told the DUP annual conference last year that there would be no border down the Irish Sea and now \u201cwell, there is\u201d. Johnson says \u201cthe contrary\u201d is the case. Reality: Corbyn is correct. Johnson has struck a deal that will keep an invisible border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This, however, will involve some additional paperwork between Northern Ireland and Great Britain on food and agrifood, which the DUP accepted as the price of a deal. But other goods will also be checked. Exactly which ones and the level of checks cannot be decided until the Brexit deal is done and a joint EU-UK committee can work out the details. Etchingham asks about integrity and strength of character. Corbyn says it is about bringing people together. Whether you live in the north or the south, your problems are the same. Johnson says: Look at what I said I would do as a politician, and look at what I have delivered. This a remarkable claim in the light of his failure to meet his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to deliver Brexit by 31 October. Q: Does the truth matter in this election? Johnson replies: I think it does. The audience laugh. Etchingham says they are now turning to trust and leadership. Q: How can we trust you? The questioner gets a round of applause. Q: The debate has become toxic, with an appalling level of lies. How can we trust you to bring this country together? Addressing the questioner by his name, Johnson says that is an important question. The problem was that parliament repeatedly blocked Brexit, he says. He says the way to restore trust is to get Brexit done. Corbyn says trust has to be earned. As an elected representative, you have to listen to people. He has spent a lot of time listening to people, from chief executives to the homeless. Everyone you meet knows something you don\u2019t know. His style is to listen to people, and to bring people together. Johnson says most of Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet have spoken against Corbyn\u2019s deal. Corbyn says Johnson told the DUP conference he would not allow a border down the Irish Sea. But his deal does involve this. Johnson disputes this. Corbyn says, if the SNP want to vote down a Labour government, that is up to them. Johnson says Corbyn has not ruled out a second referendum. He says there would be a \u201cchaotic coalition\u201d between Labour and the SNP. Corbyn says we\u2019ve had nine years of \u201cchaotic coalition\u201d already. That gets a round of applause. Q: Is the union more important than Brexit? Corbyn says he wants to reply to Johnson\u2019s deal. No deals have been done, and no deals will be done. He says he will bring this issue to a close through a referendum. Johnson says the union is the most important thing. Johnson says preserving the union is more important than Brexit. This would not normally be newsworthy, but polls show that for many Tory Brexiters, Brexit is more important than the union. Q: Is the union worth sacrificing for Brexit? Corbyn says he hopes the union does not break up. But Johnson\u2019s deal gives Northern Ireland a different status. There are issues there, he says. This deal is damaging to this country. Johnson claims his deal would keep the whole of the UK together. To get into No 10, Labour will do a deal \u2013 probably have already done a deal \u2013 with the SNP, he claims. And he says the price will be a second Scottish independence referendum. Claim: Jeremy Corbyn claims it will take \u201cat least seven years\u201d to negotiate a UK-US trade deal. Reality: The EU took seven years to negotiate and ratify a deal with Canada, not the US. On average it takes 48 months to do a trade deal. It is highly unlikely that a US deal will be struck until the UK has a new deal with the EU in place. The UK only has 11 months to negotiate a trade deal with the EU, starting on 1 February, because the current deadline is 31 December. However, many expect the transition period during which negotiations will take place to be extended by one or two years. Q: Will you stick to your pledge to get the trade deal done by the end of next year? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Johnson. People said he would not be able to get a deal, but he did. Etchingham asks if he will mint a new coin for December 2020. That gets a round of applause (but not an answer). Johnson again asks if Corbyn will campaign for his own deal. Corbyn says his policy is clear. After the referendum, the process will be at an end. He says Johnson\u2019s government has had secret meetings with the US about opening up the health service to the US. He shows the document about these talks released in the US. Most of it is redacted. Johnson claims this is an \u201cinvention\u201d. The NHS is not for sale. He says this only comes up because Corbyn is ignoring the question as to what side he will campaign on. Corbyn says he has made the position clear. Some in the audience laugh. Johnson says he wants a mandate to govern. But Corbyn wants to strike a new deal, he says. He asks if Corbyn wants to do a deal, and he asks if he will campaign for his own deal. Corbyn says he wants to bring people together. Corbyn repeats the point about a trade deal with the US taking seven years. And he claims Johnson has already indicated this deal would put the NHS at risk. Etchingham says Corbyn ducked the question about whether he would campaign for remain or leave. The Tories have changed the name of their Twitter account - making it highly misleading. UPDATE: Later in the evening they changed the name back, from factcheckUK to CCHQ Press. Our story about the row the change generated is here. Etchingham says the questions come from viewers. Q: Both of you say Brexit will be resolved in the next few months. But there have been so many broken promises. Can you assure me we won\u2019t be talking about Brexit forever. Johnson says he has a deal ready to go, and the UK will come out on 31 January. The UK will come out together. There is a sharp distinction between this, and the \u201cdither and delay\u201d offered by Corbyn. That\u2019s the second time Johnson has used that phrase. Corbyn says he would negotiate a new deal, and have a referendum, with a credible leave option. He says it is \u201cnonsense\u201d to suggest that Johnson would sort out Brexit by January. He says it would take Johnson seven years to negotiate a trade deal with the US. And the US trade deal would be incompatible with a trade deal with the EU. Boris Johnson says there is only one reason to have an election; to remove the block in parliament, get Brexit done, and to then unleash this country\u2019s potential. Under Corbyn there would be dither and delay, and two referendums. Together, let\u2019s take this country forward, he says. Jeremy Corbyn goes first with the opening statement. The election gives a real choice, he says, about the future. Labour is offering real hope. The Tory government is failing. He says he will get Brexit sorted by giving people the final say, and he will implement what they decide. Too many policies are failing. Labour will govern for the many not the few. The programme starts with Julia Etchingham introducing the debate, with Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn standing alongside her. It\u2019s about to start - the first debate of the election, and the first ever British election debate featuring just the prime minister and the leader of the opposition. It is on ITV, and Julia Etchingham is presenting. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg During the debate Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will get the chance to ask each other questions. We know what some of Johnson\u2019s questions will be because helpfully he included them in an open letter addressed to Corbyn last night. For the record, here they are. 1. You are proposing a second referendum on EU membership. In that referendum, would you recommend the UK should remain or leave? 2. Your previous manifesto promised to end freedom of movement, but following your conference it is now Labour party policy to \u201cmaintain and extend\u201d free movement. Would you end, maintain or extend free movement, and would immigration be higher or lower under Corbyn\u2019s Labour? 3. Asked on Sunday if you were prepared to continue to pay into the EU budget on an ongoing basis, you replied \u201cclearly if you want access to a market there are costs involved\u201d. How much would you be willing to pay into the EU budget in return for \u201caccess to markets\u201d? 4. All 635 Conservative candidates standing at this election have pledged to me that, if elected, they will vote in parliament to pass my Brexit deal. Can you guarantee that every Labour candidate supports your Brexit policy? We won\u2019t have a live stream of the debate at the top of the blog tonight, as we do for many political events. ITV won\u2019t allow us one. They have this old-fashioned notion that people should be watching on their channel. But we will get clips of the key moments later. And here\u2019s the latest Tory Twitter offering. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is among those spinning for the PM. From Labour From the Financial Times\u2019 John Burn-Murdoch Boris Johnson has just arrived at the ITV studios in Salford. From the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson Here is the Jeremy Corbyn version of the \u201clet\u2019s do this\u201d tweet. We saw Boris Johnson\u2019s version earlier. (See 4.50pm.) From ITV\u2019s Liam Calland This is from Jeremy Corbyn. Tez Ilyas is a comedian. From Bloomberg\u2019s Kitty Donaldson My colleagues Peter Walker and Jim Waterson have produced a very good guide to tonight\u2019s ITV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. Although debates have been a feature of British elections since 2010, this is the first one featuring just the prime minister and the leader of the opposition. And here are five important things to remember before watching the debate tonight. 1) Election debates normally don\u2019t involve much debating. We call them debates, but in reality they are mostly exercises in soundbite regurgitation, rather than exercises involving rigorous engagement with argument. David Cameron explains this well in his autobiography, For the Record, where he writes this about preparing for the 2010 debates. Bill Knapp and Anita Dunn, the US experts I had hired to help me prepare for the coming ordeal, were brutally frank about the reality I was about to encounter: to my disappointment, they told me that these wouldn\u2019t really be debates at all. You don\u2019t want to engage with your opponents\u2019s argument, you just want to put your own point across. You should focus your efforts on delivering your pre-prepared soundbite down the camera lens. Avoid too much spontaneity in taking apart opponents\u2019 arguments; it\u2019s far too risky. Just get your \u2018zinger - a one-liner destined for the headlines on the news programmes after the show - ready beforehand, and deploy it as soon as you can. 2) Almost certainly, there won\u2019t be any so-called \u201cknockout blow\u201d. See 2.33pm and 4.55pm. 3) And even if there is something approaching a defining moment, the pundits might miss it. Sometimes a candidate says something in a debate that subsequently gets cited as having a decisive impact on voters - even if that is mostly because it\u2019s an answer that reinforces a negative perception that was already well entrenched. There was a good example in 2015 when Ed Miliband was asked if he thought Labour spent too much when it was last in power, and he said no. In subsequent analyses of the election, this was seen as an appalling error because it confirmed that Miliband could not be trusted on the economy. But on the night this was not apparent to many pundits, partly because Miliband had made this argument many times before (so, to the commentariat, he was not saying anything new), and party because what he said was true (at least to the extent that Labour\u2019s spending policies did not cause the financial crash, or even have much bearing on how well the UK was equipped to cope with it). 4) Any assessment about who \u201cwon\u201d should be treated with some caution. Sometimes a debate takes place and there is a clear consensus amongst the public, if there is a poll, and amongst commentators as to who won. The best example in British politics is the first leaders\u2019 debate in 2010, which was clearly won by Nick Clegg. But more often the result is less clear-cut, with people\u2019s views as to who did best mostly overlapping with who they supported most in the first place. Boris Johnson easily outperforms Jeremy Corbyn in opinion polls at the moment, and so it is not surprising that a YouGov poll found that more people expect Johnson to perform well tonight than expect Corbyn to perform well tonight. But the betting companies, which make their forecasts based on where people are placing bets, expect Corbyn to win. YouGov is going to publish a snap poll tonight soon after the debate ends, asking people who performed best, and William Hill, Paddy Power and Coral have all sent out press releases today saying they have Corbyn the narrow favourite to win (ie, in the YouGov poll). How to you explain the discrepancy between the public\u2019s expectations and punters\u2019 expectations? Quite easily. People who place bets on an election tend to follow politics closely, and they may well have noticed that Corbyn is a better debater than people realise. See the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush on this at 4.37pm. Also, because Corbyn is going into this widely perceived as the underdog, it will be easier for him to outperform expectations. 5) Even if you do win a debate, it won\u2019t necessarily win you an election. That\u2019s because elections are decided by multiple factors, and even if a TV debate makes an impact, it is never going to be wholly decisive. Clegg knows this as well as anyone. His debate triumph in 2010 resulted in the Lib Dems soaring in the polls for a few days, and a brief obsession with \u201cCleggmania\u201d (remember that?), but by the end of the election he was more or less back where he started, and his party ended up losing seats. There are two new polls around this afternoon. YouGov has the Conservatives 12 points ahead of Labour. This is from the Times\u2019s Matt Chorley. And a Kantar poll has the Tories 18 points ahead. This is from Reuters. Usual reminder: polls aren\u2019t always an accurate guide to the election result. Boris Johnson has gone for some Rocky Balboa-type posturing ahead of tonight\u2019s ITV debate. (See 2.33pm and 4.50pm.) As you would expect, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s warm-up routine is rather different. And here is another useful Twitter thread on the likely impact of the debate tonight, from the academic Prof Tim Bale. It starts here. Labour\u2019s Dawn Butler has posted a video on Twitter from the \u201cspin room\u201d for the ITV debate tonight. And, while we\u2019re on the subject of debates, this is from Nick Anstead, an academic specialising in political communication, commenting on my point about \u201cknockout blows\u201d earlier. (See 2.33pm.) And here is Anstead\u2019s take on what impact debates have. Boris Johnson has posted this on Twitter ahead of tonight\u2019s debate. It\u2019s interesting mainly because it\u2019s a bit - well, Donald Trump. According to the Financial Times\u2019s Sebastian Payne, Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is expected to stand in for Boris Johnson in the seven-party debate on the BBC on Friday week. The New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush posted a very good thread on Twitter yesterday about why, in his view, Boris Johnson was mad to agree to two one-on-one debates with Jeremy Corbyn. Do read it. It starts here. Nigel Farage has said his Brexit party might do pacts with the Tories on a local basis in the general election. After his plea to Boris Johnson to form an official \u201cleave alliance\u201d was rebuffed he said that campaigners might choose to organise themselves on the ground informally instead. He said it was a situation that would be out of his control but the Brexit party or Tories might essentially run paper candidates in key Labour marginals. Speaking in Peterborough after an election rally, he said: This is an election in which there are remain deals being done and Brexit deals being done at local level. It\u2019s not particularly surprising. I\u2019m aware of some areas in which we may be trying very hard and they [the Conservatives] may or may not be trying very hard, and in the neighbouring seat it might be the other way round. I\u2019m aware of it. But I can\u2019t manage it. The Brexit party is standing 274 candidates at the election after deciding to withdraw 317 candidates from Tory-held seats so as not to split the vote after Johnson said he backed a Canada-style free trade deal after Britain left the EU. Farage\u2019s party believes it has a strong chance in 150 Labour seats \u2013 areas the Tories traditionally cannot win over. The Brexit party MEP for London, Lance Forman, has already urged candidates to form local pacts. He posted this on Twitter last week. A Labour source has been in touch to say that journalists might have been reading too much earlier into what John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, seemed to be saying about ruling out a windfall tax on oil companies. (See 11.42am and 1.16pm.) When McDonnell said no, he was saying no to a request to explain how a windfall tax might work, the source claims. \u201cHe has not discussed what will or won\u2019t be in the manifesto.\u201d In an interview with the New Statesman Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s most influential ally in the union movement, has suggested that, if the Tories win the election, Corbyn should not resign immediately as Labour leader. Instead there should be a \u201cperiod of reflection\u201d, McCluskey said. Asked if Corbyn would have to resign if he lost, McCluskey said: Well, obviously I\u2019m not expecting Jeremy to lose. Jeremy would have to make a decision, along with other sections of the party. We would have to look at things \u2013 that\u2019s why I say a period of reflection. Back in 2015, Ed Miliband resigned the following day. I think that was wrong of him to do that. You always need a period of reflection. The one thing I know about Jeremy Corbyn is that his election four years ago has changed British politics forever, and therefore we need to consider what this all means. We need to consider the election result. If it was a defeat \u2013 a defeat that I\u2019m not expecting \u2013 then we\u2019d have to look at the scale of that, and where it happened. That requires some calm deliberation. So whilst I don\u2019t expect it, I certainly feel that there would have to be a proper debate and discussion. But McCluskey also insisted that what was on offer in Labour\u2019s manifesto (out on Thursday) was so inspiring that the party deserved to win a massive landslide. He explained: Committing to build a million homes over a decade. Tackling homelessness. Lifting the student debt off our young people\u2019s shoulders. All of these things Labour is promising. The deal that they\u2019re going to put to people is unbelievable. Free prescriptions. Free parking in hospitals, I mean, that might sound small beer, but do you know what? I know, and you\u2019ll know, and everyone reading your thing will know hundreds, thousands of people who\u2019ll be infuriated that they get fleeced every time they go and visit their loved ones who are sick. All of these things add up to an unbelievable offer that Labour is going to be making, one that will transform our society. When you look at Labour\u2019s programme \u2013 oh my god. You would think that we would end up with a massive landslide, because it speaks to so many people. McCluskey\u2019s comment about how the manifesto will contain plans to spare young people from the burden of student debt may be a hint that, as well as abolishing tuition fees, Labour may promise to cut or write off the debts built up since tuition fees were raised to the level of \u00a39,000 a year. Corbyn floated this idea during the 2017 general election campaign, but without making a firm commitment. This morning, in his interview on the Today programme, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, also hinted that the party might cut debts for students who have already graduated. As PoliticsHome reports, he said: In terms of the system, the debt that has been piled up already, I\u2019ve been trying to say to the government they\u2019ve got a problem here that we\u2019ve all got to accept. The system is not working. Large amounts of that debt is not being paid off and the government is having to write it off. There is I think an approach that has to be taken that looks at existing debt and we will look at some of these issues in the coming weeks. The SNP has said the Conservative opposition to holding a second independence referendum is \u201ccrumbling\u201d after the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, appeared to contradict Boris Johnson\u2019s vow to block another vote regardless of whether the nationalists win at Holyrood in 2021. Jack told BBC Radio Scotland: The democratic mandate for a section 30 order is a matter for 2021. We\u2019ll see whether or not the Scottish National party get a majority then. When Johnson visited Elgin two weeks ago, he insisted he would not grant the powers necessary to hold a legal referendum, regardless of whether the SNP won a majority of Scottish seats in the general election or a pro-independence majority in Holyrood. It remains to be seen whether this is a genuine contradiction, mis-speak, overinterpretation, or attempt at the unhappy triangulation over indyref2 policy that has so vexed Labour of late. Election debate reporting is often blighted by references to the prospect of a \u201cknockout punch\u201d. Apart from being a terrible cliche, the phrase is not particularly pertinent because such moments almost never happen in election debates, and so it is unhelpful to pretend that they do. You probably have to go back to Ronald Reagan to find a moment when a single line was so effective and memorable it decided a debate. But Boris Johnson\u2019s media team are not averse to hackneyed metaphors, and they had him doing a photo opportunity in a gym earlier showing him preparing for said knockout blow. Johnson said he was \u201cexcited\u201d rather than nervous about the debate tonight. Meanwhile, as Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby points out, Jeremy Corbyn has been preparing for the debate with a trip to the barbers. The Greens launched their election manifesto this morning. My colleague Peter Walker has written it up here. And in Northern Ireland the Democratic Unionist party has launched \u2013 well, not quite a manifesto, but a 12-point plan for Northern Ireland (pdf). Speaking at the launch, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, firmly ruled out supporting a Jeremy Corbyn government in a hung parliament. She said: We are very clear that we will not be supporting a Jeremy-Corbyn-led Labour party in a government because we believe Jeremy Corbyn would not only be hugely detrimental to the United Kingdom in terms of the break-up of the United Kingdom, and we have heard the whole discussion around the Scottish independence referendum, and we would be very fearful for the economy of the United Kingdom and we would be very fearful for the defence of our United Kingdom on a global scale. So there are many, many reasons why we couldn\u2019t in all conscience support a Jeremy-Corbyn-led administration. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, also claimed today that Britain in some respects resembles a failed South American state. He said: There are elements to our system which resemble a failed state in South America. Hundreds of Brexit party candidates last week were bombarded with messages telling them they shouldn\u2019t stand, some of them quite threatening, and at the same time others offered inducements. I think our democracy is deep in crisis, I think our confidence in the whole system has never been lower and I think now that Brexit is just the beginning of a real radical transformation of our political system. The feeling that they are the masters and we are the servants is the wrong way around and needs to be reversed. Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Haroon Siddique. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has been commenting on Prince Andrew. He\u2019s a lot less censorious than Chuka Umunna. (See 7.25am.) Talking about the prince, Farage said: For him it\u2019s bad. He\u2019s eighth in line to the throne so it\u2019s not a direct threat to the monarchy. The Queen just becomes this ever more exalted figure and the public are starting to look at those who come after her with a degree of scepticism, but it\u2019s not uncommon. That has happened throughout history. The shadow chancellor has been setting out how Labour would ensure companies worked for the greater good. John McDonnell stressed that Labour is pro-business but it would beef up the regulatory system to prevent failures such as those of Thomas Cook and Carillion, and introduce measures to ensure company directors are not just driven by profit but take into account impacts on employees, the environment and the wider good. He said companies not moving towards de-carbonisation would be de-listed. But he said Labour would not impose a windfall tax on oil companies. UPDATE: Or maybe not. This afternoon Labour said journalists were reading too much into what McDonnell said about not imposing a windfall tax. (See 3.51pm). Boris Johnson will aim to tackle knife crime by reducing the time it takes to charge and prosecute offenders, the Evening Standard reports. It also says a new form of court order, called a serious violence reduction order, will be introduced to allow police to search habitual knife carriers in the street without requiring suspicion. Also on law and order, the shadow justice secretary, Robert Buckland, pledged the Tories would introduce a whole life term for adults who commit the premeditated murder of a child. The Green party launched its election manifesto with the central plank being a pledge to implement a zero-carbon economy by 2030. The party\u2019s co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, said it was moving faster on the climate crisis than Labour and the other parties, and was also firmly a remain party, unlike Labour. The Tory candidate in Aberdeen North has been suspended after being found to have made \u201cunacceptable\u201d comments about the Holocaust, Muslims and homosexuals. Ryan Houghton denied holding antisemitic, racist or homophobic views, saying the eight-year old posts on a martial arts forum had been taken out of context. The Lib Dems\u2019 Chuka Umunna has described Prince Andrew as a complete disgrace. McDonnell urged the Duke of York to cooperate with the authorities, but Buckland would not be drawn on the prince\u2019s conduct, saying the focus should be on the victims. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has mocked Boris Johnson for refusing to debate her or to facilitate a second independence referendum. She tweeted: \u201cIs this the \u2018die in a ditch\u2019 definition of \u2018never\u2019?\u201d Scotland\u2019s Catholic voters will be advised to elect MPs \u201cwho reflect as closely as possible their beliefs\u201d, in a pastoral letter from bishops which will be read out at all 500 Catholic churches this weekend. In the letter, the bishops will also warn that \u201ca creeping intolerance towards religious belief\u201d has become \u201ca part of life\u201d. The letter urges voters to seek candidates\u2019 views on a variety of issues, including abortion, assisted dying and heterosexual marriage, as well as poverty and nuclear weapons. It\u2019s quite hard to think of many Westminster candidates who will tick all of the bishops\u2019 boxes, but perhaps readers can pitch in with a few suggestions. Kezia Dugdale, the former leader of the Scottish Labour party, has provided some insights into how politicians prepare for debates \u2013 and score points \u2013 ahead of tonight\u2019s head-to-head between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. Louis Stedman-Bryce, Scotland\u2019s only Brexit party MEP, has announced that he is leaving the party because \u201cI find myself in a situation where my personal values are now in direct conflict with the party\u201d. In a video posted on Twitter, Stedman-Bryce explains that he feels the party has \u201crepeatedly failed to deliver\u201d its promises on Brexit, and adds: The Brexit party\u2019s recent decision to select a Scottish candidate who has openly posted homophobic views across social media is not only a betrayal of LGBT community but of everyone who believes such divisive and hateful views have no place in society. Last night, the Brexit party withdrew support from its Glenrothes candidate, an evangelical pastor called Victor Robert Farrell, who Stedman-Bryce is referring to. He said he would continue to represent those in Scotland who had voted for him, as an independent MEP. The Evening Standard has an exclusive on measures to tackle knife crime that will be included in the Tory manifesto. It says the measures will include: Three-times-faster charging and prosecution times of knife offenders to act as a better deterrent. Anyone caught with a knife will be arrested, charged within 24 hours and in court within a week. A new form of court order called a serious violence reduction order allowing police to search habitual knife carriers in the street without requiring suspicion. It could be used against acid and guns, as well as blades. The Conservatives have been keen to appear tough on crime in this election. Earlier today they announced their plan for whole-life terms for people found guilty of the premeditated murder of a child. During conference season they talked about stopping the release of the most serious violent and sexual offenders at the halfway point of their sentence, while the home secretary, Priti Patel, told criminals: \u201cWe are coming for you.\u201d Boris Johnson has also talked tough on crime, vowing to put more police on the streets, increase use of stop and search, and incarcerate more offenders with longer sentences. During a phone-in on Friday, Johnson claimed an increase in stop-and-search operations when he was London mayor between 2008 and 2016 had allowed 11,000 knives to be taken off the streets. However, this was a total that included weapons seized through means other than stop and search. Meanwhile Johnson has been doing a photoshoot at a boxing gym (don\u2019t know whether this is obligatory in this election \u2013 Jo Swinson has already done her own). For what it\u2019s worth, his technique could do with some \u2013 make that a lot of \u2013 refinement. Nigel Farage gives a speech in Peterborough. You can watch it below. First questions to the shadow chancellor are from the press. Q The Greens are pledging \u00a3100bn a year for 10 years to achieve zero carbon by 2030. That is also a Labour aspiration (the 2030 target). Is the Green estimate of the cost correct? A Labour will have a green transformation fund of \u00a3250bn over 10 years plus another \u00a3250bn through a National Investment Bank. We will also harness the resources of the finance industry. In some ways the figures we are working with are similar to the Greens but we will harness the finance industry with the state sector. Q How will the new regulatory system work? A We are consulting but it will include a business commission, containing a companies commission, finance commission and enforcement commission. Q Is it true you are planning a windfall tax on oil companies? A No (!) Q Is there any kind of new tax on oil companies envisaged? A Wait for the manifesto but don\u2019t hold your breath. Q Will more executives end up in jail for corporate failures under Labour\u2019s new laws? A I would expect executives and others to acknowledge that time has moved on so I don\u2019t think more will go to prison. Q How important is the leaders\u2019 debate? A Jeremy will be highlighting the problems the country faces. It will enable people to see the real Jeremy Corbyn, not just the media portrayal. Q It has been reported Labour is holding an inquiry into its colonial past. Do you think Britain is guilty of crimes and should reparations be paid? A Bristol and Liverpool benefited enormously financially from slavery. It\u2019s valuable we know our history proper, not just the kings and queens. UPDATE: This afternoon Labour says McDonnell\u2019s comments about the windfall tax have been misunderstood. See 3.51pm. Labour will implement a \u201cmuch-needed\u201d overhaul of the regulatory system. The public is poorly represented on the boards of these regulators. He mentions Carillion plus \u201cscandals\u201d at Tesco and HBOS. McDonnell says regulators are failing in many instances and the media is filling the gap. Labour will overhaul company law to bring about \u201creal change\u201d in the corporate sector. It will improve long-term economic performance, tackle the climate crisis and reduce inequality. The shadow chancellor emphasises that he applauds good business practice. He concludes and will now take questions. The shadow chancellor now talks about the \u201cobscene\u201d fact that billionaires are buying access and tax breaks from the Conservatives. McDonnell says Jeremy Corbyn is on the side of the people. Labour will introduce a 20-1 pay ratio between the highest- and lowest-paid employees in the public sector as well as companies bidding for public sector contracts. It will be a statutory duty that no one in companies is paid less than the national living wage. Companies will have to set out their policies for tackling the gender and ethnic pay gaps. Under Labour the big four auditing companies will be prevented from \u201cacting as a cartel\u201d. They will not be allowed to offer other services to prevent conflicts of interest, says McDonnell. Large firms should change auditing company at least every five years. We\u2019ll regulate to ensure that auditing firms provide socially useful information. If you refresh the page you can watch McDonnell\u2019s speech live. McDonnell says the existential threat of climate change is Labour\u2019s principal priority if it enters office. Companies not taking adequate steps towards decarbonisation should be de-listed from the London stock exchange, he says. John McDonnell says a new business model is needed with partnership at its heart. Labour will rewrite the Companies Act so directors have an obligation to take into account long-term interests of shareholders, employees, the wider public and the environment. Labour will also consult on incentives to hold shares longer term, says McDonnell. He talks about inclusive ownership, giving employees collective ownership eventually of 10% of the company. He says Bernie Sanders has advocated 20% in the US. The shadow chancellor has just begun his speech on the economy, saying the unfettered pursuit of profit has been allowed to override all other factors. The relentless pursuit of shareholder profit has been to the detriment of workers and the environment, says John McDonnell. He gives Carillion and Thomas Cook, which both went into liquidation, as examples of failures caused by corporate greed. The Conservative candidate in Ashfield in Nottinghamshire (Labour majority of 441 at the last election) has suggested the way to deal with problem tenants is to house them in tents, wake them up at 6am and then get them to pick vegetables followed by a cold shower, BuzzFeed reports. This is an interesting observation from Sky News\u2019s economics editor about the Green party\u2019s manifesto. Says something about the degree to which the other parties \u2013 including the Tories, eager to proclaim the end of austerity \u2013 are competing on public spending. It feels like every time a Green politician is questioned during this election campaign they are asked about how they can get the message across that they are the party to be trusted to tackle the climate crisis, given movement by the other parties \u2013 particularly Labour \u2013 on the issue. The party\u2019s co-leader Jonathan Bartley addressed the issue of differentiation with Labour this morning, not just on the climate emergency, but also Brexit. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Our proposals today are very much about remaining in the EU, another point of differentiation with Labour, but also transforming the country, getting to that net zero target by 2030. Looking at every sector of the economy, spelling out how we need to decarbonise and what kind of investment is going to be needed, being honest about that investment. He added: When there\u2019s a war, when we\u2019re facing an existential threat, we don\u2019t hold back. We know that we have to tackle it. Frankly, if the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now. Bartley said the party wanted to introduce a frequent flyer levy and was against airport expansion. You can read more about the Greens\u2019 manifesto, which is launched today, below. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has just taken a dig at Boris Johnson for refusing to debate her or facilitate a second independence referendum. Boris Johnson is interviewed in a number of Scottish papers this morning \u201csnubbing\u201d the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, by refusing to debate. He told the Daily Record: Although she can be very influential on our politics, she has no seat in the House of Commons nor can she be prime minister. The candidate to be prime minister who Nicola Sturgeon would support is Jeremy Corbyn. That is why he is the appropriate person to debate. The interview took place yesterday just as the SNP and Lib Dems\u2019 unsuccessful court action to participate in the ITV leaders\u2019 debate was concluded, a decision the SNP has described as a \u201cdemocratic disgrace\u201d. Sturgeon threw down the gauntlet to Johnson to debate her during last month\u2019s independence rally in Glasgow\u2019s George Square, but I also remember her telling reporters after Johnson\u2019s first visit to Scotland as prime minister, back in July, that she had suggested a TV debate on independence to him then, and he had sounded so interested that his aides had blanched at the prospect. The PM has obviously changed his mind since then \u2026 Sarah Wollaston, who switched from the Tories to the Lib Dems via Change UK, and who is a GP, has raised questions about the government\u2019s attempt to tackle the staffing crisis by agreeing a deal to pay doctors\u2019 pensions bills this year, a move which could cost hundreds of millions of pounds (see 9am update). This takes the biscuit for the most unusual politics story of the day so far \u2026 although it does make a serious point about fake news. Doctors\u2019 groups have begun responding to the emergency scheme ministers and NHS chiefs have come up with to stop what critics call the \u201cNHS pensions tax trap\u201d deterring hospital consultants and GPs in England from working extra shifts this winter. The British Medical Association, which represents about 70% of the UK\u2019s doctors, has given the proposal a cautious welcome. Under it, doctors who work enough hours this year (2019-20) to then receive a hefty bill linked to the rising value of their pension will have that bill in effect paid for by the NHS. The unprecedented move could cost the NHS between tens and hundreds of millions of pounds. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the BMA\u2019s ruling council, said: These proposals under discussion could, if properly implemented, provide the respite needed to enable significant numbers of doctors to increase the work they are doing, giving vital patient care at a time of unprecedented demand. However, we don\u2019t yet have important details about how such a scheme will work; details that are crucial to the BMA and to the tens of thousands of doctors that we represent in order to provide the necessary reassurance that doctors can take on additional work without this resulting in any financial penalty. We look forward to having those details in the very near future, and call on the next government to urgently scrap the annual allowance in defined benefit schemes such as the NHS, a solution proposed by their own advisory body, the Office for Tax Simplification. However, EveryDoctor, which campaigns to improve medics\u2019 working conditions in the NHS, dismissed the plan as a \u201cshort-term fix\u201d that would not solve the problem of an estimated 40% of doctors reducing their workloads in order to avoid being hit by a bill for up to \u00a3100,000. A spokesperson said: The pressures on the NHS are no longer isolated to the winter months. We are in a constant, spiralling recruitment crisis and the NHS is 10,000 doctors short. Vast swathes of UK doctors have been forced out of work by the 2016 punitive tax rules. A short-term fix to cover the winter period will not solve this problem. The government instead needs to create a long-term, sustainable solution which safeguards the NHS and its hard-working staff. The Green party is formally launching its manifesto this morning. The centrepiece will be a pledge to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2030. In an election broadcast later today, the party\u2019s sole MP, Caroline Lucas, will tell voters that the 12 December election offers \u201cthe greatest \u2013 perhaps the last \u2013 opportunity to change course\u201d for the UK. You can read more about the Green party\u2019s manifesto below. Q Do you need to get rid of billionaires to help others? A John McDonnell says people are understandably upset that the wealthiest are getting tax breaks. \u00a3100bn has been given away in tax cuts, it\u2019s gone to corporations, cuts to capital gains tax, inheritance tax and the highest rate of income tax. Q The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the headline figure \u2013 \u00a3100bn \u2013 about tax cuts for the wealthiest is wrong as some have benefited people who are not so well off. A McDonnell insists the figure is not wrong. Q The Phones 4u billionaire, John Caudwell, says he can\u2019t tolerate \u201cspiteful envy\u201d. A McDonnell says tell Caldwell to come see him and he\u2019ll explain Labour\u2019s policies to encourage entrepreneurship. It\u2019s a misunderstanding by Caldwell, the shadow chancellor suggests. Q Is student debt going to be addressed? A It has to be addressed by whoever is in government. He declines to say whether or not it will be cancelled. Q Are your policies on cracking down on foxhunting etc a \u201ctownie\u2019s policy\u201d? A It\u2019s making sure the hunting ban is adhered to. That concludes the interview. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is on the Today programme now. Q Is it correct to say no one should be a billionaire? A We need to attack the gross levels of inequality through a fair taxation system. Q How flat should society be? A Most of us will think on the one hand you\u2019ve got 150 billionaires and on the other hand people queueing at food banks and that\u2019s not fair. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, appeared to rule out giving MPs a free vote on overturning the foxhunting ban if the Conservatives win a majority at the general election. The controversial offer made by the former prime minister Theresa May in the 2017 Tory manifesto was dropped swiftly after her poor performance at the election. Buckland told Sky News he thought it was unlikely Boris Johnson would revive the controversial issue. Foxhunting was banned through legislation introduced by the Blair government in 2004. Buckland said: I don\u2019t see a return to that at all. I think the agenda has moved on. We are now talking in our own policies about strong animal welfare measures. We are cracking down on issues like live transport. We are dealing with trophy hunting, the keeping of primates as pets. He added that he believes Johnson has an \u201cauthenticity\u201d on environmental issues that is an \u201cimportant hallmark\u201d of his leadership. The Lib Dem justice spokesman, Dr Phillip Lee, is also doing the media rounds this morning. He told the Today programme the staffing crisis in the NHS will get worse if Brexit goes ahead (quotes from PA Media). We can see that there is a clear staffing crisis in the NHS and this is being exacerbated by the prospect of Brexit. In my own professional experience I meet many doctors over the years who are trained in the EU and indeed nursing staff and I think if we proceed with Brexit, the staffing crisis will get worse. So by investing extra money, by remaining within the EU, Liberal Democrats will protect the NHS. The Lib Dems say they would boost the NHS by raising income tax by a penny if they gained power. Asked about the prospect of the Lib Dems winning, Lee added: The fact that we\u2019re on 20 MPs and to get to 326 is quite a target, yes. We will get to the other side of the election and if the Conservatives haven\u2019t got a majority then discussions will take place, but we will take each issue as it comes and vote accordingly and we will not be putting Jeremy Corbyn into No 10 \u2026 We do have a choice not to put either of the two prime ministers into No 10, which is why we think that there should be more of an offer put to the public in terms of who should be prime minister. Another interesting front page from Scotland: You can read the story here. The shadow justice secretary, Robert Buckland, was asked about Prince Andrew on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said it was not appropriate for him to comment. By contrast, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told Sky News: I think he [the Duke of York] should cooperate with all the authorities and make sure justice is served. The Lib Dems\u2019 Chuka Umunna went even further on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. Good morning. This is Haroon Siddique taking over the blog until about 1pm-ish GMT when Andrew Sparrow will be in. If you want to catch my attention the best way is by tweeting me @Haroon_Siddique. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are doing the rounds for the Conservatives and Labour respectively this morning. Buckland will be talking, among other things, about the Tory pledge of a whole life term for adults who commit the premeditated murder of a child McDonnell will be talking about the super-rich and the tax breaks they have enjoyed under the Tories. Just back to the election debate tonight for a moment, and although Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson lost their bid to be included in ITV\u2019s programme tonight, there will be other debates later in the campaign. Swinson is due to take part in a three-way debate with Johnson and Corbyn hosted by Sky on 28 November. The following day, the BBC will host a seven-way debate in Cardiff between leaders or senior figures from the seven major political parties. And the BBC will then host a \u201cprime ministerial debate\u201d on 6 December from Southampton between Corbyn and Johnson. Away from the main parties: Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, will today call for immigration powers to be devolved from Westminster to to Scotland. The Green party will launch its election manifesto today, stressing its status as the only major party committed to zero carbon emissions by 2030. Here\u2019s one more front page that I didn\u2019t link to earlier \u2013 The Scotsman. It quotes Boris Johnson: \u201cI will never go on a TV debate with Sturgeon\u201d. And here\u2019s a taste of what Guardian comment writers are saying: Suzanne Moore has written why voting in this election feels like \u201cclinging to the wreckage of a system we should dismantle. All the issues that really matter require cooperation, not silly, point-scoring conflict.\u201d You can read John Crace\u2019s take on Boris Johnson\u2019s bumbling speech at the CBI in which he shelved planned corporation tax cuts (\u201cthe less effort he was seen to make, the more the public seemed to like him\u201d). Polly Toynbee has written about the poverty crisis and why the PM doesn\u2019t care. Two other stories in brief that you can get stuck in to to start your election day: Momentum is scaling up for a \u201conce in a generation chance\u201d to change the country with a sophisticated online and doorstep campaign that borrows ideas from the US and an innovative use of WhatsApp. Labour will pledge to close loopholes used to hunt foxes, hares and deer as it launches its animal welfare manifesto. The Tories will make a push on law and order today as they pledge that adults (over 21) who commit the premeditated murder of a child (under 16) will be given tougher sentences of life without parole. The current rules require the murder to be of multiple children or to be sexually or sadistically motivated. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, said it was his aim to stop the parents of murdered children seeing the \u201csickening\u201d spectacle of their killers walking free. Labour\u2019s focus today will be on skewering Boris Johnson on what it describes as the Tories\u2019 \u00a3100bn tax giveaway to billionaires. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will tell a campaign event in central London that Labour intends to \u201crewrite the rules of our economy\u201d. He outline party analysis that claims to show 48 of the country\u2019s 151 billionaires have donated to the Tories since 2005 while the government is on course to hand out \u00a3100bn in tax breaks and other giveaways by 2023-24. \u201cSomeone on the national minimum wage would have to work 69,000 years to get paid \u00a31bn and a newly qualified nurse would have to wait 50,000 years. No one needs or deserves to have that much money. It is obscene,\u201d he will say, telling his audience that Boris Johnson is on the side of \u201cthe billionaires, the bankers and big business\u201d. You can read the full story about McDonnell\u2019s speech here. Let\u2019s take a look at today\u2019s papers, and the Guardian splashes on the NHS staffing crisis. The FT carries a big picture of the violent crackdown in Hong Kong, but keeps its lead for Johnson shelving the corporation tax cut during a speech to the CBI yesterday (you can read John Crace\u2019s take on the PM\u2019s lacklustre performance here). The Telegraph echoes the FT, carrying a big picture from Hong Kong and a headline on the PM\u2019s speech to the CBI: \u201cJohnson accused of appeasing socialists in corporation tax U-turn\u201d. (It also headlines the continuing fallout for Prince Andrew on its front page). The i leads on the TV debate tonight between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, with the headline \u201cElection ignites\u201d. The tabloids carry varying takes on Prince Andrew. The Sun reports backers \u201cpull the plug on Prince\u201d as \u201cNet closes in on Andy\u201d. The Mirror splashes on Prince Andrew\u2019s accuser, Virginia Giuffre, filming an interview with the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme. The Express reports the Queen still backs her son. Finally, the Mail has \u201cAndrew out in the cold\u201d. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of all things politics today, as we count down to the first leaders\u2019 election debate tonight (well, two leaders anyway \u2013 more on that later). I\u2019ll be looking after the blog for the first hour or so of the day before handing over to colleagues. Feel free to get in touch: alison.rourke@theguardian.com. First up and NHS bosses have made a dramatic intervention into the campaign, with nine out of 10 saying the staffing crisis is endangering patients. Almost 60% believe this winter will be the toughest yet for the service. It may scare the horses in the Tory campaign where there is concern that the growing crisis in the health service risks derailing the party\u2019s Brexit-dominated campaign. That\u2019s unlikely to be helped today by the Lib Dem policy pledge add an extra \u00a335bn for health and social care over the next five years, by adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax. It puts the Tories in third place, pledging to spend \u00a3140.3bn on the NHS up to 2023-24, with the Lib Dems on \u00a3142.2bn and Labour in front on \u00a3143.5bn. No doubt this will get a fair amount of attention at tonight\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate on ITV at 8pm. You will only be seeing Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, after Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson lost their court bid to appear. You can read Peter Walker\u2019s guide to what to expect in the debate here, including the key subjects (Brexit, the economy, the NHS and personal character) and the curly questions for the PM (Jennifer Arcuri, how many children does he have) and Corbyn (antisemitism). You can also start to get ready for your own election bingo. Walker says a drink isn\u2019t mandatory for every repetition the the phrases, but it could be helpful. Here\u2019s his list, feel free to let us know if you have any additions: Get Brexit done. Dither and delay. Coalition of chaos. Propped up by billionaires. Many, not the few. Forty new hospitals. British Broadband. Now on to the rest of the day.",

laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws involving $11bn in transactions, including transfers potentially linked to child exploitation.</p> <p>In a statement filed with the federal court, Austrac said Westpac had failed to \u201ccarry out appropriate due diligence on customers sending money to the Philippines and South East Asia for known child exploitation risks\u201d.</p> <p>Austrac said Westpac had been aware of the child exploitation risks relating to low-value payments made through one of its systems, LitePay, since 2013 but had not fixed them until June 2018.</p> <p>\u201cWestpac still has not implemented appropriate automated detection scenarios to monitor for the known child exploitation risks through other channels,\u201d Austrac told the court. \u201cAs a result, Westpac has failed to detect activity on its customers\u2019 accounts that is indicative of child exploitation.\u201d</p> <p>Westpac also failed to properly deal with a customer who \u201copened a number of Westpac accounts after serving a custodial sentence for child exploitation offences\u201d, Austrac said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

<p>\u201cWestpac promptly identified activity on one account that was indicative of child exploitation, but failed to promptly review activity on other accounts.</p> <p>\u201cThis customer continued to send frequent low value payments to the Philippines through channels that were not being monitored appropriately.\u201d</p> <p>The customer was among 12 on whom Austrac claims Westpac failed to carry out appropriate due diligence checks \u201cwith a view to identifying, mitigating and managing known child exploitation risks\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOver a number of years, there were repeated patterns of frequent low value transactions on accounts held by each of these 12 customers that were indicative of child exploitation risks,\u201d the regulator told the court.</p> <p>Austrac also accused Westpac of failing to properly assess the risk in dealing with correspondent banks with which it did business.</p> <p>\u201cThis is in spite of a number of correspondent banks disclosing higher ML/TF (money laundering and terror finance) risks, such as themselves having correspondent banking relationships with high risk or sanctioned countries including Iraq, Lebanon, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, and Democratic Republic of Congo,\u201d Austrac said.</p> <p>\u201cSome correspondent banks who had disclosed such relationships had been fined by overseas regulators for sanctions or AML/CTF breaches resulting from inadequate controls.</p> <p>\u201cThe risk posed to Westpac was that these high risk or sanctioned countries may have been able to access the Australian payment system through these nested arrangements, unbeknownst to Westpac.\u201d</p> <p>Austrac also said that between November 2013 and September 2018, Westpac failed to give it reports within the 10 days required by law about almost three-quarters of the incoming fund transfers it received from overseas banks \u2013 some 19.5m transactions totalling more than $11bn.</p> <p>In addition, the bank failed to file timely reports about more than 12,000 outbound transactions, including more than 2,300 sent through LitePay where \u201cWestpac has never given Austrac a report of each of these instructions\u201d, Austrac said.</p> <p>Westpac faces a theoretical maximum fine of between $391tn and $483tn, but if the breaches are found by the court it is unlikely to be ordered to pay anywhere near that amount.</p> <p>However, based on Austrac\u2019s recent track record, any penalty would be likely to be extremely large.</p> <p>Last year, rival big four bank CBA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/04/commonwealth-bank-agrees-to-pay-700m-to-settle-money-laundering-lawsuit\">agreed to pay Austrac $700m </a>to settle a similar action against it in which the regulator alleged more than 53,000 breaches of AML-CTF laws.</p> <p>Westpac revealed it was under investigation by Austrac in November last year.</p> <p>\u201cThe group has recently self-reported to Austrac a failure to report a large number of international funds transfer instructions,\u201d the bank said in its 2018 annual report.</p> <p>\u201cNo provision has been raised for this matter including in relation to any potential regulatory action.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement to the stock exchange on Wednesday morning, Westpac said it was \u201creviewing Austrac\u2019s statement of claim and will issue a further statement to the ASX once it has been assessed\u201d.</p> <p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the allegations but the lawsuit proved Austrac was doing its job.</p> <p>The bank is expected to make a further statement later on Wednesday.</p> <p>Westpac shares fell 2.15% to $25.98 on Wednesday morning.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s financial intelligence agency has launched legal action against one of the country\u2019s biggest banks, Westpac, accusing it of more than 23m breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws involving $11bn in transactions, including transfers potentially linked to child exploitation. In a statement filed with the federal court, Austrac said Westpac had failed to \u201ccarry out appropriate due diligence on customers sending money to the Philippines and South East Asia for known child exploitation risks\u201d. Austrac said Westpac had been aware of the child exploitation risks relating to low-value payments made through one of its systems, LitePay, since 2013 but had not fixed them until June 2018. \u201cWestpac still has not implemented appropriate automated detection scenarios to monitor for the known child exploitation risks through other channels,\u201d Austrac told the court. \u201cAs a result, Westpac has failed to detect activity on its customers\u2019 accounts that is indicative of child exploitation.\u201d Westpac also failed to properly deal with a customer who \u201copened a number of Westpac accounts after serving a custodial sentence for child exploitation offences\u201d, Austrac said. \u201cWestpac promptly identified activity on one account that was indicative of child exploitation, but failed to promptly review activity on other accounts. \u201cThis customer continued to send frequent low value payments to the Philippines through channels that were not being monitored appropriately.\u201d The customer was among 12 on whom Austrac claims Westpac failed to carry out appropriate due diligence checks \u201cwith a view to identifying, mitigating and managing known child exploitation risks\u201d. \u201cOver a number of years, there were repeated patterns of frequent low value transactions on accounts held by each of these 12 customers that were indicative of child exploitation risks,\u201d the regulator told the court. Austrac also accused Westpac of failing to properly assess the risk in dealing with correspondent banks with which it did business. \u201cThis is in spite of a number of correspondent banks disclosing higher ML/TF (money laundering and terror finance) risks, such as themselves having correspondent banking relationships with high risk or sanctioned countries including Iraq, Lebanon, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, and Democratic Republic of Congo,\u201d Austrac said. \u201cSome correspondent banks who had disclosed such relationships had been fined by overseas regulators for sanctions or AML/CTF breaches resulting from inadequate controls. \u201cThe risk posed to Westpac was that these high risk or sanctioned countries may have been able to access the Australian payment system through these nested arrangements, unbeknownst to Westpac.\u201d Austrac also said that between November 2013 and September 2018, Westpac failed to give it reports within the 10 days required by law about almost three-quarters of the incoming fund transfers it received from overseas banks \u2013 some 19.5m transactions totalling more than $11bn. In addition, the bank failed to file timely reports about more than 12,000 outbound transactions, including more than 2,300 sent through LitePay where \u201cWestpac has never given Austrac a report of each of these instructions\u201d, Austrac said. Westpac faces a theoretical maximum fine of between $391tn and $483tn, but if the breaches are found by the court it is unlikely to be ordered to pay anywhere near that amount. However, based on Austrac\u2019s recent track record, any penalty would be likely to be extremely large. Last year, rival big four bank CBA agreed to pay Austrac $700m to settle a similar action against it in which the regulator alleged more than 53,000 breaches of AML-CTF laws. Westpac revealed it was under investigation by Austrac in November last year. \u201cThe group has recently self-reported to Austrac a failure to report a large number of international funds transfer instructions,\u201d the bank said in its 2018 annual report. \u201cNo provision has been raised for this matter including in relation to any potential regulatory action.\u201d In a statement to the stock exchange on Wednesday morning, Westpac said it was \u201creviewing Austrac\u2019s statement of claim and will issue a further statement to the ASX once it has been assessed\u201d. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the allegations but the lawsuit proved Austrac was doing its job. The bank is expected to make a further statement later on Wednesday. Westpac shares fell 2.15% to $25.98 on Wednesday morning.",

Until then, Rugby Australia\u2019s director of rugby, Scott Johnson, will oversee the rebuilding of the national team, including assembling a coaching staff, under Rennie\u2019s direction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/20/samu-kerevi-joked-but-rugbys-eligibility-rules-are-no-laughing-matter\">Samu Kerevi joked but rugby\u2019s eligibility rules are no laughing matter | Bret Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>RA were seeking a new coach after Cheika opted to walk away from his post in the wake of a disappointing quarter-final finish at this year\u2019s World Cup in Japan. Rennie arrives with a strong coaching record, having won two Super Rugby titles with New Zealand\u2019s Chiefs in 2012 and 2013, and becomes the second foreigner to coach Australia, after fellow Kiwi Robbie Deans, who was in charge between 2008 and 2013.</p> <p>\u201cI get it, I think Australians want their national team coached by an Australian and I\u2019m OK with that,\u201d said Rennie, who has not coached at international level before. \u201cHopefully, they\u2019re feeling that way because they care about Aussie rugby and all I can say is everywhere I\u2019ve gone I\u2019ve immersed myself in the community and the culture.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some outstanding young men coming through the schools system. I want to create a strong connection with the Super Rugby and national age grade coaches and help them achieve their goals, which will benefit the Wallabies in time.\u201d</p> <p>Rugby Australia CEO Raelene Castle said the organisation had looked \u201creally hard\u201d at homegrown options, but in the absence of any genuine Australian contenders they had to look elsewhere. Rennie was one of several overseas options, with his track record on the pitch and an ability to blend cultures in the dressing room key factors in his appointment.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a massive coup for Australian rugby, Dave Rennie was the clear standout candidate for the job, and we\u2019re thrilled to have secured his services,\u201d Castle said. \u201cDave\u2019s coaching philosophy focuses equally on football and team culture, the key pillars to building sustainable success in any team. He has a proven track record in the northern and southern hemisphere.\u201d</p> <p>Rennie was among 26 candidates identified by New Zealand Rugby as potential successors to All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen, who bowed out after their semi-final exit in Japan. With former Wales coach Warren Gatland ruling himself out and Jamie Joseph opting to extend his contract with Japan through to the next World Cup, the All Blacks\u2019 choices are thinning.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a proud Kiwi but the big thing is I\u2019ve been talking to Australia for a lot of months and the All Blacks interest came in late in the piece,\u201d said Rennie. \u201cAnd by that stage, we\u2019d done a lot of homework, we were really excited about the opportunity to go to Australia and that ended up being an easy decision.\u201d</p> <p>The issue of a lack of world-class Australian coaches is something RA has identified as a problem, and Johnson has been tasked with developing young coaching talent in Australia over that over the next few years. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get an Australian flavour there,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we get that. We have an obligation to get some young coaches through our system but we\u2019ve got a lot of good young coaches coming through. They\u2019re just not at the point that we need them at the pointy end now but the next cycle we need to have genuine contenders for this position coming through our system.\u201d</p> <p>Rennie was seen as favourite to take over the Wallabies but a number of media pundits had urged RA to appoint a coach on a shorter deal after the governing body\u2019s experience with Cheika. With Cheika negotiating a favourable contract extension through to Japan after the Wallabies reached the 2015 World Cup final, RA had little choice but to persist with him after the team slumped to their worst season in decades in 2018.</p> <p>A former Wellington centre, Rennie has Polynesian heritage and once represented a Cook Islands side in a non-capped match before carving out a coaching career with Wellington and later guiding the New Zealand Under-20 side. He joined the Warriors in 2017 from the Chiefs and guided the Scottish team to the Pro14 final at Celtic Park and the quarter-final of the Heineken Champions Cup last season.</p> <p>Scottish Rugby Chief Executive Mark Dodson congratulated him on his appointment. \u201cHe enhanced the strong, positive culture at Scotstoun and pushed the team to achieve significant results, playing some outstanding rugby on the way,\u201d Dodson said. \u201cHe has conducted himself throughout with great professionalism and I know he will want to sign off his time in Glasgow with some silverware.\u201d</p>",

The 55-year-old, who has signed a three-and-a-half year deal, becomes the second New Zealander to take on Australian rugby\u2019s top coaching role. Given his current commitments with Scottish team Glasgow Warriors in the Pro14 competition, Rennie will not take the reins until July next year. Until then, Rugby Australia\u2019s director of rugby, Scott Johnson, will oversee the rebuilding of the national team, including assembling a coaching staff, under Rennie\u2019s direction. RA were seeking a new coach after Cheika opted to walk away from his post in the wake of a disappointing quarter-final finish at this year\u2019s World Cup in Japan. Rennie arrives with a strong coaching record, having won two Super Rugby titles with New Zealand\u2019s Chiefs in 2012 and 2013, and becomes the second foreigner to coach Australia, after fellow Kiwi Robbie Deans, who was in charge between 2008 and 2013. \u201cI get it, I think Australians want their national team coached by an Australian and I\u2019m OK with that,\u201d said Rennie, who has not coached at international level before. \u201cHopefully, they\u2019re feeling that way because they care about Aussie rugby and all I can say is everywhere I\u2019ve gone I\u2019ve immersed myself in the community and the culture. \u201cThere are some outstanding young men coming through the schools system. I want to create a strong connection with the Super Rugby and national age grade coaches and help them achieve their goals, which will benefit the Wallabies in time.\u201d Rugby Australia CEO Raelene Castle said the organisation had looked \u201creally hard\u201d at homegrown options, but in the absence of any genuine Australian contenders they had to look elsewhere. Rennie was one of several overseas options, with his track record on the pitch and an ability to blend cultures in the dressing room key factors in his appointment. \u201cThis is a massive coup for Australian rugby, Dave Rennie was the clear standout candidate for the job, and we\u2019re thrilled to have secured his services,\u201d Castle said. \u201cDave\u2019s coaching philosophy focuses equally on football and team culture, the key pillars to building sustainable success in any team. He has a proven track record in the northern and southern hemisphere.\u201d Rennie was among 26 candidates identified by New Zealand Rugby as potential successors to All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen, who bowed out after their semi-final exit in Japan. With former Wales coach Warren Gatland ruling himself out and Jamie Joseph opting to extend his contract with Japan through to the next World Cup, the All Blacks\u2019 choices are thinning. \u201cI\u2019m a proud Kiwi but the big thing is I\u2019ve been talking to Australia for a lot of months and the All Blacks interest came in late in the piece,\u201d said Rennie. \u201cAnd by that stage, we\u2019d done a lot of homework, we were really excited about the opportunity to go to Australia and that ended up being an easy decision.\u201d The issue of a lack of world-class Australian coaches is something RA has identified as a problem, and Johnson has been tasked with developing young coaching talent in Australia over that over the next few years. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get an Australian flavour there,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we get that. We have an obligation to get some young coaches through our system but we\u2019ve got a lot of good young coaches coming through. They\u2019re just not at the point that we need them at the pointy end now but the next cycle we need to have genuine contenders for this position coming through our system.\u201d Rennie was seen as favourite to take over the Wallabies but a number of media pundits had urged RA to appoint a coach on a shorter deal after the governing body\u2019s experience with Cheika. With Cheika negotiating a favourable contract extension through to Japan after the Wallabies reached the 2015 World Cup final, RA had little choice but to persist with him after the team slumped to their worst season in decades in 2018. A former Wellington centre, Rennie has Polynesian heritage and once represented a Cook Islands side in a non-capped match before carving out a coaching career with Wellington and later guiding the New Zealand Under-20 side. He joined the Warriors in 2017 from the Chiefs and guided the Scottish team to the Pro14 final at Celtic Park and the quarter-final of the Heineken Champions Cup last season. Scottish Rugby Chief Executive Mark Dodson congratulated him on his appointment. \u201cHe enhanced the strong, positive culture at Scotstoun and pushed the team to achieve significant results, playing some outstanding rugby on the way,\u201d Dodson said. \u201cHe has conducted himself throughout with great professionalism and I know he will want to sign off his time in Glasgow with some silverware.\u201d",

The investment plan comes as Jo Swinson attempts to inject new impetus into the party\u2019s election campaign, which has seen it slip from close to 20% in the polls to about 15%, with a manifesto launch in London on Wednesday. The free school meals programme is particularly resonant for the Lib Dems, as making these universal for younger junior school students was a key party policy in the coalition government under David Cameron. The rules have been tightened since 2018, but under the Lib Dem plan all junior pupils and any secondary pupil whose family receives universal credit would get free meals, costing \u00a31.1bn a year. The schools spending programme, which was welcomed by the main teaching union, would involve an immediate increase of \u00a34.6bn next year, to address cuts since 2010. The increase would gradually rise until, by 2024/25, the Lib Dems would be committing \u00a310.6bn a year more on schools than in the 2019/20 financial year.

According to analysis released by the party, food banks have handed out 65m meals in the last five years, while the number of children in severe low income and deprivation has increased by almost 50%. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: \u201cPoverty in Britain is now the most visible and widespread it has been in decades.

      "body": "<p>It is a fair guess that Gareth Bale, everyone\u2019s favourite top-knot idiot, did not rush from the pitch after Wales\u2019s match against Hungary on Tuesday to inquire how the prime minister got on in his TV debate with Jeremy Corbyn. Or, indeed, bother to ask if we had the same prime minister as last month, when Bale pronounced in an unguarded moment of candour: \u201cI don\u2019t even know who the prime minister is any more \u2026 I haven\u2019t got a clue \u2026 I follow the golf, that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p> <p>That is, indeed, about it. In the rarefied field of 2019 Celebrity Disconnection Bale is neck and neck with Prince \u201cI let the side down\u201d Andrew for the gold medal, with only six weeks left in the season. Others might yet make the podium.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/18/gerard-pique-davis-cup-new-look-caja-magica-tennis\">Spiky Piqu\u00e9 goes on the defensive as Davis Cup\u2019s new look makes slow start | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It comes as a surprise, though it shouldn\u2019t, that famous people often do not know anything or anyone but their hairdresser or whoever it is looking after their property portfolio. They do not just live in another world; they are not sure the one they are in is real \u2013 or, in Bale\u2019s case, Real Madrid.</p> <p>The Spanish media has not been too happy with Bale for a little while now but he managed to up his irritant factor when he let slip that he would rather play for Wales than the people who have made him ridiculously rich. Admirable loyalty to his roots, some would say \u2013 although his fame playing for his country has not spread to Baku, apparently.</p> <p>When Wales lobbed up in the Azerbaijan capital last week for a Euro 2020 qualifier, the translator assigned to the visiting team\u2019s press conferences did a bit of a Bale when she asked the manager, Ryan Giggs, \u201cWho is Gareth Bale?\u201d</p> <p>Fair question. Who is this man who only football and golf knows? When the eminent Trinidadian Marxist, CLR James, asked the cricketing version of that question in Beyond A Boundary in 1963, he borrowed the famous quote from Rudyard Kipling, who asked \u201cwhat should they know of England who only England know\u201d? Or Wales.</p> <p>The Baku translator got the sack, by the way, on the reasonable grounds that she might struggle to record faithfully anything to do with the Welsh team. Is it unreasonable to wonder if a similar punishment be handed out to Bale: say, refuse to let him vote in case he gets it horribly wrong, with not knowing that Boris Johnson has been squatting in 10 Downing Street for a few months. For those asking, Bale does actually speak Spanish \u2013 but he thinks Franco is still in charge.</p> <p>In Madrid this week a footballer of similar distinction, Gerard Piqu\u00e9, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/gerard-pique-revamped-davis-cup-project\" title=\"\">has put together</a> a new version of the Davis Cup, a brave experiment but something one might have expected of someone whose awareness of life away from the pitch has led him to the murky waters of politics more than once. Piqu\u00e9 is as proud of his Catalan heritage as Bale is of his Welshness but a little more in touch with what is going on around him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/gerard-pique-revamped-davis-cup-project\">Gerard Piqu\u00e9 says revamped Davis Cup is \u2018project of my life\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As he told the Guardian in 2017 during the turmoil and violence that surrounded the referendum on Catalan independence: \u201cPolitics is a drag, but why shouldn\u2019t I express myself? I understand those players who don\u2019t want to say anything. We\u2019re footballers but we\u2019re people too. Why can a journalist or a mechanic express themselves but not a footballer?\u201d</p> <p>As it happens, Piqu\u00e9 did not say which way he voted, although he does not talk like a separatist. But at least he talks. As does the magnificent Megan Rapinoe, who has helped USA win two World Cups and an Olympic gold medal while simultaneously and fearlessly expressing her disgust for Boris Johnson\u2019s fellow fool, Donald Trump.</p> <p>Her Wikipedia entry is hilarious. Apparently she is \u201cknown for her crafty style of play and activism\u201d. She speaks out with unfettered enthusiasm on LGBT issues, which ought not be considered unusual for a famous footballer but seems so to be. In the land of the free there is a home for the brave (sort of), as Rapinoe discovered when she knelt during her national anthem before a match in solidarity with the ostracised quarterback Colin Kaepernick. She has continued to use her position to make her case, most brilliantly with that angled spread of her arms after scoring as USA conquered the world again in France, and declaring that she and her teammates were not inclined to attend a victory reception at the sullied White House.</p> <p>She is not alone. When the phenomenal Norwegian Ada Hegerberg won the inaugural women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or last year, she had to contend with the crass intervention of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/dec/04/martin-solveig-twerk-ballon-dor-ada-hegerberg\" title=\"\">DJ called Martin Solveig,</a> who asked her to twerk for the gathering. She gave him a polite \u201cno\u201d. Empowerment grows as it is watered.</p> <p>We had at least come a little way forward from the awkward moment at the Australian Open in 2015 when a courtside commentator asked Eugenie Bouchard to \u201cdo a little twirl for us\u201d after she had won. She did it, bemused and laughing nervously. But the adverse reaction was widespread and unequivocal.</p> <p>Athletes, especially women, do get put in boxes. Some of them have the self-awareness to break out. Many do not. But quite a few have at least heard of Boris Johnson, for whatever that is worth.</p>",

Or, indeed, bother to ask if we had the same prime minister as last month, when Bale pronounced in an unguarded moment of candour: \u201cI don\u2019t even know who the prime minister is any more \u2026 I haven\u2019t got a clue \u2026 I follow the golf, that\u2019s about it.\u201d That is, indeed, about it. In the rarefied field of 2019 Celebrity Disconnection Bale is neck and neck with Prince \u201cI let the side down\u201d Andrew for the gold medal, with only six weeks left in the season. Others might yet make the podium. It comes as a surprise, though it shouldn\u2019t, that famous people often do not know anything or anyone but their hairdresser or whoever it is looking after their property portfolio. They do not just live in another world; they are not sure the one they are in is real \u2013 or, in Bale\u2019s case, Real Madrid. The Spanish media has not been too happy with Bale for a little while now but he managed to up his irritant factor when he let slip that he would rather play for Wales than the people who have made him ridiculously rich. Admirable loyalty to his roots, some would say \u2013 although his fame playing for his country has not spread to Baku, apparently. When Wales lobbed up in the Azerbaijan capital last week for a Euro 2020 qualifier, the translator assigned to the visiting team\u2019s press conferences did a bit of a Bale when she asked the manager, Ryan Giggs, \u201cWho is Gareth Bale?\u201d Fair question. Who is this man who only football and golf knows? When the eminent Trinidadian Marxist, CLR James, asked the cricketing version of that question in Beyond A Boundary in 1963, he borrowed the famous quote from Rudyard Kipling, who asked \u201cwhat should they know of England who only England know\u201d? Or Wales. The Baku translator got the sack, by the way, on the reasonable grounds that she might struggle to record faithfully anything to do with the Welsh team. Is it unreasonable to wonder if a similar punishment be handed out to Bale: say, refuse to let him vote in case he gets it horribly wrong, with not knowing that Boris Johnson has been squatting in 10 Downing Street for a few months. For those asking, Bale does actually speak Spanish \u2013 but he thinks Franco is still in charge. In Madrid this week a footballer of similar distinction, Gerard Piqu\u00e9, has put together a new version of the Davis Cup, a brave experiment but something one might have expected of someone whose awareness of life away from the pitch has led him to the murky waters of politics more than once. Piqu\u00e9 is as proud of his Catalan heritage as Bale is of his Welshness but a little more in touch with what is going on around him. As he told the Guardian in 2017 during the turmoil and violence that surrounded the referendum on Catalan independence: \u201cPolitics is a drag, but why shouldn\u2019t I express myself? I understand those players who don\u2019t want to say anything. We\u2019re footballers but we\u2019re people too. Why can a journalist or a mechanic express themselves but not a footballer?\u201d As it happens, Piqu\u00e9 did not say which way he voted, although he does not talk like a separatist. But at least he talks. As does the magnificent Megan Rapinoe, who has helped USA win two World Cups and an Olympic gold medal while simultaneously and fearlessly expressing her disgust for Boris Johnson\u2019s fellow fool, Donald Trump. Her Wikipedia entry is hilarious. Apparently she is \u201cknown for her crafty style of play and activism\u201d. She speaks out with unfettered enthusiasm on LGBT issues, which ought not be considered unusual for a famous footballer but seems so to be. In the land of the free there is a home for the brave (sort of), as Rapinoe discovered when she knelt during her national anthem before a match in solidarity with the ostracised quarterback Colin Kaepernick. She has continued to use her position to make her case, most brilliantly with that angled spread of her arms after scoring as USA conquered the world again in France, and declaring that she and her teammates were not inclined to attend a victory reception at the sullied White House. She is not alone. When the phenomenal Norwegian Ada Hegerberg won the inaugural women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or last year, she had to contend with the crass intervention of a DJ called Martin Solveig, who asked her to twerk for the gathering. She gave him a polite \u201cno\u201d. Empowerment grows as it is watered. We had at least come a little way forward from the awkward moment at the Australian Open in 2015 when a courtside commentator asked Eugenie Bouchard to \u201cdo a little twirl for us\u201d after she had won. She did it, bemused and laughing nervously. But the adverse reaction was widespread and unequivocal. Athletes, especially women, do get put in boxes. Some of them have the self-awareness to break out. Many do not. But quite a few have at least heard of Boris Johnson, for whatever that is worth.",

      "bodyText": "Two federal corrections officers were indicted on Tuesday for allegedly trying to hide their failure to check on inmates on the night the convicted sex offender and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in his Manhattan cell \u2013 a mere 15ft from the jail\u2019s common area. Officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas \u201crepeatedly failed to complete mandated counts of prisoners under their watch\u201d in the special housing unit (Shu) of the Manhattan correctional center early on 10 August, even though Epstein had apparently tried to kill himself a few weeks earlier, prosecutors said. Both pleaded not guilty to charges they falsely certified to having conducted inmate counts during Epstein\u2019s final hours, and to a conspiracy charge. Neither Noel nor Thomas said anything as they left the courthouse surrounded by supporters who formed a protective barrier to block them from view. \u201cIt is our hope that we will be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,\u201d Noel\u2019s lawyer, Jason Foy, told reporters outside the courthouse, but added that his client was prepared to defend against the charges. Thomas\u2019s lawyer, Montell Figgins, said his client was disappointed that prosecutors had decided to charge him criminally. \u201cWe look forward to our day in court and we hope there will be a positive resolution,\u201d he said. The defendants were the first to be criminally charged in connection with Epstein\u2019s death, which embarrassed federal officials because the case had an unusually high profile. Epstein, who was awaiting trial for allegedly sex trafficking minors in Florida and New York, was found dead in his cell. The New York City medical examiner ruled his death a suicide. The workers were supposed to check every half-hour on the wealthy financier, who counted Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew among powerful and well-known associates. Instead, Noel and Thomas \u201csat at their desk, browsed the internet and moved around the common area of the Shu\u201d, the Manhattan US attorney\u2019s office said. Noel was looking at furniture websites while Thomas was looking at motorcycle sales and sports news, the indictment said. The officers allegedly slept for about two hours. To cover up the fact they were not working as required, prosecutors said, the officers \u201crepeatedly signed false certifications attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates that they did not do\u201d. The bogus forms meant jail managers thought Shu prisoners were being monitored as required. \u201cIn fact,\u201d the indictment said, \u201cas a result of the defendants\u2019 conduct, no correctional officer conducted any count or round of the Shu\u201d from 10.30pm on 9 August until approximately 6.30am on 10 August. When the officers made their rounds with the inmates\u2019 breakfasts, it was discovered that Epstein was dead. Noel allegedly admitted to not conducting several rounds. The indictment said Thomas told a supervisor: \u201cWe messed up. I messed up. She\u2019s not to blame. We didn\u2019t do any rounds.\u201d Court papers also provided new details about Epstein\u2019s psychological distress \u2013 and how the jail handled him. After a 23 July suicide attempt, he was put on suicide watch for 24 hours. He was then put under psychiatric evaluation until 30 July.

The morning before Epstein\u2019s death, his cellmate was moved in a \u201croutine, pre-arranged transfer\u201d. \u201cNo new cellmate was assigned to his cell,\u201d court papers said. Asked for comment on the indictments, one of Epstein\u2019s attorneys, Marc Fernich, said in an email: \u201cIt would be a shame if minor scapegoats \u2026 were made to take the fall for this tragedy on what amounts to a cover-up theory. \u201cUnless it prompts genuine self-reflection from all major participants and stakeholders in our criminal justice system and those who cover it, Mr Epstein\u2019s death in federal custody \u2013 senseless and sad as it is \u2013 will have been entirely for naught.\u201d Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said in a statement: \u201cAny allegations of misconduct are taken very seriously by the agency and will be responded to appropriately. I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public\u2019s trust in us.\u201d In 2008, Epstein was sentenced to 18 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to soliciting for prostitution, including soliciting an underage girl. A month before his death, he was arrested and charged with the sex trafficking of minors in Florida and New York. In August, Epstein\u2019s death was ruled suicide by Dr Barbara Sampson, New York City\u2019s medical examiner. The Washington Post later reported that the autopsy found Epstein had broken bones in his neck, injuries consistent with strangulation. The report and Sampson\u2019s finding touched off a number of conspiracy theories, including several retweeted by Trump, that Epstein\u2019s death may have been untoward. The arrest of the guards comes as a new Epstein accuser sued his estate, claiming he committed a \u201cvicious, prolonged sexual assault\u201d on her when she was 15. The woman, named as Jane Doe 15 in legal documents, is one of about a dozen women suing Epstein\u2019s estate for alleged sexual abuses. On Sunday, Prince Andrew gave a rare interview to the BBC in which he was quizzed about his friendship with Epstein. The interview prompted significant backlash, as the prince claimed he had no knowledge of Epstein\u2019s behavior and said he believed staying with Epstein after the financier was convicted of child sex offenses was the \u201chonorable thing to do\u201d. In announcing her lawsuit, Jane Doe 15 appealed for Prince Andrew to come forward with information about Epstein. In a statement on Tuesday, Jane Doe 15\u2019s lawyer, Gloria Allred, said: \u201cAll of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and the public are entitled to the truth about what led to the death of Jeffrey Epstein when he was in custody awaiting trial in New York.\u201d Reuters contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "Georginio Wijnaldum struck a hat-trick as Netherlands, who had already booked a spot at Euro 2020, eased to a 5-0 victory over Estonia in their final Group C qualifying clash at the Johan Cruyff Arena on Tuesday. The home side were in complete control of the contest from early on, with the defender Nathan Ake and 18-year-old debutant Myron Boadu also among the goals, as they finished second in the standings with 19 points from eight games, two behind the group winners, Germany. Netherlands\u2019 coach, Ronald Koeman, said before the game he would experiment with team selection and stuck to his word, with the livewire Quincy Promes converted to right-back, and the AZ Alkmaar forward Calvin Stengs, 20, handed a debut from the start. It took the home side six minutes to hit the front, as Promes was afforded far too much space on the right and his delivery was headed back across goal and into the net by Wijnaldum, who scored eight times in his seven matches in the qualifiers. Netherlands dominated possession and launched wave after wave of attacks. They were rewarded for their endeavour with a second goal as Ake headed in a cross from Memphis Depay. The Netherlands got their third when Stengs robbed the ball off Karol Mets and set up Wijnaldum for his second. Captain for the night, Wijnaldum then collected a pass from Stengs to complete his hat-trick, before the AZ forward Boadu came off the bench to net the fifth. Christian Benteke and Kevin De Bruyne scored two goals each as Belgium thrashed Cyprus 6-1 in their Euro 2020 Group I qualifier at the King Baudouin Stadium. Belgium finish top of their pool with a perfect 10 wins from 10 games, scoring 40 goals in the process, as Yannick Carrasco and an own goal from Kypros Christoforou completed the rout of Cyprus. In the same group Russia thrashed San Marino 5-0. In Group E Slovakia beat Azerbaijan 2-0, while in Group G Latvia won their first European Championship qualifier since 2011, beating the Euro 2020 qualifiers Austria 1-0. In the same group North Macedonia beat Israel 1-0 and Poland squeezed past Slovenia 3-2.",

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Corbyn rose to power on the back of the incontestable argument that Britain needed a kinder, more decent politics. Boris Johnson promised to be an inclusive \u201cone nation\u201d Conservative. There was little of either sentiment on display in the first televised election <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50472452\" title=\"\">debate</a> between the two men on ITV on Tuesday night. Both traded ever lower blows as they found the body of their respective arguments too well protected. This was in many ways a wasted opportunity. There are real issues at stake during this campaign: about this country\u2019s future relationship with Europe, about how to rebuild the fabric of society after almost a decade of austerity, about how to bring people together across the four nations of the United Kingdom. Opinion is divided and politicians need to bridge the yawning chasms, not widen them.</p> \n<p>TV debates are now part of the political theatre of this country\u2019s elections.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn rose to power on the back of the incontestable argument that Britain needed a kinder, more decent politics. Boris Johnson promised to be an inclusive \u201cone nation\u201d Conservative. There was little of either sentiment on display in the first televised election debate between the two men on ITV on Tuesday night. Both traded ever lower blows as they found the body of their respective arguments too well protected. This was in many ways a wasted opportunity. There are real issues at stake during this campaign: about this country\u2019s future relationship with Europe, about how to rebuild the fabric of society after almost a decade of austerity, about how to bring people together across the four nations of the United Kingdom. Opinion is divided and politicians need to bridge the yawning chasms, not widen them. TV debates are now part of the political theatre of this country\u2019s elections. Participants consider them not a stage to win over committed opponents but an opportunity to write a new script. On Tuesday night each man looked for ways to make his opponent seem weak and incompetent, as well as out of touch with public opinion.

The report, by the Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute, finds there is no evidence for the prevailing view that there is an \u201cautomatic and complete tradeoff\u201d between wages and super, and rejects calls from Liberal backbenchers to freeze in the superannuation guarantee at 9.5%, or even to make superannuation voluntary. The compulsory superannuation guarantee is set to increase from 9.5% to 12% in five annual increases starting on 1 July 2021, but the government has refused to rule out freezing the increases as it reviews the retirement income system. The report by Jim Stanford, the centre\u2019s director and economist, argues that findings of the Henry tax review have been misconstrued by an echo chamber of stakeholders across the political spectrum \u2013 from the Grattan Institute to the Centre for Independent Studies, former Labor leader Bill Shorten and former assistant treasurer Kelly O\u2019Dwyer.

Meanwhile, a second report, by the Australia Institute\u2019s Bill Browne, timed for \u201cgo home on time day\u201d on Wednesday, found Australians were still working up to six weeks of unpaid overtime in a year, or up to an average of 4.6 hours a week.

The reports aim to provide solutions and context to Australia\u2019s stagnant wage growth. Stanford conducted a historical analysis on earlier superannuation increases in Australia, and found \u201ca surprising positive correlation\u201d that annual wage growth was slightly higher in years in which the superannuation guarantee rate was raised, at 4.2%, than in years when it was unchanged (3.9%). \u201cHigher [super] payments are associated with faster growing wages, not slower, and in some specifications that finding is statistically significant,\u201d the report said.

      "body": "<p>This musical arrives from the US laden with honours \u2013 including six Tony awards and a Grammy \u2013 and you can see why. It captures the agonies of youth, allows the songs to grow out of the action and boasts a great role, here memorably taken by Sam Tutty, for its lead actor. I admired the show without lapsing into unqualified rapture.</p> <p>It starts with the advantage of a book by Steven Levenson \u2013 co-creator of the TV series Fosse/Verdon \u2013 that could stand up as a play in its own right. It tells the story of Evan Hansen, a high-school senior suffering from social anxiety, who is urged by a therapist to write encouraging letters to himself. One such missive is appropriated by a bullying schoolmate, Connor Murphy, shortly before he kills himself. Finding the letter, Murphy\u2019s parents assume it was genuinely addressed to Evan Hansen who does nothing to disabuse them. Indeed, he creates a wholly fabricated friendship with the dead boy, finds himself warmly embraced by the Murphy family and sees his memorial tribute to the suicidal Connor go viral on social media.</p> <p>It is an intriguing scenario that touches on a wide range of subjects. It shows how an elaborate fiction can help Evan overcome his sense of isolation. The story also illustrates the way grief allows families to mythologise the dead and how the internet can turn fake news into assumed fact: people willingly subscribe to something called \u201cThe Connor Project\u201d based entirely on a spurious relationship. My main complaint is that Levenson fails to follow his narrative to its logical conclusion. It builds towards the statutory uplift demanded of the musical, in which there seems no price to pay for Evan\u2019s guilty invention and in which his mum, who has appeared culpably negligent, belatedly reveals her maternal love.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"894f5fcdf1afb48f69e8af499cb491baa248f8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/894f5fcdf1afb48f69e8af499cb491baa248f8e6/0_182_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Tutty (Evan Hansen) and Rebecca McKinnis (Heidi Hansen)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last-minute transformation ... Sam Tutty (Evan Hansen) and Rebecca McKinnis (Heidi Hansen).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Murphy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The music and lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul \u2013 who collaborated on the movies La La Land and The Greatest Showman \u2013 are good enough to overcome the occasional holes in the story. The songs, mostly in a pop-rock idiom, seem to happen instinctively rather than being carefully planted. Requiem, in which the Murphy family articulate their complex reactions to Connor\u2019s death, is especially haunting, and Waving Through a Window, where Evan explains he is \u201calways on the outside looking in\u201d, deftly captures the dilemma of the alienated teenager.</p> <p>Mawkishness is also kept at bay by Tutty\u2019s performance.

      "bodyText": "This musical arrives from the US laden with honours \u2013 including six Tony awards and a Grammy \u2013 and you can see why. It captures the agonies of youth, allows the songs to grow out of the action and boasts a great role, here memorably taken by Sam Tutty, for its lead actor. I admired the show without lapsing into unqualified rapture. It starts with the advantage of a book by Steven Levenson \u2013 co-creator of the TV series Fosse/Verdon \u2013 that could stand up as a play in its own right. It tells the story of Evan Hansen, a high-school senior suffering from social anxiety, who is urged by a therapist to write encouraging letters to himself. One such missive is appropriated by a bullying schoolmate, Connor Murphy, shortly before he kills himself. Finding the letter, Murphy\u2019s parents assume it was genuinely addressed to Evan Hansen who does nothing to disabuse them. Indeed, he creates a wholly fabricated friendship with the dead boy, finds himself warmly embraced by the Murphy family and sees his memorial tribute to the suicidal Connor go viral on social media. It is an intriguing scenario that touches on a wide range of subjects. It shows how an elaborate fiction can help Evan overcome his sense of isolation. The story also illustrates the way grief allows families to mythologise the dead and how the internet can turn fake news into assumed fact: people willingly subscribe to something called \u201cThe Connor Project\u201d based entirely on a spurious relationship. My main complaint is that Levenson fails to follow his narrative to its logical conclusion. It builds towards the statutory uplift demanded of the musical, in which there seems no price to pay for Evan\u2019s guilty invention and in which his mum, who has appeared culpably negligent, belatedly reveals her maternal love. The music and lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul \u2013 who collaborated on the movies La La Land and The Greatest Showman \u2013 are good enough to overcome the occasional holes in the story. The songs, mostly in a pop-rock idiom, seem to happen instinctively rather than being carefully planted. Requiem, in which the Murphy family articulate their complex reactions to Connor\u2019s death, is especially haunting, and Waving Through a Window, where Evan explains he is \u201calways on the outside looking in\u201d, deftly captures the dilemma of the alienated teenager. Mawkishness is also kept at bay by Tutty\u2019s performance. Making his West End debut, he captures Evan\u2019s loneliness through an array of nervy smiles and hesitant gestures, and suggests his whole body could disintegrate at any moment: paradoxically, he conveys a lack of certainty with complete technical assurance and, when it comes to his solo numbers, proves he can really sing. Lucy Anderson, another debutant, also impresses in capturing the emotional wariness of Connor\u2019s sister and there is fine work from Rebecca McKinnis as Evan\u2019s mum, even if she has to undergo a last-minute transformation, and from Lauren Ward and Rupert Young as the misled Murphy parents. Michael Greif\u2019s direction, deploying a kaleidoscopically digital design by David Korins, is swift and sensitive. Everything, in fact, is expertly done but, if I didn\u2019t totally surrender to the show, it is because it lacks the courage to admit that high anxiety is not so easily cured. \u2022 At No\u00ebl Coward theatre, London, until 2 May.",

The deceitful Tory mantra about \u201cget Brexit done\u201d \u2013 a con that has received all too little scrutiny \u2013 was slapped down: it would mean at least seven years to negotiate a US trade deal, retorted Jeremy Corbyn. Remember when Theresa May\u2019s \u201cstrong and stable\u201d provoked audience groans? The same fate befell Johnson\u2019s signature slogan. In a genuine moment of TV drama, Corbyn produced a redacted document on secret trade talks between British civil servants and the Trump administration threatening the NHS.</p> \n<p>But his trickiest moment centred on what Tory pollsters have identified as his weakness: which side would he campaign on during the referendum? Though strong on the need to unify remainers and leavers, he needs a clearer answer: that politicians have mucked Brexit up and so the people must sort it.</p> \n<p>Johnson suffered audience ridicule when he was challenged over personal integrity, but Corbyn\u2019s strongest lines came on the Tory damage inflicted on the NHS \u2013 emotionally referring to the case of a dead cancer patient \u2013 and the suffering inflicted by austerity. Although there was no knockout blow, Corbyn hit Johnson with plenty of zingers, though he could have done more to challenge Johnson on rampant Tory Islamophobia and Johnson\u2019s broken sacred 31 October Brexit deadline. But with Corbyn the election underdog, a post-debate YouGov poll suggesting a draw is a win for the Labour leader \u2013 and should buoy his supporters.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> \n<h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland\" title=\"\">Jonathan Freedland</a>: </strong>Johnson looked more assertive</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"117c52c7d315726d79637a9160e44d9c0ace45d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/117c52c7d315726d79637a9160e44d9c0ace45d0/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Jonathan Freedland\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>ITV billed its debate in the manner of a boxing bout \u2013 Johnson v Corbyn \u2013 but neither landed the knockout blow the teams in their corners longed for. And yet, if the collective view eventually declares this contest a draw, that will not dismay the prime minister\u2019s team too much: given the Tory lead in the national polls, an outcome that maintains the status quo will suit them fine. It was Labour that needed to shake things up, with a Corbyn performance so spellbinding it forced voters to take a second look, shaking up the campaign. Though the Labour leader had some good moments, he did not deliver that.</p> \n<p>Johnson had the clearer plan: to haul the conversation back to Brexit no matter what the topic. Whether it was the NHS or antisemitism in Labour, the prime minister wanted to keep punching the bruise of Corbyn\u2019s noncommittal stance on Europe, his refusal to say whether he would campaign to leave or remain in the second referendum Labour would hold if elected. He did it again and again, eliciting groans from the audience. He won\u2019t mind if there was a groundhog day quality to his answers: he had one message to ram home and he did it.</p> \n<p>Corbyn\u2019s preferred terrain was the NHS, and he made the case well, making an emotional plea on behalf of a friend who died just the day before from breast cancer. His answers on Prince Andrew \u2013 putting Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s victims first \u2013 and the institution of monarchy were better too.</p> \n<p>But he showed a curious lack of fight. Johnson repeatedly exposed weak flanks that a more combative opponent would have pounded relentlessly, but Corbyn held back. A question on integrity should have been the cue for an attack on Johnson\u2019s personal record of lies and deception, but Corbyn stayed mute.</p> \n<p>US political operatives say presidential debates \u2013 which this was in all but name \u2013 are gladiatorial affairs, whose impact on the viewer is almost as great with the sound off as with the sound on. They are, on some unstated level, about demonstrating intangible qualities of strength and vigour, and by that measure Johnson probably came off a little better. He was more assertive, more focused, while Corbyn \u2013 his spectacles vaguely askew \u2013 was often hesitant and halting. That\u2019s a cruel way to judge such things, but politics is nothing if not cruel.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p> \n<h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/katy-balls\" title=\"\">Katy Balls</a>: The most revealing part was the audience laughter</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"68baed83b7ebfc0afe9b6fc9b9af65cb2b972503\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68baed83b7ebfc0afe9b6fc9b9af65cb2b972503/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Katy Balls\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>The view in Conservative campaign headquarters is that the key to a successful election campaign is message discipline. On that metric, the Tories can count the first head-to-head debate as a success. Boris Johnson repeatedly uttered his go-to slogan \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, even when the audience appeared to tire of it. While he made sure to deliver the key lines on repeat, his eagerness meant that he at times appeared impatient and aggressive.</p> \n<p>The reason Johnson decided to take the biggest risk of his campaign and agree to the head-to-head debate with Jeremy Corbyn was so that he could try to frame the election as a simple choice between himself and the Labour leader. The hope is that this will lead wavering Liberal Democrat and Brexit party voters to get behind the Conservatives out of a fear of the alternative.</p> \n<p>But in the end, there was no game-changing moment for either.

      "bodyText": "Owen Jones: No knockout blow, but plenty of zingers for Corbyn Brexit was supposed to be Boris Johnson\u2019s strongest suit, and yet even here he had moments where he came unstuck. The deceitful Tory mantra about \u201cget Brexit done\u201d \u2013 a con that has received all too little scrutiny \u2013 was slapped down: it would mean at least seven years to negotiate a US trade deal, retorted Jeremy Corbyn. Remember when Theresa May\u2019s \u201cstrong and stable\u201d provoked audience groans? The same fate befell Johnson\u2019s signature slogan. In a genuine moment of TV drama, Corbyn produced a redacted document on secret trade talks between British civil servants and the Trump administration threatening the NHS. But his trickiest moment centred on what Tory pollsters have identified as his weakness: which side would he campaign on during the referendum? Though strong on the need to unify remainers and leavers, he needs a clearer answer: that politicians have mucked Brexit up and so the people must sort it. Johnson suffered audience ridicule when he was challenged over personal integrity, but Corbyn\u2019s strongest lines came on the Tory damage inflicted on the NHS \u2013 emotionally referring to the case of a dead cancer patient \u2013 and the suffering inflicted by austerity. Although there was no knockout blow, Corbyn hit Johnson with plenty of zingers, though he could have done more to challenge Johnson on rampant Tory Islamophobia and Johnson\u2019s broken sacred 31 October Brexit deadline. But with Corbyn the election underdog, a post-debate YouGov poll suggesting a draw is a win for the Labour leader \u2013 and should buoy his supporters. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland: Johnson looked more assertive ITV billed its debate in the manner of a boxing bout \u2013 Johnson v Corbyn \u2013 but neither landed the knockout blow the teams in their corners longed for. And yet, if the collective view eventually declares this contest a draw, that will not dismay the prime minister\u2019s team too much: given the Tory lead in the national polls, an outcome that maintains the status quo will suit them fine. It was Labour that needed to shake things up, with a Corbyn performance so spellbinding it forced voters to take a second look, shaking up the campaign. Though the Labour leader had some good moments, he did not deliver that. Johnson had the clearer plan: to haul the conversation back to Brexit no matter what the topic. Whether it was the NHS or antisemitism in Labour, the prime minister wanted to keep punching the bruise of Corbyn\u2019s noncommittal stance on Europe, his refusal to say whether he would campaign to leave or remain in the second referendum Labour would hold if elected. He did it again and again, eliciting groans from the audience. He won\u2019t mind if there was a groundhog day quality to his answers: he had one message to ram home and he did it. Corbyn\u2019s preferred terrain was the NHS, and he made the case well, making an emotional plea on behalf of a friend who died just the day before from breast cancer. His answers on Prince Andrew \u2013 putting Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s victims first \u2013 and the institution of monarchy were better too. But he showed a curious lack of fight. Johnson repeatedly exposed weak flanks that a more combative opponent would have pounded relentlessly, but Corbyn held back. A question on integrity should have been the cue for an attack on Johnson\u2019s personal record of lies and deception, but Corbyn stayed mute. US political operatives say presidential debates \u2013 which this was in all but name \u2013 are gladiatorial affairs, whose impact on the viewer is almost as great with the sound off as with the sound on. They are, on some unstated level, about demonstrating intangible qualities of strength and vigour, and by that measure Johnson probably came off a little better. He was more assertive, more focused, while Corbyn \u2013 his spectacles vaguely askew \u2013 was often hesitant and halting. That\u2019s a cruel way to judge such things, but politics is nothing if not cruel. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist Katy Balls: The most revealing part was the audience laughter The view in Conservative campaign headquarters is that the key to a successful election campaign is message discipline. On that metric, the Tories can count the first head-to-head debate as a success. Boris Johnson repeatedly uttered his go-to slogan \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, even when the audience appeared to tire of it. While he made sure to deliver the key lines on repeat, his eagerness meant that he at times appeared impatient and aggressive. The reason Johnson decided to take the biggest risk of his campaign and agree to the head-to-head debate with Jeremy Corbyn was so that he could try to frame the election as a simple choice between himself and the Labour leader. The hope is that this will lead wavering Liberal Democrat and Brexit party voters to get behind the Conservatives out of a fear of the alternative. But in the end, there was no game-changing moment for either. While Johnson had some success attacking Corbyn on Brexit, there\u2019s a risk for the Tories that this backfires and Corbyn\u2019s promise that Labour would hold a second referendum gives remainers considering voting for the Liberal Democrats reason to think twice. The most revealing part of the whole debate, however, wasn\u2019t a politician\u2019s soundbite. It was the audience laughter. It exposed both sides\u2019 weaknesses. There was laughter when Corbyn suggested his Brexit policy was clear and when Johnson suggested the truth mattered. Which of these issues proves the biggest to voters \u2013 Labour Brexit uncertainty or Tory trustworthiness \u2013 will be what decides the election. \u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor Sonia Sodha: Neither did anything that will surprise weary voters This was a debate of two halves; it very much reflected a campaign that feels as though it is running in two parallel universes: the \u201cget Brexit done\u201d election fought by Boris Johnson, and the \u201cfor the many not the few\u201d campaign waged on domestic policy by Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader\u2019s weakest moments came in the first half on Brexit and the union: he looked as evasive as ever on how he would campaign in a second referendum, and didn\u2019t have a strong answer to Johnson\u2019s claim that Labour would have to offer the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon an independence referendum.

I missed a lot of this campaign, but it was all worthwhile.

The team charge at their support, holding hands, the party started. A lovely moment, though, when Gareth Bale breaks off to console Gergo Lovrencsics, who was distraught, in tears. Shades of Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee at Edgbaston during the 2005 Ashes. Bittersweet. BUT LET\u2019S NOT FORGET ABOUT THE SCOTS! Scotland 3-1 Kazakhstan (John McGinn 90). This will be three wins in a row for Steve Clarke\u2019s side. Admittedly they\u2019ve only had to play San Marino, Cyprus and Kazakhstan, but from small acorns, and all that. WALES QUALIFY FOR EURO 2020! The Welsh make it to only their third major finals in their history! And their qualification is fully deserved! They picked up momentum at the business end, and here\u2019s their reward! They were excellent to a man this evening ... but the plaudits go to Aaron Ramsey, who scored both goals on his return. They\u2019ve missed him, huh? GOAL ELSEWHERE! Poland 3-2 Slovenia (Jacek Goralski 81). But never mind that, because ... GOAL ELSEWHERE! Germany 6-1 Northern Ireland (Julian Brandt 90). Brandt tears down the inside left and fizzes a shot across Peacock-Farrell and into the top right. This is now officially a rout. \u201cThank goodness Stoke doesn\u2019t have to play Germany any time soon,\u201d quips Josh Reynolds. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Holland 5-0 Estonia (Myron Boadu 87). The Dutch celebrate their return to the top table in style. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Slovakia 2-0 Azerbaijan (Marek Hamsik 86). Too little, too late for Slovakia. A Hungarian equaliser in Cardiff would have seen them through. But Ryan Giggs\u2019 men were not to be denied. 88 min: Gareth Bale leaves the field of play, to be replaced by Harry Wilson. A chance for Cardiff to show their appreciation of their world star. Wilson gets a grand reception as he comes on, too. The Welsh are a happy bunch right now. 86 min: So having said that, a scrappy scramble erupts in the Welsh box. Joe Allen is on hand to tidy up. A goal for Hungary now would put the cat among the pigeons all right. 83 min: Hungary are causing Wales no problems whatsoever. The hosts have the feet up on the desk, cigar on. That isn\u2019t stopping their fans looking extremely nervous, as the prize of qualification edges ever closer. But you can understand that. It\u2019s how football supporters roll. GOAL! San Marino 0-5 Russia (Nikolai Komlichenko 78). For the record, Scotland scored two when they visited the microstate. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Holland 4-0 Estonia (Georginio Wijnaldum 78). A hat-trick for one of the most underrated midfielders in Europe. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Belgium 6-1 Cyprus (Christian Benteke 68). The clock is ticking very slowly for the Cypriots. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Poland 2-2 Slovenia (Josip Ilicic 61). A point would secure third spot for Slovenia; Poland have long been home and hosed. 75 min: Everyone in the Cardiff City Stadium is in party mode already. James burns his way down the left and cuts back for Ramsey, who hooks for the bottom right. His hat-trick effort is blocked and hacked clear. Wales are purring. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Germany 5-1 Northern Ireland (Leon Goretzka 72). That Michael Smith goal seems a long time ago now. Goretzka scores his second of the evening, a crisp drive into the bottom left from the edge of the area. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Holland 3-0 Estonia (Georginio Wijnaldum 66). A second for the Liverpool midfielder, who now has eight goals in this campaign already for club and country. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Latvia 1-0 Austria (Marcis Oss 65). Goals in every qualifier this evening. Marvellous. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Scotland 2-1 Kazakhstan (Steven Naismith 64). Onwards and upwards. 66 min: Daniel James is a class act. The Manchester United winger makes himself a bit of space on the left, sashays infield, and curls a delightful shot towards the top right. It\u2019s beaten Gulacsi all ends up, but goes over the bar. An inch or so away. Factor in Bale\u2019s earlier free kick, and Wales have been about five centimetres away from a four-goal lead. They\u2019ve been very impressive tonight indeed. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Poland 2-1 Slovenia (Robert Lewandowski 54). With Serge Gnabry going goal crazy, his Bayern Munich team-mate gets in on the act. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Germany 4-1 Northern Ireland (Serge Gnabry 60). Julian Brandt slips a lovely ball down the inside-left channel. Serge Gnabry shoulders debutant Tom Flanagan out of the road with ease, opens his body, and sidefoots past Bailey Peacock-Farrell for his hat-trick. GOAL ELSEWHERE! San Marino 0-4 Russia (Aleksei Ionov 56). Also no doubt recalling how Belgium beat San Marino 9-0 last month: San Marino. 58 min: Wales are looking extremely comfortable right now. Moore nearly breaks clear down the left, chasing a monster punt, but he can\u2019t quite latch onto the ball for a shot. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Belgium 5-1 Cyprus (Kypros Christoforou 51 og). This could get ugly for Cyprus. Belgium beat San Marino 9-0 last month, they\u2019ll no doubt recall. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Scotland 1-1 Kazakhstan (John McGinn 48). The rebuild starts in earnest here! 52 min: Bale nearly gets it, too. He whips a vicious free kick over the wall and back down towards the top right. Gulacsi is nowhere. The ball nearly shaves the top of the crossbar. So close to a spectacular third. 51 min: Hungary suddenly look ragged and desperate. Barath bundles Moore to the ground, just to the left of the D. Bale\u2019s eyes light up. Two goals already for Ramsey. He wants a piece of the action. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Germany 3-1 Northern Ireland (Serge Gnabry 47). A second for the former Arsenal man, and there\u2019s more grist to Grant Tennille\u2019s mill (8.26pm). But all of that may be immaterial! A free kick out on the left. Ben Davies swings it in. Moore tries to connect on the penalty spot. His shank flies through a packed box to Ramsey, free on the left-hand edge of the six-yard box. Ramsey takes a calm touch, and lifts a shot over Gulacsi and into the net. Cardiff erupts in delight! Wales are so close now! The second half gets underway in Cardiff! And elsewhere too, we\u2019ll be bound. A reminder of the state of play. As things stand, Wales are going to Euro 2020 next year. They have to win, or it\u2019s the play-offs for them. A draw is no good to them. A draw might not be good enough for Hungary, either; Slovakia, currently leading against Azerbaijan, would pip them to automatic qualification on the head-to-head should they hold on as expected. Scotland were booed off at half-time. No huge surprise there, if you\u2019d read Ewan Murray\u2019s analysis yesterday. The half-time scores. Germany 2-1 Northern Ireland Netherlands 2-0 Estonia Wales 1-0 Hungary Slovakia 1-0 Azerbaijan North Macedonia 1-0 Israel Poland 1-1 Slovenia Latvia 0-0 Austria Scotland 0-1 Kazakhstan Belgium 4-1 Cyprus San Marino 0-2 Russia GOAL ELSEWHERE! North Macedonia 1-0 Israel (Boban Nikolov 45). A diminuendo end to the first-half goal rush. The big boys Bale and Ramsey combine, and as things stand, the 2016 semi-finalists are heading back to the finals! GOALS ELSEWHERE! And it\u2019s another quickfire double in Brussels. Belgium 3-1 Cyprus (Kevin De Bruyne 41); Belgium 4-1 Cyprus (Yannick Carrasco 44). Three goals in nine minutes for the number-one-ranked team in the world. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Germany 2-1 Northern Ireland (Leon Goretzka 43). Goretzka slides in to force Jonas Hector\u2019s left-wing cross in off the right-hand post. Kazakhstan, though. On the head-to-head, Scotland are currently trailing the 116th best team in the world 4-0. 39 min: Ben Davies, currently without a manager at club level, cuts in from the left and makes space for a shot. Then he dawdles a little, and his eventual effort is blocked. Nice run, though. Meanwhile here\u2019s Grant Tennille with a little succour for Mauricio Pochettino: \u201cRamsey ... Gnabry ... perhaps the universe is reminding dear old Poch there\u2019s indeed life after being unceremoniously shuffled out of North London.\u201d GOAL ELSEWHERE! Belgium 2-1 Cyprus (Kevin De Bruyne 35). You come at the king, you better not miss. Are Belgium favourites for Euro 2020? If not, they should be. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Scotland 0-1 Kazakhstan (Baktiyor Zaynutdinov 34). Twas ever thus. 34 min: What a double save by Hennessey! A long pass down the inside-right channel. Ad Szalai cushions a header down for Szoboszlai, who must score from eight yards! But he shoots straight at the keeper. The ball rebounds to Sallai, just to his left. Sallai should score as well, but Hennessey somehow manages to smother! That is quite superb goalkeeping. 29 min: Wonderful end-to-end fun as Szoboszlai nearly dances straight down the middle of the park and into the Welsh box. He\u2019s stopped at the very last possible opportunity by Mepham, who steps across to block and steal possession. Szoboszlai wants a penalty, but he\u2019s not getting it, and Wales rip upfield. Bale is found in acres out on the right, and his cross is headed wide right by Moore. Had that been on target, it was going into the bottom right, because Gulacsi\u2019s feet were planted. 28 min: Hungary are slowly establishing a foothold. They ping it around awhile. Moore gets fed up and concedes a free kick in the midfield with his elbow. No booking, but he complains quite a lot, and on the touchline Giggsy joins in. A little bit of frustration seeping out. 26 min: Ramsey is very fortunate to escape a booking as he slides through the back of Szoboszlai. From the resulting free kick, pumped into the Welsh box from the left, Barath wastes a decent half-chance by slapping a header miles over the bar. GOALS ELSEWHERE! Slovakia 1-0 Azerbaijan (Robert Bozenik 19); San Marino 0-2 Russia (Sergei Petrov 19); Poland 1-1 Slovenia (Tim Matavz 14). There we are, another goal in Serravalle. GOALS ELSEWHERE! Holland 1-0 Estonia (Georginio Wijnaldum 6); Holland 2-0 Estonia (Nathan Ake 19). I\u2019ll be frank with you, I\u2019ve bitten off more than I can chew here. GOAL! Germany 1-1 Northern Ireland (Serge Gnabry 19). A spin on a sixpence, and Gnabry belts a shot towards the top right. Peacock-Farrell gets a hand to it, but he\u2019s never keeping it out. GOALS ELSEWHERE! And they\u2019ve both come in Brussels. Belgium 0-1 Cyprus (Nicholas Ioannou 14); Belgium 1 -1 Cyprus (Christian Benteke 16). There\u2019s you thinking all tonight\u2019s real action was in N17. Simple but effective! And the two big stars combine. Connor Roberts slips a pass down the right wing for Bale, who reaches the byline, cuts back abruptly, and curls a vicious cross into the centre, where Ramsey has timed his run perfectly. He meets the cross and powers a header past the helpless Gulacsi. As things stand, Wales are going to Euro 2020! 13 min: Wales put their first serious attack together, and it\u2019s a visual delight. James tears down the left wing and glides infield. He lays off to Ramsey, who considers shooting from distance but shuttles the ball towards Bale on the right. Bale cuts back into the penalty box and attempts a curler towards the top left. He doesn\u2019t quite catch it, and it\u2019s an easy snaffle for Gulacsi in the Hungary goal. But that\u2019s got the crowd going again, after a quiet couple of minutes. Not a great deal happening in Cardiff yet. In lieu of action in a match we previously thought would provide us with tonight\u2019s big story, here\u2019s David Hytner on Pochettino\u2019s dismissal. Poor Mauricio. Po\u2019 Poch\u2019s a-cold. SENSATIONAL GOAL ELSEWHERE! Germany 0-1 Northern Ireland (Michael Smith 7). There won\u2019t be a better goal scored all evening! Jonas Hector launches a clearing header upfield. There\u2019s nothing much wrong with it. But it finds Michael Smith in acres of space, and he larrups a riser into the top left from the best part of 30 yards! A proper old-school netbuster! Michael O\u2019Neill, what a manager. 6 min: Wales are knocking it around nicely. No need to rush, as their boss Ryan Giggs said before kick-off. The home fans are keeping their team honest with plenty of encouraging noise. GOAL ELSEWHERE! Poland 1-0 Slovenia (Sebastian Szymanski 3). Early action in Warsaw. I\u2019m already beginning to regret committing to goal alerts for every match. GOAL ELSEWHERE! San Marino 0-1 Russia (Daler Kuzyaev 3). By the looks of it, the scoring in Serravalle won\u2019t end here. 40 seconds or so: Dzsudzsak has a lash from distance. The ball\u2019s sailing towards Barry. What a very strange time to be getting shot of Poch, though, towards the end of a two-week international break. There\u2019s forward planning for you. Can\u2019t wait to hear the story behind this one. Here we go then! Kick off in Cardiff! Hungary get the ball rolling. Incidentally, it\u2019s also kicking off in north London, where Tottenham Hotspur have just sacked Mauricio Pochettino. No doubt you\u2019ll be hearing more of that soon. But one thing at a time. The teams are out at the Cardiff City Stadium! Wales are all in dragon red. Hungary are fond of that colour too, so are forced into second-choice white. Bedlam as the players take to the field; both anthems given a proper belt. Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau delivered with particular hwyl. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. Ryan Giggs, appearing very calm and relaxed, has a quick pre-match chat with Sky. \u201cAaron Ramsey is fit. He got minutes the other day. He\u2019s raring to go. Ramsey and Bale have quality and experience. We\u2019ve not had them together for a long time, Aaron\u2019s been missing for about a year. But there are other players as well, it\u2019s not just about those two. We will need to play as a team to get the victory. We might have to be patient. If we win the game early on, that\u2019s even better. But it might go to the last minute, so we have to play our football and be patient. Momentum has been building, and we\u2019re in good form. Everyone knows it\u2019s a big game, but you can\u2019t get carried away, we\u2019re against a very good organised team and we\u2019ll have to play well to win. I\u2019m sure the fans will get behind us, and we\u2019ll try to give them something to cheer about.\u201d If It Ain\u2019t Broke dept. Scotland name the same side that started Saturday\u2019s 2-1 victory in Cyprus. Tom Flanagan replaces Jonny Evans in the Northern Ireland defence for the dead rubber in Germany. The Sunderland defender makes his first competitive start, standing in for the Leicester man, who has succumbed to illness. Jordan Thompson also starts a meaningful international for the first time, replacing fellow midfielder Stuart Dallas. Shane Ferguson comes in for the injured Jamal Lewis at left-back. Germany coach Joachim Low makes five changes to the side that beat Belarus 4-0 on Saturday. Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Jonas Hector, Jonathan Tah, Julian Brandt and Emre Can replace Manuel Neuer, Robin Koch, Matthias Ginter, Timo Werner and Nico Schulz. Manchester City\u2019s Ilkay Gundogan stars in midfield. Aaron Ramsey is match fit, and thus returns to the Wales starting XI. Ryan Giggs makes two changes from the side named ahead of the 2-0 win in Azerbaijan on Saturday. Ramsey replaces Harry Wilson; it\u2019s his first Wales start in over a year. Meanwhile Joe Allen is back from suspension, and replaces Ethan Ampadu in midfield. Hungary are without injured central defenders Tamas Kadar and Willi Orban. They\u2019re also missing the suspended Mihaly Korhut and Laszlo Kleinheisler. Wales: Hennessey, Connor Roberts, Lockyer, Mepham, Ben Davies, Allen, Morrell, Bale, Ramsey, James, Moore. Subs: Ampadu, Levitt, King, Matondo, Vokes, Tyler Roberts, Vaulks, Wilson, Adam Davies, Williams, Gunter, Jamie Lawrence. Hungary: Gulacsi, Lovrencsics, Barath, Lang, Zsolt Nagy, Patkai, Adam Nagy, Dzsudzsak, Szoboszlai, Sallai, Adam Szalai. Subs: Kovacsik, Varga, Holman, Kovacs, Attila Szalai, Gazdag, Pavkovics, Vida, Dibusz, Holender, Bese, Feczesin. Germany: ter Stegen, Klostermann, Can, Tah, Hector, Gundogan, Kimmich, Kroos, Goretzka, Gnabry, Brandt. Subs: Leno, Rudy, Koch, Ginter, Serdar, Neuer, Amiri, Stark, Schulz, Werner. Northern Ireland: Peacock-Farrell, McNair, Cathcart, Flanagan, Smith, Corry Evans, Davis, Saville, Ferguson, Thompson, Magennis. Subs: Lavery, McGinn, Brown, Carson, Kennedy, Donnelly, McGovern, McLaughlin, Boyce, Lafferty. Scotland: Marshall, Palmer, Gallagher, McKenna, Taylor, Jack, McGregor, Christie, McGinn, Forrest, Naismith. Subs: MacGillivray, Shinnie, Fleck, Burke, McBurnie, Porteous, McLaughlin, Armstrong, Devlin, O\u2019Donnell, Brophy, Morgan. Kazakhstan: Nepogodov, Marochkin, Maliy, Shomko, Abiken, Pertsukh, Logvinenko, Suyumbayev, Zaynutdinov, Islamkhan, Shchetkin. Subs: Tagybergen, Aimbetov, Miroshnichenko, Erlanov, Pokatilov, Zhukov, Alip, Fedin, Kuat, Kerimzhanov, Shatski. Wales versus Hungary, is it? Ah yes. Ivor Allchurch there, setting Wales on their way to victory against the Magyarok at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. More of this sort of spectacular behaviour this evening would be most welcome, as Wales stand on the brink of Euro 2020 qualification. A win tonight, and it\u2019s theirs. A situation they\u2019d have grabbed with both hands when they lost in Budapest 12 months ago. For that reason, this MBM-Clockwatch hybrid will mostly be concentrating on events in Cardiff. But there are another nine matches being played this evening, a qualifying card that also includes (admittedly meaningless) games involving Scotland and Northern Ireland. We\u2019ll keep you posted of events in those too. Germany v Northern Ireland Netherlands v Estonia Wales v Hungary Slovakia v Azerbaijan North Macedonia v Israel Poland v Slovenia Latvia v Austria Scotland v Kazakhstan Belgium v Cyprus San Marino v Russia All games kick off at 7.45pm GMT. Will the Welsh make it to the finals? Can Scotland and Northern Ireland end their group campaigns on a high? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s on!",

But there were still at least 4 million masochists for whom the first leaders\u2019 debate was an essential warm-up to I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here!.

Maybe next time.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit\">Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn clash in ITV election debate over 'NHS for sale' claim \u2013 live news</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The prime minister had spent the morning in a blubberweight fight at a Manchester boxing gym, before making another toe-curlingly embarrassing video of him and Carrie Symonds campaigning and going back to his hotel to dishevel his hair. The Labour leader had been to the barbers for a beard trim and had then settled down to two cups of tea and a Caesar salad. Zen.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping the debate will be respectful and informative,\u201d Corbyn said on his way into the Salford studios. Which rather suggested he had learned nothing from his previous televised debates. Because respect invariably comes thinly disguised as open contempt \u2013 the TV companies wouldn\u2019t have it any other way \u2013 and, ever since the very first 2010 debate in which David Cameron and Gordon Brown underestimated Nick Clegg, no one has ever learned anything very much. Indeed, the whole purpose of the format is to be as uninformative as possible, with both party leaders sticking to set lines.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"828879a2-d053-42c3-9b2e-bb1d73106205\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G6Irb_GIBXw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>An hour before kick-off, the spin room began to fill. First in were Dawn Butler, Richard Burgon, Barry Gardiner, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Andrew Gwynne. Having taken a selfie to put up on Twitter, they positioned themselves in front of TV cameras, managing expectations and saying why Corbyn had basically already won.</p> \n<p>The Tories held back their big guns of Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Priti Patel and James Cleverly. Raab was undergoing anger management therapy \u2013 \u201cTry not to kill anyone this time, Dom\u201d \u2013 while Gove was quietly explaining to Patel and Cleverly that their prime function was to say nothing. In the meantime, Nigel Evans was doing his best to hold the fort. \u201cI\u2019m the Z list,\u201d he said sadly.</p> \n<p>In the far corner of the room, the Lib Dems\u2019 Tom Brake stood to one side, hoping someone might want to speak to him. No one did. The Brexit party\u2019s Richard Tice wandered around looking slightly lost. Presumably he had arrived a little early for his graveyard 3am slot on the Shopping Channel and had accidentally made his way into the wrong building.</p> \n<p>Still, Tice would have felt right at home in the ITV studio. All pretence that the debate was a serious contribution to the election campaign had been abandoned when the lights went up on a set that looked like a cross between a 1970s afternoon gameshow and an S&amp;M dungeon. Julie Etchingham got things rolling by asking both leaders to make an opening statement. Corbyn looked uncharacteristically nervous, while Johnson couldn\u2019t help smirking when trying to maintain his serious face.</p> \n<p>Predictably, the first question was on Brexit. Bingo. It took only one sentence for Boris to utter his first lie. That he had a readymade deal that would deliver a free trade agreement with the EU that could be wrapped up in a matter of months. Etchingham arched an eyebrow. Was he going to die in a ditch on this? Mint some December 2020 coins? The audience sniggered. Corbyn did little better as he continually fudged the issue of whether he would back any deal he renegotiated with the EU. That, too, drew a ripple of laughter.</p> \n<p>This rather set the tone for the rest of the hour. No one really landed any telling blows, with the whole show descending into second-rate light entertainment. Even Prince Andrew could probably have made a better fist of answering the questions. Despite talking over Corbyn and Etchingham at every opportunity \u2013 his ego can\u2019t allow the possibility of conversation \u2013 Johnson reverted to bluster and lies while trying to steer everything back to his Brexit deal that he had rejected 18 months previously.</p> \n<p>Corbyn couldn\u2019t even take advantage of the most open of goals. One questioner asked about personal trust. Here was the Labour leader\u2019s chance to ask Boris how many children he had, his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri and his broken promises to family and country. It would have been a slam-dunk moment that could have maybe changed the momentum of the election. But Corbyn blew it. The first half ended with an insincere handshake.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"298a8c64-fd38-45bf-888a-41b7d34d57c8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CV1h_EbQlN0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The rest was something of a non-event. Corbyn scored well on the NHS with a redacted document but the audience was so dispirited that the debate ended in a Blind Date chat. Corbyn would give Boris A Christmas Carol for Christmas: Johnson would give Corbyn some damson jam. No voters\u2019 minds would be changed. The only winner was Etchingham who somehow held the shitshow together.</p> \n<p>Yet despite all this, the debate had revealed something. That voters hold both leaders in open contempt and are in despair that one of them will end up as prime minister. Given the chance to show off their best selves, Johnson and Corbyn had merely proved they didn\u2019t have one. The country was even more screwed than anyone had previously imagined.</p> \n<p><em>John Crace\u2019s new book, Decline and Fail: Read in Case of Political Apocalypse, is published by Guardian Faber.

      "bodyText": "Teeth to be pulled. Eyes to be gouged. Throats to be slit. Most people had wisely made alternative arrangements. But there were still at least 4 million masochists for whom the first leaders\u2019 debate was an essential warm-up to I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here!. Had Boris Johnson been smothered in a cage full of rats or Jeremy Corbyn been force-fed termites, ITV would have had the surefire ratings winner of the year. Maybe next time. The prime minister had spent the morning in a blubberweight fight at a Manchester boxing gym, before making another toe-curlingly embarrassing video of him and Carrie Symonds campaigning and going back to his hotel to dishevel his hair. The Labour leader had been to the barbers for a beard trim and had then settled down to two cups of tea and a Caesar salad. Zen. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the debate will be respectful and informative,\u201d Corbyn said on his way into the Salford studios. Which rather suggested he had learned nothing from his previous televised debates. Because respect invariably comes thinly disguised as open contempt \u2013 the TV companies wouldn\u2019t have it any other way \u2013 and, ever since the very first 2010 debate in which David Cameron and Gordon Brown underestimated Nick Clegg, no one has ever learned anything very much. Indeed, the whole purpose of the format is to be as uninformative as possible, with both party leaders sticking to set lines. An hour before kick-off, the spin room began to fill. First in were Dawn Butler, Richard Burgon, Barry Gardiner, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Andrew Gwynne. Having taken a selfie to put up on Twitter, they positioned themselves in front of TV cameras, managing expectations and saying why Corbyn had basically already won. The Tories held back their big guns of Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Priti Patel and James Cleverly. Raab was undergoing anger management therapy \u2013 \u201cTry not to kill anyone this time, Dom\u201d \u2013 while Gove was quietly explaining to Patel and Cleverly that their prime function was to say nothing. In the meantime, Nigel Evans was doing his best to hold the fort. \u201cI\u2019m the Z list,\u201d he said sadly. In the far corner of the room, the Lib Dems\u2019 Tom Brake stood to one side, hoping someone might want to speak to him. No one did. The Brexit party\u2019s Richard Tice wandered around looking slightly lost. Presumably he had arrived a little early for his graveyard 3am slot on the Shopping Channel and had accidentally made his way into the wrong building. Still, Tice would have felt right at home in the ITV studio. All pretence that the debate was a serious contribution to the election campaign had been abandoned when the lights went up on a set that looked like a cross between a 1970s afternoon gameshow and an S&amp;M dungeon. Julie Etchingham got things rolling by asking both leaders to make an opening statement. Corbyn looked uncharacteristically nervous, while Johnson couldn\u2019t help smirking when trying to maintain his serious face. Predictably, the first question was on Brexit. Bingo. It took only one sentence for Boris to utter his first lie. That he had a readymade deal that would deliver a free trade agreement with the EU that could be wrapped up in a matter of months. Etchingham arched an eyebrow. Was he going to die in a ditch on this? Mint some December 2020 coins? The audience sniggered. Corbyn did little better as he continually fudged the issue of whether he would back any deal he renegotiated with the EU. That, too, drew a ripple of laughter. This rather set the tone for the rest of the hour. No one really landed any telling blows, with the whole show descending into second-rate light entertainment. Even Prince Andrew could probably have made a better fist of answering the questions. Despite talking over Corbyn and Etchingham at every opportunity \u2013 his ego can\u2019t allow the possibility of conversation \u2013 Johnson reverted to bluster and lies while trying to steer everything back to his Brexit deal that he had rejected 18 months previously. Corbyn couldn\u2019t even take advantage of the most open of goals. One questioner asked about personal trust. Here was the Labour leader\u2019s chance to ask Boris how many children he had, his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri and his broken promises to family and country. It would have been a slam-dunk moment that could have maybe changed the momentum of the election. But Corbyn blew it. The first half ended with an insincere handshake. The rest was something of a non-event. Corbyn scored well on the NHS with a redacted document but the audience was so dispirited that the debate ended in a Blind Date chat. Corbyn would give Boris A Christmas Carol for Christmas: Johnson would give Corbyn some damson jam. No voters\u2019 minds would be changed. The only winner was Etchingham who somehow held the shitshow together. Yet despite all this, the debate had revealed something. That voters hold both leaders in open contempt and are in despair that one of them will end up as prime minister. Given the chance to show off their best selves, Johnson and Corbyn had merely proved they didn\u2019t have one. The country was even more screwed than anyone had previously imagined.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s about time he contributed, isn\u2019t it?\u201d a smirking Gareth Bale said, putting his arm round the shoulder of Aaron Ramsey, who scored twice on his first Wales start for more than a year to steer his country to Euro 2020. Soon afterwards Bale, drowned out by the blaring sound of Feeder\u2019s Buck Rogers, was cavorting round the pitch amid a carnival atmosphere in Cardiff. He was waving a flag decorated with the words \u201cWales. Golf. Madrid. In that Order\u201d after he and his teammates charged at the Canton Stand before performing a synchronised belly flop in front of fans revelling in reaching a third tournament finals. Ramsey applied the finishing touches on a memorable night, propelling Ryan Giggs\u2019s side past a Hungary side outclassed from start to finish to earn their place at a second successive European Championship. The plan on Saturday \u2013 when Wales won in Azerbaijan to take automatic qualification back into their own hands \u2013 was for Ramsey to replace Bale after an hour and by the time the latter was withdrawn against Hungary, the perfect scenario had again played out. Giggs craved a fearless display and his youthful team delivered, performing with gusto. The returning Ramsey and Bale started together for the first time in 368 days \u2013 and how they enjoyed themselves. There was an air of inevitability that Ramsey would prove the hero on his return to the starting lineup. With 47 minutes played, his wonderfully taken goals had Wales purring and in the driving seat. If Ramsey was the protagonist, Bale was the architect. When the opener came, it had to be Ramsey via a gorgeous Bale cross; of course they would combine on the country\u2019s biggest occasion since the defeat by Portugal in the Euro 2016 semi-finals. Joe Allen fed Connor Roberts, who slid in Bale down the right. Bale whizzed to the byline, darting inside Adam Lang before curling a delicious left-foot cross for an unmarked Ramsey. He powered a header beyond Peter Gulacsi in the Hungary goal, sending Cardiff into a frenzy. Bale\u2019s wonderful cross seemed to hang in the air for a lifetime but Ramsey made no mistake. Long before the end, stirring renditions of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau echoed round the stadium as supporters prepared to dust off the atlas in anticipation of another European tour. Wales performance was brave, courageous and convincing, a display worthy of the occasion. Croatia\u2019s victory over Slovakia on Saturday wrestled fate back in Wales\u2019 favour but, when it came to securing the required outcome, it was down to Giggs\u2019 vibrant young group to produce. It was not only Ramsey\u2019s first Wales start for more than a year that was a huge fillip for Giggs, who made two changes. Joe Morrell, the midfielder on loan at League One Lincoln, again did not look out of place, while Allen returned with authority from suspension. The Wigan striker Kieffer Moore, who joined non-league Forest Green Rovers the same summer Wales made friends at Euro 2016, impressively led the line. Meanwhile staples from the European campaign in France, namely Chris Gunter, Ashley Williams and Sam Vokes, again warmed the bench. On the half-hour Ramsey was the catalyst for a slick Wales counter-attack that culminated in Moore heading inches wide from another wicked Bale ball from the right. It was always likely to be a chastening evening for Zsolt Nagy, the Hungary defender making his full debut. and Bale made a point of tormenting him. The visitors had one golden chance, when Wayne Hennessey made a heroic double save to deny Dominik Szoboszlai and shut out Roland Sallai\u2019s relatively tame rebound but it was in effect game over less than two minutes after the interval. Wales doubled their advantage when Ramsey kept his cool to fire in at the back post after feeding off the scraps of a Ben Davies free-kick. The selfless Moore was influential, hooking the ball into the direction of the Juventus midfielder via Chris Mepham, who shielded his marker, allowing Ramsey to finish. Bale almost made it three with a free-kick that flashed over. Bale suggested Wales\u2019s attacking armoury is stronger than three years ago and they caused havoc for Hungary from all areas, be it Moore, a constant out-ball, Daniel James, the Manchester United winger who almost put the gloss on things with a curling effort, or one of the usual suspects. Giggs\u2019s vibrant side relished every minute without being reckless or overzealous, with the teenage substitute Ethan Ampadu showing a maturity that belied his years. Roberts, too, hoovered up in key moments. James sped beyond Gergo Lovrencsics late on, presenting Ramsey with an inviting chance to mark his flawless return with a hat-trick but Gulacsi saved with his legs.

And although fungi are not plants, most depend for mutual nourishment on plants and trees, which also had a good growing season. Even the recent drop in temperatures has helped to trigger the growth of mushrooms and toadstools, the fruiting bodies of fungi. There have also been some finds of exceptionally rare fungi. The fabulous exotic violet coral fungus looks like something from a tropical coral reef and was found on the Llyn peninsula, Gwynedd. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen it in about 10 years,\u201d said Trevor Dines of the plant charity Plantlife. Another uncommon species was the devil\u2019s fingers fungus found in the Malvern hills on the Herefordshire-Worcestershire border. This fungus looks like a sea creature with striking pink-purple \u201ctentacles\u201d covered in stinking goo. The stench attracts insects to the tentacles where the spores lie, and which are picked up and spread by the insects. The fungus originally came from Australia and New Zealand and appeared in France in 1914, possibly carried in military equipment during the first world war; it was first discovered in England in 1946.",

He also dodges the question Johnson obsesses about as to whether Corbyn will campaign on either side of the people\u2019s vote, for no reason I can see. Corbyn has already said he wouldn\u2019t campaign either way, that he\u2019d let the deal speak for itself.</p> <p>Indeed, even when Johnson asks him face-to-face, he pivots back to the NHS.

Polemarchus \u2018Two minutes to reply is not enough \u2013 we\u2019re getting peanuts\u2019 So far utter crap. Johnson still not answering questions on HIS integrity but banging on the same stupid Brexit question at Corbyn and two minutes to reply to a question is not enough. We\u2019re getting peanuts. hacklesup \u2018Johnson\u2019s track record haunts him\u2019 What\u2019s clear is that Johnson is attacking Corbyn personally, while Corbyn won\u2019t be drawn into sink so low as to make a personal attack on Johnson. The unspoken words about personal integrity nevertheless echoed in the laughter of the audience when Johnson asked about telling the truth. His track record haunts him, and he continues to try to brazen it out \u2013 but everyone knows about the border down the Irish sea, wasting our money on garden bridges in the sky, building 40 hospitals, etc. desnol \u2018I doubt whether it will make the slightest difference\u2019 Anyone genuinely impartial could not fail to see Johnson\u2019s constant deflection, bluster and insults, by comparison Corbyn\u2019s performance was far, far better, but I doubt whether it will make the slightest difference. rosybeeme \u2018Corbyn doesn\u2019t do himself any favours\u2019 Corbyn doesn\u2019t do himself any favours. Own your stance, say you want to agree a deal, give the public a referendum and remain neutral as you want to be the PM of everyone, not a subsection of the population. Dodging the question makes you look like you have something to hide. rmw239 \u2018This is so depressing\u2019 This is so depressing. Two Brexiters, one overt and one covert, debating the colour of Brexit unicorns. Corbyn comes across as shifty and can\u2019t bring himself to say that EU membership is in the UK\u2019s national interest. nonanon1 \u2018I\u2019m somewhat concerned that more people may be distracted by Corbyn\u2019s glasses appearing to be cockeyed\u2019 Corbyn gives a good first answer on Brexit (seven years to negotiate the US trade deal) but I\u2019m somewhat concerned that more people may be distracted by his glasses appearing to be cockeyed. Corbyn\u2019s second Brexit answer points out that Johnson first voted against May\u2019s deal (twice), but he fails to point out the part where Johnson\u2019s revision includes a border down the Irish Sea. He also dodges the question Johnson obsesses about as to whether Corbyn will campaign on either side of the people\u2019s vote, for no reason I can see. Corbyn has already said he wouldn\u2019t campaign either way, that he\u2019d let the deal speak for itself. Indeed, even when Johnson asks him face-to-face, he pivots back to the NHS. Which is all well and good, but Corbyn HAS a simple response \u2026 why doesn\u2019t he use it?? Jessica Roth",

      "body": "<p>To understand how it has come to this for Mauricio Pochettino, why his Tottenham team have flatlined in the Premier League and why he has now been sacked as the manager, it is necessary to consider a concept that he holds dear. It involves the natural cycle of an elite player\u2019s development.</p> \n<p>When the player is young, he is grateful for opportunity and he seizes it with everything he has. He becomes a regular, a star, a full international. He wants more money. Then, in many cases, he wants an opportunity at another club, a bigger club, perhaps. He thinks he deserves even more money.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/19/mauricio-pochettino-sacked-tottenham-manager\">Mauricio Pochettino sacked as Tottenham manager amid poor results</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At this point it is decision time and \u2013 for Pochettino \u2013 it often makes sense to sell that player, ideally at a profit, and either reinvest the proceeds on a player at a higher starting level or create new pathways for others, possibly from the academy.</p> \n<p>There is no recrimination towards the want-away player, merely realism. This is how football\u2019s ecosystem works, certainly at a club like Spurs. It should be noted, too, that rather like the parenting of children, the management of players must evolve at each new stage.</p> \n<p>The problem comes when the order of things is stunted and this is what has happened for various reasons at Spurs over the past 18 months. The club have been unable to move on players that either want to leave or have become surplus to requirements and the result has been stalemates. The players have sat on their contracts, running them down, heightening tensions.</p> \n<p>Remember the criticism that Arsenal received a couple of seasons ago when some of their key players were stalling on re-signing with the club? The situation is just as bad now at Spurs, with Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen approaching the final six months on their deals. Danny Rose, who is out of contract in the summer of 2021, has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/13/danny-rose-tottenham-not-going-anywhere-contract\" title=\"\">he will not sign a new one</a>.</p> \n<p>For Pochettino the frustrations boiled over this summer, leading to his departure on Tuesday night.

It follows that they were more difficult to manage; the dynamics of the squad heavier, more testing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/19/football-reacts-mauricio-pochettino-sacking-tottenham\">\u2018The players got him the sack\u2019 \u2026 football reacts to Pochettino\u2019s Spurs dismissal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pochettino\u2019s summer was pockmarked by conflict with the chairman, Daniel Levy, which was fired by his decision to go straight from the Champions League final in Madrid to Barcelona and let it be known that, if Levy wanted him, he could come to see him there.</p> \n<p>Pochettino was devastated by the defeat to Liverpool and there are those at Spurs who think that his \u201chead went\u201d after it. In terms of the summer he made it clear to Levy it was over to him to reshape the squad and define the next chapter. It was a fraught period, with Levy the immovable object to Pochettino\u2019s irresistible force. The relationship between the pair seemed to have returned to a more stable footing since the closure of the European transfer window at the start of September, with them sharing a private jet to Milan for the Fifa Best Awards later that month. Also on board were Pochettino\u2019s wife, Karina, his assistant manager, Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez, and the club\u2019s chief scout, Steve Hitchen.</p> \n<p>But the question came to be asked with increasing desperation: could Pochettino drag himself and the club out of the quicksand? The hierarchy\u2019s view was something had to give and that was Pochettino\u2019s job because results in the league could not continue like this. They have taken 14 points from 12 matches this season and, in a larger sample size back to February, 25 from 24 games \u2013 in other words, relegation form. Performances have been flat and fragile.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What was known was that Pochettino would not walk away.

      "bodyText": "To understand how it has come to this for Mauricio Pochettino, why his Tottenham team have flatlined in the Premier League and why he has now been sacked as the manager, it is necessary to consider a concept that he holds dear. It involves the natural cycle of an elite player\u2019s development. When the player is young, he is grateful for opportunity and he seizes it with everything he has. He becomes a regular, a star, a full international. He wants more money. Then, in many cases, he wants an opportunity at another club, a bigger club, perhaps. He thinks he deserves even more money. At this point it is decision time and \u2013 for Pochettino \u2013 it often makes sense to sell that player, ideally at a profit, and either reinvest the proceeds on a player at a higher starting level or create new pathways for others, possibly from the academy. There is no recrimination towards the want-away player, merely realism. This is how football\u2019s ecosystem works, certainly at a club like Spurs. It should be noted, too, that rather like the parenting of children, the management of players must evolve at each new stage. The problem comes when the order of things is stunted and this is what has happened for various reasons at Spurs over the past 18 months. The club have been unable to move on players that either want to leave or have become surplus to requirements and the result has been stalemates. The players have sat on their contracts, running them down, heightening tensions. Remember the criticism that Arsenal received a couple of seasons ago when some of their key players were stalling on re-signing with the club? The situation is just as bad now at Spurs, with Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen approaching the final six months on their deals. Danny Rose, who is out of contract in the summer of 2021, has said he will not sign a new one. For Pochettino the frustrations boiled over this summer, leading to his departure on Tuesday night. At the end of the 2017-18 season he had called for decisive action in the club\u2019s transfer business only for nothing to happen. And when he returned this July, after spending time at his home in Barcelona after the Champions League final defeat against Liverpool, he was furious to see that outgoing business was once again slow. Spurs would sell Kieran Trippier to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for a cut-price \u00a320m in an attempt to get things moving while they added three young players \u2013 Tanguy Ndombele, Giovani Lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon. The renewal was not what Pochettino had in mind and this season he was left to use essentially the same names \u2013 though in some cases they were different people \u2013 with a little less zest for the project. It follows that they were more difficult to manage; the dynamics of the squad heavier, more testing. Pochettino\u2019s summer was pockmarked by conflict with the chairman, Daniel Levy, which was fired by his decision to go straight from the Champions League final in Madrid to Barcelona and let it be known that, if Levy wanted him, he could come to see him there. Pochettino was devastated by the defeat to Liverpool and there are those at Spurs who think that his \u201chead went\u201d after it. In terms of the summer he made it clear to Levy it was over to him to reshape the squad and define the next chapter. It was a fraught period, with Levy the immovable object to Pochettino\u2019s irresistible force. The relationship between the pair seemed to have returned to a more stable footing since the closure of the European transfer window at the start of September, with them sharing a private jet to Milan for the Fifa Best Awards later that month. Also on board were Pochettino\u2019s wife, Karina, his assistant manager, Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez, and the club\u2019s chief scout, Steve Hitchen. But the question came to be asked with increasing desperation: could Pochettino drag himself and the club out of the quicksand? The hierarchy\u2019s view was something had to give and that was Pochettino\u2019s job because results in the league could not continue like this. They have taken 14 points from 12 matches this season and, in a larger sample size back to February, 25 from 24 games \u2013 in other words, relegation form. Performances have been flat and fragile. What was known was that Pochettino would not walk away. He has had the opportunities in better times to think about offers from rival clubs after they put out feelers for him but he remained loyal. He was never going to fall on his sword. It is worth considering that the Spurs fans never turned on him and Levy made it clear in his statement that it was a hugely difficult decision to sack him, mainly because of the good times they had enjoyed together. But in his heart Pochettino knew that he was not immune to the realities of football. He had described himself as being in the throes of a rebuilding job but, with everything seemingly jammed, he had said recently that \u201cwe will see if we have the time to build what we want\u201d. There was the sense at Spurs that everybody was praying for an upturn, beginning at West Ham on Saturday, which might have allowed them to battle on until the summer when a full reboot could take place, possibly under Pochettino. He and his friends at the club have been unceremoniously disabused of that notion.",

      "body": "<p> Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 20 November.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Swedish authorities have dropped their rape investigation against Julian Assange,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/19/sweden-drops-julian-assange-investigation\">noting that the complainant\u2019s evidence was deemed credible and reliable</a>, but that after nearly a decade witnesses\u2019 memories may have faded. After a comprehensive assessment the case against Assange was deemed \u201cnot strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment\u201d, but the Swedish attorney general could yet appeal. The WikiLeaks founder, who is still battling extradition to the US, has been facing possible charges in Sweden since 2010. </p> <p><strong>The author who triggered a stunning police crackdown on a mystery prisoner in a Canberra jail has hit out at the secrecy surrounding the man\u2019s imprisonment.</strong> A former military intelligence officer was prosecuted, convicted and jailed in the ACT last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/20/author-who-tried-to-help-mystery-prisoner-publish-memoir-hits-out-at-secret-trials\">in a process </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/20/author-who-tried-to-help-mystery-prisoner-publish-memoir-hits-out-at-secret-trials\"> hidden from public scrutiny</a>. The author, Robert Macklin, attempted to publish the man\u2019s memoirs on his time in prison, which sparked police raids of the inmate\u2019s cell and his brother\u2019s home. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we had secret trials in Australia,\u201d Macklin said. \u201cIt worries me that we do.\u201d The former ACT chief minister Jon Stanhope compared the case to those prosecuted under totalitarian regimes, saying \u201cnot even the media was aware that this trial had occurred\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Food delivery bike couriers are being underpaid by up to $322 a week</strong>,<strong> </strong>according to figures from union researchers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/20/food-delivery-bike-couriers-in-australia-being-underpaid-by-up-to-322-a-week\">compared with minimum rates of pay and superannuation in the transport award</a>. A survey of more than 240 riders revealed that almost all had no minimum rates of pay, and were paid per delivery on a \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d basis.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 20 November. Top stories Swedish authorities have dropped their rape investigation against Julian Assange, noting that the complainant\u2019s evidence was deemed credible and reliable, but that after nearly a decade witnesses\u2019 memories may have faded. After a comprehensive assessment the case against Assange was deemed \u201cnot strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment\u201d, but the Swedish attorney general could yet appeal. The WikiLeaks founder, who is still battling extradition to the US, has been facing possible charges in Sweden since 2010. The author who triggered a stunning police crackdown on a mystery prisoner in a Canberra jail has hit out at the secrecy surrounding the man\u2019s imprisonment. A former military intelligence officer was prosecuted, convicted and jailed in the ACT last year, in a process hidden from public scrutiny. The author, Robert Macklin, attempted to publish the man\u2019s memoirs on his time in prison, which sparked police raids of the inmate\u2019s cell and his brother\u2019s home. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we had secret trials in Australia,\u201d Macklin said. \u201cIt worries me that we do.\u201d The former ACT chief minister Jon Stanhope compared the case to those prosecuted under totalitarian regimes, saying \u201cnot even the media was aware that this trial had occurred\u201d. Food delivery bike couriers are being underpaid by up to $322 a week, according to figures from union researchers, compared with minimum rates of pay and superannuation in the transport award. A survey of more than 240 riders revealed that almost all had no minimum rates of pay, and were paid per delivery on a \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d basis. As independent contractors, riders for companies like Deliveroo are not paid the award minimum wage, and miss out on weekend penalty rates and superannuation. An unfair dismissal case before the Fair Work Commission began on Monday seeking to prove that Uber Eats drivers are in fact employees. Australia The Australian hostage Timothy Weeks and his US colleague Kevin King have finally been released by the Taliban, a week after a prisoner exchange was aborted for unknown reasons. Weeks, a 50-year-old teacher, spent more than three years in captivity. Catastrophic fire danger conditions have been declared for much of South Australia for Wednesday, with more than 100 schools closed and at-risk residents told to leave their homes. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast a maximum 42C for Adelaide, while the mercury is expected to reach 45C in other parts of the state. The NSW police watchdog will investigate more officers over the strip-search of minors, with public hearings set for December after \u201cseveral young people\u201d were strip-searched at an under-18s event in Sydney this year. Scott Morrison is set to announce a $3.8bn infrastructure stimulus package, after calls from the Reserve Bank and the International Monetary Fund for governments to provide fiscal stimulus amid global economic uncertainty. The world Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a key witness in the Trump impeachment inquiry, has said he reported the president\u2019s \u201cimproper\u201d telephone call with the Ukrainian president immediately, slamming character attacks on those testifying as \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cvile\u201d. Two prison guards have been indicted for failing to check on Jeffrey Epstein on the night he died in a New York jail cell, with prosecutors alleging the duo \u201csat at their desk, browsed the internet\u201d instead. One of Spain\u2019s biggest corruption trials has found two former socialist presidents guilty of misconduct and misuse of public funds after \u20ac680m was handed out fraudulently through a \u201ctotally opaque grants system\u201d. Malta\u2019s prime minister has announced a potentially significant breakthrough in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia after a suspected plea deal by one of the middlemen involved in the high-profile anti-corruption journalist\u2019s bombing. An increasingly dangerous climate mechanism in the Indian Ocean is being \u201csupercharged\u201d by global heating, with Australian bushfires and African floods a result of the phenomenon, similar to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a in the Pacific.

      "bodyText": "A Metropolitan police chief who was sent an unsolicited video of child sexual abuse via WhatsApp has been convicted of possessing indecent images on her phone. Supt Robyn Williams, 54, was found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey and potentially faces being sacked after 36 years of distinguished service. Williams was at a gym class in February 2018 when she was sent the video via WhatsApp on her phone by her sister, who was outraged by its content and wanted the person behind it caught. Under the law on possessing indecent images, it was for Williams to prove she had a legitimate reason to have it, or that she had not seen the video and did not have reason to believe it was indecent. Williams, who had denied possessing an indecent image of a child, looked stunned as the jury delivered its 10-to-one majority verdict after more than 10 hours of deliberation. She was found not guilty of corruptly failing to report the image, after the jury rejected the prosecution\u2019s claim that Williams had seen a thumbnail of the image, and thus was aware of its serious nature, but failed to report it because she feared getting her sister into trouble. Williams maintained she never saw the thumbnail; it was accepted she never played the 1min video. The prosecution alleged Williams was lying to protect her sister. Williams, who was honoured for her work after the Grenfell fire disaster, is one of the most senior female African-Caribbean police officers. The jury heard she was a founder member of the National Black Police Association, helped set up a gay police association, campaigned for more women in policing and had received the Queen\u2019s police medal. Her sister and co-defendant, Jennifer Hodge, 56, was convicted of distributing an indecent image of a child. She sent it via WhatsApp to 17 people, including Williams. Hodge had been sent it by her partner, Dido Massivi, 61, who was convicted of distributing two indecent images and possessing an extreme image. The video was sent to Williams on a Saturday and the next day she spent several hours with her sister. At one point in a police interview Hodge said she had mentioned the video to her sister, but later said she had not. The prosecutor Richard Wright QC, opening the case, made it clear the defendants had no sexual interest in the images: \u201cThis is instead a case in which we allege that each of them made serious errors of judgment about how to handle this video and in dealing with it as they did, each of them has committed serious criminal offences.\u201d After sending the video, Hodge sent a message expressing her outrage about the video: \u201cSorry had to send this it\u2019s so sad that this person would put this out please post this and let\u2019s hope he gets life.\u201d The crown say that 40 minutes later Williams opened WhatsApp. Wright said: \u201cShe would have seen a tile [thumbnail] that showed the first frame of the video. It would have been clear \u2026 and we say it would have been immediately obvious exactly what it was: an indecent video of a child.\u201d Another person who was sent the video by Hodge reported it to the police. An investigation began and identified Williams as one of those who received the video. After the verdict, the deputy assistant commissioner, responsible for professionalism, Matthew Horne said: \u201cThe prosecution called this a \u2018sad case\u2019 and referred to the \u2018serious errors of judgment\u2019 made by those involved. The court heard that Supt Williams has led a distinguished career in policing and previously been commended for her professionalism. \u201cThe Independent Office for Police Conduct is carrying out an independent misconduct investigation into the actions of Supt Williams and we await the outcome.\u201d Williams remains on restricted duties at this stage. The officer, who at the time was the borough commander for Sutton in south London, told the jury she never saw the image of a man sexually assaulting a girl, and would have taken immediate action if she had. \u201cIf I\u2019d seen anything remotely like that, I would have simply, simply \u2013 I am on speed dial to my chief inspector \u2013 I would have called my lead for safeguarding and asked what was the best possible way to get this evidence into the chain of action, so we could safeguard and best protect this child. Simple phone call, no discussion.\u201d All three will be sentenced on 26 November. Supporters of Williams were aghast that she was put on trial when there was no evidence she played the video. Some in policing were also concerned that the case appeared to show a black officer being picked on, threatened with humiliation, ruin and jail. The Police Superintendents\u2019 Association and Black Police Association asked the Met to review the case five times but the force declined.",

      "body": "<p>The secretary of state\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/us-israeli-settlements-no-longer-considered-illegal-palestinian-land-mike-pompeo\" title=\"\">announcement</a> that the US no longer considers Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land to be illegal is appalling. It is also the dismal culmination of the Trump administration\u2019s record.</p> <p>Washington has done all it can to aid Israel\u2019s rightwing government, punish Palestinians and bury the two-state solution: moving its embassy to Jerusalem, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/trump-to-cut-all-us-funding-for-uns-main-palestinian-refugee-programme\" title=\"\">ending funding</a> to the UN Palestinian refugee agency, and recognising Israeli sovereignty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/21/trump-us-golan-heights-israel-sovereignty\" title=\"\">over the Golan Heights</a>.</p> <p>While David Friedman, the US ambassador to Israel, and others have a deep ideological commitment to these measures, the administration has done these things primarily to boost the prospects of Benjamin Netanyahu and bolster Donald Trump\u2019s support among evangelicals. Mr Netanyahu is clinging on to power, as his rival Benny Gantz \u2013 who has also welcomed the US decision \u2013 struggles to form a rival government. Yet another Israeli election, the third in less than a year, looks highly likely, and the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether to indict Mr Netanyahu on corruption charges is expected within days. In the US, Mr Trump surely welcomes a diversion from the impeachment hearings.</p> <p>This measure is the latest of the administration\u2019s efforts to destroy the international rules-based order. The declaration is symbolic rather than practical. The settlements remain illegal; Mr Trump\u2019s fiat does not change international law. Nor does the purported rationale, that condemning them as illegal has not brought peace. As Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the liberal pro-Israel lobby group J Street, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeremyBenAmi/status/1196526835577839617\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cDoing it for 52 years doesn\u2019t make it legal, it makes it worse.\u201d </p> <p>It is true that settlements have flourished regardless of international strictures, and that previous US governments have done little more than scold. Settlements grew exponentially while Barack Obama was president. But the US eventually grew so exasperated that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/23/us-abstention-allows-un-to-demand-end-to-israeli-settlements\" title=\"\">allowed through</a> a UN security council resolution demanding a halt to all construction in the occupied territories, rather than veto it, and John Kerry made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/28/kerry-defends-us-decision-to-not-veto-un-condemnation-of-israeli-settlements\" title=\"\">blistering attack</a> on Mr Netanyahu\u2019s government. </p> <p>The administration has not only broken with decades of policy but with most allies. The European Union was quick to reaffirm that all settlement activity is illegal, that it erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace, and that it should be ended. Democratic presidential candidates were quick to attack the announcement, with Elizabeth Warren pledging to reverse it.

      "bodyText": "The secretary of state\u2019s announcement that the US no longer considers Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land to be illegal is appalling. It is also the dismal culmination of the Trump administration\u2019s record. Washington has done all it can to aid Israel\u2019s rightwing government, punish Palestinians and bury the two-state solution: moving its embassy to Jerusalem, ending funding to the UN Palestinian refugee agency, and recognising Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. While David Friedman, the US ambassador to Israel, and others have a deep ideological commitment to these measures, the administration has done these things primarily to boost the prospects of Benjamin Netanyahu and bolster Donald Trump\u2019s support among evangelicals. Mr Netanyahu is clinging on to power, as his rival Benny Gantz \u2013 who has also welcomed the US decision \u2013 struggles to form a rival government. Yet another Israeli election, the third in less than a year, looks highly likely, and the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether to indict Mr Netanyahu on corruption charges is expected within days. In the US, Mr Trump surely welcomes a diversion from the impeachment hearings. This measure is the latest of the administration\u2019s efforts to destroy the international rules-based order. The declaration is symbolic rather than practical. The settlements remain illegal; Mr Trump\u2019s fiat does not change international law. Nor does the purported rationale, that condemning them as illegal has not brought peace. As Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the liberal pro-Israel lobby group J Street, tweeted: \u201cDoing it for 52 years doesn\u2019t make it legal, it makes it worse.\u201d It is true that settlements have flourished regardless of international strictures, and that previous US governments have done little more than scold. Settlements grew exponentially while Barack Obama was president. But the US eventually grew so exasperated that it allowed through a UN security council resolution demanding a halt to all construction in the occupied territories, rather than veto it, and John Kerry made a blistering attack on Mr Netanyahu\u2019s government. The administration has not only broken with decades of policy but with most allies. The European Union was quick to reaffirm that all settlement activity is illegal, that it erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace, and that it should be ended. Democratic presidential candidates were quick to attack the announcement, with Elizabeth Warren pledging to reverse it. Her rivals should make sure that Israel is in no doubt about their positions. The predictability of this announcement makes it more disgraceful, not less. It does not merely recognise the facts on the ground, as Mike Pompeo claimed. It encourages further expansion and annexation, as the welcome from pro-settlement politicians and campaigners has demonstrated. To claim, as Mr Pompeo has done, that it increases the likelihood of a peace deal is an Orwellian use of language. The US appears to be abandoning all pretence of acting as a broker. But if it really wishes to face the facts, it should acknowledge that a single state will not be both Jewish and democratic.",

The Conservatives have taken a different tack, buying adverts against searches for \u201ctactical voting\u201d, in order to encourage Brexit party supporters to switch allegiance and \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. Earlier on Tuesday, the teen-focused social network Snapchat admitted to a flaw in its own transparency report that had led to incorrect reports that the Conservative party spent money defending Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge seat. In fact, once Snapchat released a corrected version of the transparency report, it became clear that the Tories had spent money everywhere except Uxbridge, apparently to avoid running foul of constituency spending limits. Sam Jeffers, the founder of Who Targets Me, was one of the researchers misled by the incorrect data. \u201cUntil the standards for political ad transparency are mandated in law, with suitable penalties for non-compliance, mistakes will continue to happen,\u201d Jeffers said. \u201cWe all have a right to know how we are being targeted online.\u201d",

Bolton council\u2019s building control website includes a 2018 application to replace the insulation on the building.

      "bodyText": "The Great Britain players are feeling the Madrid chill this week but their resolve to win the Davis Cup again is underpinned by their long-established bonhomie, and their mischief-making hit a new peak on Tuesday. Giggling in most of the right places, they answered questions before their opening match against the Netherlands on Wednesday with a selection of barely disguised quotes from the Disney cartoon, Frozen, which riffs on Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s The Snow Queen, an appropriate choice given the falling temperatures. Andy \u201cLet it go\u201d Murray declared he would find it difficult to get on court five days in a row, according to the new format of the 18-team finals, but would play doubles with his brother, Jamie, if asked, depending on the circumstances. \u201cPlaying five days in a row is going to be tough just now,\u201d he said. \u201cI did it in Antwerp [where he won his first tournament in two and a half years after hip surgery in January] and I got through that tournament quite well at the end. But it was tough. I\u2019ve also since then had a bit of a break as well, where I didn\u2019t train and practise as much.\u201d As one of the game\u2019s senior voices Murray felt compelled to caution the naysayers pouring scorn on the revamped event, which began in front of a sparse gathering at the opening ceremony but has generated some partisan excitement since. \u201cPeople have been quite sceptical, which is fine, because it is a big change and I had my reservations about it [too],\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s fair to give the new event a chance to play itself out and see how it is at the end of the week. I don\u2019t know what all the other players have been saying but I think it\u2019s been very well run so far. It\u2019s been very easy for all of the players. The one concern I had, and have, is the atmosphere in the matches in comparison to what we were used to in Davis Cup ties.\u201d Kyle Edmund was the last player added to the British squad and he knows it is between him and Dan \u201cCan\u2019t hold it back any more\u201d Evans for the No 1 spot given Murray\u2019s reduced ranking in his comeback year. \u201cWe don\u2019t get a day off but hopefully we can get into a nice rhythm and play each day,\u201d Edmund said. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re expecting.

Jamie somehow did not manage to insert his allotted offering \u2013 \u201cThe cold never bothers me anyway\u201d \u2013 but he pointed out how the new format could be crucial in doubles. \u201cIn the group stages every rubber counts,\u201d he said, \u201cbut obviously in the knockouts, if it\u2019s 2-0 after singles, then the doubles doesn\u2019t get played.

The party claims it was flooded with requests during the European elections in May by opponents.</p> \n<p>The investigation came as Farage addressed a general election event in Peterborough on Tuesday. In comments made afterwards, he attacked <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/labour-manifesto-review-legacy-british-colonialism-imperialism_uk_5dd2bd21e4b02947481b822b\">Labour\u2019s policy on reviewing the legacy of Britain\u2019s colonial past</a> and said Prince Andrew should comply with any request made by the FBI to support the victims of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p> \n<p>During his speech to about 100 supporters, news broke that Louis Stedman-Bryce, an MEP from Scotland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd3dcd68f080fd59fb131be#block-5dd3dcd68f080fd59fb131be\">had quit the Brexit party</a> in protest at the selection of a Scottish candidate who had allegedly expressed homophobic remarks.</p> \n<p>The subject access requests were sent to the Brexit party earlier this year and typically take a month to respond to.

A source added: \u201cIt was a deliberate attempt to make it impossible to campaign.\u201d</p> \n<p>An ICO spokesperson said: \u201cOur regulatory work continues as usual but we will not be commenting publicly on every issue raised during the general election.

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party is being investigated for allegedly failing to answer requests for data it holds on some voters, according to Sky News. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) is looking into complaints that the party did not hand over information through the subject access request system. The party claims it was flooded with requests during the European elections in May by opponents. The investigation came as Farage addressed a general election event in Peterborough on Tuesday. In comments made afterwards, he attacked Labour\u2019s policy on reviewing the legacy of Britain\u2019s colonial past and said Prince Andrew should comply with any request made by the FBI to support the victims of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. During his speech to about 100 supporters, news broke that Louis Stedman-Bryce, an MEP from Scotland, had quit the Brexit party in protest at the selection of a Scottish candidate who had allegedly expressed homophobic remarks. The subject access requests were sent to the Brexit party earlier this year and typically take a month to respond to. Anyone can ask an organisation that holds data what personal details they might have relating to them. On Wednesday the party denied it was being investigated by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and said they would meet the deadline agreed with the watchdog to reply to the outstanding requests for data. It said there were only a small number of subject access requests outstanding - around 0.2% of the total number they received. A source added: \u201cIt was a deliberate attempt to make it impossible to campaign.\u201d An ICO spokesperson said: \u201cOur regulatory work continues as usual but we will not be commenting publicly on every issue raised during the general election. We will, however, be closely monitoring how personal data is being used during political campaigning and making sure that all parties and campaigns are aware of their responsibilities under data protection and direct marketing laws.\u201d Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge to review Britain\u2019s colonial past and its legacy was rounded on by Farage, who said it was not right to \u201cobsess about the past\u201d and claimed the British empire had relied on \u201cbribery\u201d and not military intervention like other European empires. The party has set its sights on taking seats in Labour heartland areas and part of Farage\u2019s speech was dedicated to pillorying Labour for its stance on Brexit and other policy announcements. Farage told journalists: \u201cI think if we obsess about the past, different times and different cultures, it can be very difficult to move forwards. So I think some of this stuff is just not helpful. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should apologise for what people did 300 years ago. It was a different world, a different time. You could apply that argument to any civilisation, any country and we seem to be terribly keen to apologise for the past and a bit less worried about creating a good future.\u201d Asked if schools should be taught more about Britain\u2019s colonial past, he said: \u201cIf you want to get into British empires, you can compare the British empire with the Belgian empire, the German empire, you compare it with the Spanish empire, compare it to the Portuguese empire and you\u2019d find, by comparison with the others, we were not even a military empire, we did it on bribery, that\u2019s how the Brits did it.\u201d Claire Fox, the party\u2019s MEP for North West England, said Corbyn\u2019s focus on colonial history was an attempt to come up with \u201cwoke policies\u201d and make people feel guilty about being British. On Prince Andrew\u2019s friendship with Epstein, Farage said the royal should give information to the FBI if he were requested to do so. \u201cIf the FBI ask him to I\u2019m sure he will,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all met people in our lives that later on we found out are different from what we thought they were when we first met them.\u201d He said he did not understand why the prince had done the BBC interview about his connection to Epstein, who killed himself earlier this year.

Asda also recently announced a pay increase, with its hourly rates to go up to \u00a39.18 and \u00a310.31 respectively in April but there was a row there too over the new contract, which also involved changes to working conditions which left some workers worse off. Katherine Chapman, the director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great to hear that Lidl will be going beyond the government minimum and paying the new real living wage rate to employees. However, as Lidl is not accredited with the Living Wage Foundation, we can\u2019t be sure that its subcontracted staff, such as cleaners, trolley collectors and warehouse workers, are paid this rate.\u201d",

That was how he had fun.\u201d The best bowler on that team in 2002, who took 14 wickets at an average of six runs, was a 13-year-old who lived just a few streets away from the Williamsons in Tauranga: Trent Boult.</p> <p>There will be much more talk of Williamson\u2019s childhood this week, with the opening Test against England which starts on Wednesday, the first played at Mount Maunganui\u2019s Bay Oval, a few minutes\u2019 drive from his house, his first school and the beaches where he indulges his love of surfing. \u201cThere is a real sense of achievement that a Test is being played here,\u201d he said this week. \u201cA match against England is a very special occasion for all the people involved here.\u201d Inevitably it is a ground he knows well: he was 16 when it opened in 2007, and that March he became the first person to score a century there, for Bay of Plenty Under-19s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edd8facc16e6ad8ac32fd1115b0f97307d2242f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edd8facc16e6ad8ac32fd1115b0f97307d2242f2/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fresh-faced Williamson in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fresh-faced Williamson in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross Setford/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recognition came quickly for him \u2013 he played for New Zealand\u2019s Under-19s at 15, made his first-class debut at 17, his international debut two days after his 20th birthday \u2013 but his path to sporting excellence has been long and methodical. He is now, aged 29, the only batsman ever to have represented New Zealand with a Test average above 50 \u2013 52.22 to be precise \u2013 and he continues to improve. Since the start of 2017 Williamson has averaged 63.12 and, counting only innings over 25, it shoots up to 104.35. At that last metric his career average is 94.10, the seventh best ever in Test cricket. He has become a batsman without obvious flaws, and a person who, like his batting, is unshowy but widely admired.</p> <p>England\u2019s task over these two Tests will be to examine a player who appears to have maintained that childhood habit of being exceptional at anything he does and to identify a fault.</p>",

A couple of weeks later he used it in the Northern Districts Under-14 championship, where he scored three successive tons followed by an unbeaten 91, and the die was cast, which is how Thorpe inadvertently helped to turn Williamson into a cricketer. Back in New Zealand this winter as England\u2019s batting coach, Thorpe should probably keep his kit to himself. \u201cIt was an old bat even when I got it,\u201d Williamson said, many years later. \u201cHe would have used it five years before perhaps, or maybe he didn\u2019t, but it was from him apparently. It was a good stick.\u201d To be fair, Williamson had also shone as a 12-year-old in the previous year\u2019s competition, scoring 285 runs and being dismissed only once. \u201cI reckon he went two or three years without being dismissed,\u201d said Doug Bracewell, the Kiwi Test bowler who was in Williamson\u2019s class at primary school, of that competition. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t like other kids. They played for fun but Kane played for a different reason \u2013 he played to succeed. That was how he had fun.\u201d The best bowler on that team in 2002, who took 14 wickets at an average of six runs, was a 13-year-old who lived just a few streets away from the Williamsons in Tauranga: Trent Boult. There will be much more talk of Williamson\u2019s childhood this week, with the opening Test against England which starts on Wednesday, the first played at Mount Maunganui\u2019s Bay Oval, a few minutes\u2019 drive from his house, his first school and the beaches where he indulges his love of surfing. \u201cThere is a real sense of achievement that a Test is being played here,\u201d he said this week. \u201cA match against England is a very special occasion for all the people involved here.\u201d Inevitably it is a ground he knows well: he was 16 when it opened in 2007, and that March he became the first person to score a century there, for Bay of Plenty Under-19s. Recognition came quickly for him \u2013 he played for New Zealand\u2019s Under-19s at 15, made his first-class debut at 17, his international debut two days after his 20th birthday \u2013 but his path to sporting excellence has been long and methodical. He is now, aged 29, the only batsman ever to have represented New Zealand with a Test average above 50 \u2013 52.22 to be precise \u2013 and he continues to improve. Since the start of 2017 Williamson has averaged 63.12 and, counting only innings over 25, it shoots up to 104.35. At that last metric his career average is 94.10, the seventh best ever in Test cricket. He has become a batsman without obvious flaws, and a person who, like his batting, is unshowy but widely admired. England\u2019s task over these two Tests will be to examine a player who appears to have maintained that childhood habit of being exceptional at anything he does and to identify a fault.",

And the past is \u2013 hopefully \u2013 another country.</p> <p>As a woman of 75, I have witnessed much passing of time. The achievements of the postwar Labour government were remarkable. More recently, Labour has been tainted by aspects of Blairism, in particular by Blair\u2019s kowtowing to Bush over Iraq. (Incidentally, it was the then Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy, who had the guts to stand up and disagree with him.) Some of us welcomed Jeremy Corbyn, only to find ourselves disillusioned.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t believe any single party \u2013 or person \u2013 can have all the right answers. In this micro-macro world, we all make mistakes \u2013 large or small. We hope the elected political parties will make the right choices on our behalf, but sadly this often isn\u2019t the case. The huge mistake was the referendum that led to this current fiasco over Brexit.</p> <p>Yes, the Lib Dems showed a lack of stamina in coalition \u2013 but shouldn\u2019t they now be given the opportunity to move on?<br><strong>Jan Woodhouse</strong><br><em>North Walsham, Norfolk </em></p> <p>\u2022 It has taken me rather longer than Rhiannon Lucy Coslett to change my attitude to the Liberal Democrats. As a left-of-centre voter I have lived for 50 years in a safe Conservative seat. In every election from 1970 to 2010 I voted first Liberal and subsequently Lib Dem. After their hasty decision to enter the coalition I can no longer do so.</p> <p>They accepted George Osborne blaming Labour for the financial crash of 2008 and enthusiastically supported his austerity programme. This from the party of Beveridge and Keynes. They sold their consciences in exchange for a referendum on an inferior version of electoral reform. The austerity they embraced so enthusiastically led many voters in the north and the Midlands to vote leave in the 2016 referendum and yet they have the gall to pose as the main supporters of remain.</p> <p>If Jo Swinson wants my vote the least I expect from her is an apology for her party\u2019s actions in coalition from 2010 to 2015.<br><strong>Ian O\u2019Neill</strong><br><em>South Croydon, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is understandable that Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett wants to eject the Tories for reasons such as housing, the climate emergency and tuition fees. It is also encouraging that youthful activists and university lecturers are encouraging students and other young people to sign up to vote. But it is now time that the baby boomers publicly entered this fray, and not just for fears for their children and grandchildren\u2019s futures, but for their own.</p> <p>My school friends and I soared up the Attlee escalator with improved schools and healthcare, a growing economy and youth culture. Those who wanted to were actually paid to go to college. We mostly got secure jobs and if we worked hard could afford to buy a home, bring up a family. and many of us now have good pensions.</p> <p>Five more years of a Johnson government will be bad for the young, but far grimmer for the number of years we baby boomers have left, as we become more dependent on the NHS and care facilities. These already inadequately financed institutions are now under further threat from the US drug and private health companies licking their lips at the thought of a vulnerable NHS and a grovelling Johnson government forced into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/01/nhs-drugs-bill-could-soar-if-johnson-signs-trump-trade-deal-report\" title=\"\">trade deals on Trump\u2019s terms</a>. So whether we loathe or admire Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon or Jo Swinson, we baby boomers must vote tactically to protect all our futures.<br><strong>Colin Hines</strong><br><em>East Twickenham, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Millennial Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett says the Lib Dems ruined her 20s. As a Generation Xer I can sympathise. Thatcherite Tories \u201cruined\u201d my 20s, as I graduated in the late 1980s when over 3 million of us were on the dole. The Tories also took their best shot at ruining my generation\u2019s 40s and 50s with almost a decade of cuts to the vital public services that we, our children or parents depend on, followed by the endless disaster of Brexit that will ruin lives for decades to come.</p> <p>So if you want to avoid re-electing the worst Tory government in British history, I urge you to look hard at which candidate has the best chance of keeping the Tory out in your constituency, then forget political or generational tribalism, grit your teeth and vote for them. Don\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good (or even half-tolerable).<br><strong>Chris Webster </strong><br><em>G\u00fcmligen, Switzerland</em></p> <p>\u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett offers unbalanced advice on how we should vote to avoid Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit. She naturally thinks people should vote for Labour candidates where only they can beat the Conservatives. But she neglects to mention that if the Lib Dems fail to defeat the Conservatives in enough constituencies where they are the main challenger, a majority Conservative government and a hard Brexit will be the inevitable consequence. Whatever she may feel about them, she should recognise that a strong enough breakthrough by the Lib Dems in such places could actually enable a Labour government.</p> <p>We must vote tactically to defeat the Conservatives. Moreover, for this to be maximally effective, it should be based on more recent polling figures, including from this year\u2019s EU parliament election, rather than on the 2017 election which Cosslett seems to prefer.<br><strong>Richard Hassall</strong><br><em>Knaresborough, North Yorkshire </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

More recently, Labour has been tainted by aspects of Blairism, in particular by Blair\u2019s kowtowing to Bush over Iraq. (Incidentally, it was the then Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy, who had the guts to stand up and disagree with him.) Some of us welcomed Jeremy Corbyn, only to find ourselves disillusioned. But I don\u2019t believe any single party \u2013 or person \u2013 can have all the right answers. In this micro-macro world, we all make mistakes \u2013 large or small. We hope the elected political parties will make the right choices on our behalf, but sadly this often isn\u2019t the case. The huge mistake was the referendum that led to this current fiasco over Brexit. Yes, the Lib Dems showed a lack of stamina in coalition \u2013 but shouldn\u2019t they now be given the opportunity to move on? Jan Woodhouse North Walsham, Norfolk \u2022 It has taken me rather longer than Rhiannon Lucy Coslett to change my attitude to the Liberal Democrats. As a left-of-centre voter I have lived for 50 years in a safe Conservative seat. In every election from 1970 to 2010 I voted first Liberal and subsequently Lib Dem. After their hasty decision to enter the coalition I can no longer do so. They accepted George Osborne blaming Labour for the financial crash of 2008 and enthusiastically supported his austerity programme. This from the party of Beveridge and Keynes. They sold their consciences in exchange for a referendum on an inferior version of electoral reform. The austerity they embraced so enthusiastically led many voters in the north and the Midlands to vote leave in the 2016 referendum and yet they have the gall to pose as the main supporters of remain. If Jo Swinson wants my vote the least I expect from her is an apology for her party\u2019s actions in coalition from 2010 to 2015. Ian O\u2019Neill South Croydon, London \u2022 It is understandable that Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett wants to eject the Tories for reasons such as housing, the climate emergency and tuition fees. It is also encouraging that youthful activists and university lecturers are encouraging students and other young people to sign up to vote. But it is now time that the baby boomers publicly entered this fray, and not just for fears for their children and grandchildren\u2019s futures, but for their own. My school friends and I soared up the Attlee escalator with improved schools and healthcare, a growing economy and youth culture. Those who wanted to were actually paid to go to college. We mostly got secure jobs and if we worked hard could afford to buy a home, bring up a family. and many of us now have good pensions. Five more years of a Johnson government will be bad for the young, but far grimmer for the number of years we baby boomers have left, as we become more dependent on the NHS and care facilities. These already inadequately financed institutions are now under further threat from the US drug and private health companies licking their lips at the thought of a vulnerable NHS and a grovelling Johnson government forced into trade deals on Trump\u2019s terms. So whether we loathe or admire Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon or Jo Swinson, we baby boomers must vote tactically to protect all our futures. Colin Hines East Twickenham, London \u2022 Millennial Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett says the Lib Dems ruined her 20s. As a Generation Xer I can sympathise. Thatcherite Tories \u201cruined\u201d my 20s, as I graduated in the late 1980s when over 3 million of us were on the dole. The Tories also took their best shot at ruining my generation\u2019s 40s and 50s with almost a decade of cuts to the vital public services that we, our children or parents depend on, followed by the endless disaster of Brexit that will ruin lives for decades to come. So if you want to avoid re-electing the worst Tory government in British history, I urge you to look hard at which candidate has the best chance of keeping the Tory out in your constituency, then forget political or generational tribalism, grit your teeth and vote for them. Don\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good (or even half-tolerable). Chris Webster G\u00fcmligen, Switzerland \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett offers unbalanced advice on how we should vote to avoid Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit. She naturally thinks people should vote for Labour candidates where only they can beat the Conservatives. But she neglects to mention that if the Lib Dems fail to defeat the Conservatives in enough constituencies where they are the main challenger, a majority Conservative government and a hard Brexit will be the inevitable consequence. Whatever she may feel about them, she should recognise that a strong enough breakthrough by the Lib Dems in such places could actually enable a Labour government. We must vote tactically to defeat the Conservatives. Moreover, for this to be maximally effective, it should be based on more recent polling figures, including from this year\u2019s EU parliament election, rather than on the 2017 election which Cosslett seems to prefer.

My own experiences 30 years ago also showed an elitist institution seeped in privilege. I was assaulted in the union\u2019s bar when a rather posh chap demanded that I and my friends give him the table we were at. When I refused I was thrown to the ground at which stage I reacted in self-defence.</p> <p>The contretemps was quickly broken up, which was fortunate for me as my assailant was far bigger than I realised while lying on the floor. At this stage, like Mr Azamati, I was told I had a life ban from the union. Asking about the other person involved I was amazed to be told that no punishment applied \u2013 after all, he was a lord. Rather than tugging my forelock, which was clearly the response expected, I suggested the union official went into the bar to talk to witnesses, or I would take legal action. Ten minutes later I was told it was just a misunderstanding, best forgotten. It seems nothing much has changed. <br><strong>John Young</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 Reading of the incident involving the Ghanaian postgraduate student Ebenezer Azamati, my reaction is of shame and outrage.

      "bodyText": "I was horrified to read of Ebenezer Azamati\u2019s treatment at the Oxford Union, but sadly not surprised (Blind student dragged from Oxford Union \u2018by his ankles\u2019, 18 November). My own experiences 30 years ago also showed an elitist institution seeped in privilege. I was assaulted in the union\u2019s bar when a rather posh chap demanded that I and my friends give him the table we were at. When I refused I was thrown to the ground at which stage I reacted in self-defence. The contretemps was quickly broken up, which was fortunate for me as my assailant was far bigger than I realised while lying on the floor. At this stage, like Mr Azamati, I was told I had a life ban from the union. Asking about the other person involved I was amazed to be told that no punishment applied \u2013 after all, he was a lord. Rather than tugging my forelock, which was clearly the response expected, I suggested the union official went into the bar to talk to witnesses, or I would take legal action. Ten minutes later I was told it was just a misunderstanding, best forgotten. It seems nothing much has changed. John Young Edinburgh \u2022 Reading of the incident involving the Ghanaian postgraduate student Ebenezer Azamati, my reaction is of shame and outrage. As a former secretary of the Oxford University Africa Society (1966-67), I recognised at the time that my welcome into that organisation, despite my being white and English, was a real honour. On reflection, I can say that social and intellectual engagement has had greater lasting value in my life than almost anything else I learned at Oxford.

Born Henriette Markovitch in 1907, she changed her name in 1932, soon after shifting from painting to photography, and opened a studio in Paris with art director Pierre K\u00e9fer. It was the beginning of a creative journey that would bring her into contact with some of the leading artistic figures of the time, from Brassa\u00ef, with whom she shared a darkroom, to Man Ray and the surrealists, whose work would have such an impact on her own development, moving her from portraiture to experiments in collage and photomontage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cc61b13b1ebfaf5a4f20eeae6aa2d19943a69a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cc61b13b1ebfaf5a4f20eeae6aa2d19943a69a9/0_113_5553_3332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Restlessly creative \u2026 Dora Maar exhibition at Tate Modern, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Restlessly creative \u2026 Dora Maar exhibition at Tate Modern, London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1935, she crossed paths with Picasso, with whom she would go on to have a turbulent relationship that she never quite recovered from.

Even in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/26/arts/dora-maar-a-muse-of-picasso-is-dead-at-89.html\">obituaries that followed her death in 1997, she was still being referred to as \u201cPicasso\u2019s muse.</a>\u201d</p> <p>This fascinating show, spanning nine rooms, is a meticulously mapped-out reappraisal of Maar\u2019s long and restlessly inventive creative journey. As if to establish her as a \u201cmodern woman\u201d of the time, a wall in the first room is given over to often striking portraits of her by the likes of Brassa\u00ef, Beaton, Lee Miller and Irving Penn as well as a handful of more artful self-portraits. These images suggests a gilded life \u2013 which the rest of the show in many ways undercuts.</p> <p>Among the early surprises are several erotic nudes, male and female, that were first published in the 30s in various <em>revues des charmes</em> (erotic magazines) with such titles as Seduction and Secrets du Paris. One of her subjects was Assia Granatouroff<em>,</em> a statuesque beauty who was also a model for Krull. Maar renders Assia\u2019s athletic form as a living sculpture, all curves and looming shadows. The most striking portrait is also the most sinister: an almost fetishistic portrait of Assia wearing a skin-coloured face mask and hanging by one arm from a gymnastic ring. It hints at the subconscious territory of Maar\u2019s later photomontages, made in the mid-30s, which evoke dark dreamworlds influenced by the writings of her acquaintances, the poet Paul Eluard, the transgressive writer George Bataille and the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc65960dcbe9fdc291f38e6a1db83d45b9dcbf2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc65960dcbe9fdc291f38e6a1db83d45b9dcbf2b/0_0_1276_1517/841.jpg\" alt=\"The Pretender, 1935, by Dora Maar.\" width=\"841\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pretender, 1935, by Dora Maar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maar\u2019s shifts in style were often dramatic. The surrealist pictures are preceded by several series of street photographs made in Paris, Barcelona and London. They are dark in every way, their subject matter the urban poor, their style starkly monochrome. On a London street, an old woman sells lottery tickets beneath the steel pillars of a bank on Oxford Street. Another younger woman cradles an infant in a shawl, who faces a landscape of uncertainty. Behind her is a sign for an astrology booth. Another series moves from the photojournalistic to a kind of low-key observation of the ordinary: an image of a recently rain-drenched street beneath a wall dappled with shadows is bisected by the pavement edge that runs from bottom left to top right. A similar geometry of lines and shapes defines a street portrait made in Barcelona, in which a hunched figure in the left foreground stands facing away from her camera. These are ordinary, but oddly haunting, street photographs that seem as mysterious in their own quiet way as the surrealist experimentation.</p> <p>Her experiments with large-format negatives, all eerily blue silhouettes, seem utterly contemporary, while her photos of street protests in Paris in February 1934 echo recent upheavals in the city. She also photographed many of the leading figures of the surrealist movement, including Eluard and the painter Leonor Fini, but the most startlingly surrealist image here is <a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/dora-maar/pere-ubu-1936\">Ubu (1936)</a>, a closeup of what was later identified as an armadillo foetus, its title taken from Alfred Jarry\u2019s absurdist play, Ubu Roi.

Picasso is said to have kept the blood-splattered gloves. Their temperaments were ill-suited and, after a time, her independent streak seems to have provoked rages in him.

He became more politically engaged though her radicalism. His portraits move from relatively calm depictions of her to almost vengeful distortions of her features.In 1945, when he replaced her with Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, Maar fell into a deep depression, for which she underwent electroshock treatment and was, for a time, a patient of Lacan.</p> <p>Her later paintings, hanging in one of the final rooms at Tate Modern, suggest a deep calmness, whether <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/giorgio-morandi-1660\">Morandi-like</a> still lifes or small, deftly-rendered landscapes.

At that point Vox was a minor irritant on the Spanish right and the Catalan separatists were on the back foot. However, the local elections in Andaluc\u00eda, with a surge from Vox, were a straw in the wind. Pedro S\u00e1nchez is to blame for throwing away his electoral advantage, both for his own party and the Spanish left in general. But Iglesias, in his refusal to compromise, is also to blame, not that readers would guess that from this article.

      "bodyText": "From the butchers to the hairdressers and from the playground to the pub, a tiny pit village has been gripped by a baffling mystery. Detectives in County Durham have revealed that at least 13 meticulously prepared bundles of cash, totalling \u00a326,000, had been left at random places in Blackhall Colliery since 2014. The latest \u2013 a wad of 100 \u00a320 notes \u2013 was discovered on Monday morning and was the fourth handed in to police this year. The mystery has stumped detectives, who have carried out numerous interviews, interrogated the local bank and post office staff and even tested the cash for fingerprints, but the circumstances surrounding the money remain a riddle. Speaking outside the village pub on Tuesday, hoping to crack the case on his day off work, DC John Forster said: \u201cI am hoping this is some sort of purposeful benefactor who is showing some kindness towards the village. I would rather that than someone who is vulnerable in some way or that it was connected to criminality.\u201d Forster praised the honesty of the 13 people who had found the \u00a32,000 bags and handed them in, adding that they had been found in a \u201cvery tight\u201d geographical area in the centre of the village. \u201cOne lady who handed it in was shaking \u2013 I don\u2019t think she had ever been in a police station before,\u201d he said, adding that police had asked those who handed the money in to keep quiet in the hope that detectives would solve the case. One theory is that the money could be the ill-gotten gains of a local drug dealer, although Forster said that did not tally with his knowledge of criminals being ultra-watchful with money. In Grace Hair and Beauty, along the high street where most of the cash has been found, the mystery behind the cash was all customers were talking about on Tuesday. \u201cIt could be one of these secret millionaires who wants to do good for the people,\u201d said Doris Huntington, 88, as she got her nails done. \u201cYou think he would leave it where a certain kind of people could find it rather than random.

      "body": "<p>My brother Lee Cheong, who has died aged 74, was an interior designer who created inspiring public spaces that touched the lives of thousands of schoolchildren and hospital patients. He was one of a generation of postwar designers who helped transform the dull institutional atmosphere of Britain\u2019s state sector.</p> <p>A lifelong supporter of the NHS, Lee worked on more than 40 projects across Britain, developing designs that were optimistic, efficient and, above all, appropriate to the needs of patients and hospital staff. His innovative use of light and colour \u2013 he was the first to introduce pink hospital beds \u2013 was a feature of his stylish simplicity and vision. </p> <p>Lee was born in Limehouse, east London, to Ah Tay Cheong, a merchant seaman, and Bessie (nee Simmonds), an office cleaner and housewife. He was the second oldest son in a family of 12 children. When he left St Paul\u2019s Way school at 15 he was something of a tearaway, with no qualifications and no plans for the future.</p> <p>But his fortunes took a remarkable turn when a chance meeting on the street with a friend on the way to an evening art class led to an unexpected invitation. Would Lee join him? Despite some misgivings, he went along.</p> <p>It proved to be a life-changing moment. Inspired by the creative atmosphere and the open-hearted welcome and encouragement he received at the class, Lee discovered new enthusiasm and hidden talent. A three-year course in interior design at Hornsey School of Art followed and then a further year at the London College of Furniture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"136fc25ababe56314e2cafecc14a655fc054506f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/136fc25ababe56314e2cafecc14a655fc054506f/0_63_772_463/500.jpg\" alt=\"Nottingham Breast Unit reception, which Lee Cheong worked on.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nottingham breast unit reception, which Lee Cheong worked on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He could have made a career in furniture design. Some of his early works were chosen for the Ideal Home Exhibition in London in the early 1970s and, almost 50 years later, a number of his designs are still in use (I sleep on the bed he made for me).</p> <p>His first full-time job in 1973 was with Coventry county council, as specialist furniture designer for schools, colleges, disabled people and care homes. Five years later, he joined Wessex regional healthcare authority in Winchester, where he dedicated himself, as principal interior designer, to rethinking the design of public healthcare buildings.</p> <p>In 1990, in the wake of privatisation, he and some former Wessex colleagues set up their own specialised unit to continue this work.</p> <p>He spent the later years of his career as interior design director of the Building Design Partnership, where his work was heavily influenced by guidelines for sustainable development drawn up by the Natural Step, the international network of non-profit groups that focuses on principles of progress with low ecological and social impact.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, Lee reflected that it was \u201cpeople who mattered\u201d. Not only was this key to turning his life around, but it underpinned his design philosophy.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Maureen, and his two children, Gus and Milly.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My brother Lee Cheong, who has died aged 74, was an interior designer who created inspiring public spaces that touched the lives of thousands of schoolchildren and hospital patients. He was one of a generation of postwar designers who helped transform the dull institutional atmosphere of Britain\u2019s state sector. A lifelong supporter of the NHS, Lee worked on more than 40 projects across Britain, developing designs that were optimistic, efficient and, above all, appropriate to the needs of patients and hospital staff. His innovative use of light and colour \u2013 he was the first to introduce pink hospital beds \u2013 was a feature of his stylish simplicity and vision. Lee was born in Limehouse, east London, to Ah Tay Cheong, a merchant seaman, and Bessie (nee Simmonds), an office cleaner and housewife. He was the second oldest son in a family of 12 children. When he left St Paul\u2019s Way school at 15 he was something of a tearaway, with no qualifications and no plans for the future. But his fortunes took a remarkable turn when a chance meeting on the street with a friend on the way to an evening art class led to an unexpected invitation. Would Lee join him? Despite some misgivings, he went along. It proved to be a life-changing moment. Inspired by the creative atmosphere and the open-hearted welcome and encouragement he received at the class, Lee discovered new enthusiasm and hidden talent. A three-year course in interior design at Hornsey School of Art followed and then a further year at the London College of Furniture. He could have made a career in furniture design. Some of his early works were chosen for the Ideal Home Exhibition in London in the early 1970s and, almost 50 years later, a number of his designs are still in use (I sleep on the bed he made for me). His first full-time job in 1973 was with Coventry county council, as specialist furniture designer for schools, colleges, disabled people and care homes. Five years later, he joined Wessex regional healthcare authority in Winchester, where he dedicated himself, as principal interior designer, to rethinking the design of public healthcare buildings. In 1990, in the wake of privatisation, he and some former Wessex colleagues set up their own specialised unit to continue this work. He spent the later years of his career as interior design director of the Building Design Partnership, where his work was heavily influenced by guidelines for sustainable development drawn up by the Natural Step, the international network of non-profit groups that focuses on principles of progress with low ecological and social impact. Looking back on his life, Lee reflected that it was \u201cpeople who mattered\u201d. Not only was this key to turning his life around, but it underpinned his design philosophy. He is survived by his wife, Maureen, and his two children, Gus and Milly.",

Kate Ramsden, a potential candidate for Gordon, Aberdeenshire, was discovered by the Jewish Chronicle to have written a piece comparing Israel to an abused child that grows up to become an abusive adult, and swiftly stepped down afterwards citing \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/labour-candidate-kate-ramsden-steps-down-israel-comparison\" title=\"\">personal reasons</a>\u201d.

They also have an advantage in the not-having-to-deselect-people-for-their-Facebook-opinions war, because the closest many of their candidates get to having an online presence is posting a blurry photo of their wedding ring on a pathologically unmatched \u201chorny ..... discreet\u201d Tinder profile.

The current president of the United States is essentially just an artist of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/08/confusion-after-bbc-podcasts-attempt-to-define-shitposting-laura-kuenssberg\" title=\"\">shitposting</a>, with Twitter his exquisite brush. There was a time when I could not have imagined that social media would become such a factor in elections. But we all have at least 10 years\u2019 worth of thoughts expressed online, and all it takes is one person with enough time on their hands to scroll through them, and you\u2019re done for. In 2019, as they contest a fraught and tense, once-in-a-generation election, it seems most would-be MPs\u2019 toughest opposition is their own bad opinions, expressed badly online.</p> <h2><strong>Other things to hate or enjoy \u2013 delete as appropriate</strong></h2> <p>Much like Unai Emery\u2019s Arsenal, the Lib Dems look alarmingly unsure of their identity under their new leader, and this week hasn\u2019t much helped. On some days, Jo Swinson exudes the vibrating energy of someone who related too strongly to Hermione when they read Harry Potter and has carried it damagingly into their adult life; on others, I\u2019m not sure she isn\u2019t a cold-blooded Tory plant tasked with whipping up a voting bloc of baffled centrists to offer themselves as a blood sacrifice during a hung parliament, and usher in another era of coalition.</p> <p>Now, here\u2019s a development that doesn\u2019t really unmuddy the puddle: the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruskin147/status/1196345027699576838\" title=\"\">BBC Election Ads project</a> found that Lib Dems were using Facebook advertising to target, uh, Margaret Thatcher fans in Bedford. It\u2019s not on the level of Cambridge Analytica \u2013 nobody is going to make an overblown movie about this in which a Zuckerbergesque Swinson is guilty only of thinking too much \u2013 but it is interesting nonetheless.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes I question the wisdom of the Bible and wonder how a holy text written by unseen hands thousands of years ago can still be relevant to us, living today, in a modern world where we have wifi and uncompleted coffee stamp cards. And then I see yet another candidate MP fall afoul of the old \u201cdelete your archive social media posts before someone finds them\u201d rule, and realise that sometimes the ancient doctrines can still ring true. This is why they have to print warnings on haemorrhoid creams telling people not to eat them, isn\u2019t it? Because no matter how many times you tell someone not to do something spectacularly dumb, they could still turn around and try to run for parliament despite having a history of easy-to-find racist Facebook posts. As the BBC reported this week: \u201cThe deadline for wannabe MPs to throw their hats into the ring passed on Thursday afternoon \u2013 but some didn\u2019t even make it that far.\u201d Of the various candidates around the country \u2013 and I\u2019m still astounded that this process seems less complicated than signing up for a SIM card \u2013 23 were forced to pull out of the race by their various parties, with the BBC finding a third of them had done so because of social media posts. From Labour, three candidates were nixed because of comments and actions made online \u2013 two for their tweets, one for a blogpost. Kate Ramsden, a potential candidate for Gordon, Aberdeenshire, was discovered by the Jewish Chronicle to have written a piece comparing Israel to an abused child that grows up to become an abusive adult, and swiftly stepped down afterwards citing \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d. I suppose \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d could be a coy way of saying: \u201cA weary team of Labourvolunteers read my old blogs and realised that, yes, it\u2019s probably bestnot to put me near a microphone.\u201d But on we go. Now, if you want a party that knows how to keep its squalid actions behind closed doors, to shush up its love children and to express its problematic opinions only in private members\u2019 clubs with strict phone bans, look no further than the Conservatives. They also have an advantage in the not-having-to-deselect-people-for-their-Facebook-opinions war, because the closest many of their candidates get to having an online presence is posting a blurry photo of their wedding ring on a pathologically unmatched \u201chorny ..... discreet\u201d Tinder profile. They only had to get rid of one candidate for online infractions. Antony Calvert, Wakefield, got one-twoed after old Facebook posts were unearthed in which he had criticised the appearance of his Labour rival, Mary Creagh, and made a Colonel Gaddafi joke that it really wouldn\u2019t be responsible of me to repeat here. Calvert said the posts were more than 10 years old, and not intended to cause offence, but he wouldn\u2019t be running anyway. The Lib Dems had a couple: Kevin McNamara (Thurrock), who got done for decade-old alleged racist and homophobic social media posts (stood down, \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d); and Galen Milne (Banff and Buchan), who said on social media that Tories should be hung, drawn and quartered, then \u201cburned at the stake\u201d (Was Milne deselected for being too goth?). Apologising, he said he deeply regretted the \u201coffensive statements\u201d. It will probably not surprise you that the Brexit party struggled to find candidates with completely clean social media records, with the Venn diagram between \u201cpeople who support the Brexit party\u201d and \u201cdads who post up to 40 times a day on Facebook\u201d essentially being a clean circle: Phillip Walling was removed for tweeting support of Boris\u2019s deal against party line; Prabhjit Dhillon gave up candidacy after social media posts were found that started \u201cModerate Muslims \u2026\u201d and only got worse from there; Jill Hughes stood down from Batley and Spen after it emerged she believed world governments and aliens were working hand in hand in a sort of hush-hush arrangement. Again: how are these utterings all not being systematically deleted before even thinking about a candidacy? How do people who aren\u2019t quite smart enough to lock down their Facebook privacy settings think they are at all equipped to serve as an MP? I\u2019ve long been fascinated by how this will turn out in the distant future. If you think about it, one of our future prime ministers is currently a 13-year-old tentatively signing up to TikTok. There are future leaders of the opposition out there, right now, being wildly inappropriate on Snapchat. The current president of the United States is essentially just an artist of shitposting, with Twitter his exquisite brush. There was a time when I could not have imagined that social media would become such a factor in elections. But we all have at least 10 years\u2019 worth of thoughts expressed online, and all it takes is one person with enough time on their hands to scroll through them, and you\u2019re done for. In 2019, as they contest a fraught and tense, once-in-a-generation election, it seems most would-be MPs\u2019 toughest opposition is their own bad opinions, expressed badly online. Other things to hate or enjoy \u2013 delete as appropriate Much like Unai Emery\u2019s Arsenal, the Lib Dems look alarmingly unsure of their identity under their new leader, and this week hasn\u2019t much helped. On some days, Jo Swinson exudes the vibrating energy of someone who related too strongly to Hermione when they read Harry Potter and has carried it damagingly into their adult life; on others, I\u2019m not sure she isn\u2019t a cold-blooded Tory plant tasked with whipping up a voting bloc of baffled centrists to offer themselves as a blood sacrifice during a hung parliament, and usher in another era of coalition. Now, here\u2019s a development that doesn\u2019t really unmuddy the puddle: the BBC Election Ads project found that Lib Dems were using Facebook advertising to target, uh, Margaret Thatcher fans in Bedford. It\u2019s not on the level of Cambridge Analytica \u2013 nobody is going to make an overblown movie about this in which a Zuckerbergesque Swinson is guilty only of thinking too much \u2013 but it is interesting nonetheless. What do you want, really? Hard-edged party values? Or a handful more likes on Facebook? It\u2019s simple: if the Conservatives are going to win this cursed election, they need a celebrity get. This week Labour enjoyed the endorsement of Stormzy (genuine, creditable, across-the-board cool), Susan Boyle (hovering somewhere between \u201csemi-ironic cool\u201d and \u201cactually, if she came out at Glastonbury, we\u2019d all go bananas\u201d) and Wiley (he tweeted \u201cBig up @jeremycorbyn\u201d on Friday and Corbyn responded with \u201cThank you Wiley\u201d which is, honestly, about all you can say). The Lib Dems have Eddie Marsan, remember. But where is the Conservative endorser with the pulling power to turn on some Christmas lights? So far, so quiet. You assume that, deep behind the scenes, various government aides are putting out feelers, seeing if \u201cone of Little Mix hates paying tax enough to want to say something about it\u201d, or whether Ant or Dec feel like doing a to-camera bit about privatising the NHS. \u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant",

Why do all the cats look like they\u2019ve been Brundleflied into little sacks of pubes?\u201d</p> <p>Those four months have done a lot of work. Universal Pictures has hurled <a href=\"https://twitter.com/catsmovie?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">a self-aware Twitter account</a> at the film, in the hope that we might eventually be convinced that this whole nightmare is all just some sort of ironic joke. Plus, you can get used to a lot in four months. Verrucas, missing teeth, full-scale military-assisted regime change, that sort of thing. Surely \u2013 surely! \u2013 we\u2019d all use those four months to normalise the hideous sexy-cats-wearing-the-fur-of-their-own-relatives aesthetic of Tom Hooper\u2019s Cats.</p> <p>Well, now it\u2019s time to find out. A second trailer for Cats has just appeared online. Let\u2019s track through to see if it\u2019s any less horrifying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52146e473c5c05930a2b28256a210533af1d4616\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52146e473c5c05930a2b28256a210533af1d4616/196_5_1172_703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Well, I mean the short answer is no, isn\u2019t it?

It looks like Taylor Swift took all her clothes off, daubed herself in Pritt Stick and then emptied the contents of your dad\u2019s hair clipper all over her body. But, hey, it\u2019s early days.

Three James Cordens could fit through this catflap at the same time. It is a desperately inefficient catflap. Is Cats supposed to be set in a universe where everyone hates doors?No. No it isn\u2019t. Because here\u2019s the really awful thing. In the Cats universe, CATS CAN MANUALLY OPERATE DOORS. Leaving aside the notion that these genuine affronts to God can simply waltz into your bedroom at night and stare at you when you sleep, why is there even a catflap in the first place, huh? If all the cats have fully operational human hands, and can open and close doors as they see fit, why are there catflaps? Why doesn\u2019t anything make sense?Hang on. How big are these stairs? If a cat can reach halfway up a normal human door, why are they also only the height of a normal human stair? Are these giant cats or tiny cats? And what sort of hideous proportions are the humans supposed to be in this film? From what I can work out based on the surroundings, they must be three feet tall with two-and-a-half-foot-long legs.

Policies on housing, transport, industry and the economy all flow from this central premise: that failing to see off the climate crisis would spell disaster, while tackling the challenge correctly can revitalise both the economy and the social fabric of the country. Environment The proposed Green New Deal would require close to \u00a31tn in government borrowing over the next decade, during which time the UK would be transformed to a net zero carbon economy. Renewable energy would be expanded to produce most of the country\u2019s power, with wind alone producing 70% of electricity by 2030. New support for solar, geothermal, tidal, hydro and other renewable sources would provide most of the rest, while subsidies to fossil fuels would be abolished.

Many of the gags are of the you-have-to-be-there variety so I won\u2019t ruin them by trying to explain them out of context. But you can get a flavour of Fowles\u2019s clever humour from the multi-layered jokes around the title. Early on, we learn that Sarah is not called the French lieutenant\u2019s woman by most people in Lyme Regis, but \u201cthe French lieutenant\u2019s \u2026 woman\u201d. As Sarah herself eventually tells her paramour Charles Smithson, this basically translates as \u201cThe French lieutenant\u2019s whore\u201d. But even that turns out to be misnomer when we understand that she never belonged to the French lieutenant, either biblically or psychologically. And in the final chapters, Sarah also rejects the idea of being considered anyone\u2019s woman, even Charles\u2019s.</p> <p>Talking of Charles, there\u2019s another sly joke in the title. It\u2019s Charles who drives the action, not the woman. Like Wilkie Collins\u2019s The Woman in White and Richard Blackmore\u2019s Lorna Doone, Fowles is riffing on those Victorian novels that name a woman in the title but hand the narrative over to a man, usually one (like Charles) who imagines himself \u201cin full armour, ready to slay the dragon\u201d and rescue the damsel of the title. We are always deliberately swept up in Charles\u2019s point of view \u2013 but also made to question it, to wonder where poor Sarah gets a look in and eventually, whether she wants to be rescued at all.</p> <p>For Charles, the story is an <em>amour fou</em>, an uncontrollable passion. He risks his social standing and his engagement for Sarah. They have one brief physical liaison and ever after he passes lonely days and nights, \u201cher spirit beside him, over him, before him\u201d.</p> <p>But we know nothing of how Sarah is feeling. Even on their climactic night together, Sarah does not get to climax. It\u2019s a very odd scene: Charles starts kissing Sarah, runs off to check on the bedroom next door, runs back to grab her, carries her into the bedroom and dumps her on the bed, runs back out to the next room to tear off his clothes, runs back \u201cbare legged\u201d, falls on top of her with \u201cfrantic brutality\u201d and begins to ejaculate \u201cat once\u201d. The whole episode lasts, as the author tells us \u201cprecisely 90 seconds\u201d. A few minutes later, Charles is out of the door. Nine months later, Sarah gives birth.</p> <p>Charles isn\u2019t exactly a great seducer, then, and that the experience wasn\u2019t satisfying for Sarah doesn\u2019t cross his mind at all. It\u2019s grimly amusing. But like many of the best jokes, it reveals a horrible truth: Charles\u2019s extreme solipsism. In all the time he spends obsessing over Sarah, he barely considers her feelings.</p> <p>The focus is so sharply on Charles\u2019s agonies that it comes as a surprise at the end when Sarah is given a chance to speak. Finally, we realise how much we have been missing. It feels audacious and revelatory \u2013 like so much of the book.</p> <p>But this chapter has nothing on the end. Here, Fowles brings \u201ca new character on to the scene\u201d \u2013 the author who has been telling the tale. If the novelist is also a character, we have to be sceptical about the ideas he has been feeding us about characters having autonomy, his awareness of his own technique, everything. When this author then gives us an alternate ending \u2013 the third in the book \u2013 it shows that, ultimately, we\u2019ve been reading a shaggy dog story. But what a tale!</p>",

But Ian Brossat, the deputy mayor in charge of housing, said he regretted the IOC\u2019s choice of partner \u201cat a time when many cities in Europe and the world are fighting back against Airbnb\u201d. On Twitter, he wrote: \u201c[It is] totally irresponsible given the disastrous consequences Airbnb has had on our towns and cities. We are dealing with a company that doesn\u2019t have the means to pay its taxes in France but can find the means to sign a deal with the IOC.\u201d",

A woman living in a caravan in Blackpool has no hot water and winter is approaching fast. Anderson is a plumber; the man he\u2019s talking to isn\u2019t, but he is a pal, and he\u2019s on the scene so Anderson will talk him through how to do the job.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/what-kind-plumber-woman-dying-16927839\" title=\"\">Anderson became something of a viral sensation</a> a few weeks ago when he fixed the boiler of a terminally ill 91-year-old woman, then sent her an invoice for \u00a30.00. The woman\u2019s daughter posted it on Facebook.</p> <p>But this was far from his first free job.<strong> </strong>Anderson has been at it since 2017, when he went to see an elderly man who had been quoted \u00a35,500 to install a new boiler that he didn\u2019t need. \u201cThe engineer had put a print magazine in the water tank to stop the water going through into the cylinder. Luckily, the man got a second opinion. That\u2019s when I decided to do something.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"828dc992f15f36210ffa1cdfa37f32bf66679725\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/828dc992f15f36210ffa1cdfa37f32bf66679725/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plumber James Anderson of Disabled and Elderly Plumbing and Heating Emergency Response at a customer\u2019s home in Nelson, Lancashire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viral effect \u2026 James Anderson of Disabled and Elderly Plumbing and Heating Emergency Response at a customer\u2019s home in Nelson, Lancashire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anderson went to see his accountant, who suggested starting a community interest company (CIC). He pays himself \u00a3100 a week, he says. Any profit from private work goes back into the CIC, and thus back into the community. Though there wasn\u2019t much profit for a while \u2013 he was several thousand pounds in debt. Having his story go viral has certainly helped. Some \u00a382,000 has come in from crowdfunding alone since the zero-invoice news broke. He has rehired part-time the two lads he had to lay off. Anderson can help more of the old and vulnerable of Burnley. And beyond, he hopes. He has plans to expand.</p> <p>He lets me in on the passenger side of his van, clears a space, sets off across town, still mostly on the phone. \u201cCall me James, Jimmy, whatever you like,\u201d he says. Originally from Liverpool, Anderson, now 52, has been a plumber for 20 years, and was a bin man before that. We pull up outside a bungalow, on double yellow lines. It\u2019s OK, he knows all the traffic wardens, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve done jobs for their mums and dads: they\u2019re a bit more lenient.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You deserve everything you get, and while I\u2019m alive you get it for free</p> <footer> <cite>James Anderson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Margaret, 72, lets us in. She lives here with her partner, Ray, 92, and a bouncy young dog called Eric. Anderson fitted a new boiler for them, donated by the manufacturer. He has come to check that it\u2019s running OK. Margaret finds it hard to see the timer display properly, with her cataracts. Anderson says he will replace it with one with bigger numbers.</p> <p>The boiler certainly seems to be working \u2013 it\u2019s like Malta in here. That\u2019s where Margaret and Ray met. \u201cOr was it Spain?\u201d says Ray. Ray was in the army, \u201cDon\u2019t ask where \u2013 you get a long way in 25 years,\u201d he says. Now he has dementia.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people alive now stood in front of a gun to stop us from not being here any more,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cYou deserve everything you get, and while I\u2019m alive you get it for free.\u201d The new boiler is guaranteed for 10 years. Ray is pretty sure it will outlive him.</p> <p>Back in the van (no ticket) to the next job. \u201cA lot of the elderly and disabled people feel like they\u2019re a burden,\u201d says Anderson. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/cold-weather-uk-winter-deaths-europe-polar-vortex-a8224276.html\" title=\"\">Last year, 17,000 elderly and disabled died because of fuel poverty</a>,\u201d he says. \u201cIt should be a national government initiative: anyone over 65 or registered disabled should have some form of discount.\u201d</p> <p>Next stop is a couple of miles away in Nelson, where Sarah and Matthew live. Matthew used to be a mechanic but shattered his spine in an accident and can no longer work. They have three children at school and college and get by on disability benefits.</p> <p>Sarah knew about Anderson from Facebook. So when she was told it would cost \u00a3250 to disconnect their smart thermostat that has never really worked and put the old one back, she called him. It takes about 10 minutes and there\u2019s no charge. Here\u2019s the invoice to prove it, and a photo of Sarah holding it, to go on James\u2019s Facebook page. He\u2019s getting good at social media.</p> <p>Yes, he has had the modern-day Robin Hood \u2013 though without the violence \u2013 comparisons. \u201cThat\u2019s what people call me, but I\u2019m just a normal person.\u201d Why does he do it? \u201cCos I care, simple as that. They deserve it \u2013 there\u2019s no help out there. They\u2019re left to suffer in silence.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the van, back on the phone, there\u2019s good news from Blackpool too: hot water restored to one caravan.</p> <h2><strong>Alison Gore</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c6143805383785c7dab2e44beee4748e85c40230\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6143805383785c7dab2e44beee4748e85c40230/0_0_214_320/214.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Gore\" width=\"214\" height=\"320\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beautician Alison Gore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alison Gore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I speak to Alison Gore on the phone. She is in Cheltenham, where she has a <a href=\"http://absolute-beauty.co.uk/\" title=\"\">beauty salon</a>, \u201ca friendly, local kind of place, nothing big or fancy\u201d, she says. They do massage, facials, eyes, nails, manicures, pedicures, hair removal, all the stuff. And for free if you have cancer.</p> <p>It came about a while back partly because of some of the nonsense that was being taught on beauty courses. \u201cLike students being told not to touch a client with cancer and that if you massaged a cancer patient it would spread the cancer,\u201d says Gore, who qualified \u201cin the dark ages, 1992\u201d.</p> <p>Gore did some research into how to give cancer patients beauty treatments safely. She made leaflets, dropped them off in the support centre for the local hospital \u2013 Cheltenham has a big oncology department, plus a Sue Ryder hospice \u2013 and the word got out.</p> <p>A lot of it is about making people feel normal, she says. \u201cThey love the fact they can come in as normal clients, talk about what they want to talk about. Usually it\u2019s nothing to do with the illness \u2013 they can moan about whoever they want to moan about. You know, the usual things. It\u2019s not a hospital appointment, for a change \u2013 their lives revolve around hospital appointments.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Cherry said they got it wrong, the lymphoma wasn\u2019t curable. I saw her every week, painted her nails every colour under the sun</p> <footer> <cite>Alison Gore</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gore tells me about a client called Cherry. \u201cShe was told she had non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She came in and said she was really lucky \u2013 she had this thing but it was curable \u2013 and she wanted her nails done. She came in a month later and said they got it wrong \u2013 it wasn\u2019t curable. I saw her every week, painted her nails every colour under the sun. She was phenomenal. I saw her the day before she died. Her brother picked me up and took me to the hospice to paint her nails \u2013 I knew she was ready.\u201d</p> <p>Now, in memory of Cherry, they call the days when they offer free treatments at the salon \u2013 usually three per patient \u2013 Cherry Blossom days.</p> <p>I speak to another client of Gore\u2019s, Anne-Marie, 43, a programme accountant working in the public sector. She was diagnosed with a pancreatic tumour last year. She had never really visited salons before, but she was getting a lot of backache and wanted a massage. A friend told her about Gore\u2019s free sessions. \u201cThe oncology unit offer treatments as well, but you have to go into the hospital and you really don\u2019t want to do that more than you have to. The fact that it was in a salon makes it so much nicer. It\u2019s lovely to have something that\u2019s a bit luxurious, a big treat when everything is quite dark and horrible.\u201d</p> <p>Anne-Marie had chemo, then a big operation in which her pancreas, spleen and gall bladder were removed. Now she is back on the chemo. She is overwhelmingly tired but unable to sleep because of the steroids, although the last scan was good. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk it might come back, but I\u2019m cancer free at the moment.\u201d And she is still going to see Gore.</p> <p>A lot of Gore\u2019s clients are having chemo. \u201cThey say when they look in the mirror it\u2019s not them any more,\u201d Gore says. They may have lost their hair, or they may be wearing a wig. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to remember to look in the mirror and remembering it\u2019s still you. You are not the cancer. The cancer isn\u2019t you \u2013 you are still you.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder why she does it. Does she \u2013 or someone close to her \u2013 have cancer? No, she\u2019s been lucky. It\u2019s simple, she says. \u201cIf I had millions of pounds I would be able to give money to make a difference, but I don\u2019t. I have a skill and some time, so I have something I can give. That\u2019s why I do it: because I can.\u201d</p>",

He is relishing it. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is you\u2019ve got to do something you care about,\u201d he says. \u201cJust going to the shop, seeing my clients, earning, money, going on holiday, there\u2019s no fulfilment there, it\u2019s just a job and I feel like a robot. But with this, and the street work, I\u2019m using my trauma, and the lessons I\u2019ve learned, to help others. It fills me up, I get excited about it.\u201d James Anderson James Anderson is on the phone, too, when he meets me at Burnley Manchester Road station. A woman living in a caravan in Blackpool has no hot water and winter is approaching fast. Anderson is a plumber; the man he\u2019s talking to isn\u2019t, but he is a pal, and he\u2019s on the scene so Anderson will talk him through how to do the job. Anderson became something of a viral sensation a few weeks ago when he fixed the boiler of a terminally ill 91-year-old woman, then sent her an invoice for \u00a30.00. The woman\u2019s daughter posted it on Facebook. But this was far from his first free job. Anderson has been at it since 2017, when he went to see an elderly man who had been quoted \u00a35,500 to install a new boiler that he didn\u2019t need. \u201cThe engineer had put a print magazine in the water tank to stop the water going through into the cylinder. Luckily, the man got a second opinion. That\u2019s when I decided to do something.\u201d Anderson went to see his accountant, who suggested starting a community interest company (CIC). He pays himself \u00a3100 a week, he says. Any profit from private work goes back into the CIC, and thus back into the community. Though there wasn\u2019t much profit for a while \u2013 he was several thousand pounds in debt. Having his story go viral has certainly helped. Some \u00a382,000 has come in from crowdfunding alone since the zero-invoice news broke. He has rehired part-time the two lads he had to lay off. Anderson can help more of the old and vulnerable of Burnley. And beyond, he hopes. He has plans to expand. He lets me in on the passenger side of his van, clears a space, sets off across town, still mostly on the phone. \u201cCall me James, Jimmy, whatever you like,\u201d he says. Originally from Liverpool, Anderson, now 52, has been a plumber for 20 years, and was a bin man before that. We pull up outside a bungalow, on double yellow lines. It\u2019s OK, he knows all the traffic wardens, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve done jobs for their mums and dads: they\u2019re a bit more lenient.\u201d Margaret, 72, lets us in. She lives here with her partner, Ray, 92, and a bouncy young dog called Eric. Anderson fitted a new boiler for them, donated by the manufacturer. He has come to check that it\u2019s running OK. Margaret finds it hard to see the timer display properly, with her cataracts. Anderson says he will replace it with one with bigger numbers. The boiler certainly seems to be working \u2013 it\u2019s like Malta in here. That\u2019s where Margaret and Ray met. \u201cOr was it Spain?\u201d says Ray. Ray was in the army, \u201cDon\u2019t ask where \u2013 you get a long way in 25 years,\u201d he says. Now he has dementia. \u201cA lot of people alive now stood in front of a gun to stop us from not being here any more,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cYou deserve everything you get, and while I\u2019m alive you get it for free.\u201d The new boiler is guaranteed for 10 years. Ray is pretty sure it will outlive him. Back in the van (no ticket) to the next job. \u201cA lot of the elderly and disabled people feel like they\u2019re a burden,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cLast year, 17,000 elderly and disabled died because of fuel poverty,\u201d he says. \u201cIt should be a national government initiative: anyone over 65 or registered disabled should have some form of discount.\u201d Next stop is a couple of miles away in Nelson, where Sarah and Matthew live. Matthew used to be a mechanic but shattered his spine in an accident and can no longer work. They have three children at school and college and get by on disability benefits. Sarah knew about Anderson from Facebook. So when she was told it would cost \u00a3250 to disconnect their smart thermostat that has never really worked and put the old one back, she called him. It takes about 10 minutes and there\u2019s no charge. Here\u2019s the invoice to prove it, and a photo of Sarah holding it, to go on James\u2019s Facebook page. He\u2019s getting good at social media. Yes, he has had the modern-day Robin Hood \u2013 though without the violence \u2013 comparisons. \u201cThat\u2019s what people call me, but I\u2019m just a normal person.\u201d Why does he do it? \u201cCos I care, simple as that. They deserve it \u2013 there\u2019s no help out there. They\u2019re left to suffer in silence.\u201d Back in the van, back on the phone, there\u2019s good news from Blackpool too: hot water restored to one caravan. Alison Gore I speak to Alison Gore on the phone. She is in Cheltenham, where she has a beauty salon, \u201ca friendly, local kind of place, nothing big or fancy\u201d, she says. They do massage, facials, eyes, nails, manicures, pedicures, hair removal, all the stuff. And for free if you have cancer. It came about a while back partly because of some of the nonsense that was being taught on beauty courses. \u201cLike students being told not to touch a client with cancer and that if you massaged a cancer patient it would spread the cancer,\u201d says Gore, who qualified \u201cin the dark ages, 1992\u201d. Gore did some research into how to give cancer patients beauty treatments safely. She made leaflets, dropped them off in the support centre for the local hospital \u2013 Cheltenham has a big oncology department, plus a Sue Ryder hospice \u2013 and the word got out. A lot of it is about making people feel normal, she says. \u201cThey love the fact they can come in as normal clients, talk about what they want to talk about. Usually it\u2019s nothing to do with the illness \u2013 they can moan about whoever they want to moan about. You know, the usual things. It\u2019s not a hospital appointment, for a change \u2013 their lives revolve around hospital appointments.\u201d Gore tells me about a client called Cherry. \u201cShe was told she had non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She came in and said she was really lucky \u2013 she had this thing but it was curable \u2013 and she wanted her nails done. She came in a month later and said they got it wrong \u2013 it wasn\u2019t curable. I saw her every week, painted her nails every colour under the sun. She was phenomenal. I saw her the day before she died. Her brother picked me up and took me to the hospice to paint her nails \u2013 I knew she was ready.\u201d Now, in memory of Cherry, they call the days when they offer free treatments at the salon \u2013 usually three per patient \u2013 Cherry Blossom days. I speak to another client of Gore\u2019s, Anne-Marie, 43, a programme accountant working in the public sector. She was diagnosed with a pancreatic tumour last year. She had never really visited salons before, but she was getting a lot of backache and wanted a massage. A friend told her about Gore\u2019s free sessions. \u201cThe oncology unit offer treatments as well, but you have to go into the hospital and you really don\u2019t want to do that more than you have to. The fact that it was in a salon makes it so much nicer. It\u2019s lovely to have something that\u2019s a bit luxurious, a big treat when everything is quite dark and horrible.\u201d Anne-Marie had chemo, then a big operation in which her pancreas, spleen and gall bladder were removed. Now she is back on the chemo. She is overwhelmingly tired but unable to sleep because of the steroids, although the last scan was good. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk it might come back, but I\u2019m cancer free at the moment.\u201d And she is still going to see Gore. A lot of Gore\u2019s clients are having chemo. \u201cThey say when they look in the mirror it\u2019s not them any more,\u201d Gore says. They may have lost their hair, or they may be wearing a wig. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to remember to look in the mirror and remembering it\u2019s still you. You are not the cancer. The cancer isn\u2019t you \u2013 you are still you.\u201d I wonder why she does it. Does she \u2013 or someone close to her \u2013 have cancer? No, she\u2019s been lucky. It\u2019s simple, she says. \u201cIf I had millions of pounds I would be able to give money to make a difference, but I don\u2019t. I have a skill and some time, so I have something I can give. That\u2019s why I do it: because I can.\u201d",

The Young Workers Centre \u2013 an initiative of the Victoria Trades Hall Council \u2013 conducted a survey of more than 240 riders, revealing most are engaged on a \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d basis and almost all are paid per delivery, with no minimum rates of pay. Bike couriers at companies such as Deliveroo are employed as independent contractors, meaning they are not paid the award minimum rate of $25.81 per hour they would be entitled to if classed as employees. According to the centre, a typical courier working 24 hours a week including six hours at the higher weekend rate would receive $681 under the award and $65 in super. Although pay was as high as $18.50 an hour with a $2.50 delivery commission when delivery apps entered the market in late 2015, the Transport Workers\u2019 Union argues that through a series of unilateral pay cuts conditions have ratcheted down to flat rates of $10 a delivery, or as low as $5.90 for some deliveries under new dynamic pricing systems. A typical courier paid $10 per delivery might make 53 deliveries, for a weekly pay packet of $530, about $151 under the award, the rider snapshot said. Under an alternative dynamic pay method of $3.50 per pickup, $1.80 per delivery and a variable fee based on time and distance, a courier might earn as little as $424 a week, some $322 less than the award rate when superannuation is factored in. Unions have been rocked by the Fair Work Ombudsman\u2019s claim in June that ridesharing company Uber does not directly employ its drivers, fearing that it will solidify the existing practice in the gig economy to classify workers as independent contractors. In 2018 the ombudsman took court action against food delivery company Foodora, alleging that bike couriers are employees, which the administrators of the now-collapsed Foodora Australia admitted is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be true. However, Uber Eats and Deliveroo maintain their couriers are independent contractors. In an unfair dismissal case before the Fair Work Commission which began on Monday, the TWU is seeking to prove Uber Eats drivers are in fact employees. The survey found that the average age of riders is 26, while three-quarters are temporary visa holders such as international students, or people on working holiday or bridging visas. Just one in 10 surveyed was an Australian citizen. Only 2% of riders said they would not negotiate for a pay rise as they were happy with current pay rates, while 60% said it is \u201cnot possible to negotiate a pay rise\u201d. One-quarter of surveyed couriers had been in an accident, with one in eight sustaining injuries such as concussions, knee injuries, broken bones or dislocations. On Wednesday the TWU will release a proposed charter of rights for delivery drivers including the minimum wage, paid wait times, penalty rates, an allowance for bad weather and fully-funded workers compensation. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said Uber and Deliveroo \u201cneed to sign up to the charter of rights\u201d to fix what the TWU alleges are the \u201cappalling practices\u201d of \u201cripping workers off \u2026 and throwing [them] on the scrap heap when they are injured or no longer useful\u201d. \u201cThrough the charter [riders] want an end to the \u2018take-it-or-leave-it\u2019 practice where they carry all the liability and Uber and Deliveroo accept none of the responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cRiders are taking this stand amidst the absence of any semblance of interest from the federal government which has outright refused to support them.\u201d VTHC secretary Luke Hilakari said the delivery riders snapshot \u201cpaints a picture of extreme worker exploitation in the food delivery industry\u201d. \u201cThe likes of Uber and Deliveroo need to accept that if they want to operate in the Australian market, they need to abide by Australian employment law.\u201d",

According to the draft agenda for Friday\u2019s Coag energy council meeting, obtained by Guardian Australia, the commonwealth has scheduled a discussion about the $2.55bn ERF, now rebadged the Climate Solutions Fund, at the long delayed meeting of federal and state energy ministers. Ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting, the first in nearly 12 months, Taylor has signalled he wants to pursue a series of deals with the states to roll out new generation and transmission \u2013 an approach that has followed the Morrison government\u2019s decision to ditch the national energy guarantee (Neg). The Neg was a casualty of the federal Liberal party\u2019s leadership eruption last August. The Coalition initially faced pressure from some of the Liberal state governments, including New South Wales, to revive the Neg, which was supported by most stakeholders in the energy sector. But with Canberra refusing to reboot the Turnbull-era policy mechanism that combined reliability standards and emissions reduction for electricity, the states have in more recent times pursued a plan B, giving Canberra specific wish lists of projects they want assistance with. Taylor has not ruled out the side deals including direct assistance for emissions reduction in the states, and the Morrison government has been quietly pursuing an overhaul of the ERF, appointing a panel of four business leaders and policy experts to suggest options to expand it. The conversation at the Coag meeting on Friday is expected to seek state and territory buy-in for the planned overhaul of the fund, which has been heavily criticised for failing to deliver substantial emissions reduction from the industrial sectors of the economy. It is likely the states will want cash from the fund to drive abatement in their jurisdictions. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A discussion paper flagging the ERF overhaul, first reported by Footprint, says the fund has been successful in generating carbon offsets from native vegetation and landfill projects, largely because they cost relatively little and do not require businesses to make substantial operational changes. But it says the scheme has done little to cut emissions through energy efficiency projects and from industry, agriculture and transport, in part due to high upfront and transaction costs. The emissions reduction fund works as a reverse auction, rewarding landowners and businesses that make cheap, viable bids for taxpayers\u2019 support to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The paper says the government is looking at ways to attract more participants from industry and agricultural businesses. Stakeholders report there is a diversity of views within the reviewing panel, headed by Grant King, the outgoing president of the Business Council of Australia and a former chief executive of Origin Energy, about how to refashion the scheme, and the process is operating on a tight timeframe. Ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting, Victoria has asked the Morrison government to fast-track work on the KerangLink \u2013 a transmission line increasing power transfer capability between the Snowy area and Melbourne. The request from Victoria follows a similar pitch from the NSW government, which has asked Canberra to underwrite new generation to replace the Liddell power station, and either underwrite or de-risk new investments in transmission that have been highlighted as urgent by the Australian Energy Market Operator. The side deal with NSW is understood to be close to sign-off. South Australia has not telegraphed its wishlist publicly, but says it will pursue options for expanding the state\u2019s abundant renewable energy resources in ways that deliver more affordable and reliable power to consumers.

It would be perfectly possible to maintain a wary distance from the current White House incumbent without destroying the relationship. God knows Trump \u2013 who by all appearances lives in a moment-to-moment stream of transactional encounters \u2013 would barely notice if Australia cooled the friendship by a few degrees. On the other hand, his entire personal history suggests that he is unlikely to be meaningfully grateful for any loyalty shown him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Australian right knows that the left hates Trump.

If Trump goes down, Morrison will not be able to erase all the glad-handing and back-scratching from the public record.</p> <p>So why has the PM been so determined to suck up to the guy? A number of possibilities that suggest themselves. None are particularly comforting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/17/australians-are-asking-how-did-we-get-here-well-islamophobia-is-practically-enshrined-as-public-policy\">Australians are asking how did we get here? Well, Islamophobia is practically enshrined as public policy | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first is that the prime minister, his government, his party, and the whole culture of Australian conservatives know no greater pleasure, nor any greater purpose, than \u201cowning the libs\u201d.</p> <p>The Australian right knows that the left hates Trump. And that is almost enough on its own to lead it to ostentatiously embrace him.</p> <p>The pig-headed contrarianism of conservatism is an international trait, but it is particularly evident among Australia\u2019s Coalition parties, which appear to have no special reason for being in government, and no ambitions for their administration beyond delaying a response to climate change, maintaining a racist refugee policy and frustrating efforts at reconciliation.</p> <p>Right now, they\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/18/nsw-fires-qld-bushfires-queensland-new-south-wales-australia-boys-arrested-fire-bushfire-sydney\">literally watching the country burn</a>.</p> <p>Another possibility, though, lies in another aspect of the character of Australian conservatism. Increasingly over the decades, the Liberal party, rightwing media, and their camp followers have looked to US conservatism for the ideas that they, in their mediocrity, are incapable of generating.</p> <p>Successively, the Liberals looked to their cousins across the ditch, and adopted their ideas. Like Republicans in the past, they used dog whistling, confected a border security problem, and exploited the \u201cwar on terror\u201d as ways to win elections. They then enacted policies which largely benefited the wealthy and accelerated growing inequality.</p> <p>Thinktanks including the IPA were successful less in thinking than in porting small government doctrine from the US right to an Australian context. The Australian right fell hard for concepts like \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d, which were initially forged as weapons in the US culture war. Christian right-style religious conservatism was always a harder sell in an irreligious country, but even this has made inroads, with culture warriors inside and outside the parliament picking fights on issues from halal food to trans rights.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s right is simply incapable of adopting a critical stance on US conservatism. They are under its tutelage.</p> <p>One last possible explanation comes down to the temperament, personality and particular political character of Morrison.</p> <p>If Tony Abbott\u2019s politics had the flavour of a European reactionary \u2013 throne, knighthoods, and altar \u2013 and Malcolm Turnbull was a cosmopolitan neoliberal, Morrison may be the closest thing we have seen to a member of the all-American Christian right in the Lodge.</p> <p>His enthusiastic, long-term membership in a suburban Pentecostal megachurch sets him apart from previous examples of the ways in which religion has infected Australian politics. Unlike every prime minister (outside a few notable atheists), Morrison is neither a Catholic nor a mainline Protestant. His faith was made in America.</p> <p>His religious beliefs are fair game in this context because \u2013 as Morrison himself revealed \u2013 one of the visits he made in the US was to a similar Pentecostal church in Washington DC, run by an entrepreneurial, smart-casual pastor Mark Batterson. </p> <p>Megachurch Pentecostalism offers a particular mirror on its country of origin. Long on personal inspiration and short on doctrine and history, each church in the loosely affiliated Assemblies of God network is often only as old as the building that houses it.</p> <p>Pentecostalism emphasises direct experience, personal transformation, biblical inerrancy, and the moment-to-moment possibility of premillennial rapture, when faithful believers will ascend into heaven while the Earth descends into tribulation.</p> <p>Megachurches are not confined to Pentecostalism but they are often under the even broader umbrella of American evangelicalism: 2000+ congregations happen across a range of denominations, but mostly in those that believe in biblical inerrancy, and the need to be born again. On the whole these churches are characteristic not so much of America as a whole but of its provinces, suburbs, mid-size cities: the sprawl.</p> <p>And evangelicals are the segment of society which was most crucial in delivering the presidency to Trump. Almost all white evangelicals voted for him, and on their own composed 25% of his electorate. They voted for him not so much because of his intrinsic appeal but because they considered his opponent to be an existential threat to their way of life.</p> <p>As with many other conservatives who had misgivings about a vulgar, adulterous, mendacious and acquisitive candidate, being anti-anti-Trump \u2013 hating the president\u2019s liberal critics \u2013 has put them more and more in his corner.</p> <p>In a movement that perennially sees itself as besieged by secular modernity, Trump has become their unlikely paladin.</p> <p>This is Morrison\u2019s faith community. This, perhaps, is his tribe. If he feels an affinity for the president, this may be its source: faith, loyalty and sacrifice.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jason Wilson is a Guardian Australia columnist and journalist living in America</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

God knows Trump \u2013 who by all appearances lives in a moment-to-moment stream of transactional encounters \u2013 would barely notice if Australia cooled the friendship by a few degrees. On the other hand, his entire personal history suggests that he is unlikely to be meaningfully grateful for any loyalty shown him. A well-placed, mild criticism here and there might leave room, later, for excusing ourselves from some foreign adventure embarked to shore up the president\u2019s crumbling legitimacy, a possibility that it would be foolish to rule out. Such criticism might also embody a recognition that the president is pursuing a self-destructive economic war with China, whose trading relationship with Australia dwarfs the Australia-US relationship. If diplomacy is about threading such needles \u2013 balancing trade and security relationships \u2013 Australia\u2019s government has shown no interest in doing so. Moreover, the downside political risk in being so strongly identified with Trump \u2013 for whom there is a non-zero likelihood of being removed from office \u2013 would seem to be obvious. If Trump goes down, Morrison will not be able to erase all the glad-handing and back-scratching from the public record. So why has the PM been so determined to suck up to the guy? A number of possibilities that suggest themselves. None are particularly comforting. The first is that the prime minister, his government, his party, and the whole culture of Australian conservatives know no greater pleasure, nor any greater purpose, than \u201cowning the libs\u201d. The Australian right knows that the left hates Trump. And that is almost enough on its own to lead it to ostentatiously embrace him. The pig-headed contrarianism of conservatism is an international trait, but it is particularly evident among Australia\u2019s Coalition parties, which appear to have no special reason for being in government, and no ambitions for their administration beyond delaying a response to climate change, maintaining a racist refugee policy and frustrating efforts at reconciliation. Right now, they\u2019re literally watching the country burn. Another possibility, though, lies in another aspect of the character of Australian conservatism. Increasingly over the decades, the Liberal party, rightwing media, and their camp followers have looked to US conservatism for the ideas that they, in their mediocrity, are incapable of generating. Successively, the Liberals looked to their cousins across the ditch, and adopted their ideas. Like Republicans in the past, they used dog whistling, confected a border security problem, and exploited the \u201cwar on terror\u201d as ways to win elections. They then enacted policies which largely benefited the wealthy and accelerated growing inequality. Thinktanks including the IPA were successful less in thinking than in porting small government doctrine from the US right to an Australian context. The Australian right fell hard for concepts like \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d, which were initially forged as weapons in the US culture war. Christian right-style religious conservatism was always a harder sell in an irreligious country, but even this has made inroads, with culture warriors inside and outside the parliament picking fights on issues from halal food to trans rights. Australia\u2019s right is simply incapable of adopting a critical stance on US conservatism. They are under its tutelage. One last possible explanation comes down to the temperament, personality and particular political character of Morrison. If Tony Abbott\u2019s politics had the flavour of a European reactionary \u2013 throne, knighthoods, and altar \u2013 and Malcolm Turnbull was a cosmopolitan neoliberal, Morrison may be the closest thing we have seen to a member of the all-American Christian right in the Lodge. His enthusiastic, long-term membership in a suburban Pentecostal megachurch sets him apart from previous examples of the ways in which religion has infected Australian politics. Unlike every prime minister (outside a few notable atheists), Morrison is neither a Catholic nor a mainline Protestant. His faith was made in America. His religious beliefs are fair game in this context because \u2013 as Morrison himself revealed \u2013 one of the visits he made in the US was to a similar Pentecostal church in Washington DC, run by an entrepreneurial, smart-casual pastor Mark Batterson. Megachurch Pentecostalism offers a particular mirror on its country of origin. Long on personal inspiration and short on doctrine and history, each church in the loosely affiliated Assemblies of God network is often only as old as the building that houses it. Pentecostalism emphasises direct experience, personal transformation, biblical inerrancy, and the moment-to-moment possibility of premillennial rapture, when faithful believers will ascend into heaven while the Earth descends into tribulation. Megachurches are not confined to Pentecostalism but they are often under the even broader umbrella of American evangelicalism: 2000+ congregations happen across a range of denominations, but mostly in those that believe in biblical inerrancy, and the need to be born again. On the whole these churches are characteristic not so much of America as a whole but of its provinces, suburbs, mid-size cities: the sprawl. And evangelicals are the segment of society which was most crucial in delivering the presidency to Trump. Almost all white evangelicals voted for him, and on their own composed 25% of his electorate. They voted for him not so much because of his intrinsic appeal but because they considered his opponent to be an existential threat to their way of life. As with many other conservatives who had misgivings about a vulgar, adulterous, mendacious and acquisitive candidate, being anti-anti-Trump \u2013 hating the president\u2019s liberal critics \u2013 has put them more and more in his corner. In a movement that perennially sees itself as besieged by secular modernity, Trump has become their unlikely paladin. This is Morrison\u2019s faith community. This, perhaps, is his tribe. If he feels an affinity for the president, this may be its source: faith, loyalty and sacrifice. Jason Wilson is a Guardian Australia columnist and journalist living in America",

      "bodyText": "Sitting at a picnic table in the sun, Yael Stone, 34, is unrecognisable from the \u201cBetty-Bo cute\u201d character she played for seven years on Orange Is the New Black. Makeup-free with a pixie cut, she impresses as a deep thinker, intelligent and articulate. The actor has spent the past year settling back into Australia with her partner and baby. It\u2019s been a big year: she started studying sustainability, took a seven-month social media break, and spoke out publicly against the Oscar-winning actor Geoffrey Rush, with whom she starred in a play in 2010, after he began defamation action against News Corp. In doing so, she became the highest-profile voice in Australia\u2019s troubled #MeToo movement. After time off after the difficult birth of her daughter, Pemau, and before that seven seasons as Lorna Morello, Stone is back on the Australian stage in the title role for Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s new production, The Beauty Queen of Leenane. The 1996 play comes from Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, who wrote, directed and produced the 2017 film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Beauty Queen focuses on the suffocating and mutually destructive relationship between an ageing mother Mag (Noni Hazlehurst) and her adult daughter Maureen (Stone) who live together in rural Ireland. Stone describes her character as a woman who has \u201cunwittingly taken up this crazy spinster status in this small town. She\u2019s seen as mad, completely undesirable and the town joke \u2013 sort of like the witch role. She\u2019s diabolically connected to her mother.\u201d The role comes with \u201ca lot of darkness and difficulty and psychic violence\u201d. I meet Stone on a rehearsal break in the backblocks of Sydney\u2019s Fox studios. Straight off the bat, she starts talking about the environment and her struggle to reconcile her beliefs with her carbon footprint. \u201cIt has proved to be a real dilemma for me \u2013 and I\u2019m feeling super irresponsible as a person who has deemed it necessary to work in two fucking continents,\u201d she says. But surely it\u2019s harder to get these plum roles in Australia if you don\u2019t have an established career overseas? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go away to come back,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m right in the thick of it \u2013 you\u2019ve got me right where it hurts \u2013 but I feel like these are the kinds of hits that I need to make. There are big personal sacrifices we can make \u2013 or even daily little sacrifices we can make, around single-use plastics. But ultimately I really believe it\u2019s in the hands of government legislating big corporations to make change.\u201d Scroll through Stone\u2019s Instagram from the past to the present and you can see an evolution taking place. \u201cIf you look at the narrative of my social media you\u2019ll see [it goes from] someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, who kind of gets sucked in to trying to be beautiful \u2013 trying to be what I think I\u2019m supposed to be \u2013 to [someone] realising that it\u2019s all horseshit, and it\u2019s unhealthy. It\u2019s a terrible, terrible tool as it\u2019s being used now: the sense of comparison, the bullying, the shame, the total illusion that it\u2019s based on.\u201d Stone\u2019s mission is to get from 1 million Instagram followers to zero, sort of like a reverse influencer. So she started posting videos where she is 100% authentic, asking big questions like, \u201cHow can you have a creative life and parent a small baby?\u201d and \u201cHow to be an Australian actor with a career in the US and what that means for my carbon footprint?\u201d After she posts each video, she deletes the Instagram app so as not to get caught in a loop of scrolling and checking likes. \u201cI have actively been trying in the public version of my life to really expose myself: to not wear makeup, to be boring, to talk about what keeps me up at night, to be silly in a way that\u2019s not necessarily palatable. To be more myself basically \u2013 to be more like me. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do there.\u201d After she had the baby, Stone took some time off acting to study sustainability online. She also accidentally enrolled in a physics course, which she passed. It\u2019s been a year of \u201chuge growth\u201d, she says. Part of the growth has been painful. Stone was one of only a small handful of high-profile women in Australia to come forward with a #MeToo story. Hers was about Rush, who starred alongside Stone in Diary of a Madman for Belvoir Street theatre almost a decade ago. When Rush filed for defamation against the Daily Telegraph, which first published allegations that he had acted inappropriately towards another actor, Eryn Jean Norvill, the newspaper attempted to get Stone\u2019s allegations against the actor admitted as evidence in their defence. After the judge rejected it, but before the public knew that she was Witness X, she gave a nuanced interview to 7.30 detailing her allegations. When she was 25 and he was 59, she said, Rush had exposed himself to her backstage, sent her sexually suggestive text messages, and attempted to spy on her while she was showering. Rush has denied any inappropriate behaviour towards Stone and Norvill, and won $2.9m in damages for the Norvill story, a ruling the Telegraph is now attempting to appeal. Going public was an extension of Stone\u2019s desire for authenticity, she says. \u201cSharing is not always comfortable but if I can just stay really honest and really authentic then that might be powerful for somebody else,\u201d Stone told Nine in July. \u201cCertainly I think the last year has made clear that there is no other option for me ... It is absolutely necessary for me to be at peace with myself and to be the kind of role model for my kid that I think she deserves.\u201d When we speak, the actor says she can\u2019t discuss the Rush allegations but she praises Sydney Theatre Company and the new organisation Safe Theatres for creating a better space for actors. \u201cThe experience of being at STC is night and day from the last theatre experience I\u2019ve had, from any experience I\u2019ve had, because of very hard work from people like Sophie Ross and Eryn Jean Norvill [who founded Safe Theatres].

The World Health Organisation has recognised since 2015 that climate change was the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century, and argued the scientific evidence for that assessment was \u201coverwhelming\u201d. The AMA president, Tony Bartone, said climate change meant higher mortality and morbidity from heat stress, injuries and mortalities from severe weather, increases in the transmission of vector-borne diseases, food insecurity resulting from declines in agricultural outputs, and higher incidences of mental ill health. Bowen will say he has been struck in his first six months in the health portfolio by the number of clinicians and medicos who have engaged him on climate change. \u201cAs one senior doctor put it me powerfully recently: \u2018Doctors listen to the science of the climate change and its health impacts like we listen to the science of vaccination and the impacts of not vaccinating. They are as clear as each other, and ignoring the science of climate change would be akin to supporting anti-vaxxers.\u2019 \u201d",

The thorny issue of independence was dealt with by both sides agreeing that an independence referendum must be held 10 to 15 years after the first Autonomous Bougainville Government was elected (by June 2020), but that the vote should be non-binding.

      "bodyText": "New South Wales police officers are being investigated over the strip-search of \u201cseveral\u201d minors at an underage music festival this year. On Wednesday the state\u2019s police watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, will announce public hearings into the strip-search of \u201cseveral young people\u201d at the Lost City Music festival, an under-18s event held in Sydney in February. Set down for the first week in December, the hearings form part of an ongoing investigation by the watchdog into the practice of strip-searching minors, and come amid increasing scrutiny of the possible misuse of the controversial police power. It also comes as the state\u2019s police commissioner, Mick Fuller, engages in a high-profile campaign defending the use of strip-searches. In a front-page interview with Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph this week, Fuller said young people should have \u201ca little bit of fear\u201d of police. Fuller also claimed reducing strip-searches could lead to an increase in knife crime despite less than 1% of all searches in the state being conducted for that reason. The LECC hearings will shine further light on the use of strip-searches on minors after public hearings in October revealed the allegedly illegal strip-search of a 16-year-old girl at the 2018 Splendour in the Grass festival. The inquiry heard the girl was left fearful and in tears after she was forced to strip naked and squat in front of a police officer who then \u201clooked underneath\u201d her. The search took place without a parent or guardian present, a potential breach of police powers. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cI could not believe this was happening to me,\u201d the girl said in a prepared statement read out in the inquiry by the counsel assisting the commissioner, Peggy Dwyer. \u201cI could not stop crying. I was completely humiliated.\u201d This month, Guardian Australia revealed police performed strip-searches on more than 100 girls in the last three years, including two 12-year-olds and eight 13-year-olds. The Guardian also revealed other instances of potentially illegal strip-searches, including a woman who recounted a female officer having \u201cjiggled\u201d her breasts during a search when she was 15 years old in 2011. The revelations prompted the NSW Labor opposition to call for a review of the laws governing strip-searches, with the shadow police spokeswoman, Lynda Voltz, questioning the justification for using the power against children. Two weeks ago the NSW deputy coroner, Harriet Graeme, also called for a wind-back of their use, saying the \u201cwholesale practice of strip-searching young people\u201d was of \u201cgrave concern\u201d and recommended police only use the practice in cases where officers suspect someone is involved in drug supply rather than possession. In NSW, officers are only able to conduct a strip-search outside of a police station if the urgency and seriousness of the situation requires it. In the case of minors, a parent or guardian must be present unless an immediate search is necessary to protect the person or prevent the destruction of evidence. However, the use of the practice in the context of music festivals has drawn considerable criticism. During the LECC hearings in October, the commissioner, Michael Adams QC, questioned under what circumstances \u2013 apart from a suspicion someone was hiding drugs in a body cavity, which police are not allowed to search \u2013 it would be urgent for an officer to conduct a strip search at a music festival. That question, to a senior constable who worked at the 2018 Splendour in the Grass, prompted the officer to concede that all 19 strip searches he conducted at the festival may have been illegal.",

      "bodyText": "When Burger King announced the Impossible Whopper (a vegan alternative to their bestselling burger), they did so with the tagline: \u201c100% Whopper, 0% Beef.\u201d Turns out, the statement may have been misleading. At least, that\u2019s what customer Phillip Williams, who is vegan, has claimed in a lawsuit filed against the fast-food giant in south Florida on Monday. Williams purchased the Impossible Whopper (without mayo) at a drive-thru store in Atlanta after reading about the Impossible Burger online. He bought the vegan Whopper, which costs around $1 more than the regular Whopper. Being a strict vegan who doesn\u2019t eat any animal byproduct, Williams studiously checked that the burger was indeed mayonnaise free and proceeded to eat it. He says he was shocked to find later on that the Impossible Whopper is cooked on the same grills as the meat. Williams alleges that no signage on his trip warned him that his burger would be cooked on the same grills as the meat, nor was he notified by any staff before he ate it. Williams argues that he was duped by the fast-food chain and that he wouldn\u2019t have paid for the premium-priced burger if he had known that it was \u201ccovered in meat by-products\u201d. He said he is taking Burger King to court on behalf of all vegans and vegetarians who have similarly bought the product under false pretenses. In a statement, a Burger King representative said the company does not comment on pending litigation. On the Burger King website, underneath the advert boasting \u201c100% WHOPPER\u00ae, 0% Beef,\u201d there is a notice that reads: \"*For guests looking for a meat-free option, a non-broiler method of preparation is available upon request.\u201d However, Burger King did not respond to a question about whether the statement was uploaded after Williams bought his burger. In November, Impossible Foods revealed in its own report that an ingredient in its burger was tested on rats, causing controversy over whether it can truly be vegan if it is tested on animals. A number of rats died in the testing of the burger. Of course, seeing as most vegetables are grown using animal byproducts (such as manure), we may be heading down a slippery slope. But in the meantime, Williams has kindly asked for a pretty simple solution: that in future, Burger King plainly discloses that the Impossible Whopper is cooked on the same grill as its other meat when advertising the burger.",

      "body": "<p>The photographer and film director Robert Freeman, who has died of pneumonia aged 82, found enduring fame in the 1960s through his work with the Beatles, shooting the cover photographs for some of their most significant albums including A Hard Day\u2019s Night and Rubber Soul. He also photographed other towering names in music and show business, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/07/obituaries.usa\" title=\"\">Charlton Heston</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/23/obituaries/andy-warhol-pop-artist-dies.html\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol</a>, Sophia Loren, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-obituary\" title=\"\">Muhammad Ali</a> and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, and took memorable portraits of jazz musicians including <a href=\"http://movies2.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1021.html\" title=\"\">Dizzy Gillespie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/09/archives/cannonball-adderley-jazzman-dead.html\" title=\"\">Cannonball Adderley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1967/07/18/archives/john-coltrane-jazz-star-dies-inventive-saxophone-player-40.html\" title=\"\">John Coltrane</a>.</p> <p>Although the Beatles connection ensured his name became widely known, Freeman had a broad intellect through which he explored a variety of creative disciplines. A compulsive traveller, he had a panoramic knowledge of music, from Debussy and <em>musique concr</em><em>\u00e8te</em> to modern jazz and music from Cuba and South America (though he was never a diehard Beatles fan). He was fascinated by architecture, and devoured literature from Goethe to Cervantes to Rilke. He also pursued a successful career as a director of commercials, and directed the feature films <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063709/\" title=\"\">The Touchables</a> (1968) and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065263/\" title=\"\">Secret World</a> (1969).</p> <p>Before meeting the Beatles in 1963, Freeman had worked as a photographer for two years, contributing to the Sunday Times and other magazines. He had just photographed the Soviet premier <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/12/archives/nikita-s-khrushchev.html\" title=\"\">Nikita Khrushchev</a> at the Kremlin, and had shot the first Pirelli calendar (published in 1964), through which he met his first wife, the German-born model Sonny Drane (originally Sonnhild Spielhagen). They had a son, Dean, and a daughter, Janine.</p> <p>His first commission for the Beatles came through their manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1967/aug/28/fromthearchive\" title=\"\">Brian Epstein</a>, after Freeman had sent him a selection of his atmospherically monochrome photographs of jazz musicians. \u201cMy favourite assignment during that period was photographing John Coltrane and other jazz musicians at a festival in London,\u201d Freeman later recalled. \u201cIt was photographs of these musicians that I later showed to the Beatles.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bac426858151f7c754f1150fbab548cadb33ad4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bac426858151f7c754f1150fbab548cadb33ad4b/47_0_3285_1972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Coltrane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Freeman\u2019s photographs of John Coltrane helped land him his first Beatles commission</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Freeman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Epstein arranged for him to meet the group in Bournemouth, where they were playing a string of dates at the Gaumont cinema. This coincided with a request from their producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/09/george-martin-producer-of-the-beatles-dies-aged-90\" title=\"\">George Martin</a>, who needed a cover photo for their forthcoming second album.

      "bodyText": "The photographer and film director Robert Freeman, who has died of pneumonia aged 82, found enduring fame in the 1960s through his work with the Beatles, shooting the cover photographs for some of their most significant albums including A Hard Day\u2019s Night and Rubber Soul. He also photographed other towering names in music and show business, including Charlton Heston, Andy Warhol, Sophia Loren, Muhammad Ali and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, and took memorable portraits of jazz musicians including Dizzy Gillespie, Cannonball Adderley and John Coltrane. Although the Beatles connection ensured his name became widely known, Freeman had a broad intellect through which he explored a variety of creative disciplines. A compulsive traveller, he had a panoramic knowledge of music, from Debussy and musique concr\u00e8te to modern jazz and music from Cuba and South America (though he was never a diehard Beatles fan). He was fascinated by architecture, and devoured literature from Goethe to Cervantes to Rilke. He also pursued a successful career as a director of commercials, and directed the feature films The Touchables (1968) and Secret World (1969). Before meeting the Beatles in 1963, Freeman had worked as a photographer for two years, contributing to the Sunday Times and other magazines. He had just photographed the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev at the Kremlin, and had shot the first Pirelli calendar (published in 1964), through which he met his first wife, the German-born model Sonny Drane (originally Sonnhild Spielhagen). They had a son, Dean, and a daughter, Janine. His first commission for the Beatles came through their manager Brian Epstein, after Freeman had sent him a selection of his atmospherically monochrome photographs of jazz musicians. \u201cMy favourite assignment during that period was photographing John Coltrane and other jazz musicians at a festival in London,\u201d Freeman later recalled. \u201cIt was photographs of these musicians that I later showed to the Beatles.\u201d Epstein arranged for him to meet the group in Bournemouth, where they were playing a string of dates at the Gaumont cinema. This coincided with a request from their producer George Martin, who needed a cover photo for their forthcoming second album. Epstein asked Freeman to arrange a photoshoot, and the photographer was able to bargain the proffered \u00a325 fee up to \u00a375. \u201cSince the photograph was needed urgently, I had to improvise a studio situation in the hotel,\u201d Freeman wrote in his book The Beatles: A Private View (2003). \u201cThey came down at midday wearing their black polo-necked sweaters. It seemed natural to photograph them in black and white wearing their customary dark clothes.\u201d The session, on 22 August 1963, produced the imposing cover shot for the album With the Beatles, with the foursome\u2019s faces side-lit by natural daylight and half in shadow, and Ringo Starr placed below the other three to make the composition fit the square format of an LP cover. Though the session took barely half an hour, Freeman\u2019s image lent the group a knowing, arthouse aura, setting them apart from the cheesy frivolity of their competitors. He became the group\u2019s friend and confidant, travelling on tour with them to the US and going on to shoot covers for their albums A Hard Day\u2019s Night, Beatles For Sale, Help! and Rubber Soul. The stretched, druggy-looking image on the last of these was created by accident when the card on to which Freeman was projecting it slid backwards and distorted the picture. John Lennon and his wife Cynthia moved into a London flat upstairs from Freeman and Sonny in Emperor\u2019s Gate, South Kensington, and Freeman designed the artwork for Lennon\u2019s books In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works. It was suggested by Philip Norman in his Lennon biography (2009) that Lennon had an affair with Sonny, alluded to (in coded form) in Lennon\u2019s song Norwegian Wood. Freeman was born in West Wickham, then in Kent, to Freddy Freeman, an insurance broker for London theatres, and his wife, Dorothy (nee Jaycock). He attended Ardingly college in Sussex, and then went to Clare College, Cambridge, to study modern languages. He edited the university magazine, which published some of his early black and white photographs, and also pursued his interest in architecture. Attending lectures by the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner helped to shape his thinking about the relationship between space and light. Much as the Beatles connection assisted him, it also typecast him, and Freeman came to regard it as \u201ca yoke\u201d, according to his second wife, Tiddy Rowan. He moved into film directing, making the short, surreal film Greetings, Mary Ann! (1966) with a screenplay by Paul Ableman. This was never widely distributed, but Freeman achieved greater visibility with The Touchables, a crime-drama scripted by Ian La Frenais from a story by Donald Cammell (who would make Performance, 1970, with Nic Roeg). The story involved a swinging London pop idol being kidnapped by female fans and incarcerated in a plastic dome. Freeman followed up by directing Secret World, starring Jacqueline Bisset with cinematography by Peter Biziou, who later worked on Mississippi Burning (1988), Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian (1979) and other major productions. Then Freeman began working on TV commercials with Hugh Hudson and his brilliantly innovative film company Cammell Hudson &amp; Brownjohn. Among numerous highlights, Freeman was a cameraman on The Tortoise and the Hare (1966), a 37-minute film promoting Pirelli Cinturato tyres. It starred the model Liz Allsop driving an E-Type Jaguar across Italy, and won a prize at the Venice film festival.

Fasting might entail abstinence from technology, artificial light, food, drink, conversation, eye contact \u2013 essentially anything that an individual finds stimulating. But is there any sense to the fad?</p> <p>\u201cRetreating from life probably makes life more interesting when you come back to it,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.nutt\" title=\"\">David Nutt</a>, director of the neuropsychopharmacology unit in the division of brain sciences at Imperial College London. \u201cMonks have been doing it for thousands of years. Whether that has anything to do with dopamine is unclear.\u201d</p> <p>It is possible to manipulate the production of dopamine through diet, Nutt says. He mentions the velvet bean, which contains high concentrations of a precursor to dopamine. \u201cThere is no question that you can have a dietary influence on the production of dopamine,\u201d he says. \u201cStarvation would probably reduce dopamine to some extent.\u201d</p> <p>Dopamine is often thought of as a reward, but <a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/bhattacharya/\" title=\"\">Joydeep Bhattacharya</a>, who leads the research group of cognitive and neuroscience at Goldsmiths, University of London, points out that dopamine is really \u201cabout learning the anticipation of the reward, and not the pleasure itself. It is primarily released in this anticipation phase.\u201d</p> <p>This could counteract dopamine fasting because abstinence might trigger a greater number of thoughts about the things from which a person is abstaining. \u201cThe moment we try to abstain, naturally our brain will crave that \u2013 so there will be more of a dopamine release.\u201d Similarly, anyone who abstains and has a sense of occasion about the abstinence would be in danger of triggering the production of dopamine, as would a person who periodically congratulates themselves on their abstinence during the abstinence.</p> <p>Rather than casting this sort of intense, time-limited disengagement as a dopamine fast, it may be better seen as meditation. But dopamine-related dangers lurk there, too. As Nutt, who has studied the production of dopamine in monks, says: \u201cIf you transcend in meditation, you might get euphoria, a release of dopamine.\u201d It would seem nowhere is safe.</p>",

But is there any sense to the fad? \u201cRetreating from life probably makes life more interesting when you come back to it,\u201d says David Nutt, director of the neuropsychopharmacology unit in the division of brain sciences at Imperial College London. \u201cMonks have been doing it for thousands of years. Whether that has anything to do with dopamine is unclear.\u201d It is possible to manipulate the production of dopamine through diet, Nutt says. He mentions the velvet bean, which contains high concentrations of a precursor to dopamine. \u201cThere is no question that you can have a dietary influence on the production of dopamine,\u201d he says. \u201cStarvation would probably reduce dopamine to some extent.\u201d Dopamine is often thought of as a reward, but Joydeep Bhattacharya, who leads the research group of cognitive and neuroscience at Goldsmiths, University of London, points out that dopamine is really \u201cabout learning the anticipation of the reward, and not the pleasure itself. It is primarily released in this anticipation phase.\u201d This could counteract dopamine fasting because abstinence might trigger a greater number of thoughts about the things from which a person is abstaining. \u201cThe moment we try to abstain, naturally our brain will crave that \u2013 so there will be more of a dopamine release.\u201d Similarly, anyone who abstains and has a sense of occasion about the abstinence would be in danger of triggering the production of dopamine, as would a person who periodically congratulates themselves on their abstinence during the abstinence. Rather than casting this sort of intense, time-limited disengagement as a dopamine fast, it may be better seen as meditation. But dopamine-related dangers lurk there, too. As Nutt, who has studied the production of dopamine in monks, says: \u201cIf you transcend in meditation, you might get euphoria, a release of dopamine.\u201d It would seem nowhere is safe.",

The office of the United Nations high commissioner for human rights said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about reports of live ammunition being used against demonstrators. It remains unclear how many people have been arrested, injured or killed in the protests that began on Friday and spread across at least 100 cities and towns. Authorities shut down internet access to the outside world on Saturday and the outage remains in place across the nation of 80 million people. \u201cWe are especially alarmed that the use of live ammunition has allegedly caused a significant number of deaths across the country,\u201d the UN spokesman Rupert Colville said in a statement, adding that it had been \u201cextremely difficult\u201d to verify the overall death toll. Iranian officials say 12 protesters and members of Iran\u2019s security forces have died and more than 600 people have been arrested. But the UN put the figure for deaths in the dozens, and called on the government \u201cimmediately to re-establish Iranians\u2019 access to the internet, as well as other forms of communication, which allow for freedom of expression and access to information\u201d. Amnesty International said on Monday it believed at least 106 people had been killed, citing \u201ccredible reports\u201d. \u201cThe organisation believes that the real death toll may be much higher, with some reports suggesting as many as 200 have been killed,\u201d Amnesty said in a statement. Iranian journalists have claimed in reports that shootings by the security forces number well over 100, and that families have been refused the chance to see their relatives\u2019 bodies. The fuel price rises represent yet another burden on Iranians, who have experienced a severe currency collapse after President Donald Trump withdrew the US from Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and re-imposed crippling US sanctions. Reports out of Iran confirm widespread and diffuse protests but the shutdown of the internet combined with tight state controls on the media make the scale of the protests difficult to assess. The whole of the Islamic republic has been largely offline since the internet restrictions were imposed. \u201cMany professions and banks \u2026 have faced problems, and we have been trying to solve this,\u201d the government spokesman Ali Rabiei told the semi-official news agency ISNA on Tuesday. \u201cThe internet will come back gradually in some provinces where there are assurances the internet will not be abused.\u201d The judiciary issued sharp warnings about those known to be sending videos of protests abroad. The judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaeili said on Tuesday that people who had been filming the protests and sending them to \u201calien and enemy networks\u201d were being identified. Esmaeili said in a news conference that the judiciary would adopt a \u201cpunitive\u201d policy against those who \u201cloot or destroy\u201d public property. He said everybody was \u201cresponsible for their actions\u201d and called on people to separate their actions from those of \u201crioters\u201d, and to instead refer them to law enforcement agencies and the judiciary. Government news outlets published detailed reports, with pictures and videos, of \u201cspontaneous\u201d counter-riot demonstrations that were being organised to show opposition to the agitators. Cheap petrol is practically considered a birthright in Iran, home to the world\u2019s fourth-largest crude oil reserves despite decades of economic woes since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.

In 2018, the Trump administration moved the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (East Jerusalem, which Israel <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/jerusalem\">unilaterally annexed </a>in 1967 and which the international community considers unlawfully occupied, was once intended as the capital of a future Palestinian state.)

In step with the Israeli right\u2019s annexationist policies, the Trump peace plan \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://972mag.com/oslo-palestinian-economy-bahrain-trump/142030/\">the Deal of the Century</a>\u201d \u2013 is all but guaranteed to be a gift to the territorial-maximalist right. To say that it is unlikely to include a Palestinian state would be an understatement.</p> <p>But as is typical of Trump administration decisions, this is not simply a matter of ideology. It is also a matter of personal expediency \u2013 for Trump and Netanyahu alike \u2013 as well as a blatant instance of US intervention in a foreign country\u2019s political system. Both Trump and Netanyahu are bogged down by investigations into their almost certainly criminal conduct. Pompeo\u2019s announcement is a bone thrown to Trump\u2019s anxious base of Christian Zionists and the Jewish religious right, and it is another gift \u2013 much like Trump\u2019s Golan Heights recognition \u2013 to Netanyahu who, floundering in electoral limbo, can now claim a foreign policy victory just one day before Israel\u2019s attorney general is expected to <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israeli-prosecutors-conference-postponed-ahead-of-netanyahu-indictment-1.8136274\">announce his indictment</a>.</p> <p>It would, however, be a mistake to view Pompeo\u2019s announcement as a complete break with US policy precedent. Again, as with so much of what the Trump administration has done over the past several years, this, too, marks less a rupture with the status quo than its unmasking. While the US government has long considered Israeli construction of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories a violation of international law on paper, it has done little to hold Israel\u2019s government meaningfully accountable in practice.</p> <p>In the past decade, perhaps the closest the US government came was the Obama administration\u2019s <em>abstention </em>from a 2016 United Nations security council resolution that condemned Israeli settlements as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/23/us-abstention-allows-un-to-demand-end-to-israeli-settlements\">flagrant violation</a>\u201d of international law. Just five years earlier, the Obama administration actually <em>vetoed</em> a similar resolution condemning Israeli settlement building \u2013 with a justification quite similar to the one offered by Pompeo in Monday\u2019s announcement.

Pompeo\u2019s announcement is, without doubt, a step beyond what previous administrations were willing to consider. But the difference between this decision and previous US decisions to disregard international law is a difference of degree, not kind.</p> <p>Which should be a warning to those who would like to see a just and equitable final status agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Even when Trump is gone, the forces that have doggedly worked to prevent the US from holding Israel accountable for its actions will remain. The views expressed in Pompeo\u2019s announcement are roughly shared, for instance, by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AIPAC/status/1196523841607983104\">powerful pro-Israel lobby Aipac</a> \u2013 which, though perhaps hard for some to believe, is facing criticism from the messianic-Zionist right for not <em>endorsing </em>outright Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank. (In fact, the positions of some of the Trump officials currently driving U.S policy on Israel-Palestine are also to the right of Aipac\u2019s stated positions: Ambassador Friedman, a <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-trump-s-israel-envoy-s-family-still-fundraising-for-west-bank-settlement-1.5453962\">prominent pro-settlement activist</a>, is an adamant opponent of a two-state solution, which Aipac nominally supports, at least for now.)</p> <p>Nor will the prospect of de jure annexation disappear, even if Netanyahu falls victim to a palace coup within his Likud party, resigns over indictments or loses a potential third round of elections.

      "body": "<p>Global carbon emissions from the aviation industry are growing faster than expected, and pose a serious risk to the world\u2019s climate efforts if left to grow unchecked. The rise of <em>flygskam</em>, or \u201cflight-shame\u201d, has spurred airlines and travel companies to offer customers the option of offsetting the carbon emissions of their flights. But not everyone is convinced that climate sins can be absolved through projects based on simple carbon accounting.</p> <h2><strong>What is carbon offsetting?</strong></h2> <p>Offsetting involves calculating the emissions of a trip or activity and then purchasing \u201ccredits\u201d from projects that prevent or remove the equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. Many accredited carbon offsetting schemes involve planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which according to recent research <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/04/planting-billions-trees-best-tackle-climate-crisis-scientists-canopy-emissions\">could play a major role in helping to tackle the climate crisis</a>. Other schemes invest in renewable energy projects which save carbon emissions by replacing fossil fuels alternatives. Growing awareness of the climate crisis, and the \u201cGreta Thunberg effect\u201d, has driven demand for carbon offset schemes. The amount of investment from people who hope to \u201ccancel\u201d their carbon footprints has climbed fourfold in recent years, according to the offsetting watchdog Gold Standard.</p> <h2><strong>Which companies do it</strong><strong>?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/19/easyjet-offset-carbon-emissions-flights-thomas-cook-collapse\">EasyJet\u2019s pledge to fly carbon neutral</a> follows a string of other airlines which hope to encourage passengers to keep flying despite climate concerns. At least 10 other airlines \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.airnewzealand.co.uk/sustainability-customer-carbon-offset\">Air New Zealand</a> and <a href=\"https://www.less.ca/en-ca/flights.cfm?auid=ac\">Air Canada</a> \u2013 offer carbon offsetting to their passengers.</p> <p>British Airways said this year that it plans to start offsetting the carbon from all its domestic flights from 2020. For passengers travelling further afield BA offers a carbon calculator and a range of accredited offset schemes to invest in. The schemes include reforestation in the Amazon basin and fitting low-smoke stoves in Sudan.</p> <p>Royal Dutch Shell offers drivers which fill up at its petrol stations in the UK and the Netherlands the chance to \u201cdrive carbon neutral\u201d at no extra cost by using carbon credits from conservation projects in Peru, Indonesia, the US and Britain.</p> <h2><strong>Why are airlines embracing offsetting?</strong></h2> <p>In short, airlines plan to use carbon offsetting to address the aviation\u2019s expanding carbon footprint while continuing to increase the number of flights they offer every year. The aviation industry plays a growing role in the climate crisis by releasing hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere every year. The global carbon emissions from commercial flights are rising up to 70% faster than predicted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/19/airlines-co2-emissions-rising-up-to-70-faster-than-predicted\">according to the International Council on Clean Transportation</a>, because of growing demand for air travel in developed countries.</p> <p>The group said emissions increased by a third between 2013 to 2018, the equivalent of building 50 coal-fired power plants, and may triple by 2050 if left unchecked. If airlines hope to avoid a backlash against the industry while still increasing the number of flights they operate, then offsetting is the quickest answer.</p> <p>Not all airlines have taken up carbon credits. American Airlines, the world\u2019s biggest airline, does not offer an offset scheme.

      "bodyText": "Global carbon emissions from the aviation industry are growing faster than expected, and pose a serious risk to the world\u2019s climate efforts if left to grow unchecked. The rise of flygskam, or \u201cflight-shame\u201d, has spurred airlines and travel companies to offer customers the option of offsetting the carbon emissions of their flights. But not everyone is convinced that climate sins can be absolved through projects based on simple carbon accounting. What is carbon offsetting? Offsetting involves calculating the emissions of a trip or activity and then purchasing \u201ccredits\u201d from projects that prevent or remove the equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. Many accredited carbon offsetting schemes involve planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which according to recent research could play a major role in helping to tackle the climate crisis. Other schemes invest in renewable energy projects which save carbon emissions by replacing fossil fuels alternatives. Growing awareness of the climate crisis, and the \u201cGreta Thunberg effect\u201d, has driven demand for carbon offset schemes. The amount of investment from people who hope to \u201ccancel\u201d their carbon footprints has climbed fourfold in recent years, according to the offsetting watchdog Gold Standard. Which companies do it? EasyJet\u2019s pledge to fly carbon neutral follows a string of other airlines which hope to encourage passengers to keep flying despite climate concerns. At least 10 other airlines \u2013 including Air New Zealand and Air Canada \u2013 offer carbon offsetting to their passengers. British Airways said this year that it plans to start offsetting the carbon from all its domestic flights from 2020. For passengers travelling further afield BA offers a carbon calculator and a range of accredited offset schemes to invest in. The schemes include reforestation in the Amazon basin and fitting low-smoke stoves in Sudan. Royal Dutch Shell offers drivers which fill up at its petrol stations in the UK and the Netherlands the chance to \u201cdrive carbon neutral\u201d at no extra cost by using carbon credits from conservation projects in Peru, Indonesia, the US and Britain. Why are airlines embracing offsetting? In short, airlines plan to use carbon offsetting to address the aviation\u2019s expanding carbon footprint while continuing to increase the number of flights they offer every year. The aviation industry plays a growing role in the climate crisis by releasing hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere every year. The global carbon emissions from commercial flights are rising up to 70% faster than predicted, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, because of growing demand for air travel in developed countries. The group said emissions increased by a third between 2013 to 2018, the equivalent of building 50 coal-fired power plants, and may triple by 2050 if left unchecked. If airlines hope to avoid a backlash against the industry while still increasing the number of flights they operate, then offsetting is the quickest answer. Not all airlines have taken up carbon credits. American Airlines, the world\u2019s biggest airline, does not offer an offset scheme. Instead, it has taken \u201cmany meaningful steps to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions\u201d such as buying new planes which are more fuel efficient. Do environmental groups support offsetting? Green groups are clear that the best way to reduce emissions from the aviation industry is to take fewer flights. Many fear that carbon offsetting may do more harm than good by offering airlines a licence to keep polluting and encouraging travellers to continue to choose the most polluting option. There is also concern among environmentalists that the confusing state of carbon accounting may mean that projects fall short of neutralising the damage caused by air travel in the first place. Greenpeace UK described easyJet\u2019s carbon offset scheme as \u201cjumbo-size greenwash\u201d and warned that expert analysis has cast serious doubts about whether offsetting schemes work at all. Instead, policymakers should put in place a frequent flier levy to curb the number of flights and their climate-wrecking emissions, Greenpeace said. Other groups have urged passengers to view carbon offsets as a last resort which can be used as a positive nudge to donate to green projects \u2013 not as a solution to the climate crisis. Which projects receive funding from offsetting? The early days of voluntary carbon offsetting were relatively unregulated and open to abuse. Today, a flurry of watchdogs have emerged to verify carbon offset schemes and projects which help to make the carbon savings. These include the American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, Plan Vivo and Verra, which offer many hundreds of projects for business and individuals to choose from. Gold Standard offers carbon offsets which help install low-smoke stoves in Rwanda and build wind power projects in Rajasthan, India. C-Level will offset carbon emissions by helping to restore grasslands in Mongolia and reducing deforestation in Tanzania.",

      "bodyText": "The digital election campaign is under way. Different audiences have been thoroughly A/B tested, and the parties have settled on some of their core messaging with the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats all having spent in excess of \u00a3100,000 on Facebook and Instagram campaigns to date. However, Facebook is not the only place that the parties are spending their money. Another online battleground we\u2019re exploring this week is Google search, where paid ads appear alongside certain keywords. Although there\u2019s often little scrutiny of these ads, they account for a significant amount of online spending \u2013 Labour has spent \u00a364,000 since the end of October, equivalent to almost half its Facebook spending. Parties are also spending their campaign funds on Snapchat, with its much younger audience, although that investment is significantly lower than their Facebook outlay. Labour: contrast in messages on different social networks The Labour party appears to have decided that, to reach young voters, it needs to do so outside Facebook, whose audience has become older over time. With this in mind the party has been producing adverts on Snapchat geared toward that social network\u2019s demographic (young adults) and style. One of two ads placed by Labour on Snapchat in the past week is a five-second clip with a remain message, superimposing rapid-fire wording promising a \u201cfinal say\u201d on Brexit over images of both the EU and union flag. To date Labour has spent \u00a3128,000 on Facebook and Instagram, compared with \u00a315,000 on Snapchat. The Tories are on Snapchat \u2026 but you couldn\u2019t tell by their messaging While Labour appears to have catered its messaging specifically for the younger audience of Snapchat, the Conservatives have opted to use much the same themes, and very similar ads, across social networks. Most of the adverts posted by the Tories on Facebook in the past week have been geared towards an older audience, with one exception being targeted at younger men comparing Labour\u2019s free broadband promise to dial-up internet. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that most people in these age groups would never have had to live through this pain, the image received fewer than 4,000 impressions over the weekend before being made inactive. Facebook and Instagram are much more attractive to the Conservatives: the party has spent \u00a3143,000 on Facebook to date, compared with \u00a33,200 on Snapchat. Liberal Democrats: many ads but just two messages Despite being a pro-remain party, and presumably needing to reach younger voters, the Liberal Democrats are yet to advertise on Snapchat during the campaign. Instead they\u2019re channelling their energy into two broad messages on Facebook. The first is a clear \u201cStop Brexit\u201d, and talks of a \u201c\u00a350bn remain bonus\u201d. The second involves the Liberal Democrats\u2019 love of bar charts to suggest they have a chance of winning seats. Labour targets Lib Dem voters on Google Labour has massively outspent the Tories on Google ads since the election was called, with \u00a364,000 worth of ads placed, compared with the Tories\u2019 \u00a312,500. The Lib Dems have placed no ads at all, according to Google\u2019s transparency tool. Labour has used the bulk of its ads to target potential Lib Dem voters. The party ran four ads with the slogan \u201cVote Lib Dem, get Boris Johnson\u201d, and three pushing the party\u2019s second referendum policy. By contrast just one took aim at the Conservatives explicitly. While Google\u2019s ad library displays all ads placed by political parties, Google does not say what keywords they were served on, thereby providing only half the picture. Through manual keyword searches the Guardian found that Brexit party ads appeared on a number of Labour-related search terms such as \u201cLabour party\u201d and \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u201d. The Brexit party spent \u00a3800 during the reporting period. Meanwhile the Tories have been playing defensively, using an ad to insist the NHS is \u201cnot for sale\u201d after reports of secret meetings with US drug companies. They\u2019ve also been attacking the Lib Dems, and placed an ad on searches related to postal vote registration which linked to a Conservative webpage. More importantly, the Conservatives also inspired the digital dashboard team to launch a new feature: tactical voting tip of the week. The Google ad library shows data for ads placed between 29 October and 11 November. Spending data covers 27 October to 10 November. The data was pulled from the ad library on 18 November.

      "bodyText": "An estimated 7,000 people have crammed together in the northern Italian city of Modena as part of a growing \u201csardines\u201d movement against the politics of the far-right leader, Matteo Salvini, in which opponents attempt to beat the numbers he draws to his rallies. Protesters converged under the rain at Piazza Grande on Monday night as the former interior minister campaigned in the city before crucial regional elections in Emilia-Romagna, a leftwing stronghold. It followed a gathering of an estimated 12,000-15,000 people in Bologna last Thursday night amid a heavy downpour to counteract the launch of a campaign by the League candidate, Lucia Bergonzoni, to vie for the presidency of Emilia-Romagna as part of an alliance with the smaller far-right party Brothers of Italy, and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia. The next demonstration is planned in the coastal city of Rimini on Sunday, where Salvini will inaugurate the League\u2019s regional headquarters. Salvini has pledged to \u201cfree Emilia-Romagna from the left\u201d in the elections on 26 January. The administration is under the control of the centre-left Democratic party, which is ruling nationally alongside the Five Star Movement. The sardines protests were devised by four friends from Bologna as a riposte to Salvini\u2019s boasts about filling Italy\u2019s squares with supporters. His coalition launched its campaign at an indoor sports arena in Bologna with the capacity to accommodate about 5,700 people. \u201cThe limit was already defined and so we decided to try to gather 6,000 people at Piazza Maggiore,\u201d Andrea Garreffa, one of the four friends, said. \u201cIn the end, between 12,000 and 15,000 people came.

      "bodyText": "Two former socialist presidents of the southern Spanish region of Andaluc\u00eda have been found guilty of misconduct and misuse of public funds over their roles in a decade-long, \u20ac680m (\u00a3582m) fraud that led to one of the country\u2019s biggest corruption trials. The verdicts will be acutely embarrassing for the Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) as its leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the acting prime minister, struggles to form a government after winning another inconclusive election nine days ago. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s awkward predicament is exacerbated by the fact that the PSOE came to power last year by seizing on a huge corruption case involving the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), which was previously in government. Twenty-one former PSOE officials stood trial in Seville over their involvement in the so-called ERE case, the Spanish acronym for a workforce dismissal plan. Prosecutors argued that two successive PSOE administrations in Andaluc\u00eda oversaw a corrupt scheme in which funds intended to help unemployed people and struggling companies were often diverted to individuals and businesses that were close to the PSOE. Between 2001 and 2010, the fund received \u20ac855m from the Andaluc\u00edan government. According to anti-corruption prosecutors, \u20ac680m was handed out fraudulently through a \u201ctotally opaque grants system\u201d that operated free of \u201call the established control mechanisms\u201d. Manuel Chaves, who was president of the regional government between 1990 and 2009 and chair of the PSOE from 2000 to 2012, was found guilty of misconduct and barred from holding office for nine years. His successor, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gri\u00f1\u00e1n, who stepped down in 2013 as news of the scam emerged, was found guilty of misconduct and misuse of public funds, jailed for six years and banned from office for 15 years. Seventeen of the other defendants were convicted of misconduct or misuse of public funds, or both, while two were acquitted. In their sentencing remarks, the judges said: \u201cThe political need to provide a rapid response to the big socio-labour conflicts led those in charge of the Andaluc\u00edan government to set up a flexible system \u2013 a system so flexible that it ended up doing away with the legally established control mechanisms.\u201d The sentencing will embarrass S\u00e1nchez, who said last year that the verdict in the G\u00fcrtel corruption case, which found that the PP benefited from an illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme, \u201cseriously damaged the health of our democracy\u201d. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s rivals were quick to accuse the acting prime minister of failing to tackle corruption within his own party, although the scandal predates S\u00e1nchez\u2019s tenure as PSOE leader, which began in 2014. \u201cNo regeneration, no progress, no dignity #YOUAREresponsibleS\u00e1nchez,\u201d the PP tweeted. Albert Rivera, who stepped down as leader of the centre-right Citizens party after its disastrous performance in this month\u2019s election, said the PSOE had \u201cstolen millions and millions of euros from the Spanish people\u201d. He added: \u201cAre you going to resign, Mr S\u00e1nchez? Yes or no?\u201d Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party, described the PSOE as \u201cthe most corrupt party in Europe\u201d. Pablo Iglesias, whose anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance has signed a preliminary agreement to enter into a coalition government with the PSOE, said the old two-party system had brought \u201ccorruption and arrogance\u201d. But he said Spain had changed and the opportunity had arisen to \u201cdefend social justice and guarantee the integrity of our institutions\u201d. Andaluc\u00eda, traditionally a PSOE stronghold, is now ruled by the PP and Citizens after they sought Vox\u2019s support in winning power after a regional election last December. Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, the PSOE\u2019s organisational secretary, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, said that the party had \u201cabsolute respect\u201d for the court\u2019s verdict and had never attempted to hide the wrongdoing in the region. But \u00c1balos also pointed out that the corruption had taken place between 2000 and 2010, adding: \u201cIt does not affect the current government nor the current party leadership.\u201d He said the verdict would help the PSOE draw a line under events \u201cthat the PP has tried to exploit for years by attempting to portray us as being as bad as them when it comes to corruption plots.\u201d",

And while Jesus may have been an early adopter, we can\u2019t blame Him for their popularity. Credit should actually go to the gods of Silicon Valley.

      "bodyText": "CupcakKe is a 22-year-old Chicago rapper famous for highly explicit sex-positive songs, including one about SpongeBob SquarePants. She has also been upfront about her various mental health issues. In September, CupcakKe (n\u00e9e Elizabeth Harris) abruptly announced she was retiring from music in an Instagram Live stream in which she said she was worried about \u201ccorrupting the youth\u201d and that the music industry would never accept her because of her size. After a hiatus from social media, CupcakKe reappeared last week. \u201cJesus fasted for 40 days &amp; so did I \u2026\u201d she posted on Twitter. She followed this a couple of days later with a picture of herself and the caption: \u201cWater fast for past month &amp; here\u2019s my results.\u201d Many of CupcakKe\u2019s more than 511,000 Twitter followers were alarmed at her drastic dieting \u2013 and told her as much. The British actor and activist Jameela Jamil, who seems to feel obliged to weigh in on every single body-image issue, swooped in to comment. \u201cPlease take this down,\u201d she urged. \u201cIt\u2019s just very unsafe.\u201d Jamil later apologised for being judgmental, telling CupcakKe: \u201cI should have done more to protect you rather than bring you stress.\u201d Jamil may have been somewhat insensitive, but she was right: fasting for a month is extremely unsafe \u2013 and advertising your extreme fast to hundreds of thousands of impressionable fans is irresponsible. Even more alarming is the fact that CupcakKe isn\u2019t the first celebrity to go on a water fast; they are very much in vogue. And while Jesus may have been an early adopter, we can\u2019t blame Him for their popularity. Credit should actually go to the gods of Silicon Valley. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s founder, has been vocal about his experiments with extreme fasting. And Pavel Durov, the founder of the messaging app Telegram, has also sung the praises of self-starvation. Male tech gurus, abetted by the media, have glamorised, monetised and rebranded eating disorders as some sort of innovative path to self-knowledge. But there\u2019s nothing innovative about starving yourself.",

The November CBI survey still largely indicates a manufacturing sector struggling in the face of soft domestic and foreign demand, and hampered by Brexit, domestic political and global economic uncertainties.</p> <p>The survey indicates that the manufacturing sector could well be a drag on UK GDP in the fourth quarter ...

That survey found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/24/survey-reveals-scale-of-sexual-harassment-at-lloyds-of-london\">nearly 500 people working in the insurance market had either suffered or observed sexual harassmen</a>t in the past 12 months \u2013 findings that the Lloyd\u2019s boss John Neal described as \u201ctruly terrible\u201d.</p> <p>The survey also found that 38% of respondents did not know who to raise concerns to in the Lloyd\u2019s market and only 45% of people felt comfortable enough to raise a concern.</p> <p>Seeking to address this, the new campaign aims to give clear guidance on what individuals should do if they see or experience unacceptable behaviour. Advertisements, banners and vinyl posters will feature prominently within the Lloyd\u2019s building in London as part of the campaign, together with easily accessible guides and online information (Lloyds.com/speakup). </p> <p>Neal said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At Lloyd\u2019s we expect all market participants to act with integrity, be respectful and always speak up.

I think everyone has a role to play.

Chinese state media described the latest discussions, held by phone over the weekend, as \u201cconstructive,\u201d but a report from CNBC suggested yesterday that the mood in Beijing was pessimistic. Doubts have crept in over whether a preliminary deal can be struck, and when.</p> <p>Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank\u2019 Asia Treasury Department in Singapore, told Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are some lingering doubts over whether a phase one deal can be struck. The suspicion is that there\u2019s a lot more wrinkles to iron out than initially thought.</p> </blockquote> <p>In a positive sign, the Trump administration issued a new 90-day extension allowing US companies to continue to do business with China\u2019s Huawei Technologies while US regulators work on rules on telecommunications firms that pose a risk to national security.</p> <p>The trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies has dragged on well for over a year. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the middle of next month, the Trump administration will introduce fresh tariffs on roughly $156bn worth of Chinese imports, unless something changes. Some traders are hoping phase one of the overall trade deal will be agreed upon by then so there will be no need to press ahead with new tariffs. </p> <p>Mr Trump would like more concessions from China in relation to intellectual property rights, but for now he doesn\u2019t want to reverse tariffs, but China are open to the idea of rolling back on the levies. The toing and froing of the trade spat will probably continue up until when the next round of US levies are set to kick in, and then we could see some constructive talks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asian stock markets are mixed \u2013 the Shanghai composite index gained 0.78%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 1.29% and the Australian market advanced 0.7%. Sentiment was lifted by hopes that Beijing will provide more stimulus after yesterday\u2019s rate cut from the People\u2019s Bank of China. </p> <p>However, other markets are down \u2013 Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.53%, as exporters came under pressure from a firmer yen against the dollar, while the South Korean Kospi slipped 0.34%.<br></p> <p>The pound has performed well as the Conservative Party is leading in the polls, and after Boris Johnson declared that all Tory candidates standing in next month\u2019s election had promised to back the deal he brokered with the EU.</p> <p>The pound is inching higher this morning, trading below $1.30 at $1.2959, following the prime minister\u2019s speech at the CBI\u2019s annual conference yesterday.

      "bodyText": "Over here, stock markets are also trading higher, although they are off their highs. Sentiment has been lifted by optimism that a US-China trade deal is still in the offing. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 66 points at 7,374.21, a 0.92% gain Germany\u2019s Dax up 109 points at 13,316.66, up 0.83% France\u2019s CAC up 4.45 points at 5,934/24, up 0.08% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 5.83 points at 23,459.03, down 0.01% The pound is slightly lower against the dollar and the euro, at $1.2942 and \u20ac1.1677. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones and Nasdaq opened at record highs \u2013 the Dow rose almost 44 points, or 0.16%, to 28,079.76 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 28.08 points, or 0.33%, to 8,578.02. Thank you for all your great comments. Good-bye \u2013 we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Ding Dong: The Dow Jones and Nasdaq have hit new record highs. The Dow opened almost 36 points, or 0.13% higher, at 28,072.10, while the Nasdaq advanced 27 points, or 0.32%, to 8,577.07. The figures will help dispel any recession fears. The US housing market has perked up in recent months, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times. Fears that the US economy could slide into recession have receded in recent months as trade tensions with China have eased. There are hopes that a preliminary trade deal can be agreed soon between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. The latest US housing data are out, and they are strong. Housebuilding rebounded in October and the number of permits for future home construction jumped 5% to 1.46m, the highest level since May 2007. The number of homes on which construction started rose 3.8% to 1.31m last month, according to the US Commerce Department. Indian-owned Tata Steel, the owner of the Port Talbot steelworks, plans to cut 3,000 jobs across Europe \u2013 but unions in Britain and the Netherlands have vowed to fight the plans. Tata announced the cuts late last night as the steel industry struggles with weak demand and high costs. In June, competition authorities blocked a joint venture with Germany\u2019s Thyssenkrupp. Unions in Britain and the Netherlands said they had been given a jobs guarantee until 2021 following the collapse of that deal. Frits van Wieringen, President of Tata Steel\u2019s European works council, said it would take time to work out detail, but warned of \u201ca very serious confrontation in the Netherlands\u201d. There is no justification whatsoever to cut over 1,500 jobs here, and it will be impossible to find any kind of compromise over that. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the British steelworkers union Community, said British workers would also be \u201crobustly defending\u201d the 2021 jobs agreement. Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, also weighed in, saying: This is terrible news for Tata Steel workers, made all the worse coming just before Christmas. This Conservative government has failed to support our manufacturing industry and people are paying for that failure with their livelihoods. It speaks volumes that the business secretary Andrea Leadsom cancelled a meeting with the steel industry only last month. They just don\u2019t care. Labour will bring the real change our country needs through investment and confidence in our domestic industry. Here is a quick round-up of today\u2019s corporate news. An independent report by a law firm into TSB\u2019s IT meltdown in 2018 has found the bank\u2019s board lacked \u201ccommon sense\u201d and shifted customers to a new IT platform before it had been fully tested. EasyJet has outlined its ambition to become the world\u2019s first major airline to operate net-zero carbon flights across its entire network, announcing it would offset all emissions. The UK government is set to wave through the \u00a34bn takeover of the British defence company Cobham by Advent after the US private equity group made legally binding promises to address national security concerns. Here is some reaction to the CBI industrial trends survey, which showed some signs of improvement in manufacturers\u2019 order books in recent weeks, as the risk of a no-deal Brexit faded. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, says: The report does little to inspire confidence that better times lie just around the corner for manufacturing sector. The November CBI survey still largely indicates a manufacturing sector struggling in the face of soft domestic and foreign demand, and hampered by Brexit, domestic political and global economic uncertainties. The survey indicates that the manufacturing sector could well be a drag on UK GDP in the fourth quarter ... This reinforces our suspicion that GDP growth is likely to be limited to just 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter. Aston Martin is gearing up for the launch of its first-ever sports utility vehicle, the DBX, in Beijing tomorrow. It will be manufactured at the British luxury carmaker\u2019s new factory in St Athan in Wales, where more than 300 people are working. The carmaker said the car had met with a positive reception from customers so far, and it will start delivering it to clients from the second quarter of next year. The DBX costs \u00a3158,000, sitting between the Bentley Bentayga and Lamborghini Urus. Lloyd\u2019s of London, the world\u2019s oldest and biggest insurance market, has launched a #SpeakUp campaign to encourage more people to speak up against unacceptable behaviour. The organisation, which dates back to 1686, was forced to act after Bloomberg reported evidence from 18 women of widespread sexual harassment ranging from inappropriate remarks to physical assault. Lloyd\u2019s immediately responded by setting up a bullying and harassment helpline in April, and commissioned a survey to gauge the scale of the problems. That survey found nearly 500 people working in the insurance market had either suffered or observed sexual harassment in the past 12 months \u2013 findings that the Lloyd\u2019s boss John Neal described as \u201ctruly terrible\u201d. The survey also found that 38% of respondents did not know who to raise concerns to in the Lloyd\u2019s market and only 45% of people felt comfortable enough to raise a concern. Seeking to address this, the new campaign aims to give clear guidance on what individuals should do if they see or experience unacceptable behaviour. Advertisements, banners and vinyl posters will feature prominently within the Lloyd\u2019s building in London as part of the campaign, together with easily accessible guides and online information (Lloyds.com/speakup). Neal said: At Lloyd\u2019s we expect all market participants to act with integrity, be respectful and always speak up. I hope this campaign encourages more people to do so. You will be heard, you will be supported, and we will act, because no matter what form it takes, harassment is never acceptable. The ambition here is to make a positive difference in many people\u2019s lives, by empowering individuals to act and intervene when they witness unacceptable behaviour. I think everyone has a role to play. Lloyd\u2019s leadership is fully committed to transforming the culture at Lloyd\u2019s with shared values that will shape the behaviours, choices and actions of everyone in the marketplace. Lloyd\u2019s has also banned daytime drinking at its in-house bar, One Under Lime. Around 45,000 people work in the market \u2013 thousands of brokers and underwriters who are employed by 100 insurers and 300 broking firms, as well as 1,000 staff directly employed by Lloyd\u2019s. The latest fall in output volumes was mainly driven by motor vehicles and metal products, while mechanical engineering, plastic products and aerospace have fared better and made positive contributions to output. Looking ahead, firms overall anticipate production to be flat in the next three months. The CBI said growth across the UK economy has been volatile this year as businesses were forced to shift activity in response to moving Brexit deadlines (the first deadline of 29 March was extended to 31 October, which in turn has been extended until 31 January). We expect the economy to grow modestly in the event of a smooth transition to a new Brexit deal, with the longer-term economic impact dependent upon the details within the final deal. The survey of 307 manufacturers also found that export orders continued to fall, with the monthly balance at -22%, an improvement from the -41% registered in October. A gauge of factory output over the past three months was -9%, similar to October\u2019s -10%. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s deputy chief economist, said: While the thick fog of uncertainty from a No Deal Brexit has lifted somewhat, the manufacturing sector remains under pressure from weak global trade and a subdued domestic economy. Order books remain below average, and output volumes continue to fall. When taking into account the deteriorating outlook for manufacturing globally, it\u2019s clear that the outlook for the sector remains precarious. The general election is an opportunity for all parties to explain how they will shore up our economy. Ratifying a Brexit deal and moving on to build a vibrant future relationship with our biggest trading partner, based on frictionless trade, will be vital \u2013 both for UK manufacturers, and business as a whole. The CBI industrial trends survey is out. It suggests British manufacturers enjoyed a pick-up in orders in November, after hitting a nine-year low the month before, as the risk of a no-deal Brexit receded. The survey showed 13% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal while 40% said they were below normal this month, resulting in a net balance of -26%, up from -37% in October. It remains below the long-run average of -13%. Goldman Sachs is predicting that the drag on the global economy from the trade war between the US and China \u2013 the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 will gradually fade next year. Jan Hatzius and other economists at the US investment bank wrote in a note yesterday that the progress towards a partial trade deal and expectations of an extended truce should benefit the world economy \u2013 assuming there is no further escalation of tariffs. The US is due to impose more tariffs on Chinese goods on 15 December, if an agreement is not struck by then. The 18-month trade war is currently shaving 0.5 percentage points from the growth rates in both the US and China, the Goldman Sachs economists estimate. Traders are buying back into the market despite a lack of progress in the US-China trade talks \u2013 but people are clearly hoping for a deal sometime soon. Comments from China\u2019s central bank governor Yi Gang are also providing a fillip to stock markets. He has just promised to step up credit support to the economy and push real lending rates lower. This comes after the People\u2019s Bank of China cut its short-term funding rate for the first time since 2015 yesterday to prop up the economy. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, has sent us his thoughts on the \u201cbull market\u201d and tonight\u2019s TV clash. European markets are rallying and US futures are already pointing to solid gains, as risk appetite comes storming back following a mixed session yesterday. It is almost as if this is still a bull market. Disturbances in Hong Kong have failed to dent the bullish view, and with trade wars still mercifully quiet the indices appear to have taken the bit between their teeth \u2013 European indices are surging in impressive fashion, and even the FTSE 100 is powering higher. Today sees the first clash on TV between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson, a discussion likely to generate more heat than light. Both leaders know their polling has picked up of late, and will want to continue that move, while the poor Lib Dems will have to wait for another way of boosting their flagging position. There is still plenty of time to go, but one imagines Conservative Central Office will be very pleased with the overall position so far. The pound, meanwhile, is not doing very much after yesterday\u2019s gains, boosted by the Conservative party\u2019s lead in the polls. Against the dollar, sterling has slipped 0.02% to $1.2952 this morning. Tonight we will get the first TV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn (8pm GMT on ITV). The rally on stock markets is gathering pace. The FTSE 100 in London is now 1.08% higher, at 7,386.73, a gain of almost 80 points. The Dax in Frankfurt has gained 1.23% to 13,368.34. The CAC 40 in Paris is up 0.55% and the FTSE MiB in Milan is 0.78% ahead. Pierre Veyret, technical analyst at trading platform ActivTrades has looked at the rally in European shares. European markets are trading significantly higher, led by miners and the travel and leisure sector, despite a mixed trading session in Asia. Global sentiment remains bullish on stocks as investors look for further positive signs from the trade talks. Investors have already priced a trade deal in with many benchmarks around the world now hitting record prices and P/E ratio levels. This could be a dangerous situation for bull traders if negotiations between Beijing and Washington slow down as many traders have already bought the rumour. Today, investors\u2019 focus will be drawn to both US building permits data as well as the first televised leadership debate in the UK, prior to December\u2019s general election. Russ Mould, investment director at the UK stockbroker AJ Bell, says the move shows the aviation sector is under real pressure to address its environmental impact. Regular fliers often fret about their carbon footprint so EasyJet\u2019s move, at a significant but not unmanageable cost of \u00a325m a year, could pay off. Well, at least if it is seen as a genuine strategy and not just window dressing. The news comes hot on the heels of Wizz Air CEO Jozsef Varadi\u2019s call for a ban on business class \u2013 the Hungarian-based outfit styles itself as Europe\u2019s greenest airline. Clearly the industry sees itself coming under more pressure in the future and is trying to get one step ahead as climate change becomes an increasingly important issue for politicians, regulators and the public. EasyJet\u2019s move is laudable, but there are some doubts over its \u00a325m cost estimate. Back to easyJet\u2019s pledge to become \u201cthe world\u2019s first major net zero carbon airline\u201d. Amazingly, it will only cost \u00a325m to offset carbon emissions from the fuel used for all flights in the year to 30 September 2020. So why are not more airlines doing this? EasyJet says in today\u2019s results statement: Carbon offsetting is an interim measure and we will continue the push to reinvent aviation for the long-term, including development of sustainable fuel and electric flying. Global shares are pushing higher again as traders bet on a trade deal between the US and China. The clock is ticking, though \u2013 a preliminary deal needs to be agreed before 15 December, when Washington is due to impose a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, edged up 0.1% to its highest level since January last year. The broad Euro Stoxx 600 index advanced 0.4% to hit its highest level since July 2015. Germany\u2019s Dax is now 0.59% ahead while the FTSE 100 index in London has advanced 0.71%. Wall Street futures are pointing to a higher open on the other side of the Atlantic, rising 0.2%. EasyJet shares have also gained 4%, to \u00a313.26, despite a 26% drop in pretax profits to \u00a3427m for the year to 30 September. The budget airline carried record passenger numbers but blamed weaker confidence due to Brexit uncertainty for a 1.8% fall in revenue per seat. EasyJet is relaunching its package holiday business to boost customer numbers following the collapse of its rival Thomas Cook. EasyJet Holidays will offer beach and city holidays through the airline\u2019s network. Chief executive Johan Lundgren said: I am really thrilled that with the launch before Christmas of our brand new EasyJet Holidays business, we are bringing flexibility and excellent value to the holiday market. We believe there is a gap in the market for a modern, relevant and flexible business for today\u2019s consumer. The company also unveiled plans to become the \u201cfirst major airline to operate net-zero carbon flights\u201d. Cobham shares rose more than 4% on the news, and are now trading 3.9% higher at 160.8p. The FTSE 100 index has pushed almost 40 points higher to 7,346.31, a gain of 0.53%. European stock markets are also rising. Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.37% at 13,255.47 France\u2019s CAC up 0.14% at 5,939.92 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.38% at 23,552.01 There is news on the planned \u00a34bn takeover of the UK defence firm Cobham by the US private equity group Advent. The UK government now suggests that it is minded to allow the deal, after Advent made several legally binding undertakings such as placing a number of British executives on the defence company\u2019s different boards. Andrea Leadsom, the business minister, put the deal on hold in mid-September and ordered an investigation into whether the sale poses a national security threat. Cobham, based in Dorset, is a world leader producing systems for planes to refuel in mid-air. Shareholders had approved the sale of Cobham, established 85 years ago by the aviation pioneer Sir Alan Cobham, against the wishes of the founding family, which owns 1.5% of the company. Boston-based Advent has pledged to give prior notice to the Ministry of December if it plans to sell all or parts of Cobham, and to honour existing contracts with the government. Leadsom said she would hold a consultation on the proposals until 17 December. European stock markets are up \u2013 UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 19 points at 7,326.73, a 0.26% gain Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.3% France\u2019s CAC up 0.2% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.4% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.2% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The waiting game continues for the US-China trade deal. Chinese state media described the latest discussions, held by phone over the weekend, as \u201cconstructive,\u201d but a report from CNBC suggested yesterday that the mood in Beijing was pessimistic. Doubts have crept in over whether a preliminary deal can be struck, and when. Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank\u2019 Asia Treasury Department in Singapore, told Reuters: There are some lingering doubts over whether a phase one deal can be struck. The suspicion is that there\u2019s a lot more wrinkles to iron out than initially thought. In a positive sign, the Trump administration issued a new 90-day extension allowing US companies to continue to do business with China\u2019s Huawei Technologies while US regulators work on rules on telecommunications firms that pose a risk to national security. The trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies has dragged on well for over a year. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: In the middle of next month, the Trump administration will introduce fresh tariffs on roughly $156bn worth of Chinese imports, unless something changes. Some traders are hoping phase one of the overall trade deal will be agreed upon by then so there will be no need to press ahead with new tariffs. Mr Trump would like more concessions from China in relation to intellectual property rights, but for now he doesn\u2019t want to reverse tariffs, but China are open to the idea of rolling back on the levies. The toing and froing of the trade spat will probably continue up until when the next round of US levies are set to kick in, and then we could see some constructive talks. Asian stock markets are mixed \u2013 the Shanghai composite index gained 0.78%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 1.29% and the Australian market advanced 0.7%. Sentiment was lifted by hopes that Beijing will provide more stimulus after yesterday\u2019s rate cut from the People\u2019s Bank of China. However, other markets are down \u2013 Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.53%, as exporters came under pressure from a firmer yen against the dollar, while the South Korean Kospi slipped 0.34%. The pound has performed well as the Conservative Party is leading in the polls, and after Boris Johnson declared that all Tory candidates standing in next month\u2019s election had promised to back the deal he brokered with the EU. The pound is inching higher this morning, trading below $1.30 at $1.2959, following the prime minister\u2019s speech at the CBI\u2019s annual conference yesterday. He will square up to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in the first televised election debate tonight at 8pm on ITV. European stocks are expected to open slightly higher, close to the record highs struck recently.

      "bodyText": "Pressure is mounting on the Lake District national park to reconsider its decision to allow off-road cars and motorbikes on farm tracks that campaigners say is devastating the tranquillity of the area. England\u2019s largest national park has received a highly critical letter from advisers to Unesco, which granted it world heritage status in 2017 after a 20-year campaign. The problem is particularly acute in Tilberthwaite valley and the valleys surrounding the villages of Little Langdale and Elterwater, and local people have been lobbying for a ban with the backing of the National Trust and a petition signed by more than 350,000 people. Despite this, in October the Lake District National Park Authority (LDNPA) decided to continue allowing recreational off-road vehicles on dozens of farm tracks on this land \u2013 much of it once owned by Beatrix Potter and described by Alfred Wainwright as \u201cthe loveliest in Lakeland\u201d. The authority has received a letter from the International Council on Monuments and Sites (Icomos), the body that advises Unesco on protecting world heritage sites. It says the impact of these vehicles \u201cis not limited to the material aspects of the roads and their erosion but also on the character and tranquillity of the landscape\u201d. \u201cIcomos states that the traffic regulation orders (TROs), which have been available to national parks to remove the right to use motorised vehicles on certain \u2018green\u2019 roads since 2006, appear to be an appropriate tool to deal with the impact,\u201d it adds.

An official report in October showed people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were likely to be targeted under relaxed stop-and-search rules, despite not having committed crimes. The equality impact assessment also suggested \u201cchanges in the level of stop and search have, at best, only minimal effects on violent crime\u201d.

Australian Timothy Weeks, 50, and Kevin King, 63, an American, were handed over to US forces in southern Zabul province and transported from the area by helicopter, putting an end to more than three years in captivity. The prisoner swap was supposed to have taken place last week but was aborted for reasons that are still unclear. The release of the two westerners, who were teachers at Kabul\u2019s American University of Afghanistan, was confirmed on Tuesday by Taliban officials and by Imran Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan, who said his government had helped to facilitate the exchange. King\u2019s family issued a statement saying he was safe with US officials in Afghanistan and getting the medical care he needed ahead of his return home to be reunited with his family.

Weeks, from the New South Wales town of Wagga Wagga, and King, from Pennsylvania, were abducted at gunpoint from a car in August 2016.

US Navy Seals conducted a raid to free them days later, descending on a militant hideout in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan, but the men had been moved hours earlier, according to reports. The pair appeared looking gaunt and weathered in a video released in January 2017 begging their parents to ask the US government to negotiate for their release. They appeared in a second video later that year, setting a June 2017 deadline for their release, in which Weeks pleaded with the then Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to negotiate for his release. Both men said they were being treated well by the Taliban but that they would remain prisoners unless their governments could negotiate their freedom. It is unknown whether the men had been forced to speak. The Taliban released a statement in October of that year claiming King was suffering from a \u201cdangerous heart and kidney disease\u201d. \u201cWe have tried to treat him from time to time, but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,\u201d the Taliban statement said. A Taliban commander in eastern Afghanistan previously told the Guardian the group considered teachers at the American University of Afghanistan dangerous as they \u201cchange the minds of society\u201d. Khan said Pakistan welcomed the release of the men and hoped it would give \u201ca boost of confidence to all parties involved to re-engage in the peace process\u201d. The American University of Afghanistan said in a statement it \u201cshares the relief of the families of Kevin and Timothy, and we look forward to providing all the support we can to Kevin and Tim and their families\u201d. Southern Zabul province, where the two professors were freed, is heavily controlled by the Taliban and vast parts of it have long been a no-go area for the government. According to the Taliban, an unofficial ceasefire is being observed in three districts of the province \u2013 Shahjoy, Shahmatzo and Naw Bahar \u2013 possibly to facilitate the release of the two hostages. The Haqqani group predates the Taliban but has become integrated into its structure, and is suspected of having carried out some of the most brutal and indiscriminate attacks over the course of the nearly two decades of war that have followed the 2001 US-led invasion. Besides a statement in 2017 saying that the Australian government was \u201cworking to secure the release of an Australian man in Afghanistan\u201d, very little has been said publicly, and no public campaigns by the family or otherwise have been made regarding their cases. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the US national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, made separate calls to Ghani on Monday to discuss the prisoners\u2019 release, Ghani\u2019s spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, said. The release and swap were intended to try to restart talks to end Afghanistan\u2019s 18-year war and allow for the eventual withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. The US had been close to an agreement with the Taliban in September but a fresh wave of violence in the Afghan capital in which a US soldier died brought talks and any impending deal to a halt. The agreement was to call for direct talks between the Taliban and Afghan government as well as other prominent Afghans to find a negotiated end to the war and to set out a roadmap for a peaceful post-conflict Afghanistan.

Background The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said the Tories would change the law to ensure an adult convicted of the premeditated murder of a child is sentenced to a \u201cwhole life\u201d order, meaning they will never be eligible for parole. It is part of the party\u2019s attempt to be seen to be \u201ctough on crime\u201d \u2013 one of the most important issues for both Tory and Labour voters after Brexit and health, according to the psephologist John Curtice. There are 63 murderers being held in jail in England and Wales until their death, including Rosemary West, Levi Bellfield and Thomas Mair, who killed the Labour MP Jo Cox shortly before the EU referendum, according to the ministry of justice. Under the 2003 Criminal Justice Act, judges can already hand down whole life tariffs as the starting point of their sentencing for child murderers but only if it involves \u201cabduction of the child or sexual or sadistic motivation\u201d. The Tories say this is too restrictive and there should be no exceptions. One person whose sentence would have been affected by the Tory proposal is Ian Huntley, who murdered Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both aged 10, in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in 2002. He was sentenced one day after the 2003 act came into force but the judge ruled that he did not meet the \u201cwhole life\u201d criteria. Huntley was instead given a minimum life sentence with no eligibility for parole until 2042. Under the Tory plans, people such as Huntley would leave prison only after they died. Reality Child murder is rare. According to the latest Office for National Statistics figures, there were 67 victims of homicide under the age of 16 in the year ending March 2018.

A quarter of victims were killed by a parent or step-parent and previously analysis has consistently shown that children aged under one are disproportionately represented in national homicide figures. The 2018 figure includes six children killed in the Manchester Arena terrorist attack, and no suspects had been identified in 28 cases. This leaves 33 cases with known killers or suspects, and some of these cases may have been manslaughter. Verdict A change in the law is unlikely to change the execution of justice in England and Wales because there are so few child murder cases. But it will deliver plenty of headlines that feed into the \u201ctough on crime\u201d election narrative.",

      "bodyText": "Children as young as 11 are working aboard Vietnamese vessels fishing illegally for seafood that could end up on sale in supermarkets in the EU and US, according to an investigation by the Environmental Justice Foundation. The children were discovered on boats detained by Thai authorities for fishing illegally in Thai waters, thousands of miles from their homes. A report by the environmental group also found a lack of catch documentation or verification systems on Vietnamese vessels to determine the origin of seafood. Vietnam is the world\u2019s fourth largest seafood exporter, with one of the fastest-growing fishing fleets. It sends products such as shrimp to 170 countries, and in 2017 it exported $8.5bn (\u00a36.5bn) worth of seafood, with the top export destinations being the EU, followed by the US. The country aims to increase exports to $10.5bn this year. Steve Trent, the director of the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), whose members have accompanied Thai police on patrols against illegal fishing in the Gulf of Thailand, said: \u201cIt is not every vessel that has a child on board. But we are hearing the same things over and over from the crew: \u2018we shouldn\u2019t be out here, but there\u2019s no fish at home\u2019. \u201cIn Vietnam, we\u2019ve found kids on board and we\u2019ve found them fishing in areas they shouldn\u2019t be. You have 108,000 vessels in Vietnam. That\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d A total of 12 children were found to be working across the 41 vessels surveyed by EJF. Many of them were relatives of the crew. One, who worked as a cook, said he had been promised a small fee on his return home. All forms of child labour on long-distance boats is illegal in Vietnam. Crew testimony gathered by EJF suggests that depleted fish populations and uncontrolled fishing fleet expansion have led to vessels being forced to fish illegally. Vessel captains, who were among more than 200 fishermen surveyed by EJF researchers, said boat owners had encouraged them to fish in the waters of neighbouring countries.

The number of vessels with large engines of over 400 horsepower has also increased by 30% between 2016 and 2018. Recently, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime ranked Vietnam the fifth worst offender for overfishing and illegal and unregulated fishing, behind China, Taiwan, Cambodia and Russia.

If you are buying Vietnamese prawns, there is every chance it is unsustainable and illegally caught and there\u2019s also a chance it could have been caught by kids. How do you know you are not getting that product?\u201d The report recommended that seafood companies, processors and retailers audit their supply chains to ensure their products do not come from vessels using child labour. Vietnam, which was issued with a \u201cyellow card\u201d warning by the EU over wild-caught seafood exports in 2017, has introduced new legislation to combat overfishing, including installation of vessel monitoring systems on vessels. However, poor implementation of reforms as well as years of neglect and a domestic fishery in steep decline had hampered progress, the report said, putting the country at risk of trade sanctions.

One said that although there was \u201cno credible evidence to suggest the Holocaust did not happen \u2026 I do find some of the events fabricated\u201d.</p> <p>He was also quoted as saying he did not see how homosexuality was good for the human race, that Islam\u2019s core teachings had the goal of \u201cworld domination\u201d and that some Muslims had big families with the aim of creating \u201cEurabia\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: \u201cThe comments contained in these blogs are unacceptable and Mr Houghton has been suspended as a member of the Scottish Conservative party as a result. The party has also withdrawn its support for his candidacy in Aberdeen North. The Scottish Conservatives deplore all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and antisemitism.\u201d</p> <p>Houghton said in a statement: \u201cAt the age of 20 on an online forum, I took part in a range of political discussions. These included terrorism, LGBT rights and antisemitism.\u201d</p> <p>He said that in one of the threads he had discussed freedom of speech and comments made by the Holocaust denier David Irving, referencing his view that some evidence had been fabricated. Houghton said he made clear in subsequent posts that he was not defending the views and strongly opposed Holocaust denial.</p> <p>The candidate added: \u201cI apologise unreservedly for any hurt now caused by these comments and have been in contact with members of the Jewish community in Aberdeen.\u201d</p> <p>Although the Conservatives have removed their support for Houghton, he will remain as their candidate on the ballot because his nomination papers have already been submitted.</p> <p>The Labour peer Alf Dubs said: \u201cAs someone who survived the Holocaust, I feel sickened that there will be a Conservative party candidate on the ballot paper on 12 December who claimed events in the Holocaust were fabricated. The Conservatives must face up to their problem with antisemitism. Instead of using the issue to score political points, they should challenge it in their own ranks.\u201d</p> <p>Aberdeen North was won in 2017 by the SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman, with Labour in second place.</p> <p>Separately, the Conservative candidate in Ashfield, Lee Anderson, has been criticised for saying \u201cnuisance tenants\u201d should be forced to pick vegetables and live in a tent in a field.</p> <p>In a Facebook video, he said: \u201cWhat I am about to say is my own personal opinion. I stood on this spot a few months ago, banging on about nuisance tenants on this lovely estate. People say to me: \u2018But they\u2019ve got to live somewhere.\u2019 That\u2019s right, so my plan would be \u2013 and again, this is just my own personal opinion \u2013 that these people who have to live somewhere, let\u2019s have them in a tent in the middle of a field.</p> <p>\u201cSix o\u2019clock every morning, let\u2019s have them up, let\u2019s have them in the field, picking potatoes or any other seasonal vegetables, back in the tent, cold shower, lights out, six o\u2019clock. Same again the next day. That would be my solution.\u201d</p> <p>Layla Moran, a spokeswoman for the Liberal Democrats, said: \u201cEveryone in this country deserves a decent standard of living. Conservative candidate Lee Anderson\u2019s comment exposes a concerning disregard for this basic human right, and a lack of empathy towards those whom he aspires to represent.</p> <p>\u201cAs a Conservative parliamentary candidate in a marginal seat, Anderson should not be stoking and entrenching division, or targeting vulnerable people. Unfortunately, this sort of comment is all too common from Conservative party candidates, who are out of touch with the constituencies and the people they are attempting to represent.\u201d</p>",

One said that although there was \u201cno credible evidence to suggest the Holocaust did not happen \u2026 I do find some of the events fabricated\u201d. He was also quoted as saying he did not see how homosexuality was good for the human race, that Islam\u2019s core teachings had the goal of \u201cworld domination\u201d and that some Muslims had big families with the aim of creating \u201cEurabia\u201d. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: \u201cThe comments contained in these blogs are unacceptable and Mr Houghton has been suspended as a member of the Scottish Conservative party as a result. The party has also withdrawn its support for his candidacy in Aberdeen North. The Scottish Conservatives deplore all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and antisemitism.\u201d Houghton said in a statement: \u201cAt the age of 20 on an online forum, I took part in a range of political discussions. These included terrorism, LGBT rights and antisemitism.\u201d He said that in one of the threads he had discussed freedom of speech and comments made by the Holocaust denier David Irving, referencing his view that some evidence had been fabricated. Houghton said he made clear in subsequent posts that he was not defending the views and strongly opposed Holocaust denial. The candidate added: \u201cI apologise unreservedly for any hurt now caused by these comments and have been in contact with members of the Jewish community in Aberdeen.\u201d Although the Conservatives have removed their support for Houghton, he will remain as their candidate on the ballot because his nomination papers have already been submitted. The Labour peer Alf Dubs said: \u201cAs someone who survived the Holocaust, I feel sickened that there will be a Conservative party candidate on the ballot paper on 12 December who claimed events in the Holocaust were fabricated. The Conservatives must face up to their problem with antisemitism. Instead of using the issue to score political points, they should challenge it in their own ranks.\u201d Aberdeen North was won in 2017 by the SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman, with Labour in second place. Separately, the Conservative candidate in Ashfield, Lee Anderson, has been criticised for saying \u201cnuisance tenants\u201d should be forced to pick vegetables and live in a tent in a field. In a Facebook video, he said: \u201cWhat I am about to say is my own personal opinion. I stood on this spot a few months ago, banging on about nuisance tenants on this lovely estate. People say to me: \u2018But they\u2019ve got to live somewhere.\u2019 That\u2019s right, so my plan would be \u2013 and again, this is just my own personal opinion \u2013 that these people who have to live somewhere, let\u2019s have them in a tent in the middle of a field. \u201cSix o\u2019clock every morning, let\u2019s have them up, let\u2019s have them in the field, picking potatoes or any other seasonal vegetables, back in the tent, cold shower, lights out, six o\u2019clock. Same again the next day. That would be my solution.\u201d Layla Moran, a spokeswoman for the Liberal Democrats, said: \u201cEveryone in this country deserves a decent standard of living. Conservative candidate Lee Anderson\u2019s comment exposes a concerning disregard for this basic human right, and a lack of empathy towards those whom he aspires to represent. \u201cAs a Conservative parliamentary candidate in a marginal seat, Anderson should not be stoking and entrenching division, or targeting vulnerable people. Unfortunately, this sort of comment is all too common from Conservative party candidates, who are out of touch with the constituencies and the people they are attempting to represent.\u201d",

In an attempt to overturn two criminal convictions for escaping from the Maze prison in 1973 and 1974, lawyers for the 71-year-old are challenging the way he was originally held under emergency legislation. Adams, who has always denied being a member of the IRA, was taken into custody under article 4 of the Detention of Terrorists (Northern Ireland) Order 1972, which covered anyone whom the secretary of state for Northern Ireland \u201csuspected of having been concerned in the commission or attempted commission of any act of terrorism\u201d. The regulations required that Northern Ireland secretary be involved personally in making any such decision. Documents released to the public records office under the 30 years rule have since revealed that the government knew there had been a procedural irregularity in relation to the detention of Adams and other republican detainees who had tried to escape with him from the heavily guarded internment camp. A note for the record found in the files, dated 17 July 1974, related a meeting held by the then Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, called to consider \u201can urgent problem which the attorney general had brought to his attention\u201d. The note explained that \u201cfollowing a recent attempt to escape by four prisoners [a reference to Adams and others] from the Maze, an examination of the papers concerning those prisoners revealed that applications for interim custody orders concerning three of them had not been examined personally by the previous secretary of state for Northern Ireland during the Conservative administration. \u201cIt now appeared that the [previous] Conservative administration had left both tasks to junior ministers in the Northern Ireland office and, according to [the attorney general\u2019s] information, there might be as many as 200 persons unlawfully detained in Northern Ireland.\u201d Adams\u2019 order was signed by a minister of state. Adams, who now sits as a Sinn F\u00e9in TD for Louth in the Irish Dail, was not present at the supreme court hearing in London which was heard by five justices including the lord chief justice of England and Wales, Lord Burnett. Lord Kerr, a former lord chief justice of Northern Ireland, presided. Adams was first interned in March 1972 and was released in June that year to take part in secret talks with the Conservative government in London. More than 1,900 suspects were interned in the early years of the Troubles as violence spiralled out of control. Those held were overwhelmingly nationalists or republicans; not all were members of paramilitary organisations. Adams was rearrested in July 1973 in Belfast and taken to the Maze, also known as Long Kesh idetention centre. On Christmas Eve 1973 he was one of four detainees caught attempting to break out. A hole had been cut in a perimeter fence and all four men were already out of the prison. His second escape attempt, in July 1974, was a more elaborate scheme involving kidnapping a man who had a striking resemblance to him from a bus stop in west Belfast. The man was taken to a house where his hair was dyed and he was given a false beard, the lower courts in Belfast were told. His double was driven to the Maze where the plan was that he would be swapped for Adams in a visiting hut. Prison staff had been alerted, however, and Adams was arrested in the car park of the jail. He was later sentenced to 18 months in jail for the first escape attempt and an additional three years for the second attempt, after two separate trials before single judges sitting without a jury. Presenting Adams\u2019 appeal at the supreme court, Sean Doran QC said: \u201cEverything goes back to the original order \u2026 We would ask the court to rule that those convictions are now unsafe.\u201d The supreme court has been asked to decide whether it was parliament\u2019s intention that only the secretary of state for Northern Ireland should have the power to make an interim custody order. The director of public prosecutions for Northern Ireland, who is the respondent in the case, has successfully argued in the Northern Ireland courts that the Carltona principle \u2013 based on a 1943 test case \u2013 allows that \u201cwhere parliament specifies that a decision is to be taken by a specified minister, generally that decision may be taken by an appropriate person on behalf of the minister.\u201d The hearing continues.

Scientists and humanitarian officials say this year\u2019s record Indian Ocean dipole, as the phenomenon is known, threatens to reappear more regularly and in a more extreme form as sea surface temperatures rise. Of most concern are years in which the sea surface off the coast of Africa warms up, provoking increased rains, while temperatures off Australia fall, leading to drier weather.

Unfortunately, it turns out that\u2019s exactly what they did: in what amounts to one of the more colossal failures by a studio marketing department in recent years, the film effectively spoiled itself three months ahead of schedule. (<a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a29808391/last-christmas-director-paul-feig-trailer/\">Feig has since admitted his regrets</a>.)</p> <p>Had it been unexpected, this stickily sentimental supernatural turn might at least have had a certain euphoric WTF quality: as it is, when you spend the whole film tracking the buildup, small, illogical details only become more glaring. (Why <em>did </em>ill-fated bike courier Tom keep his mobile phone in a cupboard at home while on the job?) And even when you know what\u2019s coming, the actual reveal is botched through sloppy montage: why base a whole film on this one bad joke if not to have Golding actually, with tears sparkling in his eyes, earnestly deliver the line, \u201cLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\u201d?

Much is made of Kate\u2019s family having fled the conflict in Yugoslavia to settle in London, an ordeal that has given her mother (Thompson, sporting a dismally generic comedy <em>borscht </em>accent) a seemingly terminal case of lugubriousness.</p> <p>The chronology is baffling, though: you\u2019d expect someone at some stage in the script development process to have pointed out that the breakup of Yugoslavia took place seven years earlier, in 1992.

      "bodyText": "The contemporary culture of spoiler paranoia is hardly ever one that collides with the romantic comedy genre: who walks into a romcom not knowing more or less what\u2019s going to happen by the time the credits roll? Last Christmas, however, is a bit of an exception: from the moment the trailer for the latest fuzzy diversion from Bridesmaids director Paul Feig hit the internet back in August, it seemed clear this one wouldn\u2019t end in the usual way. Were we right? Nothing but spoilers ahead, obviously. So, that \u2018twist\u2019 The internet hivemind can be wrong about many things, but when it came to cracking the secret of Last Christmas from its trailer \u2013 which, at three minutes, was unusually long and information-packed \u2013 it didn\u2019t take people long to put two and two together. The film is billed as a riff on the music of George Michael, named after the song Last Christmas, with that incessant \u201cI gave you my heart\u201d refrain \u2026 We hear manic pixie nightmare Kate (Emilia Clarke) telling us that she \u201cnearly died last year\u201d over what look suspiciously like scenes of heart surgery \u2026 Oh God, could mysterious, slightly otherworldly dreamboat Tom (Henry Golding) be the benevolent ghost of her heart donor? Some argued that perhaps that was exactly what the trailer wanted us to think, and we were somehow being wrongfooted. After all, would Feig and screenwriters Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings really hinge an entire film on what is essentially one goofily literal bit of wordplay? Unfortunately, it turns out that\u2019s exactly what they did: in what amounts to one of the more colossal failures by a studio marketing department in recent years, the film effectively spoiled itself three months ahead of schedule. (Feig has since admitted his regrets.) Had it been unexpected, this stickily sentimental supernatural turn might at least have had a certain euphoric WTF quality: as it is, when you spend the whole film tracking the buildup, small, illogical details only become more glaring. (Why did ill-fated bike courier Tom keep his mobile phone in a cupboard at home while on the job?) And even when you know what\u2019s coming, the actual reveal is botched through sloppy montage: why base a whole film on this one bad joke if not to have Golding actually, with tears sparkling in his eyes, earnestly deliver the line, \u201cLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\u201d? How could Thompson and Feig overlook such sublime camp potential? Humbug. \u2018Yugoslavia, 1999\u2019 At least knowing the twist in advance gives you some headspace to focus on the film\u2019s peculiar grasp of modern history, signalled in the very first scene \u2013 a prologue introducing young Kate\u2019s (or Katarina\u2019s, to use her loathed birth name) musical talents in a church choir \u2013 by a title card announcing the time and place as \u201cYugoslavia, 1999\u201d. Much is made of Kate\u2019s family having fled the conflict in Yugoslavia to settle in London, an ordeal that has given her mother (Thompson, sporting a dismally generic comedy borscht accent) a seemingly terminal case of lugubriousness. The chronology is baffling, though: you\u2019d expect someone at some stage in the script development process to have pointed out that the breakup of Yugoslavia took place seven years earlier, in 1992. Do they mean specifically the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by which Serbia and Montenegro was known until 2003? Which of the Yugoslav wars did Kate\u2019s family flee? The film could have made things easier for itself (and us) by not wedding itself to such specific dates and just ambling around in an alternative Hollywood timeline. But then it couldn\u2019t have treated us to its various cringe-inducing references to Brexit Britain, which are cannily calculated to come down inarguably on the side of hard-working, salt of the earth immigrants without committing to a leave or remain stance.

An overarching business commission would contain within it three separate watchdogs \u2013 a companies commission, a finance commission, and an enforcement commission.</p> \n<p>Answering questions afterwards, McDonnell confirmed he would like banks to be included in the new system, in what could be the biggest shake-up of financial regulation since 1997 when Gordon Brown made the Bank of England independent. \u201cMy own view is that I would like to see banking within it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>McDonnell outlined a series of perceived faults with the way shareholder capitalism worked, including short-termism, excessive executive pay, the lack of bargaining power for workers and the \u201ccartel\u201d behaviour of the big four accounting firms.</p> \n<p>He said Labour would force the big four \u2013 Ernst and Young, Deloitte, KPMG and PwC \u2013 to separate their audit and non-audit businesses. This would be aimed at avoiding the conflicts of interest he claimed could arise when the firms were selling consultancy services to the same company whose accounts they were meant to be casting a sceptical eye over.</p> \n<p>McDonnell also said a Labour government would establish a \u201cstatutory auditor\u201d to carry out its own checks on companies. \u201cIts purpose will be to conduct real-time audits of banks, building societies, credit unions, insurers and major investment firms. The auditor will not be dependent on fees from client companies and as a result could become independent and robust,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He said Labour would rewrite the Companies Act to ensure firms were responsible to employees and customers as well as their shareholders, and insist that one-third of board members were staff.</p> \n<p>Larger companies would also be given the option to create a German-style two-tier board structure, with a separate supervisory board having oversight over executives.</p> \n<p>McDonnell confirmed that Labour would force large companies to establish an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d, in which they would be obliged to set aside up to 10% of their shares for employees, who would then be entitled to receive dividends worth up to \u00a3500.</p> \n<p>The policies have been drawn up with the help of academics including the accounting expert Prem Sikka.</p> \n<p>Business groups responded warily to McDonnell\u2019s speech. The British Chambers of Commerce warned against a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach.</p> \n<p>The BCC\u2019s co-executive director Claire Walker said: \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support employee ownership, stronger corporate governance and a transition to a greener economy, which have had positive impacts on many firms. But it would be misguided to impose a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach.</p> \n<p>\u201cGetting our economy moving requires serious investment in skills, infrastructure and a reduction in business costs. But extensive government interference in ownership and governance could deter investors and damage confidence.\u201d </p>",

But he outlined a series of far-reaching changes to the \u201cregulatory architecture\u201d that governs how Britain\u2019s businesses can behave. \u201cWe aim to take on the excesses of the shareholder model and lay some of the foundations of a stakeholder economy,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s business model of shareholder domination is increasingly proving to be incompatible with not just the fair and respectful treatment of workers but also with the responsibilities associated with any organisation operating within a democracy.\u201d He said a Labour government would establish a series of powerful commissions to oversee corporate behaviour. An overarching business commission would contain within it three separate watchdogs \u2013 a companies commission, a finance commission, and an enforcement commission. Answering questions afterwards, McDonnell confirmed he would like banks to be included in the new system, in what could be the biggest shake-up of financial regulation since 1997 when Gordon Brown made the Bank of England independent. \u201cMy own view is that I would like to see banking within it,\u201d he said. McDonnell outlined a series of perceived faults with the way shareholder capitalism worked, including short-termism, excessive executive pay, the lack of bargaining power for workers and the \u201ccartel\u201d behaviour of the big four accounting firms. He said Labour would force the big four \u2013 Ernst and Young, Deloitte, KPMG and PwC \u2013 to separate their audit and non-audit businesses. This would be aimed at avoiding the conflicts of interest he claimed could arise when the firms were selling consultancy services to the same company whose accounts they were meant to be casting a sceptical eye over. McDonnell also said a Labour government would establish a \u201cstatutory auditor\u201d to carry out its own checks on companies. \u201cIts purpose will be to conduct real-time audits of banks, building societies, credit unions, insurers and major investment firms. The auditor will not be dependent on fees from client companies and as a result could become independent and robust,\u201d he said. He said Labour would rewrite the Companies Act to ensure firms were responsible to employees and customers as well as their shareholders, and insist that one-third of board members were staff. Larger companies would also be given the option to create a German-style two-tier board structure, with a separate supervisory board having oversight over executives. McDonnell confirmed that Labour would force large companies to establish an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d, in which they would be obliged to set aside up to 10% of their shares for employees, who would then be entitled to receive dividends worth up to \u00a3500. The policies have been drawn up with the help of academics including the accounting expert Prem Sikka. Business groups responded warily to McDonnell\u2019s speech. The British Chambers of Commerce warned against a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach. The BCC\u2019s co-executive director Claire Walker said: \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support employee ownership, stronger corporate governance and a transition to a greener economy, which have had positive impacts on many firms. But it would be misguided to impose a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach. \u201cGetting our economy moving requires serious investment in skills, infrastructure and a reduction in business costs. But extensive government interference in ownership and governance could deter investors and damage confidence.\u201d",

Who Targets Me was critical of the company\u2019s error. \u201cWith political parties spending more and more on online ads, and election outcomes increasingly influenced by digital tactics, it\u2019s critical that accurate, timely information on who is spending what is made publicly available,\u201d said Sam Jeffers, the group\u2019s co-founder, when the Guardian flagged the mistake. \u201cAs a small organisation working to increase ad transparency during elections, we expect big companies, with large resources, to play their part. This includes checking that the data they release is accurate. \u201cUntil the standards for political ad transparency are mandated in law, with suitable penalties for non-compliance exist, mistakes will continue to happen. We will keep working to hold social media companies and the political parties that advertise on them to account, to ensure our elections are as transparent as possible. We all have a right to know how we are being targeted online.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rory McIlroy cannot end his week as the Race to Dubai winner for a fourth time but he is perfectly at ease with the scenario even if it is one that may disappoint the European Tour. McIlroy begins this week\u2019s season-ending DP World Tour Championship sixth in the order of merit but too far adrift of Bernd Wiesberger to overhaul the Austrian. Wiesberger, Tommy Fleetwood, Jon Rahm, Shane Lowry and Matt Fitzpatrick will contest the overall prize. Had McIlroy taken out European Tour membership at the start of the year \u2013 he instead waited until close to a deadline in May \u2013 high finishes in World Golf Championships and the Masters would have afforded him a different situation heading into this week. This is not, however, a matter which remotely vexes Europe\u2019s most high profile golfer. McIlroy\u2019s four worldwide victories in 2019 justify his overall approach. McIlroy issued a firm \u201cno\u201d when asked if his Race to Dubai position was in any way frustrating. He added: \u201cI\u2019ve won it three times. It\u2019s a wonderful feeling to be able to do it but I just haven\u2019t played enough European Tour events. I haven\u2019t played enough counting European Tour events to have a chance, so no. I haven\u2019t played enough and you look at someone like a Bernd Wiesberger that\u2019s played 25, 26, 27 times \u2013 those are the guys that deserve to be up there with a chance to win.\u201d McIlroy will have a new caddie for one week only, with his regular bag man Harry Diamond on a planned break following the birth of his daughter. Niall O\u2019Connor, a former Ulster rugby player and long-time friend of McIlroy, will assume duties in Dubai. \u201cIf there\u2019s any week where I don\u2019t have Harry on the bag, it\u2019s good it\u2019s this week,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI feel like I could play this place blindfolded. I\u2019ve been coming back here for 10 years, I know the place like the back of my hand. Hopefully I can play well for the first few days and we\u2019ll get into the heat of battle on the weekend. That will be something that will be fun for both of us.\u201d Race to Dubai glory would fittingly conclude a Lowry year which was kicked off by success in nearby Abu Dhabi and peaked with victory at the Open Championship. The Irishman broke with convention when assessing the psychology of a first-time major winner. \u201cThat\u2019s the incredible thing, since the Open, I actually don\u2019t feel any different. If you had told me before, were things going to change and would you feel different, I would have said yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any different. I don\u2019t feel any different as a player, as a person. Honestly I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s changed me in any way. It\u2019s obviously changed my career path a little bit, but as a person, I don\u2019t feel any different.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers says the government\u2019s $3.8 billion infrastructure package to boost construction and jobs activity is a \u201chumiliating\u201d backdown and an admission that the economy is weak and in need of stimulus. Following the prime minister, Scott Morrison\u2019s, announcement on Wednesday that the government would spend an extra $3.8bn worth of infrastructure spending over the next four years, Chalmers said the government had misjudged economic conditions. \u201cFor months now, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have been saying that their policy settings are bang on, and that the fundamentals of the Australian economy are very strong,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cWith this announcement today, they are conceding, in a humiliating fashion, that both of those statements were wrong. \u201cThis is an admission that the economy has deteriorated since the election, but not a comprehensive plan to turn things around,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cIt\u2019s an admission that the Morrison government has got the economy badly wrong.\u201d Announcing the stimulus package Morrison said the government would support jobs and investment as the economy faced global uncertainty without succumbing to \u201cpanic\u201d. The move follows calls from Labor, the International Monetary Fund and the Reserve Bank for the government to provide more fiscal stimulus amid slowing growth and record low interest rates. Details of the package and the government\u2019s first tranche of deregulation reforms will be unveiled by Morrison in a major speech to the Business Council of Australia on Wednesday night, with the prime minister saying the government will \u201cpractically and soberly\u201d support growth in the current economic climate. \u201cAustralia has an undiminished capacity to grow our economy and succeed in today\u2019s global environment and \u2026 achieving this growth remains our priority task,\u201d he is expected to say. The prime minister is expected to contrast the Coalition\u2019s remedy for economic support with Labor\u2019s response to the global financial crisis under Kevin Rudd, saying the government is focused on structural reform rather than a \u201cdesperate, one off, short-term sugar hit\u201d. \u201cIf Australians wanted to elect economic panic merchants, they would have voted Labor,\u201d Morrison is expected to say, according to draft extracts of the speech. \u201cA panicked reaction to contemporary challenges would amount to a serious misdiagnosis of our economic situation.\u201d Dismissing a popular \u201cappetite for crisis\u201d, Morrison will say that there is an \u201cimmaturity\u201d in Labor\u2019s demand for urgent action regardless of the consequences. \u201cIf there is a crisis, you don\u2019t need to dot your i\u2019s and cross your t\u2019s. Urgency takes over reason. What you get is the fiscal debacle that was rendered by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor government that we are still paying for to this day, and that Labor continues to promote. We will not be following Labor\u2019s example or policy prescriptions. \u201cA responsible and sensible government does not run the country as if it is constantly at DEFCON1 the whole time, whether on the economy or any other issue \u2013 it deals with issues practically and soberly.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Over the next 18 months, this will comprise $1.27bn in fast-tracked funding along with $510m in new money, while over the forward estimates the amount brought forward will total $2.72bn, with $1.06bn in new money. Morrison will say the infrastructure spend will support the economy in two ways \u2013 by creating construction activity and jobs in the near term, and by reaping longer run productivity gains. The prime minister is also expected to outline details of the first stage of the government\u2019s deregulation agenda, which has been led by the assistant minister to the prime minister, Ben Morton. \u201cOur government will foster the stability and certainty necessary in both our political and economic systems to support jobs, grow our economy, protect our environment, deliver world class services and enable individual Australians and their families to plan for their future with confidence,\u201d Morrison will say. \u201cThey\u2019ve had enough of the drama.\u201d The infrastructure plan will include spending in every state and territory, with the government planning to announce details of transport projects in Queensland and Western Australia this week. On Monday, Morrison announced a $415m package with the South Australian government. The states will be expected to stump up additional cash as part of the infrastructure deal, with urban projects usually funded on a 50-50 split, while regional projects have a 20% state contribution. Arguing the economy remains in good shape with jobs growth expected to remain \u201csolid\u201d, Morrison will also talk up the stimulatory impact of the government\u2019s tax cut package, saying the $19.5bn package was the nominal fiscal equivalent over the forward estimates of almost the entire once-off cash payment stimulus provided under the Rudd Government. He will also reaffirm the government\u2019s commitment to returning the budget to surplus, saying it will be the product of \u201cdifficult and disciplined choices over six successive Coalition budgets\u201d.

In 1931 an \u201cincurved yellow chrysanthemum\u201d was named after Harold Larwood; in 1938 both a pink hybrid tea rose, \u201csaid to be very free blooming\u201d, and a gladiolus, \u201clight apricot, suffused with salmon, and the throat carmine and lemon\u201d, were named after Donald Bradman, and in 1939 a pair of dianthus were named after Len Hutton (\u201ca sturdy plant, bearing blooms of velvety reddy brown\u201d) and Eddie Paynter (\u201ccrimson, the shade of a Lancashire rose, fringed with white\u201d).</p> <p>In 1987 Denis Compton was similarly honoured, though only after the least subtle of sledgehammer hints.

In the 1980s a new development on the grounds of the former King Edward VI Grammar School in Stourbridge was given the name Cricketers Green, and all the roads named after former players. Cowdrey, Jardine, Laker and Hammond all got small streets, but the largest was named after Herbert Sutcliffe, who had died only a few years earlier. Sadly the 1980s were not a good time to name anything after someone called Sutcliffe; locals were furious that the Yorkshire Ripper was being honoured and bombarded the local council with petitions and protests. Sutcliffe Drive was swiftly renamed Kenyon Close, after the more obscure but significantly safer Don Kenyon, once of Stourbridge, who played eight Tests in the 1950s.</p> <p>Then there is the case of Grimsby\u2019s Crampin Steam Fishing Company, which in the 1930s launched the Famous Cricketer Fleet. For a few years there was a constant stream of cricket-themed steamers being produced by the Selby shipyard Cochrane and Sons, starting with the Larwood \u2013 \u201cof the latest type for fishing in Iceland waters\u201d \u2013 the Paynter \u2013 boasting \u201clatest type large steam trawl winch\u201d \u2013 and the Patsy Hendren \u2013 \u201cthe fastest trawler afloat\u201d.

Douglas Jardine promised to take part in his steamer\u2019s maiden voyage, but eventually sent his apologies, citing convenient family illness, as well as a pair of tankards and a wish that the crew would drink \u201csuccess to the vessel, happy voyages, and big hauls.\u201d On its first outing the Jardine set a new British trawler speed record of 13.52 knots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e40d6da8bcaadac4703321a33b0d2afa568da6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e40d6da8bcaadac4703321a33b0d2afa568da6a/0_0_2758_3561/775.jpg\" alt=\"Workers caulk the deck of the trawler Larwood in December 1935, one of a fleet of Grimsby trawlers named after famous cricketers.\" width=\"775\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers caulk the deck of the trawler Larwood in December 1935.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In all there were six boats in the fleet, though not for very long. The trawlers were pressed into military service during the second world war, and as such became targets for the German air force. On 25 April 1940 the Bradman was bombed by the Germans and sunk off the coast of Norway; the following day the Hammond was hit, and three days after that the Larwood was set on fire by an incendiary bomb and abandoned. The Jardine was bombed on 30 April and skittled by the British, and in the space of a single week six had become two. Crampin was not put off, launching the Norman Yardley, another Bradman, a Statham and finally a Trueman in the years after the war, but his cricket-themed trawlers have long since disappeared.

In a physical adjustment, a teacher uses their hands to help guide a student more deeply into a posture. They can be done in almost any pose and different teachers have different methods. According to the piece, these touches are often unwanted. They can also be dangerous, if a student is modifying due to injury and a teacher pushes them too far, or psychologically triggering, for people recovering from trauma.</p> <p>I became a yoga teacher almost 10 years ago. I discovered that the world of yoga had changed dramatically since my mother\u2019s days as a barefoot hippie in white sweatpants. Hundred-dollar leggings are the norm and women doing handstands on beaches in impossibly skimpy bikinis sell granola bars on Instagram to millions of followers. The question of what yoga is or isn\u2019t has become muddled, indeed.</p> <p>My first 200 hours spent in yoga teacher training focused far more on the postures and the sutras, which are, essentially, the Sanskrit rules to living a yogic life. I graduated feeling deeply committed to my personal practice, but lacking the basic skills of teaching. My second 200-hour training was at Lifetime Yoga, where the teachings of Jonny Kest, one of the teachers highlighted by the Times, are used to teach a vigorous hot vinyasa flow. Vinyasa is a touch-heavy practice. We spent hours learning techniques to physically adjust our students. We were encouraged to help deepen postures by giving mini massages and finding press points to help students find greater ease in postures. Physical adjustments are generally an accepted part of any practice. But Kest\u2019s approach, as highlighted by the Times, is controversial because, until this recent backlash, it didn\u2019t include consent.</p> <p>Different studios handle consent differently. At my current studio outside London, we use place cards in front of our mats saying whether or not we wanted to be touched. One of my teachers asks us to place hands on our bellies in savasana (corpse pose) if we prefer not to be touched. Consent is vital. When touch feels good, it feels so good. When it feels bad, it\u2019s awful.</p> <p>This is something I learned the hard way. I once had to go to a yoga class three times before I figured out that the way my male teacher was parting my thighs from behind and rubbing his groin into my backside was inappropriate. I should have known better, but that\u2019s the inherent trouble with yoga. Part of the teacher/student relationship is trust and no one should practice with a teacher they don\u2019t trust.</p> <p>Last year, I had to stop adjusting men I don\u2019t personally know in my classes. Twice I was cornered after an evening class by men making advances on me. It\u2019s easy to mistake the caring touch of a yoga teacher for something more sexual \u2013 especially if that touch hasn\u2019t been adequately explained to students.</p> <p>Another teacher I know was stalked by a student for months because he mistook her adjustment for a sexual pass. In training, I was told to be cautious with touch, especially on straight men. Touch is, after all, the \u201cmother of all senses\u201d. In a fetus, it is the first sense we develop. Touch can be especially confusing for men because, as <a href=\"https://www.zurinstitute.com/touch-in-therapy/\">psychologist Ofer Zur points</a> out, \u201cFor most men in our society, touch has been limited to violent and sexual encounters.\u201d</p> <p>For all these reasons, I believe yoga studios have a responsibility to define and explain the purpose of touch to every student who walks in their door. We can\u2019t play fast and loose with consent.</p> <p>Touch is a potentially beautiful thing. It can help relax a body and deepen a posture. But until every single yoga studio nails consent, touching in yoga ought to be touchy, indeed.</p>",

The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, on Tuesday announced that the government would consult on legally binding steps to be taken by Advent, adding she was \u201cminded to accept\u201d the undertakings \u2013 despite objections expressed to competition regulators by unnamed parties about the private equity firm\u2019s potential short-term hunt for profits. Advent International and Cobham announced the all-cash deal on 25 July, but the government intervened on 17 September. The MoD expressed concerns that the takeover could expose military information held on Cobham\u2019s systems and that key capabilities could be undermined if Advent decided to exit parts of the business. Cobham, which specialises in the air-to-air refuelling technology used by UK and US military jets, is a supplier to the Ministry of Defence as well as making a broad range of systems for aviation and space industries. However, the Dorset-based company, which employs about 10,000 people worldwide, only earns about 8% of its revenues in the UK. The company\u2019s new owners will be prevented from withdrawing from important military services for five years, as well as ensuring that board structures keep British nationals in charge of key defence services. Advent will also have to give the Ministry of Defence prior notice if it plans to sell on all or part of Cobham. The preliminary decision to accept the undertakings came despite criticisms from some shareholders, including Nadine Cobham, the daughter-in-law of the company\u2019s late founder, Sir Alan Cobham. A redacted report by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) that was also published on Tuesday showed that four unnamed third parties had said Advent was not a suitable owner of crucial national security capabilities, including the air-to-air refuelling services, because it was a private equity company with a short-term view to make a profit by selling off or breaking up the business. The government will not make a final decision on whether to accept the takeover until after a consultation on the undertakings has been completed on 17 December. Leadsom said: \u201cI have now reviewed further national security advice from the MoD and met with both Cobham and Advent who have offered legally binding undertakings designed to mitigate national security concerns, which I am minded to accept.\u201d Shonnel Malani, a partner at Advent, said: \u201cFollowing the CMA\u2019s review, we have worked closely with the Ministry of Defence to construct undertakings that would adequately mitigate against any potential national security risks and we welcome today\u2019s decision by the secretary of state to propose to accept those undertakings, subject to consultation.\u201d",

She wants to go into teaching instead.</p> <p>Conely\u2019s experience is not unique. The Junior Lawyers Division\u2019s <a href=\"http://communities.lawsociety.org.uk/junior-lawyers/news/jld-resilience-and-wellbeing-survey-report-2019/5067323.article\">2019 resilience and wellbeing survey</a> found that 93% of respondents \u2013 students, graduates, trainee solicitors and solicitors up to five years\u2019 qualified \u2013 felt stressed. Almost half said that they had experienced poor mental health, which is a 10% increase from the year before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/11/what-to-expect-from-your-first-year-at-law-school-by-current-students\">What to expect from your first year at law school \u2013 by current students</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s no secret that the legal profession can often be a high-pressure working environment; lawyers are the second most stressed professionals in the country. Some universities are therefore taking steps to help students better cope with academic pressures and the transition from legal education to a career as a lawyer.</p> <p>The BPP University Law School has announced that it will introduce lessons on mindfulness, meditation, relaxation and resilience as part of their courses. Students will learn topics including \u201cbalancing work and life\u201d, \u201cself-care\u201d and \u201cgetting a good night\u2019s sleep\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago when mental wellbeing in the law was barely discussed,\u201d says Jo-Anne Pugh, director of programme design and development at BPP. \u201cThe profession has moved on and all law schools must also do the same.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the profession making loud noises about the importance of improving mental health among students and graduates, the reality is junior lawyers remain overworked. <a href=\"https://www.douglas-scott.co.uk/storage/downloads/jluxZzFcYSrRuSMrPwVLJrKUUBn6GubwjxHQ2QYC.pdf\">Research by legal recruitment firm Douglas Scott</a> revealed that 17% of trainees are working 48 hours or more, with London-based trainees expected to work more than any others in the country. In some extreme cases, trainees are forfeiting holidays taking them below the statutory minimum of 20 days and training contracts are being used to deliver services blighted by gaps in public funding.</p> <p>The workaholic culture appears to start at university. In a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324866343_Undergraduate_Resilience\">year-long study of the resilience</a> and mental health experiences of undergraduate students at Leeds University, associate professor of law Lydia Bleasdale found that, unlike their cohorts, law students had very little free time to pursue activities unrelated to the profession. Anything legal students did outside of their studies was related to law.</p> <p>In a separate study of <a href=\"https://essl.leeds.ac.uk/law/news/article/919/report-on-millennial-lawyers-launched-at-the-leeds-law-society\">millennial lawyers</a>, trainees reported similar struggles to find a work-life balance.

      "bodyText": "\u201cOne of my lecturers describes law school as being like the Hunger Games,\u201d says law student Erin May Conely. \u201cIt can be quite cut-throat with everyone fighting for the same jobs at top law firms.\u201d For the 22-year-old, who is studying law at the University of Birmingham, the competitive atmosphere has led to so much stress that she has decided not to enter the profession once she graduates. She wants to go into teaching instead. Conely\u2019s experience is not unique. The Junior Lawyers Division\u2019s 2019 resilience and wellbeing survey found that 93% of respondents \u2013 students, graduates, trainee solicitors and solicitors up to five years\u2019 qualified \u2013 felt stressed. Almost half said that they had experienced poor mental health, which is a 10% increase from the year before. It\u2019s no secret that the legal profession can often be a high-pressure working environment; lawyers are the second most stressed professionals in the country. Some universities are therefore taking steps to help students better cope with academic pressures and the transition from legal education to a career as a lawyer. The BPP University Law School has announced that it will introduce lessons on mindfulness, meditation, relaxation and resilience as part of their courses. Students will learn topics including \u201cbalancing work and life\u201d, \u201cself-care\u201d and \u201cgetting a good night\u2019s sleep\u201d. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago when mental wellbeing in the law was barely discussed,\u201d says Jo-Anne Pugh, director of programme design and development at BPP. \u201cThe profession has moved on and all law schools must also do the same.\u201d Despite the profession making loud noises about the importance of improving mental health among students and graduates, the reality is junior lawyers remain overworked. Research by legal recruitment firm Douglas Scott revealed that 17% of trainees are working 48 hours or more, with London-based trainees expected to work more than any others in the country. In some extreme cases, trainees are forfeiting holidays taking them below the statutory minimum of 20 days and training contracts are being used to deliver services blighted by gaps in public funding. The workaholic culture appears to start at university. In a year-long study of the resilience and mental health experiences of undergraduate students at Leeds University, associate professor of law Lydia Bleasdale found that, unlike their cohorts, law students had very little free time to pursue activities unrelated to the profession. Anything legal students did outside of their studies was related to law. In a separate study of millennial lawyers, trainees reported similar struggles to find a work-life balance. Junior lawyers also admitted they felt that university didn\u2019t prepare them enough for the level of stress in the profession, and the study heard stories of trainees not sleeping or crying in the office toilets. Competition at university for academic and professional prowess, as well as a culture of perfectionism, exacerbates this pressure. Bleasdale says: \u201cWhat we found was that students were comparing themselves to others and then feeling deficient, like they were the only ones who didn\u2019t understand something or were the only ones who were struggling. It was usually related to a sense of not being good enough academically.\u201d Bleasdale says it\u2019s vital that law students try to maintain a sense of identity that is not entirely bound up in academic success. Carve out time for yourself after studies and get involved in activities that are not related to your course or profession. Stay away from social media, she adds \u2013 it can be a toxic place which feeds into that frenzy of comparison and competition. If you are struggling to cope, however, it\u2019s important to talk about it. Elizabeth Rimmer, chief executive of support charity LawCare, says: \u201cIf you are a student, talk to your tutor, family or friends. Don\u2019t go it alone. If you are in work and feeling overwhelmed, definitely go and speak to a colleague. Confide in someone and tell them how you are feeling and see if you can get additional support. \u201cSecondly, sit down and try to silence that inner critic that might be telling you are not good enough and you can\u2019t do these things,\u201d she adds. \u201cRemind yourself of all the achievements you have had and make a realistic plan for how you are going to get through it all. Most importantly, many people feel this way. You won\u2019t be the only person who has ever felt like that.\u201d",

But many relationships crumble by the three-month mark \u2013 when you start to see the other person\u2019s flaws, but before the partnership becomes a solid, defined entity. If you can weather the three-month point, those early days will set the tone for your future relationship. What are the common mistakes people make at the start of relationships \u2013 and how can you avoid them? The experts weigh in.</p> <h2><strong>Coming on too strong</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s good to know what you want from a prospective partner, and to be clear about that. But it\u2019s off-putting to lay everything out on the table straight away. \u201cDon\u2019t set out your 20-year plan on the first few dates,\u201d says psychologist and relationship expert <a href=\"https://www.ekenny.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Emma Kenny</a>. \u201cIt can be intimidating. It also means that you\u2019ve negated the opportunity to see how things would develop naturally with that person.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Being too rigid in what you want</strong><br></h2> <p>It\u2019s good to have an idea of the sort of person with whom you would like to settle down. But being too rigid in the early stages of a relationship can kill promising romances stone dead. \u201cThink about what that other person is as an individual, not in terms of their political beliefs or whether they\u2019re a vegan or whatever,\u201d Kenny says. Put away the checklist. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great idea to interview someone on the first few dates. Asking them how much they\u2019re earning, or about their home-owning situation \u2013 it\u2019s not an organic way to get to know someone. You\u2019re a prospective partner, not a recruitment consultant.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Performing for them</strong></h2> <p>Early on in relationships, you often want to put your best foot forward \u2013 be the cool girl (or boy) who is up for anything, never complains and always looks fabulous. \u201cWhen you start dating someone new, you can put on a bit of a show,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.persialawson.com/\" title=\"\">dating coach Persia Lawson</a>. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to perform, instead of being authentic.\u201d But it\u2019s an exhausting pretence to have to maintain long-term. Why not just be yourself? \u201cI try to encourage people to realise it\u2019s cooler to just be yourself. If you\u2019re trying too hard to perform around someone, they\u2019re probably not the right person for you anyway.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Not </strong><strong>learning from past relationships </strong></h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of relationship audits,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cLook back at your last relationship and see what went wrong. Ask yourself: \u2018What am I doing wrong in relationships? How accountable should I be?\u2019\u201d Perhaps you have a habit of dating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/05/the-attachment-secret-are-you-a-secure-avoidant-or-anxious-partner\" title=\"\">emotionally unavailable people</a>, or you struggle to respect boundaries. By doing some work on yourself, you will be better placed for a future, healthy relationship.</p> <h2><strong>Moving too fast</strong></h2> <p>When you\u2019re caught up in the dopamine rush of a new relationship, it\u2019s tempting to want to crash through all the major milestones as fast as possible, as if you are collecting mushrooms in Mario Kart. \u201cA lot of my clients make the mistake of moving too fast in general,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cTelling someone you think they\u2019re the one and you\u2019re deeply connected to them after date one or two is not great for everybody involved.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t meet the friends and family for at least three months. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to take things at a slower pace sometimes,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.relate.org.uk/users/ammanda-major\" title=\"\">Ammanda Major, a therapist at Relate</a>. \u201cPeople want to get in there and meet friends and parents and live in each other\u2019s lives after a very short time. But it\u2019s OK to take it at a slower pace. If you go rushing along and the whole thing collapses after three months, you may end up feeling bereft.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Ignoring red flags</strong></h2> <p>We\u2019ve all been there. You have been dating someone for a few weeks, they seem perfect and then they\u2019re rude to a waitress or trash-talk their ex. Don\u2019t ignore red flags. \u201cRed flags are important, because they mean you should step back from that relationship,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cMaybe you hate it when people raise their voice, then they shout at you \u2013 but you find them so attractive, you ignore it. If you ignore red flags, you will end up in a horrible relationship.\u201d Besides, anyone who is rude to a waitress is definitely not worth your time.</p> <h2><strong>Posting too much</strong><strong> online</strong></h2> <p>Be mindful of what you post on social media. \u201cIt can feel wonderful to think you\u2019ve met your soulmate, but remember that if it\u2019s going to be an important relationship, you don\u2019t have to rush things,\u201d says Major. Which means: hold off on the loving romantic tributes, for now. \u201cIf you post: \u2018I\u2019m in a fabulous relationship, I think this is the one,\u2019 your new partner might see that and if that\u2019s not where their head is at, you\u2019ve kiboshed it before it\u2019s even started. Or if it doesn\u2019t work out, you might feel embarrassed.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Not establishing clear boundaries early on</strong></h2> <p>The first three months of a relationship set the tone for the rest of your time together. If you\u2019ve allowed the relationship to be on your partner\u2019s terms, you will find it hard to come back from that. \u201cYou need to respect yourself and have clear boundaries when it comes to dating someone,\u201d says Lawson. \u201cBe brave enough to put your boundaries up and say: \u2018This is what I need and what I desire.\u2019 A lot of people are scared to express how they want to be treated for fear of being rejected. But it\u2019s better to know now than later. Besides, people are attracted to people who know their own worth, rather than accepting the crumbs and scraps of poor behaviour, because they think it\u2019s all they can get.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to challenge your partner or pull them up on their behaviour in those early months \u2013 if you let things slide now, you will be letting them slide for ever.</p> <h2><strong>Glossing over sexual incompatibility</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s completely natural for sex with a new partner to not be mindblowing initially \u2013 you are only just getting to know each other. But if things continue to misfire in the bedroom department, that may be a sign you\u2019re not right for each other. Long-term, you can only have a healthy relationship with someone with whom you are sexually compatible. \u201cIf your intimate life isn\u2019t working out, you must not ignore that,\u201d says Major. Try to address things head-on. \u201cCommunicate your desires openly and share your kinks. You have to deal with things as soon as possible, otherwise you\u2019re going to have problems.\u201d If things don\u2019t work out, move on.</p> <h2><strong>Being too available</strong></h2> <p>When you think you have found the one, it can be tempting to cancel all your plans and hole up together. \u201cYou stop contacting your friends, and start scheduling your entire life around when you may see them,\u201d says Lawson. \u201cYou sideline any hobbies or interests you have.\u201d</p> <p>But if you do this, you may end up isolated from your support systems in an unhealthy relationship. \u201cIn my experience, couples who spend all their time together don\u2019t seem to work out,\u201d Lawson says. \u201cIt becomes toxic and codependent.\u201d Rather, embrace some healthy distance. \u201cYou need to have friendships, hobbies and interests outside your relationship.\u201d Beware the love bubble \u2013 it always bursts, whether you like it or not.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s the news millions of veteran gamers have been waiting more than a decade for: another title in the sci-fi shooter series Half-Life.</p> <p>Developer Valve Corporation has tweeted that a game entitled Half-Life: Alyx is in development and that more details will be revealed on 21 November. Excitement was perhaps tempered, however, by the nature of the project. Half-Life: Alyx is a virtual reality game that will likely lead on the Valve Index headset, launched earlier this year.</p> <p>Over the last 10 years, the company has more or less abandoned traditional game development in favour of launching and maintaining its games retail platform Steam and its VR technology experiments. Since Vive launched in 2016, the company has released a few VR demos and mini-experiences such as the Lab and Moondust, both based around its Portal series of physics puzzlers. But it has resisted starting work on Half-Life 3.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019re excited to unveil Half-Life: Alyx, our flagship VR game, this Thursday at 10am Pacific Time.<br><br>Can\u2019t wait to share it with all of you! <a href=\"https://t.co/BupFCxSrTw\">pic.twitter.com/BupFCxSrTw</a></p>&mdash; Valve (@valvesoftware) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The first two titles in the Earth Invasion series are among the most critically acclaimed titles in modern gaming \u2013 brilliant narrative-heavy first-person shooters with a compelling hero in Gordon Freeman, and a thrillingly creepy alien race in the shape of the Combine. Half-Life 2 and two subsequent episodes extended the story beyond the original\u2019s Black Mesa research facility to a full city overrun with Combine forces, where Gordon encounters a small human rebel force.</p> <p>From the title of the new project, it is one of the rebel leaders, Alyx Vance, that the new VR project will focus on. A non-playable character in Half-Life 2, Alyx was nevertheless considered a landmark in video game representation, a woman of colour with a leading role when other major games were dominated by male protagonists.</p> <p>While revenues from VR headsets hit $3.6bn in 2018, according to the market research firm SuperData, the sector has not broken through to the mainstream as expected after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2014/mar/26/oculus-rift-facebook-fury-kickstarter-funders\">\u00a31.4m Kickstarter campaign for the Oculus Rift</a> device in 2012. The market leader is PlayStation VR, a comparatively cheap headset that works with the PlayStation 4 console. At \u00a3460, the Valve Index (which uses Valve\u2019s open Steam VR platform) is at the high end of the market and requires a similarly high-end PC, as well as a certain amount of technical expertise to set up.</p> <p>Reaction from gamers ranges from excitement to disappointment. The phrase \u201cHalf-Life 3 confirmed\u201d has <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/half-life-3-confirmed\">become a meme for forlorn expectations</a>. Gamers without expensive VR equipment may be hoping for a full Half-Life subsidiary they can play on their current consoles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1196568514204708864\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;I wish Valve would make a new Half-Life&quot; <br><br>*the monkey&#39;s paw curls a finger* <a href=\"https://t.co/elJNZzc0ly\">https://t.co/elJNZzc0ly</a></p>&mdash; Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1196568514204708864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The Valve announcement is at 10am PST (18pm GMT) on 21 November.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 November 2019.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the news millions of veteran gamers have been waiting more than a decade for: another title in the sci-fi shooter series Half-Life. Developer Valve Corporation has tweeted that a game entitled Half-Life: Alyx is in development and that more details will be revealed on 21 November. Excitement was perhaps tempered, however, by the nature of the project. Half-Life: Alyx is a virtual reality game that will likely lead on the Valve Index headset, launched earlier this year. Over the last 10 years, the company has more or less abandoned traditional game development in favour of launching and maintaining its games retail platform Steam and its VR technology experiments. Since Vive launched in 2016, the company has released a few VR demos and mini-experiences such as the Lab and Moondust, both based around its Portal series of physics puzzlers. But it has resisted starting work on Half-Life 3. The first two titles in the Earth Invasion series are among the most critically acclaimed titles in modern gaming \u2013 brilliant narrative-heavy first-person shooters with a compelling hero in Gordon Freeman, and a thrillingly creepy alien race in the shape of the Combine. Half-Life 2 and two subsequent episodes extended the story beyond the original\u2019s Black Mesa research facility to a full city overrun with Combine forces, where Gordon encounters a small human rebel force. From the title of the new project, it is one of the rebel leaders, Alyx Vance, that the new VR project will focus on. A non-playable character in Half-Life 2, Alyx was nevertheless considered a landmark in video game representation, a woman of colour with a leading role when other major games were dominated by male protagonists. While revenues from VR headsets hit $3.6bn in 2018, according to the market research firm SuperData, the sector has not broken through to the mainstream as expected after a \u00a31.4m Kickstarter campaign for the Oculus Rift device in 2012. The market leader is PlayStation VR, a comparatively cheap headset that works with the PlayStation 4 console. At \u00a3460, the Valve Index (which uses Valve\u2019s open Steam VR platform) is at the high end of the market and requires a similarly high-end PC, as well as a certain amount of technical expertise to set up. Reaction from gamers ranges from excitement to disappointment. The phrase \u201cHalf-Life 3 confirmed\u201d has become a meme for forlorn expectations. Gamers without expensive VR equipment may be hoping for a full Half-Life subsidiary they can play on their current consoles. The Valve announcement is at 10am PST (18pm GMT) on 21 November. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 November 2019. An earlier version incorrectly referred to the HTC Vive headset rather than the Valve Index headset in the text and subheading. The headline was also changed to clarify that the Half-Life sequel will not likely be exclusive to just high-end VR headsets.",

With more economic freedom came the ability to do as she pleases: that much was obvious from her heavily autobiographical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/13/beyonce-album-first-review\">self-titled album</a>, surprise-released in 2013, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with\">Lemonade</a> in 2016.</p> <p>This transition reverberates in the work of peers who\u2019ve followed in her wake.

Her work functions like a mirror held up to black women, offering them representation in ways that white gatekeepers wouldn\u2019t instinctively understand.</p> <p>This decade, I watched black musicians defy other traditional gatekeepers in the hard-to-crack world of fashion. Like Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna entered music as a teen, signing to Def Jam at 17. Now, she\u2019s scaled unprecedented levels by becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/18/rihanna-set-to-become-lvmhs-first-black-female-designer-reports\">the first black woman to head up a luxury fashion brand</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/may/21/rihanna-fenty-label-fashion-industry\">Fenty in partnership with French company LVMH</a>. At the start of the decade, few would have seen her evolution coming. During her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/14/rhianna-pop-loud-cd-review\">Loud</a> era, all shrill EDM production and flame-red hair, she felt easy to dismiss as a pop-machine puppet, singing words written by other people.

Rihanna\u2019s success in fashion and beauty moves her away from seeming like a product that belongs to her record label. She becomes a person and force of her own \u2013 Fenty, after all, is her real-life surname. And by steering all these seemingly disparate parts into one brand, she is creating a new set of norms for black art. Plenty of her peers have seen how investing in and executing a broader vision can support, rather than distract from, their music. Consider the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/05/tyler-the-creator-back-after-uk-ban-funk-reinvention-homophobia-accusations\">Tyler, the Creator</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/solange-knowles\">Solange</a>, Kanye West, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dev-hynes\">Dev Hynes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-ocean\">Frank Ocean</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/donald-glover\">Donald Glover</a>, and you realise how their multifaceted work shaped some of the most important western pop culture of the decade.</p> <p>Our notions of what counts as \u201cblack art\u201d no longer need to be defined by the global north\u2019s white mainstream. Since the 80s, black genres from hip-hop and house to R&amp;B have led countercultures. But those genres used to be put into neat boxes \u2013 \u201cblack culture\u201d, to be consumed in specific ways and places, without needing to care about the experiences behind the work. Now, black music soundtracks global teendom. Now, Kanye West can endure being laughed out of fashion circles before turning Yeezy <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2019/07/09/kanyes-second-coming-inside-the-billion-dollar-yeezy-empire/\">into a billion-dollar company</a>. West brought a certain kind of self-conscious tastefulness to his work as a designer, continuing to kick back against convention just as he had as a middle-class art-school kid during his mid-2000s backpack-rap era. (Hardly the usual \u201cthug life\u201d backstory easier to sell to white consumers.) Glover, meanwhile, can rap (and sing) as Childish Gambino, and also create and executive produce a TV show as lush as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/atlanta\">Atlanta</a>. Solange can create performance art, with installations for New York\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.immanuelwilkins.com/new-gallery-1\">Guggenheim</a> and LA\u2019s <a href=\"https://hammer.ucla.edu/solange\">Hammer Museum</a> and London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/soul-nation-art-age-black-power/solange-knowles-ferguson-on-black-identity\">Tate Modern</a>.

Such a thing can\u2019t exist within the parameters of a business designed for profit \u2013 historically, <a href=\"https://www.awal.com/blog/history-of-record-deals\">recording contracts let labels exploit artists</a>. Yet this type of multifaceted black labour rebukes the idea that you\u2019re only worth the figure on your first contract. Frank Ocean\u2019s Endless album/livestream, a quick way out of his Def Jam contract before he released Blonde, brought these delicate chess moves to life. One of the most boring critiques of Beyonc\u00e9 is that she\u2019s just a cog in a corporate machine. But the fact that any of these artists turn their talent into products doesn\u2019t negate their overall value.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/mar/24/beyonce-effect-galleries-new-generation-art-devotees-picasso-jay-z\">Beyonc\u00e9 effect fills galleries with a new generation of art devotees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Black children are always taught that we have to work twice as hard to gain half as much recognition. These displays of black labour, of a relentless drive to excel in various ways and a refusal to be defined by one skill, push that adage to an extreme. These polymaths show that you can eschew one neat categorisation and do so on your own terms. Black American fans of Beyonc\u00e9 would have recognised the cultural references others missed in Homecoming, her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/homecoming-beyonce-review-documentary-is-a-triumphant-celebration\">2018 Coachella festival </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/homecoming-beyonce-review-documentary-is-a-triumphant-celebration\"> performance</a>, an ode to historically black American universities. Later, it was turned into a Netflix special produced by \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Parkwood Entertainment. The decade in Beyonc\u00e9 drew to a close with her executive-producing 2019\u2019s pan-African <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/11/the-lion-king-review-anthro-leonine-clones-original\">Lion King</a> reboot soundtrack, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/19/beyonce-the-lion-king-the-gift-review-superstar-shows-impeccable-taste\">The Gift</a>, in addition to voicing Nala in the film.</p> <p>The idea of performers \u201cjust sticking to the music\u201d is all but dead. In the next decade, it may well become the norm for black artists to explore other creative avenues without being mocked or cut down. As pop music shifts away from English as lingua franca, new global acts could begin to dominate in spaces previously only held by this crop of multitalented public figures.</p> <p>Seen at a glance, they can inadvertently make hard work appear effortless, and as though you\u2019re failing if you\u2019re not squeezing as much productivity out of every day as Beyonc\u00e9. But that misses the point. These artists have poured buckets of themselves into these accomplishments, and have done so while working in an industry still mired in institutional racism, sexism and one that treats duty of care as an afterthought. They made the choice to seek self-determination \u2013 sometimes at a high cost. What you do with your 24 hours is up to you.</p>",

West brought a certain kind of self-conscious tastefulness to his work as a designer, continuing to kick back against convention just as he had as a middle-class art-school kid during his mid-2000s backpack-rap era. (Hardly the usual \u201cthug life\u201d backstory easier to sell to white consumers.) Glover, meanwhile, can rap (and sing) as Childish Gambino, and also create and executive produce a TV show as lush as Atlanta. Solange can create performance art, with installations for New York\u2019s Guggenheim and LA\u2019s Hammer Museum and London\u2019s Tate Modern. Once you realise you\u2019re more than a preconceived notion of a black artist, or of black industry, entire worlds open up. These musicians\u2019 stories are aligned in a quest for true independence. Such a thing can\u2019t exist within the parameters of a business designed for profit \u2013 historically, recording contracts let labels exploit artists. Yet this type of multifaceted black labour rebukes the idea that you\u2019re only worth the figure on your first contract. Frank Ocean\u2019s Endless album/livestream, a quick way out of his Def Jam contract before he released Blonde, brought these delicate chess moves to life. One of the most boring critiques of Beyonc\u00e9 is that she\u2019s just a cog in a corporate machine. But the fact that any of these artists turn their talent into products doesn\u2019t negate their overall value. Black children are always taught that we have to work twice as hard to gain half as much recognition. These displays of black labour, of a relentless drive to excel in various ways and a refusal to be defined by one skill, push that adage to an extreme. These polymaths show that you can eschew one neat categorisation and do so on your own terms. Black American fans of Beyonc\u00e9 would have recognised the cultural references others missed in Homecoming, her 2018 Coachella festival performance, an ode to historically black American universities. Later, it was turned into a Netflix special produced by \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Parkwood Entertainment. The decade in Beyonc\u00e9 drew to a close with her executive-producing 2019\u2019s pan-African Lion King reboot soundtrack, The Gift, in addition to voicing Nala in the film. The idea of performers \u201cjust sticking to the music\u201d is all but dead. In the next decade, it may well become the norm for black artists to explore other creative avenues without being mocked or cut down. As pop music shifts away from English as lingua franca, new global acts could begin to dominate in spaces previously only held by this crop of multitalented public figures. Seen at a glance, they can inadvertently make hard work appear effortless, and as though you\u2019re failing if you\u2019re not squeezing as much productivity out of every day as Beyonc\u00e9. But that misses the point. These artists have poured buckets of themselves into these accomplishments, and have done so while working in an industry still mired in institutional racism, sexism and one that treats duty of care as an afterthought. They made the choice to seek self-determination \u2013 sometimes at a high cost. What you do with your 24 hours is up to you.",

      "bodyText": "Jordan has accused the US of entrenching the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, after Washington announced it did not consider Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank to necessarily be illegal. Ayman Safadi, the Jordanian foreign minister, criticised the US decision, saying settlements \u201ckill the two-state solution\u201d, the most widely accepted blueprint for Middle East peace. \u201cEntrenching the occupation and its injustice, and violating the resolutions of international legitimacy will not achieve peace, and will not guarantee security and stability,\u201d he said, according to state media. \u201cNothing changes the illegal reality of settlements that the international community is unanimous in condemning,\u201d he added. In a dramatic break with decades of international law and global consensus, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, made the announcement on Monday. He said arguments about who was right and who was wrong as a matter of international law were counterproductive to any future agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. Pompeo even suggested the move would \u201cprovide the very space for Israelis and Palestinians to come together to find a political solution\u201d. \u201cCalling the establishment of civilian settlements inconsistent with international law has not advanced the cause of peace,\u201d Pompeo said. Palestinians, their allies, rights groups and international law analysts disagreed, stating that the establishment of settlements on occupied land was a war crime. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the EU policy on Israeli settlements \u201cis clear and remains unchanged: all settlement activity is illegal under international law and it erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace\u201d. The move is a political boost for Benjamin Netanyahu at a precarious time for him. The 70-year-old prime minister is fighting for his political survival as Israel prime minister while his opponent, Benny Gantz, is trying to assemble a coalition government. Pompeo said the timing of the announcement was \u201cnot tied to domestic politics anywhere\u201d. On a visit to the West Bank on Tuesday, Netanyahu said: \u201cI think it is a great day for the state of Israel and an achievement that will remain for decades.\u201d Earlier he had said he had spoken to Donald Trump on Monday night and told the US president \u201che had corrected a historic injustice\u201d. \u201cI said to President Trump that we are not in a foreign land,\u201d he said of the Palestinian territories. \u201cThis is our homeland for over 3,000 years. The reason that we are called \u2018Jews\u2019 is because we came from here, from Judea,\u201d he added, using the region\u2019s biblical name. In September, days before he was due to run in a national election, Netanyahu said he intended to annex Jewish settlements, but gave only a vague timeframe. After that announcement, warned that the move could have a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on the peace treaty between Jordan and Israel. The US policy shift is likely to trigger significant anger in Jordan, a staunch US ally whose population is about 70% Palestinian, who are descended from refugees. The Jordanian government\u2019s official position is that those refugees and their descendants will one day be able to return to an independent Palestinian state, and considers any policy that undermines the two-state solution to be an existential threat. However, Israel has made efforts in recent years to build diplomatic ties with other Arab countries, especially Gulf states, that are not based on concession to the Palestinians. Netanyahu has held up the drive as a success, and the reaction to the US decision from other Middle Eastern states was muted. The foreign ministry in Egypt, which also has a peace treaty with Israel, said that \u201cCairo is committed to international decisions and international law regarding settlements, and believes they are illegal and contrary to international law\u201d. Since he entered office, Trump has repeatedly made moves welcomed by Israeli hardline nationalists that have been interpreted as detrimental to Palestinians and their hopes for a future state. The US president recognised the contested city of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, slashed humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees and closed their diplomatic offices in Washington. Trump\u2019s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, has also been a longtime supporter of the settlement movement.",

Here you\u2019ll be reminded of some the country\u2019s most dazzling subcultures \u2013 from female punks to floppy-haired Spike Islanders \u2013 and get the sort of insight into working-class life that only the best documentary photographers can provide. Yet none of these images were taken by people who consider themselves photographers. Often holiday snaps, they were shot by amateurs, one great picture among countless humdrum efforts. This month, however, they will go on display in London, alongside work by far more established names.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You might take 500 photos and end up with one photo that really captures the time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The project was never intended to take off. Paul Wright was an office worker in Manchester, his hands full looking after two small children, when he started posting the odd photograph he found online \u2013 he admits he didn\u2019t realise how copyright worked back then \u2013 to his Instagram page. \u201cAlongside pictures of my family,\u201d he laughs. This blossomed into the British Culture Archive, a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/britishculturearchive/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/britcultarchive?lang=en\">Twitter</a> account for all the shots he was finding online. It soon found fans in the likes of Johnny Marr and Robert Carlyle. The latter actually got in touch to say: \u201cThanks for all the beautiful images. Haunting, evocative, vibrant \u2026 Love them all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8acea6f90e567b6cb036d076d931454ec061e15b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8acea6f90e567b6cb036d076d931454ec061e15b/0_0_592_594/500.jpg\" alt=\"Widnes.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I get messages asking why I don\u2019t feature any middle-class culture\u2019 \u2026 Widnes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of the People's Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was pretty chuffed with that,\u201d says Wright when we meet today in a London cafe. \u201cIt made me realise I must be doing something right.\u201d Wright\u2019s plan was to focus on photographers whose work he thought had been overlooked or forgotten. But soon, people who wouldn\u2019t dream of calling themselves photographers were getting in touch. \u201cThey would say things like, \u2018This is us when we were punks in 1977.\u2019 At first, I didn\u2019t know what to do with them all, but then I had an idea.\u201d</p> <p>So the People\u2019s Archive was born \u2013 and it can be quite a thrill to have an image selected. \u201cI love the idea,\u201d says Jacqui Pollock, an NHS worker who submitted her late father\u2019s picture of her family out on the Salford streets. You can see why the shot caught Wright\u2019s eye: a row of mischievous looking tykes perch on a car bonnet clutching sweets, the yellow stain on the picture adding an extra layer of authenticity. Wright chose it as the lead image for <a href=\"https://britishculturearchive.co.uk/2019/11/12/british-culture-archive-at-the-social/\">his exhibition</a>, which would have surprised the man who took it.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a giant of a character, but he wasn\u2019t a photographer,\u201d says Pollock of her father. \u201cHe was a window-cleaner.\u201d How would he react to his work being shown alongside that of established photographers? \u201cHe\u2019d probably say, \u2018Fuckin\u2019 yuppies, the lot of them!\u2019 But he would be proud, really. Then he\u2019d turn up and cause chaos.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c4a535146f1a51db473c5ce955e3ddb9b0b13f3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4a535146f1a51db473c5ce955e3ddb9b0b13f3a/0_57_599_359/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jacqui Pollock and family in Salford, from the People\u2019s Archive on Instagram\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacqui Pollock and family in Salford, from the People\u2019s Archive on Instagram</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: British Culture Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being included in the archive has prompted Pollock to reconsider the photograph. \u201cI love that my parents got how special childhood is, that we had freedom and space to play.\u201d She talks of her \u201cbonkers Dad\u201d who \u201creally lived his life \u2013 despite many things that could have dragged him down, like breaking his back after falling off a building cleaning windows. He had a wisdom and playfulness that was infectious. He never allowed himself to lose his childlike ability to have fun. He was my hero.\u201d</p> <p>This is exactly what Wright wants: it\u2019s more than just a nostalgia trip. \u201cPeople say you shouldn\u2019t look back, but it can be good. Maybe you had ideas for your life back then that haven\u2019t panned out. I\u2019ve had messages from people saying the archive spurred them to change what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Was he surprised by the quality of the shots people had squirrelled away? \u201cYeah! But it\u2019s like if you go on holiday with your mates \u2013 you might take 500 photos and end up with one that really captures the time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbcdb42b2e73a83443c3f556aefef1b60fde6afc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbcdb42b2e73a83443c3f556aefef1b60fde6afc/0_0_567_592/479.jpg\" alt=\"Hulme.\" width=\"479\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More than a nostalgia trip \u2026 Hulme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy the People's Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One theme of the archive is a celebration of working-class culture. Wright\u2019s dad was a fireman who went on strike in the 1980s and he grew up with a fascination for the turmoil the country endured in that decade. \u201cI get messages asking why I don\u2019t feature any middle-class culture,\u201d Wright says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really know what that is. If someone wants to send me pictures of, say, the badminton casuals or whatever, then fine. But this is what I know.\u201d</p> <p>Although Wright wants the British Culture Archive to be politically neutral, he knows how toxic and divisive these times are. In such a climate, images celebrating working-class culture and multiculturalism really resonate, offering a reminder of a time when communities had stronger bonds.</p> <p>Take Richard Davis. His photos of the 1980s brutalist architecture of the Hulme area of Manchester, long since demolished, will feature in the exhibition. Davis says his photos generated a little local interest at the time but since the British Culture Archive shone a spotlight on them he has found wider recognition, including a book deal. \u201cNeedless to say this has really reignited my passion in photography,\u201d he says. \u201cSo much so that I\u2019ve set up my darkroom again.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibition/tish-murtha-works-1976-1991\">Tish Murtha</a> gained a similar leg-up: her black and white images of life in Newcastle and the north east of England were woefully overlooked during her lifetime. \u201cBecause she was a female photographer in the 70s, from a working-class background, I don\u2019t think she fancied her chances approaching publishing houses,\u201d says Wright.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73df4f17026ea87e15379bdf01c40896101e41f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73df4f17026ea87e15379bdf01c40896101e41f3/0_0_1800_1168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tish Murtha\u2019s Kids jumping onto Mattresses, 1980 \u00a9 Ella Murtha, All rights reserved.

Ultimately, he\u2019d like to secure a permanent space in his home city, where he can put on guest exhibitions and workshops for local kids. He remembers his own talent being snuffed out by his teachers, and wants to stamp out the notion that photography is only for certain people.</p> <p>So he\u2019ll keep on doing what he does best: scouring the web for hidden treasure as soon as his kids have been put to bed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like work,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a labour of love.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"http://www.thesocial.com/debut-exhibition-british-culture-archive-at-the-social/\">Images from the People\u2019s Archive are on display at the Social, London</a><a href=\"http://www.thesocial.com/debut-exhibition-british-culture-archive-at-the-social/\">, until the end of 2019</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "On a patch of grass on an estate, a kid attempts a dicey BMX stunt in front of his mates. In a barber\u2019s, a hairdresser puts the finishing touches to a spiky mohican. Outside a Jobcentre, teenagers kick a ball around. In front of pebble-dashed terraces, Ford Cortinas sit in a long line. Elsewhere, an old man sunbathes in nothing but pants, socks and shoes. To visit the online People\u2019s Archive is to travel back in time, to a Britain before smartphones made snappers of us all. Here you\u2019ll be reminded of some the country\u2019s most dazzling subcultures \u2013 from female punks to floppy-haired Spike Islanders \u2013 and get the sort of insight into working-class life that only the best documentary photographers can provide. Yet none of these images were taken by people who consider themselves photographers. Often holiday snaps, they were shot by amateurs, one great picture among countless humdrum efforts. This month, however, they will go on display in London, alongside work by far more established names. The project was never intended to take off. Paul Wright was an office worker in Manchester, his hands full looking after two small children, when he started posting the odd photograph he found online \u2013 he admits he didn\u2019t realise how copyright worked back then \u2013 to his Instagram page. \u201cAlongside pictures of my family,\u201d he laughs. This blossomed into the British Culture Archive, a dedicated Instagram and Twitter account for all the shots he was finding online. It soon found fans in the likes of Johnny Marr and Robert Carlyle. The latter actually got in touch to say: \u201cThanks for all the beautiful images. Haunting, evocative, vibrant \u2026 Love them all.\u201d \u201cI was pretty chuffed with that,\u201d says Wright when we meet today in a London cafe. \u201cIt made me realise I must be doing something right.\u201d Wright\u2019s plan was to focus on photographers whose work he thought had been overlooked or forgotten. But soon, people who wouldn\u2019t dream of calling themselves photographers were getting in touch. \u201cThey would say things like, \u2018This is us when we were punks in 1977.\u2019 At first, I didn\u2019t know what to do with them all, but then I had an idea.\u201d So the People\u2019s Archive was born \u2013 and it can be quite a thrill to have an image selected. \u201cI love the idea,\u201d says Jacqui Pollock, an NHS worker who submitted her late father\u2019s picture of her family out on the Salford streets. You can see why the shot caught Wright\u2019s eye: a row of mischievous looking tykes perch on a car bonnet clutching sweets, the yellow stain on the picture adding an extra layer of authenticity. Wright chose it as the lead image for his exhibition, which would have surprised the man who took it. \u201cHe was a giant of a character, but he wasn\u2019t a photographer,\u201d says Pollock of her father. \u201cHe was a window-cleaner.\u201d How would he react to his work being shown alongside that of established photographers? \u201cHe\u2019d probably say, \u2018Fuckin\u2019 yuppies, the lot of them!\u2019 But he would be proud, really. Then he\u2019d turn up and cause chaos.\u201d Being included in the archive has prompted Pollock to reconsider the photograph. \u201cI love that my parents got how special childhood is, that we had freedom and space to play.\u201d She talks of her \u201cbonkers Dad\u201d who \u201creally lived his life \u2013 despite many things that could have dragged him down, like breaking his back after falling off a building cleaning windows. He had a wisdom and playfulness that was infectious. He never allowed himself to lose his childlike ability to have fun. He was my hero.\u201d This is exactly what Wright wants: it\u2019s more than just a nostalgia trip. \u201cPeople say you shouldn\u2019t look back, but it can be good. Maybe you had ideas for your life back then that haven\u2019t panned out. I\u2019ve had messages from people saying the archive spurred them to change what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Was he surprised by the quality of the shots people had squirrelled away? \u201cYeah! But it\u2019s like if you go on holiday with your mates \u2013 you might take 500 photos and end up with one that really captures the time.\u201d One theme of the archive is a celebration of working-class culture. Wright\u2019s dad was a fireman who went on strike in the 1980s and he grew up with a fascination for the turmoil the country endured in that decade. \u201cI get messages asking why I don\u2019t feature any middle-class culture,\u201d Wright says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really know what that is. If someone wants to send me pictures of, say, the badminton casuals or whatever, then fine. But this is what I know.\u201d Although Wright wants the British Culture Archive to be politically neutral, he knows how toxic and divisive these times are. In such a climate, images celebrating working-class culture and multiculturalism really resonate, offering a reminder of a time when communities had stronger bonds. Take Richard Davis. His photos of the 1980s brutalist architecture of the Hulme area of Manchester, long since demolished, will feature in the exhibition. Davis says his photos generated a little local interest at the time but since the British Culture Archive shone a spotlight on them he has found wider recognition, including a book deal. \u201cNeedless to say this has really reignited my passion in photography,\u201d he says. \u201cSo much so that I\u2019ve set up my darkroom again.\u201d Tish Murtha gained a similar leg-up: her black and white images of life in Newcastle and the north east of England were woefully overlooked during her lifetime. \u201cBecause she was a female photographer in the 70s, from a working-class background, I don\u2019t think she fancied her chances approaching publishing houses,\u201d says Wright. Murtha died in 2014, but her daughter Ella made it her mission to get her work the recognition she thought it deserved. She recently published a book of her mum\u2019s work called Youth Unemployment. \u201cPaul called it his favourite book of 2017 and I suddenly started getting loads of new followers. A whole new audience was discovering my mam\u2019s work. Paul is doing it purely for the love of photography and the desire to preserve memories and culture for future generations.\u201d Wright wants to run the British Culture Archive \u2013 and it\u2019s People\u2019s Archive offshoot \u2013 full time. He has raised \u00a312,000 through crowdfunding, and is eyeing the Lottery Heritage Fund and other sponsorship options. Ultimately, he\u2019d like to secure a permanent space in his home city, where he can put on guest exhibitions and workshops for local kids. He remembers his own talent being snuffed out by his teachers, and wants to stamp out the notion that photography is only for certain people. So he\u2019ll keep on doing what he does best: scouring the web for hidden treasure as soon as his kids have been put to bed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like work,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a labour of love.\u201d Images from the People\u2019s Archive are on display at the Social, London, until the end of 2019",

Zoe\u2019s boss, for example, embodied a spicy blend of \u201cexhibiting presumably uncontrollable mood swings\u201d, \u201cmaking verbal put-downs\u201d and \u201cyelling, screaming and throwing tantrums\u201d.</p> <p>Zoe hadn\u2019t experienced anything like her boss\u2019s temper before. She remained silent as he ranted, often about things that had practically nothing to do with her work, like how annoyed he was that the coffee machine was malfunctioning, or that her whole generation was lazy and selfish. When he finished, she returned to her desk and struggled to regain her calm and focus for the rest of the day.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long before the stress Zoe felt from being yelled at began to affect her personal life.</p> <p>\u201cIt taxed my relationship with my boyfriend horribly,\u201d she says. \u201cHe spent a year listening to me cry and scream and get out all of my negative emotions that should have been aimed at my boss, and unfortunately it burnt him out, and it burnt out the whole relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Zoe quickly realized she had more to lose. \u201cI had lost energy for almost all the things that I loved doing,\u201d she says. \u201cI realized I was losing who I was because I was so unhappy.\u201d</p> <p>She soon quit.</p> <p>For those who have never had an abusive boss, Zoe\u2019s story may sound shocking \u2013 but situations like hers are not uncommon: <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236570/employees-lot-managers.aspx\">half</a> of both the US and <a href=\"https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/half-of-uk-managers-quit-due-to-bad-management/\">UK</a> workforces report having left a job because of a boss who yelled at or otherwise tormented employees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2019/mar/27/do-you-think-your-boss-is-a-bit-daft-youre-not-alone\">Is your boss a \u2018bit daft\u2019? Evidence suggests you\u2019re not alone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312478027_Abusive_Supervision\">2017 study</a> on abusive supervision found that people who have worked with a bullying boss report being more withdrawn and depressed, and that targets of abusive supervision report symptoms that bear \u201cstriking similarities to those diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder\u201d.</p> <p>Research has <a href=\"https://www.workplacebullying.org/2012-d/\">long supported</a> a link between workplace abuse and negative consequences for employees \u2013 if your boss is antagonistic, you\u2019re more likely to have anxiety and stress headaches, and lose sleep and your ability to concentrate. A new <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/2/230?utm_source=link_newsv9&amp;amp;utm_campaign=item_259850&amp;amp;utm_medium=copy\">study</a> from the International Journal of Environmental Research and public Health even found people coping with workplace abuse had a heightened risk of developing cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>In some cases, workplace abuse can be contagious within an organization. For instance, in 2013, the Journal of Applied Psychology <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23647209\">found</a> American soldiers in Iraq were more likely to admit to hitting and kicking innocent civilians and were less likely to report misdeeds by others when their supervisors were also cruel to them.</p> <p>According to the author and <a href=\"https://www.askamanager.org/\">Ask a Manager blogger</a> Alison Green, young or new employees can be especially impressionable: \u201cIf you have someone modeling how to manage while yelling, there is a high risk that [new managers] are going to pick that up as well,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople get their cues of what is and isn\u2019t acceptable from their managers and treating someone badly simply because you have power over them is pretty abusive.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to understand how victims of a bully boss can incur personal costs and lose their confidence and productivity. Yet <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31448931\">new research</a> from Villanova University reveals that it\u2019s not just workers who suffer when their boss is abusive \u2013 it may come as a relief to learn that bad managers themselves face consequences for being insufferable jerks.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we found is that the abusive boss is significantly hurt by their own behaviors,\u201d says the lead researcher, Dr Manuela Priesemuth. \u201cThey actually lose their social worth, which is basically feeling valued and appreciated by other people. And because they miss this crucial component of self-worth, they\u2019re also going to perform worse at their work.\u201d Basically, if you treat people badly they\u2019re not going to like you, and for social creatures like humans, being disliked is hurtful and disadvantageous.</p> <p>Is that good news? Well \u2026 kind of. Priesemuth found \u201cmany managers realize the social costs of their behavior and stop \u2013 unless they have psychopathic tendencies\u201d.</p> <p>Psychopaths, Priesemuth explains, \u201cdon\u2019t really care about social worth because they don\u2019t really care about other people.\u201d If your abusive boss belongs to the 15% of bad bosses who Priesemuth determined are psychopaths, that\u2019s \u201cvery bad\u201d, she says.</p> <p>So let\u2019s consider the worst-case scenario: what do you do if you are working with someone you suspect is pathologically callous, and, for whatever reason, you are unable or unwilling to simply quit?</p> <p>\u201cI would start by asking \u2013 am I safe having a gentle, backstage conversation with this person about their behavior?\u201d says Robert Sutton, Stanford professor and author of 2017\u2019s The Asshole Survival Guide: How to Deal with People who Treat You Like Dirt. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t feel safe, then who in your network can you recruit to confront this person with you?\u201d</p> <p>If confrontation is not going to fly, Sutton suggests what he calls \u201cmind tricks to save your soul\u201d: essentially cognitive behavioral therapy tactics involving mentally reframing a threat to reduce its impact.</p> <p>One such trick is just to see the existential absurdity of your torment in the context of the fleeting nature of time. \u201cWhen something\u2019s unpleasant, you remind yourself that this is just temporary, and that \u2018when I look back at this, a year or two from now, it\u2019ll just be nothing\u2019,\u201d says Sutton.</p> <p>Yet if the idea of needing to dissociate from your dreary plight as a beleaguered office grub just to survive seems a little too soul-destroying to be a viable solution, studies suggest you can, in fact, fight fire with fire. Research from 2014 <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/peps.12094\">found</a> that employees with hostile bosses are better off when they respond with passive aggression.</p> <p>The study, conducted by Professor Bennett Tepper of Ohio State University, found that employees who responded passive-aggressively to their abhorrent bosses by ignoring them, feigning ignorance of the cause of their rage, or just giving a half-hearted effort were \u201cless likely to see themselves as victims\u201d.</p> <p>When employees retaliate against bad bosses, they suffered less psychological distress and job dissatisfaction. What\u2019s more, these employees didn\u2019t feel like their reciprocal hostility negatively affected their careers \u2013 rather, Tepper posits they may in fact enjoy increased admiration from their colleagues, thereby becoming more committed to their workplace.</p> <p>Handling an abusive boss, then, is not unlike dealing with a schoolyard bully: if you can\u2019t walk away or remain unbothered by their antics, it may be best to fight back.</p>",

A 2017 study on abusive supervision found that people who have worked with a bullying boss report being more withdrawn and depressed, and that targets of abusive supervision report symptoms that bear \u201cstriking similarities to those diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder\u201d. Research has long supported a link between workplace abuse and negative consequences for employees \u2013 if your boss is antagonistic, you\u2019re more likely to have anxiety and stress headaches, and lose sleep and your ability to concentrate. A new study from the International Journal of Environmental Research and public Health even found people coping with workplace abuse had a heightened risk of developing cardiovascular disease. In some cases, workplace abuse can be contagious within an organization. For instance, in 2013, the Journal of Applied Psychology found American soldiers in Iraq were more likely to admit to hitting and kicking innocent civilians and were less likely to report misdeeds by others when their supervisors were also cruel to them. According to the author and Ask a Manager blogger Alison Green, young or new employees can be especially impressionable: \u201cIf you have someone modeling how to manage while yelling, there is a high risk that [new managers] are going to pick that up as well,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople get their cues of what is and isn\u2019t acceptable from their managers and treating someone badly simply because you have power over them is pretty abusive.\u201d It\u2019s easy to understand how victims of a bully boss can incur personal costs and lose their confidence and productivity. Yet new research from Villanova University reveals that it\u2019s not just workers who suffer when their boss is abusive \u2013 it may come as a relief to learn that bad managers themselves face consequences for being insufferable jerks. \u201cWhat we found is that the abusive boss is significantly hurt by their own behaviors,\u201d says the lead researcher, Dr Manuela Priesemuth. \u201cThey actually lose their social worth, which is basically feeling valued and appreciated by other people. And because they miss this crucial component of self-worth, they\u2019re also going to perform worse at their work.\u201d Basically, if you treat people badly they\u2019re not going to like you, and for social creatures like humans, being disliked is hurtful and disadvantageous. Is that good news? Well \u2026 kind of. Priesemuth found \u201cmany managers realize the social costs of their behavior and stop \u2013 unless they have psychopathic tendencies\u201d. Psychopaths, Priesemuth explains, \u201cdon\u2019t really care about social worth because they don\u2019t really care about other people.\u201d If your abusive boss belongs to the 15% of bad bosses who Priesemuth determined are psychopaths, that\u2019s \u201cvery bad\u201d, she says. So let\u2019s consider the worst-case scenario: what do you do if you are working with someone you suspect is pathologically callous, and, for whatever reason, you are unable or unwilling to simply quit? \u201cI would start by asking \u2013 am I safe having a gentle, backstage conversation with this person about their behavior?\u201d says Robert Sutton, Stanford professor and author of 2017\u2019s The Asshole Survival Guide: How to Deal with People who Treat You Like Dirt. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t feel safe, then who in your network can you recruit to confront this person with you?\u201d If confrontation is not going to fly, Sutton suggests what he calls \u201cmind tricks to save your soul\u201d: essentially cognitive behavioral therapy tactics involving mentally reframing a threat to reduce its impact. One such trick is just to see the existential absurdity of your torment in the context of the fleeting nature of time. \u201cWhen something\u2019s unpleasant, you remind yourself that this is just temporary, and that \u2018when I look back at this, a year or two from now, it\u2019ll just be nothing\u2019,\u201d says Sutton. Yet if the idea of needing to dissociate from your dreary plight as a beleaguered office grub just to survive seems a little too soul-destroying to be a viable solution, studies suggest you can, in fact, fight fire with fire. Research from 2014 found that employees with hostile bosses are better off when they respond with passive aggression. The study, conducted by Professor Bennett Tepper of Ohio State University, found that employees who responded passive-aggressively to their abhorrent bosses by ignoring them, feigning ignorance of the cause of their rage, or just giving a half-hearted effort were \u201cless likely to see themselves as victims\u201d. When employees retaliate against bad bosses, they suffered less psychological distress and job dissatisfaction. What\u2019s more, these employees didn\u2019t feel like their reciprocal hostility negatively affected their careers \u2013 rather, Tepper posits they may in fact enjoy increased admiration from their colleagues, thereby becoming more committed to their workplace. Handling an abusive boss, then, is not unlike dealing with a schoolyard bully: if you can\u2019t walk away or remain unbothered by their antics, it may be best to fight back.",

NT police constable Zachary Rolfe, 28, has been charged with one count of murder. But beyond the charge against the policeman, serious concerns have been raised about the way police and health officials dealt with the shooting, including their treatment of Walker\u2019s relatives, who were left waiting for hours outside the police station seeking answers about his condition. Walker died inside the police station from his injuries but did not receive critical emergency care, and his family were not notified until hours after his death.

The chicest Halloween costume in 2019 was a slinky wild west satin shirt and fringe-embellished mask that covered the wearer\u2019s entire face, save for a tantalising glimpse of chin. Your party wasn\u2019t a party unless someone was sporting the Lone Ranger-moseying-down-to-Torture Garden look of country crooner Orville Peck. \u201cI heard people say they were going to do it, but I thought there would be just five or six,\u201d explains a gravel-voiced Peck down the line from Copenhagen as he nears the end of his European tour. \u201cBut if you look at the tagged photos on my Instagram it was hundreds and hundreds of people of every age, gender and race, including a woman that looks like she\u2019s probably in her 80s and a Brazilian influencer in a Swarovski crystal mask.\u201d That so many want to pay tribute to the mysterious Canadian artist and his sumptuous style is no surprise. Since the March release of his velvety debut album, Pony, the pseudonymous, gay singer-songwriter, whose real identity remains a mystery, has become something of a cult figure for the LGBT community and country fans alike. Rapper Lil Nas X might have updated the genre for an LGBT audience with his smash-hit Old Town Road, while the Grammy-winning Kacey Musgraves is an outspoken ally, but country boys who sing about other boys are still few and far between, with Peck as their leading light.

      "bodyText": "When she was younger, Sophie Dahl\u2019s stepgrandmother used to tease her: \u201cWho do you think you are, Madame Badobedah?\u201d The name (which \u201crhymes with ooh la la\u201d) stuck, and has now inspired the model turned author\u2019s first foray into children\u2019s writing. Opening this longer-form picture book, it\u2019s hard to resist the urge to sniff out traces of a certain other grandparent. But with Madame Badobedah (Walker), Dahl junior proves she has a playful and beguiling voice all of her own. Mabel is an only child whose parents run a seaside B&amp;B. In one exquisite picture, illustrator Lauren O\u2019Hara depicts the Mermaid hotel as a sort of hive buzzing with boxers, band members and other intriguing characters. Mabel is not impressed when a rude old lady moves in with 23 bags, hundreds of trinkets and a strange tortoise called Boris. She turns detective, concluding that the new guest, whom she names Madame Badobedah, is a villain. But in time they strike up a friendship and find themselves venturing through a Narnia-esque cupboard. Pairing Dahl with O\u2019Hara is a masterstroke. Her painterly images are colourful and chic but mysterious, just like Madame Badobedah, whose life story, refreshingly, is never fully revealed. Hopefully sequels await. Other memorable girl protagonists join Mabel this season. Sofia Valdez, Future Prez (Abrams) is the latest in Andrea Beaty and David Roberts\u2019s bestselling Questioneers series, featuring inspiring children from Miss Lila Greer\u2019s grade two class (first came Iggy Peck, Architect). When her beloved Abuelo hurts his ankle at the local landfill, Sofia finds herself campaigning for this dirty \u201cMount Trashmore\u201d to be turned into a park. Partly a response to the political climate in the US, the book shows Sofia, a child of immigrants, overcoming obstacles becoming a great leader.

      "body": "<p>Just 37 miles but light years away from the stadium at which Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson put on a show for thousands of delirious fans, Washington played the New York Jets before thousands of empty red, yellow and orange seats. The Jets \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/07/new-york-jets-washington-dolphins-bengals-worst-team-in-the-nfl\">a terrible team themselves</a> \u2013 won, 34-17, and the score flattered Washington.</p> <p>Washington\u2019s record fell to 1-9, and they will continue the season with another home game Sunday against Detroit. The bookies have already made the Lions (3-6-1) a three-point favorite, and resale tickets are available on StubHub for as little as $10. Washington DC has a lousy team, but it is actually worse than that: fans are beyond angry. They don\u2019t care.</p> <p>And why should they? Asked at a postgame news conference what message he\u2019d given his team, Bill Callahan, who once led the Oakland Raiders to the Super Bowl but has been assigned the unpleasant task of serving as Washington\u2019s interim coach, replied, \u201cI just let them know there\u2019s no give-up in myself.\u201d Team motto: <em>No Give-Up.</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/19/kansas-city-chiefs-los-angeles-chargers-mexico-city-nfl\">Philip Rivers intercepted four times as Chiefs beat Chargers in Mexico City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is the saddest part of all. Washington used to love its NFL team more than any other big-league team that represented the District of Columbia. But Ol\u2019 DC has moved on. The NHL\u2019s Capitals won their first Stanley Cup in 2018, and the Nationals last month won the city\u2019s first World Series since 1924. The Mystics won the WNBA championship last month. The one team that can rival the city\u2019s NFL team for incompetency are the Wizards, who missed the NBA playoffs last season and already look off pace in the early stages of the 2019-20 campaign.</p> <p>Washington fans love to point out that the football team has had seven losing seasons and zero playoff victories since team president Bruce Allen, the son of the legendary former coach George Allen, joined the team as a general manager in 2010. But the fans have also never liked Dan Snyder, who has owned the team since 1999. It\u2019s easy to see why: <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/why-wont-washington-redskins-change-their-name-cleveland-wahoo-out-worth-1160263\">he refuses to change </a>the team\u2019s obsolete and racist nickname, maintaining that it is a tradition; has overseen several free-agent signings at what were considered to be exorbitant salaries, only to see those players fail to produce; and hired, then promoted, the widely reviled Allen. To cap it all, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/02/AR2009090203887.html\">he once infamously sued</a> season-ticket holders who asked to be released from multi-year contracts.</p> <p>Add a medical mess that is a public-relations disaster. Trent Williams, the much-admired veteran offensive tackle, ended a long holdout in October but said he would never play for the team again because team doctors <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/us/trent-williams-cancer-scare-washington-holdout-trnd/index.html\">had ignored a growth on his head</a> that turned out to be cancerous. \u201cThere\u2019s no trust there,\u201d said Williams, who has pointed most of his anger at Allen.</p> <p>\u201cWashington has discovered that champions can live here. So why tolerate, let alone support, an atrociously run and constantly embarrassing franchise with a moral compass that is as twisted as a corkscrew?\u201d Thomas Boswell, the Washington Post\u2019s veteran sports columnist and Washington native, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/what-once-seemed-impossible-is-now-undeniable-the-redskins-have-lost-washington/2019/11/17/c215e596-0975-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html\">wrote in Monday\u2019s paper</a>.</p> <p>And it won\u2019t get better soon. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/07/washington-fire-jay-gruden-5am-meeting-nfl\">The team fired coach Jay Gruden</a>, and the rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins has been given the rest of the season to work on his game. He has promise, but he also has a long way to go.

      "bodyText": "Just 37 miles but light years away from the stadium at which Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson put on a show for thousands of delirious fans, Washington played the New York Jets before thousands of empty red, yellow and orange seats. The Jets \u2013 a terrible team themselves \u2013 won, 34-17, and the score flattered Washington. Washington\u2019s record fell to 1-9, and they will continue the season with another home game Sunday against Detroit. The bookies have already made the Lions (3-6-1) a three-point favorite, and resale tickets are available on StubHub for as little as $10. Washington DC has a lousy team, but it is actually worse than that: fans are beyond angry. They don\u2019t care. And why should they? Asked at a postgame news conference what message he\u2019d given his team, Bill Callahan, who once led the Oakland Raiders to the Super Bowl but has been assigned the unpleasant task of serving as Washington\u2019s interim coach, replied, \u201cI just let them know there\u2019s no give-up in myself.\u201d Team motto: No Give-Up. That is the saddest part of all. Washington used to love its NFL team more than any other big-league team that represented the District of Columbia. But Ol\u2019 DC has moved on. The NHL\u2019s Capitals won their first Stanley Cup in 2018, and the Nationals last month won the city\u2019s first World Series since 1924. The Mystics won the WNBA championship last month. The one team that can rival the city\u2019s NFL team for incompetency are the Wizards, who missed the NBA playoffs last season and already look off pace in the early stages of the 2019-20 campaign. Washington fans love to point out that the football team has had seven losing seasons and zero playoff victories since team president Bruce Allen, the son of the legendary former coach George Allen, joined the team as a general manager in 2010. But the fans have also never liked Dan Snyder, who has owned the team since 1999. It\u2019s easy to see why: he refuses to change the team\u2019s obsolete and racist nickname, maintaining that it is a tradition; has overseen several free-agent signings at what were considered to be exorbitant salaries, only to see those players fail to produce; and hired, then promoted, the widely reviled Allen. To cap it all, he once infamously sued season-ticket holders who asked to be released from multi-year contracts. Add a medical mess that is a public-relations disaster. Trent Williams, the much-admired veteran offensive tackle, ended a long holdout in October but said he would never play for the team again because team doctors had ignored a growth on his head that turned out to be cancerous. \u201cThere\u2019s no trust there,\u201d said Williams, who has pointed most of his anger at Allen. \u201cWashington has discovered that champions can live here. So why tolerate, let alone support, an atrociously run and constantly embarrassing franchise with a moral compass that is as twisted as a corkscrew?\u201d Thomas Boswell, the Washington Post\u2019s veteran sports columnist and Washington native, wrote in Monday\u2019s paper. And it won\u2019t get better soon. The team fired coach Jay Gruden, and the rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins has been given the rest of the season to work on his game. He has promise, but he also has a long way to go. Haskins threw for 214 yards Sunday, but all but 81 of those yards and both of his touchdowns came after the Jets took a 34-3 lead. \u201cLife is hard. I have to work harder,\u201d Haskins said in a postgame news conference. The only team with a worse record than Washington in the NFL are the 0-10 Cincinnati Bengals, whose best chance to win a game appears to be a 22 December game in Miami against the Dolphins, who have overcome an 0-7 start to win two of their last three. So Washington may not even get the No1 overall draft pick by tanking \u2013 and they have their future QB, anyway. Washington thought they had a solid quarterback for the long haul when they acquired Alex Smith after the 2017 season in a trade with Kansas City. But Smith suffered a horrific leg injury last November after leading Washington to six victories in their first nine games. Washington have won two of 17 games since. Smith hopes to return, but his career may be over, and Washington moved on accordingly by selecting Haskins in the first-round of this year\u2019s draft. Football is cruel that way. But Washington added little in free agency other than safety Landon Collins, who could be seen slamming his hands against his helmet in disgust after the Jets took a 20-3 lead on Sunday. \u201cWe had a fighting chance against the Jets, a team that\u2019s trying to do the same thing we\u2019re doing, trying to get a win,\u201d Collins, a former Giants player, said after the game. \u201cFrom that standpoint, [I\u2019m] just kind of down because they\u2019re a beatable team, and we didn\u2019t come here with our A game and put our effort out on the field.\u201d Washington were cooked by the middle of the second quarter on Sunday.

A 25-nation <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2018/10/01/trumps-international-ratings-remain-low-especially-among-key-allies/\">Pew survey</a> last year found, overall, that 70% of respondents had no confidence in Trump\u2019s leadership. While a majority still held a favourable view of the US, unfavourable views were up sharply from the Obama era. About 70% said the US under Trump did not take sufficient account of the interests of other countries and was doing less to address international problems.</p> <p>Trump won\u2019t be around forever. But this collapse in trust may have lasting, long-term implications for transatlantic ties. A survey of 60,000 people in 14 EU member states published this fall by the European Council on Foreign Relations <a href=\"https://qz.com/1705388/europeans-dont-trust-the-us-or-trump-poll-says/\">found</a> most Europeans \u201cno longer believe the US can serve as a guarantor of their security\u201d. Europe and America risk drifting even further apart in 2020.</p> <p>Not all this angst can be laid at Trump\u2019s door. But his personal hostility to the EU and individual European leaders, his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html\">denigration of Nato</a>, his bypassing of his own intelligence agencies and state department, his collaboration with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, and his willingness to betray staunch allies such as Syria\u2019s Kurds are undoubtedly stoking fears about US reliability in security matters. Trump\u2019s hope of scoring a big pre-election foreign policy \u201csuccess\u201d adds to the general nervousness.</p> <p>Some of these fears are structural. Europeans, including Britons, are alarmed by Trump\u2019s disdain for the UN and other multilateral decision-making bodies, and his readiness to ignore international treaties. His go-it-alone chauvinism weakens US leverage. It also shows ingrained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/14/trump-american-foreign-policy-unstable-confrontational\">disrespect</a> for the global rules-based order that has sustained western liberal democracy in the postwar era.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s admiration for authoritarian regimes and \u201cstrongman\u201d leaders such as Putin and China\u2019s Xi Jinping, when set alongside his electoral shenanigans at home, has strengthened the view that he is no friend to democracy \u2013 at a time when democracies everywhere are <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/06/06/democracy-and-its-discontents/\">under sustained attack</a>.</p> <p>The US under Trump\u2019s baleful tutelage is not only losing influence and respect. It is also, increasingly, a source of and contributor to global woes and instabilities. His unilateral, nationalistic, self-defeating approach threatens deepening trouble across the board next year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How much longer Nato can last as a coherent force, given Trump\u2019s relentless antipathy, is an open question</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unresolved issues around Iran\u2019s and North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions are one obvious 2020 flashpoint. Trump\u2019s interventions to date have made matters worse. Now mounting anger and frustration in both countries could bring tensions to a head. In Iran\u2019s case, such escalation may quickly draw in Saudi Arabia and Israel \u2013 and Turkey too, given Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-syria-war-crimes-erdogan-refugees-kurdish-turkey\">craven appeasement</a> of Ankara after its invasion of Syria.</p> <p>How much longer Nato can last as a coherent force, given Trump\u2019s relentless antipathy, is an open question. It is one Russia will be constantly testing as it expands its influence in the Middle East, builds up its conventional and nuclear forces, and intimidates neighbors such as Ukraine and the Baltic states.</p> <p>Another fraught 2020 issue is whether a worldwide recession can be avoided as Trump pursues his trade vendetta with China, market confidence falls and debt levels (including the projected $1tn 2020 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/us/politics/deficit-will-reach-1-trillion-next-year-budget-office-predicts.html\">US deficit</a>) rise. Judging by his recent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50350545\">belligerence</a>, Mike Pompeo, America\u2019s undiplomatic chief diplomat, appears determined to trigger a new cold war with Beijing. Harsh words could easily turn to blows over Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p> <p>Yet more pressing still, in the wake of Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html\">renunciation</a> of the Paris climate accord, is genuinely urgent action to tackle the environmental crisis engulfing the planet, evidenced most recently by record floods in Britain, lethal wildfires in California and Australia and the ongoing mass extinction of species from the Arctic to the Amazon.</p> <p>In short, Trump has an awful lot to answer for in 2020. America\u2019s friends fervently hope America\u2019s voters make America great again \u2013 by agreeing to dump Trump. Think of it as your gift to the world.</p>",

About 70% said the US under Trump did not take sufficient account of the interests of other countries and was doing less to address international problems. Trump won\u2019t be around forever. But this collapse in trust may have lasting, long-term implications for transatlantic ties. A survey of 60,000 people in 14 EU member states published this fall by the European Council on Foreign Relations found most Europeans \u201cno longer believe the US can serve as a guarantor of their security\u201d. Europe and America risk drifting even further apart in 2020. Not all this angst can be laid at Trump\u2019s door. But his personal hostility to the EU and individual European leaders, his denigration of Nato, his bypassing of his own intelligence agencies and state department, his collaboration with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, and his willingness to betray staunch allies such as Syria\u2019s Kurds are undoubtedly stoking fears about US reliability in security matters. Trump\u2019s hope of scoring a big pre-election foreign policy \u201csuccess\u201d adds to the general nervousness. Some of these fears are structural. Europeans, including Britons, are alarmed by Trump\u2019s disdain for the UN and other multilateral decision-making bodies, and his readiness to ignore international treaties. His go-it-alone chauvinism weakens US leverage. It also shows ingrained disrespect for the global rules-based order that has sustained western liberal democracy in the postwar era. Trump\u2019s admiration for authoritarian regimes and \u201cstrongman\u201d leaders such as Putin and China\u2019s Xi Jinping, when set alongside his electoral shenanigans at home, has strengthened the view that he is no friend to democracy \u2013 at a time when democracies everywhere are under sustained attack. The US under Trump\u2019s baleful tutelage is not only losing influence and respect. It is also, increasingly, a source of and contributor to global woes and instabilities. His unilateral, nationalistic, self-defeating approach threatens deepening trouble across the board next year. Unresolved issues around Iran\u2019s and North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions are one obvious 2020 flashpoint. Trump\u2019s interventions to date have made matters worse. Now mounting anger and frustration in both countries could bring tensions to a head. In Iran\u2019s case, such escalation may quickly draw in Saudi Arabia and Israel \u2013 and Turkey too, given Trump\u2019s craven appeasement of Ankara after its invasion of Syria. How much longer Nato can last as a coherent force, given Trump\u2019s relentless antipathy, is an open question. It is one Russia will be constantly testing as it expands its influence in the Middle East, builds up its conventional and nuclear forces, and intimidates neighbors such as Ukraine and the Baltic states. Another fraught 2020 issue is whether a worldwide recession can be avoided as Trump pursues his trade vendetta with China, market confidence falls and debt levels (including the projected $1tn 2020 US deficit) rise. Judging by his recent belligerence, Mike Pompeo, America\u2019s undiplomatic chief diplomat, appears determined to trigger a new cold war with Beijing. Harsh words could easily turn to blows over Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea. Yet more pressing still, in the wake of Trump\u2019s renunciation of the Paris climate accord, is genuinely urgent action to tackle the environmental crisis engulfing the planet, evidenced most recently by record floods in Britain, lethal wildfires in California and Australia and the ongoing mass extinction of species from the Arctic to the Amazon. In short, Trump has an awful lot to answer for in 2020. America\u2019s friends fervently hope America\u2019s voters make America great again \u2013 by agreeing to dump Trump. Think of it as your gift to the world.",

      "bodyText": "Bill Gates is backing a new venture which aims to turn sunlight into a source of heat exceeding 1,000C that could help replace fossil fuels. The world\u2019s richest man is joining investors behind Heliogen, the first company to concentrate sunlight to reach temperatures that are high enough to power heavy industry without carbon emissions. The technology could even reach temperatures of 1,500C to split hydrogen molecules from water to create a fossil-free gas to warm homes, fuel cars and power factories. Bill Gross, the chief executive and founder of California-based Heliogen, said the company represents a technological leap forward in tackling the emissions from industry and transport that make up 75% of the world\u2019s carbon footprint. The company uses software to align a large array of mirrors to reflect sunlight to a target, creating a source of heat almost three times as intense as previous commercial solar systems. Gross said creating low-cost, ultra-high-temperature process heat gives the company an opportunity to make meaningful contributions to solving the climate crisis. The technology can generate temperatures high enough to manufacture cement without fossil fuels. Cement is the world\u2019s third largest source of emissions behind oil and coal, and its production is expected to boom due to urbanisation in developing countries and economic growth. If allowed to continue unchecked, cement production would pose a major threat to the targets set by the Paris agreement, which aims to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Heliogen has the backing of private equity investors and entrepreneurs who believe its technology could help the most polluting industries to cut their carbon emissions. Early investors in Heliogen include Gates, the venture capital firm Neotribe and the billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong\u2019s Nant Capital. Gates said he was pleased to be an initial backer of a \u201cpromising development in the quest to one day replace fossil fuel\u201d. \u201cToday, industrial processes like those used to make cement, steel, and other materials are responsible for more than a fifth of all emissions,\u201d he added. \u201cThese materials are everywhere in our lives but we don\u2019t have any proven breakthroughs that will give us affordable, zero-carbon versions of them.

      "bodyText": "After Alan Wheatley was widowed last year, it looked as if he would have to go into a care home. Having had a stroke in 2013, he found himself unable to cope on his own and took to sleeping in his lounge. On several occasions, he ended up in hospital after falling. Just when residential care looked inevitable, Wheatley heard about a new extra-care housing scheme opening on his doorstep in Kingsthorpe, Northampton. He knew the location well \u2013 he played darts in the social club that used to occupy part of the site \u2013 and the idea of having his own flat with care and support on demand appealed to his desire for independence while offering the assurance of help if needed. Wheatley, 69, became one of the first residents to move into Balmoral Place, a development of 80 flats, and has since made himself invaluable. Not only does he do a lot of internet shopping and form-filling for fellow residents, but he has become a busy volunteer gardener tending the borders, tubs and hanging baskets around the scheme. He even has a seedling propagator in his flat. \u201cIt all started when I asked if they\u2019d mind if I did a bit of weeding,\u201d says Wheatley, a former mechanic at the Aston Martin car plant in Newport Pagnell. \u201cThen they asked if I wanted some equipment. I\u2019ve got 150 primroses coming this week, which I\u2019ve paid for myself for the moment, but we\u2019re raising a fund to put towards the flowers.\u201d When he arrived, he had four visits a day by the on-site care team. Now he has none, though all flats have a 24-hour emergency call system. Would he have settled equally well in a care home? \u201cNo. It would have been detrimental to the way I live, to my quality of life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the flexibility here that makes all the difference.\u201d Balmoral Place has been developed by housing and care provider Mears Group, which has had a difficult time trying to establish itself in the homecare market. It is now focusing more on extra-care, which it sees as tapping into huge demand from older people like Wheatley who want the combination of their own front door, company when they want it and the security of knowing care is on hand. \u201cApart from the fact that housing-with-care is really working for us, it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d says Alan Long, Mears executive director. \u201cOne real contrast for us is recruitment: the biggest single issue for staff is working with the same service users, so it becomes more than a job.

Towns and villages in Greece, the Balkans and Italy are emptying as young people head to nearby cities or to northern Europe in search of work. But here, the opposite is happening. The houses, businesses and infrastructure of Kamza, which has a population of around 250,000, would not exist if it wasn\u2019t for Albania\u2019s several-million-strong diaspora.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have a deep love for this city because they built it themselves,\u201d says former deputy mayor Tomorr Kotarja. \u201cEveryone has made their contribution. In older cities you are just a citizen, but here you have your imprint.\u201d</p> <p>Kamza\u2019s history is as chaotic as its streets. During the communist period it was state-owned agricultural land with around 5,000 inhabitants. Internal migration was banned by the regime, and workers in the mines and farms of the north were completely isolated from the rest of the country. \u201cThe propaganda stated that living in rural areas was the best because the air was fresher,\u201d says Kotarja.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ffba4864c9346772d5f12f62d3ed35b6cf6e217\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ffba4864c9346772d5f12f62d3ed35b6cf6e217/0_215_4272_2563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ismail Veizi and his family\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ismail Veizi has extended his house from two rooms to four storeys with money his son made as a painter and decorator in Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Bateman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But when the Democratic Party of Albania came to power in 1992, rural workers set off towards the capital in their thousands.</p> <p>\u201cLife in the north was hard,\u201d says former miner Ismail Veizi, who arrived that year with his wife and two sons. \u201cI was in hospital many times because of the chemicals I breathed in. It was minus 20 degrees in winter and we had to travel far to get firewood. Coming here was a matter of life and death.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting in his clean, comfortable house close to the city centre, he describes how the neighbourhood was just fields when he arrived. \u201cThere were some people living in the stables,\u201d he says. \u201cOthers had marked out space for their house in the field.

      "bodyText": "Driving out of Albania\u2019s capital, Tirana, into nearby Kamza, blocks of communist-era apartments give way to a chaotic jumble of houses of different colours, shapes and heights. Many are half-finished or being rebuilt. Some are just exposed brick, while others are painted near-fluorescent greens, oranges or yellows. \u201cPeople pay a lot of attention to the aesthetics of the houses,\u201d says Njazi Murrja, who lives locally. \u201cThey show the culture and the wealth of the family.\u201d On the crowded pavements, street-sellers, children and groups of old men playing dominoes jostle for space. The roads are named after celebrities or international cities; on our way to a higgledy-piggledy street market we pass by Rruja New York (New York Street). If it all sounds rather informal, that\u2019s because it is \u2013 this former slum has been transformed by its residents over the past 10 years into Albania\u2019s fastest-growing city, all thanks to money sent home by relatives working abroad. Throughout eastern and southern Europe, emigration is dramatically changing communities. Towns and villages in Greece, the Balkans and Italy are emptying as young people head to nearby cities or to northern Europe in search of work. But here, the opposite is happening. The houses, businesses and infrastructure of Kamza, which has a population of around 250,000, would not exist if it wasn\u2019t for Albania\u2019s several-million-strong diaspora. \u201cPeople have a deep love for this city because they built it themselves,\u201d says former deputy mayor Tomorr Kotarja. \u201cEveryone has made their contribution. In older cities you are just a citizen, but here you have your imprint.\u201d Kamza\u2019s history is as chaotic as its streets. During the communist period it was state-owned agricultural land with around 5,000 inhabitants. Internal migration was banned by the regime, and workers in the mines and farms of the north were completely isolated from the rest of the country. \u201cThe propaganda stated that living in rural areas was the best because the air was fresher,\u201d says Kotarja. But when the Democratic Party of Albania came to power in 1992, rural workers set off towards the capital in their thousands. \u201cLife in the north was hard,\u201d says former miner Ismail Veizi, who arrived that year with his wife and two sons. \u201cI was in hospital many times because of the chemicals I breathed in. It was minus 20 degrees in winter and we had to travel far to get firewood. Coming here was a matter of life and death.\u201d Sitting in his clean, comfortable house close to the city centre, he describes how the neighbourhood was just fields when he arrived. \u201cThere were some people living in the stables,\u201d he says. \u201cOthers had marked out space for their house in the field. Some had come as a family, some a whole clan.\u201d He built a simple two-room structure, with no sewage system or electricity. Water had to be collected from a well an hour away. As well as poor conditions, migrants from the north also struggled to adjust culturally \u2013 they spoke a different dialect to the people in Tirana, and for centuries had maintained a traditional clan system. In 1995 police tried to clear the settlements, but gave up after encountering fierce resistance. \u201cThe people from Tirana looked at us with a certain contempt,\u201d says Kotarja. \u201cSo we worked hard to improve our position.\u201d Faced with a lack of jobs, migration became residents\u2019 primary option, starting with Greece and Italy. Today, Kotarja says, most favour the UK, even though a place on a lorry costs around \u20ac15,000 (\u00a312,800). The attraction comes from the network of Albanians already settled there, and the fact that they have experienced less discrimination than in other countries. \u201cAll their money went into the houses,\u201d says Kotarja. \u201cPeople started bringing their expertise back from outside and built bigger and better.\u201d Murrja, a teacher, moved to Kamza from Diber in 2004 with money earned by his eldest son in Greece. \u201cMy aim was to educate my children here,\u201d he says. \u201cThe conditions were terrible in the villages, there was no infrastructure.

The city began to rapidly formalise once it became its own municipality in 2007. \u201cThe changes happened very fast,\u201d says Kotarja. A water supply was built with the help of an NGO, and the central government provided money to build roads and schools. Legislation formalised building construction. Some new factories and businesses provide jobs, but with unemployment still around 50%, emigration remains the most popular source of income. The situation places strain on family relationships \u2013 Veizi\u2019s daughter-in-law, Xhuljana, raises her child alone for half the year while her husband works in Germany. The government still struggles to collect taxes on the money sent from abroad, which is largely made on the black market. \u201cMigration has increased since 2013,\u201d says Kotarja. \u201cPeople see no hope or opportunity in Albania.\u201d Albanians are currently caught entering the UK illegally more than any other nationality.

A torchbearer for the Conservatives\u2019 academy and free school policy, he founded and led one of the first free secondary schools \u2013 the Bedford free school \u2013 then left to head up PTE, the Parents and Teachers for Excellence group, which campaigns for stricter discipline and more facts in the curriculum. He stepped down last month to pursue another campaign.</p> <p>\u201cBut, in fact, the Conservatives have got a great story to tell about education,\u201d he says. \u201cTake the reform of the curriculum and exam system \u2013 no one wants to undo that now.

      "bodyText": "Mark Lehain, 41 Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate (PPC) for Newcastle-upon-Tyne North (Labour majority 10,349) \u201cIt\u2019s not been easy being a Tory in education over the last few years,\u201d says Lehain, a former maths teacher, with a sigh. A torchbearer for the Conservatives\u2019 academy and free school policy, he founded and led one of the first free secondary schools \u2013 the Bedford free school \u2013 then left to head up PTE, the Parents and Teachers for Excellence group, which campaigns for stricter discipline and more facts in the curriculum. He stepped down last month to pursue another campaign. \u201cBut, in fact, the Conservatives have got a great story to tell about education,\u201d he says. \u201cTake the reform of the curriculum and exam system \u2013 no one wants to undo that now. The academy programme is about enabling great school teachers and leaders to have the biggest impact, free from interference from local councils and politicians.\u201d The father of four girls, all at state schools, opposes grammar schools \u2013 though he sees no point in dismantling the ones that are left. And he is no fan of independent schools, though he says parents have \u201ca natural right to decide how to educate their child\u201d. He doesn\u2019t deny that teacher recruitment and retention have \u201cgot a lot tougher\u201d but says this is a problem across the developed world. \u201cHeavy workload is not caused any more by the Department for Education or Ofsted because they have said they are not going to tell schools how to run themselves. Headteachers have been given the powers to reduce workload and improve behaviour and I think this will make a massive difference, plus raising teacher starting salaries to \u00a330,000,\u201d he says. What about school funding? \u201cThere is no doubt that funding has got really tight over the last few years but we have to remember that in 2010 there was no money, and education was well protected up to 2015 compared with other parts of the public sector,\u201d he says. \u201cNow the public finances are on a more stable footing there will be an extra \u00a314bn over three years and it will be used to help level up the lowest-funded parts of the country where schools get less money because of historic inequalities in the funding formula.\u201d \u201cI know I am going to get flak over what I have said about funding but most education cash goes on staff and, compared to many people in the country, teachers are well paid and have good pensions. You have to look at the big picture \u2013 and that isn\u2019t always popular.\u201d Jackie Schneider, 56 Labour PPC for Wimbledon (Conservative majority 5,622) The toxicity of testing and league tables is diverting schools from their real purpose of helping children reach their full potential, says the primary music teacher. \u201cWe don\u2019t rank fire stations. We expect every fire station to be first class and the same should go for schools. If a school isn\u2019t first class we should move heaven and earth to support it, not put it at the bottom of a table and tell it to fight its way up.\u201d As well as being employed by St Teresa\u2019s RC primary school in the London borough of Merton, Schneider works across the borough for the Merton music hub. The teacher, whose three sons went to school in Merton, won an award in 2005 for her contribution to the campaign for more nutritious school dinners and was appointed to the then School Food Trust. Her school has been \u201cfantastic\u201d in allowing her unpaid leave for the election campaign, she says. Schneider thinks education should be cradle to grave and funded as a public good, not a way of separating the \u201csheep from the goats\u201d or a route to the highest-paid jobs. That is why Labour is right to promise to abolish tuition fees and invest in further education and training, she says. \u201cMy mother was an army child and missed out on education and felt she didn\u2019t deserve anything other than a low-grade job \u2013 but then she started night school and realised she wasn\u2019t dumb at all. But where have all the courses gone? They are now either very expensive or non-existent. Lifelong learning is something I fight for,\u201d she says. She is \u201cdistraught\u201d by the way parents of disabled children are having to fight to get an education for them, and it is \u201ca matter of real sadness\u201d to her that the Conservative government \u201ctook a hatchet to local authorities\u201d by their forced academisation and free school programmes. \u201cIt has been an unmitigated disaster and we see the abuse of budgets time and time again and failing academies that are just given away to another academy provider. What Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings did by introducing the private sector was utterly, utterly irresponsible and children are paying the price of that vanity project,\u201d she says. The Labour party conference this year passed a motion to abolish private schools and return pupils to the state sector. Schneider says she understands the \u201ccry from the heart\u201d that children should not be segregated by wealth. \u201cWe need to end charitable status and make the schools pay their taxes but I am not going into this election demanding every private school should be shut down,\u201d she says. Donna Wallace, 61 Green Party PPC for Aldershot (Conservative majority 11,473) \u201cCan I think of something good that has happened to state education since I have been teaching? I am not sure I can,\u201d says Donna Wallace, a secondary history teacher who works for a supply agency. An advocate of lifelong learning \u2013 she studied at university full time for a history honours degree and PGCE while her two daughters were at primary school \u2013 she recently took a maths GCSE at evening school. \u201cAfter that I taught maths at a school in Reading and I teach geography as well as history, and last year I was teaching religious education,\u201d she says. She can think of plenty of bad things that have happened, however. Constant changes to the curriculum make it hard work to keep up and restrictions on what can be taught prevents teachers from using their passions and interests, she says. \u201cI go to different schools and they are all strapped for cash. They need teachers to cover classes, so they are getting rid of support staff just when there are more children with learning difficulties coming in. \u201cThere needs to be more money invested in infrastructure. I am in a really nice school at the moment built as a temporary structure in 1971 and we literally had a flood in the classroom because of the leaking windows,\u201d she says. Her party is promising to bring free schools and academies back into the democratically accountable local authority school system. And Ofsted? \u201cWell, I do wonder. They sweep in and sweep out and tick a few boxes, so how can their judgments be accurate? I worked at a school recently, an academy in a brand new building that was passed by Ofsted as outstanding. Well, it was nowhere near outstanding.\u201d Under a Green party government, Ofsted would be replaced by an independent national council of educational excellence with regional offices, she says. Education is her livelihood and her passion but it was a threat to the environment that brought her into politics. \u201cI started standing in local elections five years ago because I was so enraged that our local Tory Rushmoor council sold off a small green in the centre of Farnborough with a dozen trees on it, including two beautiful cherry trees, to developers who built a hotel and restaurant on it,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to have more real people in parliament rather than career politicians.\u201d Lee Howgate, 47 Liberal Democrat PPC for Torbay (Conservative majority 14,283) The \u00a314bn over three years that Boris Johnson is promising for education will just take schools back to the funding level of 2015 by 2023 and will \u201cmelt like breath in the wind\u201d if we get a hard Brexit, says the English teacher, quoting Macbeth. English is his first love, but as an assistant headteacher at Saltash community school in Cornwall, he also teaches geography and history. \u201cBecause of the funding cuts we have a freeze on hiring so we assistant and deputy heads have to do our best to cover other subjects,\u201d he explains. It is not just the school that is suffering. \u201cOne of the main reasons I went into politics was because I could see the impact of the cuts on the community. I am teaching children with just one set of shoes and one pair of trousers from families who are living on the edge, which means the creaking school budget has to work even harder to make sure children are fully clothed and fed,\u201d he says. Brought up on a council estate in Leeds, Howgate now lives in Paignton with his wife \u2013 head of English at the local comprehensive \u2013 and teenage son and daughter, both at local state schools. He has taken unpaid leave to fight the election and his headteacher has been \u201cvery understanding\u201d. Students found out about his political aspirations over the summer when they saw him on the local news campaigning against fire service funding cuts. \u201cThey were excited about it and it was lovely to come back to in September, but I avoid talking about politics,\u201d he says. Boris Johnson is promising to be \u201cthe candyman\u201d for education, but the \u00a314bn over three years is not enough to level up the inequalities of school funding.

Subsidising fossil fuel production overseas costs each UK taxpayer more than \u00a37 a year, according to estimates from Friends of the Earth. Trees became an unexpected electoral battleground over the weekend when the Tories pledged to plant 30m new trees a year and the Liberal Democrats promised 60m. Emi Murphy, a trees campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cWe\u2019re calling for the next government to properly fund the doubling of tree cover. \u201cThis is one of the key solutions to solving the climate crisis but has been shockingly underfunded for years.

Face masks made of nightingale faeces, used by elite Japanese women for centuries, are one of the stranger beautifying techniques currently resurgent in western salons.

Sounds right. Only two companies are approved by the Japanese government to make this product, on farms where free-range birds are fed organic seeds. Their droppings are UV-sterilised and micro-organisms, dead bacterial debris, fungal spores, the exoskeletons of insects, etc are removed. Dehydrated and milled to powder, the faeces are then bottled for consumers to slather on their chops. I\u2019d feel more comfortable if the stuff was scraped off a tree\u2019s bark using a credit card. Perhaps, in a sense, it is.</p> <p>To clarify, \u201cno fun\u201d translates as \u201cbird poo\u201d, while \u201cuguisu\u201d is the species name of the Japanese bush warbler, somewhat different from a nightingale. The Koreans were the first to use bird faeces, to strip dye from clothes. The Japanese applied the idea to skincare, observing how it removed makeup efficiently, leaving bright and clear skin.

      "bodyText": "I am standing in the bathroom with poo all over my face. Let me explain. Face masks made of nightingale faeces, used by elite Japanese women for centuries, are one of the stranger beautifying techniques currently resurgent in western salons. I\u2019m giving the cheaper, at-home version a try, to see if there\u2019s anything in it. Do nightingales shoot magic out of their cloacas? More to the point, who wants to be young for ever if it means spending eternity in the bathroom with poo all over your face? \u201cUguisu Poo\u2019s facial mask (Uguisu, 30g, \u00a317.99) is manufactured using the ancient no fun making method,\u201d announces the website. Sounds right. Only two companies are approved by the Japanese government to make this product, on farms where free-range birds are fed organic seeds. Their droppings are UV-sterilised and micro-organisms, dead bacterial debris, fungal spores, the exoskeletons of insects, etc are removed. Dehydrated and milled to powder, the faeces are then bottled for consumers to slather on their chops. I\u2019d feel more comfortable if the stuff was scraped off a tree\u2019s bark using a credit card. Perhaps, in a sense, it is. To clarify, \u201cno fun\u201d translates as \u201cbird poo\u201d, while \u201cuguisu\u201d is the species name of the Japanese bush warbler, somewhat different from a nightingale. The Koreans were the first to use bird faeces, to strip dye from clothes. The Japanese applied the idea to skincare, observing how it removed makeup efficiently, leaving bright and clear skin. While it has been used by kabuki actors and Buddhist monks, the technique is frequently nicknamed \u201cthe geisha facial\u201d. Advocates claim it clears acne and reduces the appearance of pores. Can that be worth the voluntary scatology? Doubts abound as I puff a cloud of product from the bullet-shaped container.

So far, so simple. Yet Brexit will at this point be far from \u201cdone\u201d. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has accepted that a \u201cbasic free-trade deal\u201d could possibly be negotiated by the end of next year. Yet this raises numerous questions. For one thing, a basic deal on tariffs would risk falling foul of EU member states worried about the danger of Britain having tariff-free access to the EU market but able to cut standards, including workers\u2019 rights. For another, the government has repeatedly claimed it is seeking a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d trade deal. And the UK has a major interest in a much broader trade deal, covering services and internal security matters, such as access to EU databases, which have proved essential for combating international crime. All of this points to the UK wanting a much more substantial and wider-ranging trade deal than the basic model. And this will take time \u2013 maybe years. The prime minister argues the UK is in a unique situation: it starts from a position of alignment with EU rules. But this is a red herring. Never before has a state negotiated a (less than) free-trade deal distancing itself from a major trading partner; the EU will wish to scrutinise very carefully what dealignment actually means in practice. Expect, also, each national capital to come up with its own list of desiderata, and ratification to be particularly tough. So the choice is clear: either a lengthy process that will belie the idea of \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d. Or a short, sharp negotiation ending with a short, thin agreement that raises the prospect of years of adjustment.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Top tweet:</h2> <p>Anti-Brexit journalist Ian Dunt lays it on the line:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanDunt/status/1196457870197493760\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There&#39;s a chance to stop Brexit.

You can catch our latest Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here, and for daily updates head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories With the election campaign in full swing and due to last for nearly another month, actual Brexit news \u2013 as opposed to snappy slogans, disingenuous claims and unfulfillable promises \u2013 was at something of a premium. The EU launched legal action after Britain failed to nominate a candidate for the European commission, and the outgoing European council president, Donald Tusk, called on anti-Brexit campaigners to keep fighting in the run-up to the polls. Somewhat embarrassingly, Tesla cited Brexit uncertainty after choosing Germany rather than the UK as the site for its new European plant \u2013 and Australia (backed by 14 other countries) demanded compensation for Brexit trade disruption. Otherwise it was all pretty much what you\u2019d expect. The Conservatives pledged to cut overall immigration (but dropped any idea of a target) and increase spending on neglected towns. They also shelved a corporate tax cut in favour of public spending. The PM continued to repeat a limited selection of election soundbites, including the meaningless promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, and was rightly given stick for a string of inaccurate statements. (He wasn\u2019t the only one: Michael Gove, too, was accused of lying about EU citizens\u2019 NHS rights). On the Labour side, Jeremy Corbyn promised to outspend the Tories with a \u00a326bn rescue plan for the NHS and made headlines with an ambitious plan to nationalise part of BT and provide free broadband across the UK. It ran into predictable trouble, however, after Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey said victory in the general election would require a tough line on free movement. Corbyn said the party\u2019s manifesto would allow \u201ca great deal of\u201d \u2013 but not altogether free \u2013 movement. For their part, the Lib Dems found themselves in difficulty over their insistence \u2013 against the wishes of some candidates - on standing in highly marginal seats held by Labour over the Conservatives, and for selective use of polling data in their leaflets. What\u2019s next No change from last week, really: Johnson\u2019s stated plan is to secure a majority big enough for him to get his Brexit deal through parliament by 31 January, then negotiate the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU \u2013 including a new trade deal \u2013 before the end of the transition period in December 2020. The polls suggest he could be on course to accomplish the former, but there isn\u2019t a serious trade expert alive who would bet on him achieving the latter. Since the PM has said he will never extend the transition period, this raises questions about what happens at the end of next year if the trade deal has not been agreed (and ratified). Best of the rest Brexit could weaken rules on antibiotics in farming, activists warn. Stressed Whitehall staff at \u2018breaking point\u2019 over Brexit. Voters\u2019 choice is Tory no-deal Brexit or second referendum, says Gauke. Police assessing claims that Tories offered peerages to Brexit party. Roland Rudd exits People\u2019s Vote amid continuing rancour. \u2018CVs at bottom of pile\u2019: Britons in EU say Brexit is taking its toll. Rising proportion of EU citizens in UK given temporary \u2018pre-settled status\u2019. Top comment In the Guardian, Anand Menon and Catherine Barnard say Johnson is deluded if he thinks he can \u201cget Brexit done\u201d in a hurry: With a majority, he should be able to pass his withdrawal agreement bill in order that the UK finally leaves the EU on 31 January. So far, so simple. Yet Brexit will at this point be far from \u201cdone\u201d. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has accepted that a \u201cbasic free-trade deal\u201d could possibly be negotiated by the end of next year. Yet this raises numerous questions. For one thing, a basic deal on tariffs would risk falling foul of EU member states worried about the danger of Britain having tariff-free access to the EU market but able to cut standards, including workers\u2019 rights. For another, the government has repeatedly claimed it is seeking a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d trade deal. And the UK has a major interest in a much broader trade deal, covering services and internal security matters, such as access to EU databases, which have proved essential for combating international crime. All of this points to the UK wanting a much more substantial and wider-ranging trade deal than the basic model. And this will take time \u2013 maybe years. The prime minister argues the UK is in a unique situation: it starts from a position of alignment with EU rules. But this is a red herring. Never before has a state negotiated a (less than) free-trade deal distancing itself from a major trading partner; the EU will wish to scrutinise very carefully what dealignment actually means in practice. Expect, also, each national capital to come up with its own list of desiderata, and ratification to be particularly tough. So the choice is clear: either a lengthy process that will belie the idea of \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d. Or a short, sharp negotiation ending with a short, thin agreement that raises the prospect of years of adjustment. Top tweet: Anti-Brexit journalist Ian Dunt lays it on the line:",

It is Sunday morning and the soothing sound of hymns reverberate from a nearby church. For most of the children living near the estate, it is time for Sunday school and listening to Bible stories. But for Tapiwa Mumverenge*, nine, it is another day of toil. In tattered clothes and worn-out plastic shoes, Tapiwa emerges from lofty stacks of sugarcane. Despite his age, he has worked for the past six months at the plantation. He was just seven when he first had to find work, after both his parents died in 2017. Now Tapiwa works to feed himself and his elderly grandmother. Drenched in sweat, he furiously swings his makeshift blade, hacking at sugarcane plants twice his height. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to school.

A clearer version is the Charlotte County ballot (right).</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In its <a href=\"https://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/designing-usable-ballots/\">field guide</a> for designing usable ballots, the center lists 10 principles for election officials. Some are fairly obvious \u2013 use clear, simple language and one sans-serif font that\u2019s at least 12-point in size \u2013 while others are more nuanced. For example, the designers recommend against text centered on the page, which forces the eye to hunt for the following line, and against party emblems (icons, which we process <a href=\"https://electiontools.org/tool/civic-icons-and-images/\">60,000 times faster</a> than written text, should be used only to help voters navigate the ballot). Other recommendations include avoiding color when communicating important information (not all voters see color clearly).</p> <p>Unfortunately, not all jurisdictions have heeded these principles. In 2018, another county in Florida, Broward, placed the Senate race at the bottom of the first column of the ballot, underneath the instructions in English, Spanish and Creole. According to Whitney Quesenbery, a co-director of the Center for Civic Design, this design probably created problems for two types of voters: \u201crushers\u201d and \u201cskippers\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"845d465a0d614122299f3baeab6c797215d6b0c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/845d465a0d614122299f3baeab6c797215d6b0c8/0_0_3240_3858/840.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Broward County, Florida election ballot\" width=\"840\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2018 Broward county, Florida, election ballot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rushers are experienced voters who don\u2019t feel the need to read instructions and would probably have skimmed over the entire first column.

      "bodyText": "Though Florida had a host of problems during the 2000 presidential election, one of the most obvious was the \u201cbutterfly ballot\u201d used in Palm Beach county, Florida. On that ballot, the space that voters pressed to mark their choices was misaligned with the row of the given candidate, causing some to accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. In fact, after George Bush was declared the winner of the state, by a 537-vote margin, the Palm Beach Post determined that the ballot design ultimately cost Al Gore the presidency. An election\u2019s outcome can potentially be flipped by bad ballot design \u2013 not just the misalignment of rows, but also choices as seemingly minor as the order of candidates\u2019 names, which disproportionately favors those at the top of the ballot. Since 2000, some aspects of ballot design have improved, partly thanks to better technology and organizations like the Center for Civic Design, a not-for-profit whose goal is to \u201cmake every interaction between government and citizens easy, effective, and pleasant\u201d. In its field guide for designing usable ballots, the center lists 10 principles for election officials. Some are fairly obvious \u2013 use clear, simple language and one sans-serif font that\u2019s at least 12-point in size \u2013 while others are more nuanced. For example, the designers recommend against text centered on the page, which forces the eye to hunt for the following line, and against party emblems (icons, which we process 60,000 times faster than written text, should be used only to help voters navigate the ballot). Other recommendations include avoiding color when communicating important information (not all voters see color clearly). Unfortunately, not all jurisdictions have heeded these principles. In 2018, another county in Florida, Broward, placed the Senate race at the bottom of the first column of the ballot, underneath the instructions in English, Spanish and Creole. According to Whitney Quesenbery, a co-director of the Center for Civic Design, this design probably created problems for two types of voters: \u201crushers\u201d and \u201cskippers\u201d. Rushers are experienced voters who don\u2019t feel the need to read instructions and would probably have skimmed over the entire first column. Skippers, on the other hand, are low-literacy readers. \u201cThey tend to start a paragraph, decide if they need to read it, and then skip on,\u201d says Quesenbery. \u201cThey, too, can miss information on ballots if they skip to the next page, column or section.\u201d It\u2019s not uncommon for voters to leave certain races blank, but 9% of voters didn\u2019t weigh in on the Senate race in part of Broward county, a much higher rate than in other counties of the same congressional district that used different ballots. In total, the faulty design could have cost the Democratic candidate thousands of votes. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst combination,\u201d says Larry Norden, the director of the Election Reform Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, an independent, non-partisan law and policy organization. \u201cWhen you see a mistake like that, and it actually potentially changes the outcome of the election.\u201d After the controversy, Broward\u2019s supervisor of elections resigned, and her replacement is currently sending this year\u2019s ballot design to the county commissioners, the canvassing board and representatives from the political parties for review and approval, according to Steve Vancor, the county\u2019s spokesman. The county may also conduct usability tests with prospective voters, as a ballot is only effective if it\u2019s tailor-made for its community. For example, since 1939, Cambridge, Massachusetts, has used ranked-choice voting (RCV), a system in which voters rank a slate of candidates, and if none of them wins outright in the first round of tabulations, the contender in last place is eliminated, and her votes are distributed to her voters\u2019 second choices. Critics often complain that such a system confuses voters, but in 2017, the majority of voters ranked at least three candidates of the 26. Recently, the Cambridge Board of Elections Commission voted to limit the ranked choices to 15 candidates. It\u2019s a significant reduction, but a number that high would still probably be inappropriate for another jurisdiction, like San Francisco, where RCV is still relatively new. For that reason, effective ballot design is especially crucial. Previously, the ballot in San Francisco used a \u201ccolumn style\u201d, which listed every candidate\u2019s name under headers for their first choice, second choice and so on. According to Chris Hughes, the Policy Director and Counsel for the Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center, this layout incorrectly suggested that the more times you ticked their box, the more support they\u2019d get. But, he says, \u201cIf you rank someone multiple times, your vote is still only going to count for them once.\u201d Eventually, the city responded by introducing a grid system, the mechanisms of RCV become clearer. The need for intelligent design is even higher for provisional ballots, which are given to voters whose registration is in question in several states. If a voter misses a field or makes a mistake, like writing the date instead of her birthday, she can invalidate the ballot, so having clear instructions and sufficient white space is crucial. However, there\u2019s only so much innovation that a paper ballot can support \u2013 and only so many voters it can accommodate. For those reasons, Drew Davies, the former national president of the American Institute of Graphic Arts, the professional association for design, prefers a digital interface called a ballot-marking device. When used for RCV, these ballots can eliminate a chosen candidate\u2019s name as the voter progresses, preventing them from choosing the same name multiple times. More broadly, though, voting on a screen is accessible in ways that filling out traditional ballots is not. \u201cYou can imagine that process is significantly difficult if you\u2019re blind or if you have some motor skills issues or if you don\u2019t have use of your arms at all,\u201d says Davies. The ideal design for a ballot is often impeded by other factors, like cost, space constraints, technical limitations and state law. Recently, New York passed the \u201cVoter Friendly Ballot Act\u201d, which includes requirements to notify voters when a ballot is double-sided and to post sample ballots online before an election. Though these changes seem obvious, it\u2019s often necessary to spell them out explicitly. Otherwise, the consequences can be severe. \u201cA nightmare scenario is a close 2020 election where something like what happened in Broward county has an impact again,\u201d says Norden.",

It certainly came well after Renaissance writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais \u2013 who revelled in Lyon\u2019s culinary traditions, depicting the tawdry delights of offal and cheap cuts in Gargantua and Pantagruel. Rabelais, coincidentally, worked as a physician at the original Grand H\u00f4tel-Dieu in the 1530s.</p> <p>Besides the gastronomy centre, the site incorporates the five-star Hotel InterContinental, which opened in June 2019, private apartments, a conference centre, food hall, 40 courtyard shops and nine restaurants.

Lyon already hosts Sirha, the world\u2019s largest food and catering trade fair, as well as the Biennale Internationale du Go\u00fbt (Big) and the Bocuse d\u2019Or, the chefs\u2019 Olympics, every two years. As for the origin of Lyon\u2019s reputation as the capital of world gastronomy, it came from the pen of turn-of-the 20th-century French journalist and food critic Curnonsky, who was himself voted the Prince of Gastronomes by chefs and restaurateurs in 1927. It certainly came well after Renaissance writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais \u2013 who revelled in Lyon\u2019s culinary traditions, depicting the tawdry delights of offal and cheap cuts in Gargantua and Pantagruel. Rabelais, coincidentally, worked as a physician at the original Grand H\u00f4tel-Dieu in the 1530s. Besides the gastronomy centre, the site incorporates the five-star Hotel InterContinental, which opened in June 2019, private apartments, a conference centre, food hall, 40 courtyard shops and nine restaurants. It has taken more than four years to complete (only the chapel remains to be fully restored) with much of the renovation using the original construction techniques of the 17th and 18th centuries. At almost the same latitude on the other side of France, Bordeaux\u2019s Cit\u00e9 du Vin has attracted more than 1.3 million visitors since it opened in June 2016. Three other Cit\u00e9s dedicated to food and drink are due to open in Paris-Rungis, Tours and Dijon in the next decade. \u2022 Cit\u00e9 Internationale de la Gastronomie, Grand H\u00f4tel-Dieu, Place de l\u2019H\u00f4pital, Lyon. Open daily 10am-7pm (until 10pm on Saturdays). Le Cellier, the centre\u2019s cafe and gift shop, is open daily from 9am to 8pm. Combined entry plus tasting \u20ac24. Entrance only, adults \u20ac12, 5-16s \u20ac8, under 5s free. Eurostar trains run from London St Pancras to Lyon in 4 hours and 41 minutes Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news is up and running. What\u2019s going on? All political eyes will be on ITV tonight as it hosts the first leaders\u2019 debate. Notably absent will be Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon, who lost their high court battle to be included. Johnson and Corbyn alone will be asked questions submitted by viewers. You can bet the health service will get high billing after revelations today that 90% of NHS bosses fear understaffing is endangering patients. Almost six in 10 of them think this winter will be the toughest yet for the service. The Lib Dems will add to the NHS narrative when they pledge to invest an extra \u00a335bn into health and social care over the next five years, by adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax. The party says this would raise \u00a37bn, taking their proposed NHS budget to \u00a3142.8bn by 2023-24. The plan places them in between spending pledges by the Tories (\u00a3140.3bn) and Labour (\u00a3143.5bn). Labour will take aim at the Tories\u2019 \u00a3100bn tax giveaway to UK billionaires as John McDonnell ramps up his attack on the super-rich. McDonnell will say that Labour intends to \u201crewrite the rules of our economy\u201d, whereas the PM is on the side of \u201cthe billionaires, the bankers and big business. Someone on the national minimum wage would have to work 69,000 years to get paid \u00a31bn and a newly qualified nurse would have to wait 50,000 years. No one needs or deserves to have that much money, it is obscene.\u201d At a glance The Conservatives will pledge that adults who commit the premeditated murder of a child will be given \u201cwhole-life prison terms\u201d. Currently the rules require the murder to be of multiple children, or to be sexually or sadistically motivated. The Corbyn-backing Momentum faction is scaling up for a \u201conce in a generation chance\u201d to change the country with a sophisticated online and doorstep campaign that borrows ideas from the US and makes innovative use of WhatsApp. Labour will pledge to close loopholes used to hunt foxes, hares and deer as it launches its animal welfare manifesto. Suzanne Moore has written why voting in this election feels like \u201cclinging to the wreckage of a system we should dismantle. All the issues that really matter require cooperation, not silly, point-scoring conflict.\u201d You can read John Crace\u2019s take on Boris Johnson\u2019s bumbling speech at the CBI in which he shelved planned corporation tax cuts (\u201cthe less effort he was seen to make, the more the public seemed to like him\u201d) and Polly Toynbee\u2019s view on the poverty crisis and why the PM doesn\u2019t care. The day ahead Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, will call for immigration powers to be devolved from Westminster to to Scotland. The Green party will launch its election manifesto, stressing its status as the only major party committed to zero carbon emissions by 2030. The election debate starts on ITV at 8pm.

Keeping Song of the South away from children in 2019 is a sensible and responsible decision \u2013 I shooed my own kids away while watching it \u2013 but it\u2019s important to remember that its legacy still colors the Walt Disney Company, no matter how hard the studio works to burnish Walt\u2019s reputation. And even if it never sees the light of day officially, its attitudes are present in white nostalgia for \u201cthe singing heart of the old south\u201d and black characters who either benefit from white beneficence or nobly assist them at the cost of their own agency. Those stories are readily available on every streaming service on the market.",

      "body": "<p>Four years before Blake Lively realised that <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29819849/why-blake-lively-deleted-instagrams-rhythm-section/\">wiping her old posts</a> could be a great source of publicity; four years before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/12/who-is-caroline-calloway-and-why-cant-the-internet-stop-talking-about-her\">Caroline Calloway</a> exploded into popular consciousness or Tavi Gevinson meticulously unpacked her own adolescent <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/who-would-tavi-gevinson-be-without-instagram.html\">self-branding efforts</a>, Essena O\u2019Neill deleted her Instagram account. The Australian influencer had amassed 600,000+ followers. She\u2019d been paid $2,000 a post for #sponcon.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill grew up on Instagram. She joined the platform at the age of 14 and by 19 it had become her primary source of income, validation and affection. It was 2015, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/instagram-star-essena-oneill-quits-2d-life-to-reveal-true-story-behind-images\">she was sick of it.</a></p> <p>In her posts she\u2019d been smiling. She\u2019d been posing in paradise. She was thin and white, often in a bikini, with long, perfectly tussled blond hair. Then, in a tearful video she declared: \u201cThis isn\u2019t real.\u201d She was miserable. She was anxious about her body. Despite her cute outfits, she was broke.</p> <p>The confessional skyrocketed her out of her niche community and into the mainstream. Her follower count ticked upwards of one million.</p> <p>In her book Trick Mirror, Jia Tolentino writes: \u201cThe anti-Instagram statement is now a predictable part of the model/influencer social media life cycle: a beautiful young woman who goes to great pains to maintain and perform her own beauty for an audience will eventually post a note on Instagram revealing that Instagram has become a bottomless pit of personal insecurity and anxiety. She\u2019ll take a weeklong break from the social network and then, almost always, she will go on exactly as before.\u201d</p> <p>Except, perhaps, not <em>exactly </em>as before. O\u2019Neill was one of the first influencers to make a confession like this. For many influencers and celebrities who followed her lead, this dose of \u201creality\u201d won them fresh attention and waves of new followers. The pause allowed them to pivot to the hottest commodity on the platform: <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/influencers-are-abandoning-instagram-look/587803/\">authenticity</a>.</p> <p>A \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-rise-of-the-getting-real-post-on-instagram\">getting real</a>\u201d moment can act like rinse aid for the social media machine. It unclogs the accumulated ick around the ethics of self-promotion, only to reveal a digital self that\u2019s even shinier.</p> <p>Barely out of childhood, O\u2019Neill drafted the blueprint for this moment. But its architect never finished her project.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/02/i-overcame-my-dependence-on-instagram-after-my-model-photos-made-me-a-hit\">I overcame my dependence on Instagram after my model photos made me a hit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike the influencers Tolentino describes, O\u2019Neill did not go on exactly as before. In the words of a former schoolmate, she ceased to exist. After her initial viral moment, O\u2019Neill set up a website and started soliciting donations for her content, so that she wouldn\u2019t have to do sponsored posts any more. She had a book deal in the works. A few months later, in 2016, to cries of \u201cscam\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/05/instagram-star-essena-oneill-the-way-it-all-turned-so-negative-just-numbed-me\">she shut the website down</a>. She digitally disappeared, the book never materialised.</p> <p>All in all, O\u2019Neill had raised about $10,000 for her new content project. In an interview with the vlogger and pop culture critic Tiffany Ferguson, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce5kkO_urHE\">O\u2019Neill recently explained</a> that she donated some of the money to charity, and the rest she spent on rent.</p> <p>Now, at 23, she\u2019s back. \u201cThere was something so special about what I had online, and I want it again,\u201d she told Ferg. As for what she\u2019s been up to in the intervening years, \u201cI\u2019ve been working many shitty jobs. I\u2019ve been struggling. It hasn\u2019t been great.\u201d</p> <p>Her new project is a website: <a href=\"https://www.authoritywithin.com/\">Authority Within</a>. It\u2019s inspired by the long captions and sense of community she once found on Tumblr. A podcast is forthcoming.</p> <p>Though O\u2019Neill contacted Guardian Australia when the site launched, she declined an interview, for the moment, saying: \u201cAuthority Within is my message now.\u201d</p> <p>The message goes beyond easy aphorisms such as \u201cbe kind to your body\u201d or \u201ctreasure real friendships\u201d. After falling hard into her constructed selfhood, spending five years in \u201cthis endless cycle of consumption\u201d, then wandering off into the digital wilderness for four years, it seems O\u2019Neill has become a materialist.</p> <p>Not the kind that accepts free clothes and jewellery \u2013 the kind that\u2019s reading Marx.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/12/the-instagram-influencers-hired-to-rehabilitate-saudi-arabias-image\">The Instagram influencers hired to rehabilitate Saudi Arabia's image</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe understand the \u2018good life\u2019 as the dominant narrative ...

I have always struggled with the idea of \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d. And as someone who is receiving just the warmest most heartfelt messages right now... I still feel gripped by \u201cI should of been better known better ah\u201d... Isaak is a man who shows me endless acceptance... freedom in ways I never imagined previously. He was the first male in my life that said \u201cyour intensity is your heart and it\u2019s one of the traits I admire in you the most\u201d. Often I do feel \u201ccrazy\u201d... but then again, shouldn\u2019t it equally be as valid to criticize our culture as the container we were all born into?  Maybe it\u2019s just me? But I feel like we are living in insanely divided times. Over the years I\u2019ve loved finding Karl Marx and all his writings on Alienation... it fucking hits home. It\u2019s weird (oh really?) but finding \u201cfather figures\u201d over the years has really helped me. There\u2019s no way to talk about financial fears or family pains publicly. So finding idols... and partners who see pain as pain... passion as passion... fear as fear... Isaak words will never be able to measure your love.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/essenaoneillwtf/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Essena</a> (@essenaoneillwtf) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-11-14T20:04:29+00:00\">Nov 14, 2019 at 12:04pm PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Amid the YouTube embeds, collectivist ideals, musings on alienation, Deleuze quotes and explorations of polyamory, her website also links to a Patreon page where subscribers can support the project.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill insisted to Ferg that neither her disappearance or reappearance have been a calculation. \u201cA marketing scheme?\u201d she said. \u201cYeah just do a rant about your deepest feelings?

      "bodyText": "Four years before Blake Lively realised that wiping her old posts could be a great source of publicity; four years before Caroline Calloway exploded into popular consciousness or Tavi Gevinson meticulously unpacked her own adolescent self-branding efforts, Essena O\u2019Neill deleted her Instagram account. The Australian influencer had amassed 600,000+ followers. She\u2019d been paid $2,000 a post for #sponcon. O\u2019Neill grew up on Instagram. She joined the platform at the age of 14 and by 19 it had become her primary source of income, validation and affection. It was 2015, and she was sick of it. In her posts she\u2019d been smiling. She\u2019d been posing in paradise. She was thin and white, often in a bikini, with long, perfectly tussled blond hair. Then, in a tearful video she declared: \u201cThis isn\u2019t real.\u201d She was miserable. She was anxious about her body. Despite her cute outfits, she was broke. The confessional skyrocketed her out of her niche community and into the mainstream. Her follower count ticked upwards of one million. In her book Trick Mirror, Jia Tolentino writes: \u201cThe anti-Instagram statement is now a predictable part of the model/influencer social media life cycle: a beautiful young woman who goes to great pains to maintain and perform her own beauty for an audience will eventually post a note on Instagram revealing that Instagram has become a bottomless pit of personal insecurity and anxiety. She\u2019ll take a weeklong break from the social network and then, almost always, she will go on exactly as before.\u201d Except, perhaps, not exactly as before. O\u2019Neill was one of the first influencers to make a confession like this. For many influencers and celebrities who followed her lead, this dose of \u201creality\u201d won them fresh attention and waves of new followers. The pause allowed them to pivot to the hottest commodity on the platform: authenticity. A \u201cgetting real\u201d moment can act like rinse aid for the social media machine. It unclogs the accumulated ick around the ethics of self-promotion, only to reveal a digital self that\u2019s even shinier. Barely out of childhood, O\u2019Neill drafted the blueprint for this moment. But its architect never finished her project. Unlike the influencers Tolentino describes, O\u2019Neill did not go on exactly as before. In the words of a former schoolmate, she ceased to exist. After her initial viral moment, O\u2019Neill set up a website and started soliciting donations for her content, so that she wouldn\u2019t have to do sponsored posts any more. She had a book deal in the works. A few months later, in 2016, to cries of \u201cscam\u201d, she shut the website down. She digitally disappeared, the book never materialised. All in all, O\u2019Neill had raised about $10,000 for her new content project. In an interview with the vlogger and pop culture critic Tiffany Ferguson, O\u2019Neill recently explained that she donated some of the money to charity, and the rest she spent on rent. Now, at 23, she\u2019s back. \u201cThere was something so special about what I had online, and I want it again,\u201d she told Ferg. As for what she\u2019s been up to in the intervening years, \u201cI\u2019ve been working many shitty jobs. I\u2019ve been struggling. It hasn\u2019t been great.\u201d Her new project is a website: Authority Within. It\u2019s inspired by the long captions and sense of community she once found on Tumblr. A podcast is forthcoming. Though O\u2019Neill contacted Guardian Australia when the site launched, she declined an interview, for the moment, saying: \u201cAuthority Within is my message now.\u201d The message goes beyond easy aphorisms such as \u201cbe kind to your body\u201d or \u201ctreasure real friendships\u201d. After falling hard into her constructed selfhood, spending five years in \u201cthis endless cycle of consumption\u201d, then wandering off into the digital wilderness for four years, it seems O\u2019Neill has become a materialist. Not the kind that accepts free clothes and jewellery \u2013 the kind that\u2019s reading Marx. \u201cWe understand the \u2018good life\u2019 as the dominant narrative ... We feel these ideas are force fed to the public via the dominant digital culture that is supporting and sustaining the capitalist elite \u2026 the young, beautiful, positive, inspiring individuals who are INSANELY successful right now,\u201d her website states. \u201cThe neoliberal \u2018good life\u2019 is a facade/individual trip and is literally killing/enslaving the rest of the world.\u201d Amid the YouTube embeds, collectivist ideals, musings on alienation, Deleuze quotes and explorations of polyamory, her website also links to a Patreon page where subscribers can support the project. O\u2019Neill insisted to Ferg that neither her disappearance or reappearance have been a calculation. \u201cA marketing scheme?\u201d she said. \u201cYeah just do a rant about your deepest feelings? I\u2019d never recommend to have an emotional outburst online.\u201d Reading Authority Within feels a little like falling into a leftist YouTube wormhole, or a hazy conversation in the early hours of the morning. It\u2019s disorientating, stylised and very far from brand safe. In her interview with Ferg, O\u2019Neill was open about her mental health struggles, and the difficult comedown from \u201cthe insane pleasure of earning money like that. Working minimum wage and getting paid to promote a cute vegan product, it\u2019s different. It\u2019s a different world.\u201d Many of the young women who grew up with Instagram are now questioning the outsized role it\u2019s played in their lives. As a result of that interrogation, they are using the platform differently. O\u2019Neill is going further. She is being vulnerable in a way that no-makeup selfies and grainy candids are not. Unlike so many of the influencers who share their \u201cgetting real\u201d moment, O\u2019Neill is not illustrating her digital comeback using her corporeal body. So far, excepting the picture in her bio, she has not posted a photograph of herself. Illustrating a long, confessional caption with a personal snap is a kind of sleight-of-hand. Followers may appreciate your candour, or they may be sticking around for the same reason they came in the first place: to look at the pictures. Influencer marketing surveys suggest we want more authenticity from those we follow. O\u2019Neill is asking to rejoin a community while rejecting its primary currency. She\u2019s telling the world to listen, not look. And what she\u2019s saying is far from mainstream palatability. In a way, it\u2019s a dare: how much authenticity can you handle?",

Salesforce\u2019s average gender pay gap in the UK, at more than 33% last year, is still substantial, but Gadhia says that, walking around the office, diversity \u2013 in terms of both gender and ethnicity \u2013 is far more evident than in other places she has worked. \u201cThere\u2019s still more work to be done, but we\u2019re on the right path.\u201d One goal of Gadhia\u2019s, as she assumes her demanding new role, is to heed her own advice and lead by example when it comes to mental health. In her autobiography, The Virgin Banker, published in 2017, she wrote frankly about her battle with postnatal depression. Today she admits that when she bowed out of Virgin Money last year, a company she had grown and fostered for so long, she suffered a real sense of bereavement. \u201cLeaving Virgin Money definitely had a negative impact on my mental health. It was a bereavement. I\u2019d lost something,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t firing on all cylinders so getting back into the workplace has been very helpful.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Julia was around 11 years old the first time it happened. She let herself into her dad\u2019s apartment in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, dropped her schoolbag and flopped on to the sofa. She switched on the TV and turned to her favourite channel in time for the cartoons. The screen filled up with a cartoon man with a huge head. On his chin, in place of skin or a beard were huge cracks. Suddenly, she felt like she was going to throw up in disgust. She screwed up her eyes and fumbled for the button to turn off the TV.</p> <p>Every few months or so after this, she would see something that she just could not bear. Something that made her feel utterly disgusted and terrified. Sometimes it was cracks, but other times it was patterns of holes or dots, or scenes from nature programmes showing things such as groups of barnacles. She would shake, pour with sweat and end up lying on the floor in tears. One time, she was chatting on the phone when she saw something so awful she threw her mobile across the room. No one else she knew seemed to have this strange reaction. What was going on?</p> <p>Then, one day, when she was living in London in her early 20s, her then-boyfriend came bursting through the front door after work. \u201cJulia!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI know what you have!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Trypophobia is an aversion to clusters of holes or cracks that is associated with feelings of fear and disgust. You might not have heard of it. But do not worry: you won\u2019t be able to forget it now. Psychologists recognise a number of phobias that can have a huge negative impact on people\u2019s lives. The new kid on the block, trypophobia, is not yet widely accepted as one of them. There is even debate about whether it is a phobia at all, because while most phobias are synonymous with abject terror, a number seemingly provoke disgust as well as fear. Some researchers think that trypophobia is based only in disgust.</p> <p>Asked what first triggered their trypophobia, people describe everything from a Christmas bauble to a picture of a wasps\u2019 nest, pitted bricks in a wall, bubbles in cake batter, or the way water beaded on their shoulder after a shower. As well as such triggering objects in real life, many trypophobes describe images as being particularly problematic. Pictures involving lotus seed pods are often cited as initial triggers. The lotus plant produces large green seed heads that look almost like a shower head, with many large seeds. The \u201clotus boob\u201d meme, a fake image and story about an infected breast, caused quite the stir when it started circulating on email back in 2003.</p> <p>There is limited research into trypophobia, but <a href=\"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ijae/advpub/0/advpub_IJAE-D-16-00045/_article/-char/en\" title=\"\">one study</a> might help explain why that meme (debunked by the fact-checking website <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/\" title=\"\">Snopes</a>) spread so far and wide \u2013 it found that trypophobia is more powerful when holes are shown on skin than on non-animal objects such as rocks. The disgust is greater when holes are superimposed on faces.</p> <p>Of course, the lotus boob meme would not have gone anywhere without the internet. The web has been linked to the rise of other conditions that have physical or behavioural symptoms but, many believe, have their origin in the mind \u2013 so-called psychogenic conditions.</p> <p>From Strasbourg\u2019s dancing plague of 1518 to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/magazine/teenage-girls-twitching-le-roy.html\" title=\"\">2011 case of twitching teenage girls</a> in a small town in New York state, mass psychogenic illnesses are nothing new. They are part of the fabric of being human. But with the internet and its virtually instantaneous global avalanche of information, billions of us can be exposed to potential triggers wherever we are in the world. And anyone with a device and an internet connection is a potential agent of spread. Online communities have emerged around things such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/may/07/morgellons-mysterious-illness\" title=\"\">Morgellons disease</a> (an unexplained skin condition) and people who believe they are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/mind-games-the-tortured-lives-of-targeted-individuals/\" title=\"\">targeted individuals</a>\u201d, being stalked, surveilled or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/my-father-says-hes-a-targeted-individual-maybe-we-all-are/\" title=\"\">experimented on by the establishment</a>.<strong> </strong>So, is trypophobia another of these odd conditions? Is it a product of the digital world, or simply disseminated through it? And why for the affected people are holes \u2013 of all things \u2013 the cause of utter terror?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Julia\u2019s boyfriend grabbed his laptop and typed furiously into a search engine. He picked a video from the results and clicked play. She lasted 10 seconds before bursting into tears and running out of the room. The video was one of many you can find today that \u201ctests\u201d if you have trypophobia. They tend to be a series of triggering images \u2013 everything from lotus flower seeds to sponges. Once she had calmed down, Julia thought about what this moment meant. \u201cI was really surprised, but also kind of happy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt kind of comforting that other people had the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>There was just one catch. She couldn\u2019t search online for more information because the first thing you see when you search \u201ctrypophobia\u201d is triggering images.</p> <p>Hence her boyfriend became her designated Googler, reading aloud anything he could find on the condition. This was also how Julia discovered and joined one of the two main Facebook groups for trypophobes.</p> <p>Skimming through the groups, it does not take long to realise that trypophobia creeps into all aspects of life. People affected live in constant fear of being accidentally or deliberately triggered by any number of seemingly innocuous pictures or objects, from crumpets to brake-lights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A massage therapist tells me: \u201cI can\u2019t look at certain things \u2026 I have to send some clients away if they have triggering skin issues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe hairs on my arms rise whenever I see MANY holes,\u201d writes another person. \u201cI would come to think that I\u2019m gonna die if I keep on looking.\u201d They are also troubled by anything with \u201chairy spikes\u201d.</p> <p>Talking about Facebook, one person says they are \u201calways wondering if I\u2019m about to get slammed in the eyes with pods, or holes in rocks.\u201d They go on to describe watching TV or movies. \u201cThere are costume and makeup artists that love the effect for depth on screen. We\u2019ll spend the rest of our viewing time knotted up \u2026\u201d</p> <p>One user describes himself as a \u201c6ft 4 big guy\u201d who was \u201cabsolutely flattened\u201d by one picture.</p> <p>Online and in real life, trypophobic people say they are also deliberately shown triggering pictures by people looking to elicit a reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be funny to surprise me with a photo of tiny holes etc,\u201d writes one. \u201cMaking me panic is just cruel.\u201d For these people, trypophobia is a question that no one wants to have to answer: what is in those holes?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The patient is gowned up. A dotted black felt-tip line marks the boundaries of the bump. The doctor chooses her weapon. \u201cReady?\u201d she asks. Knife to skin. A disembodied gloved hand hovers nearby, holding gauze. Nearly. Nearly. Nearly.</p> <p>Then it happens. A huge jet of oatmealy pus rises out of a shoulder cyst. A blackhead yields to the forces applied to it, dead-skin gunk snaking and coiling its way out of the pore like butter being squished through a cream cracker. It is gross and mesmerising.</p> <p>I am weirdly fascinated by the US dermatologist Sandra Lee, AKA Dr Pimple Popper. She has 3.5 million followers on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drpimplepopper/\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>, 5.4 million on her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgrsF4TYwmrV0QsXb8AoeHQ\" title=\"\">YouTube channel</a>, SLMD, and a <a href=\"https://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/dr-pimple-popper/\" title=\"\">TV series</a>. Clearly, I am not alone.</p> <p>I cannot stop watching her videos once I start. I get a taste in my mouth \u2013 thick, slightly metallic saliva. The headrush of anticipation, impatience, tension building up before the release. If you are not au fait, then pimple popping is the trend for filming, up close and personal, the act of popping, squeezing or otherwise removing blackheads, cysts and other dermatological dementors. It is disgusting. It is also ambivalent, not in the sense of indecision or ambiguity, but rather a strong tension between opposing forces \u2013 something that researchers in the field say is \u201cequally capable of helping and harming, making laugh and making angry\u201d. For me, pimple popping is gross, but it is also compelling. Try a video on your nearest and dearest. (Mother-in-law: loves it; colleague who sits dangerously near to my desk: not so much.) Anecdotally, pimple-popping seems to divide the trypophobia community down the middle too.</p> <p>\u201cThey are surprisingly satisfying. I don\u2019t know why,\u201d says Julia, who is partial to the occasional popping video despite her trypophobia. Does she find them triggering? \u201cA little bit, but only on the level that it\u2019s still kind of nice. It\u2019s a super-weird mix, like doing something you know that\u2019s a bit dangerous but you kind of like it.\u201d</p> <p>What is in those holes? Pus, blood, gunk. Gross, but familiar. And being dealt with.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Think of the last time you were disgusted, I-need-to-bleach-my-brain-and-wash-my-hands-forever disgusted. Whenever it was, and whatever was behind it, we have something in common. The face that you would have made (and that you are probably making now, remembering) is the same as mine when I last stepped in warm cat sick. Your eyebrows contract, your eyes narrow, your nose wrinkles and your upper lip curls. That disgusted snarl is controlled by a muscle called the <em>levator labii superioris</em> \u2013 the movement of which is seen as the unique facial expression for disgust.</p> <p>Researchers suggest that we have evolved disgust <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01397/full\" title=\"\">to help us avoid pathogens</a> \u2013 things that can cause disease \u2013 found in everything from spoiled food to poisonous plants, from vomit to dead bodies. Faced with things we associate with disease or decay, we instinctively screw up our faces, to try to stop them entering our bodies through our mouth, nose and eyes. We retch, say \u201cyuck\u201d, and back off to protect ourselves from exposure to them and their disease-laden possibilities.</p> <p>This pathogen-avoidance reaction is now being seen as a key part of what is called the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6092612/\" title=\"\">behavioural immune system</a>. This describes our thought processes and behaviours when we try to avoid parasites and infectious diseases. Tom Kupfer, an emotions researcher at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, thinks that trypophobia is linked to our evolutionary adaptations to avoid parasites that live on our skin \u2013 things such as headlice and sand fleas.

      "bodyText": "Julia was around 11 years old the first time it happened. She let herself into her dad\u2019s apartment in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, dropped her schoolbag and flopped on to the sofa. She switched on the TV and turned to her favourite channel in time for the cartoons. The screen filled up with a cartoon man with a huge head. On his chin, in place of skin or a beard were huge cracks. Suddenly, she felt like she was going to throw up in disgust. She screwed up her eyes and fumbled for the button to turn off the TV. Every few months or so after this, she would see something that she just could not bear. Something that made her feel utterly disgusted and terrified. Sometimes it was cracks, but other times it was patterns of holes or dots, or scenes from nature programmes showing things such as groups of barnacles. She would shake, pour with sweat and end up lying on the floor in tears. One time, she was chatting on the phone when she saw something so awful she threw her mobile across the room. No one else she knew seemed to have this strange reaction. What was going on? Then, one day, when she was living in London in her early 20s, her then-boyfriend came bursting through the front door after work. \u201cJulia!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI know what you have!\u201d * * * Trypophobia is an aversion to clusters of holes or cracks that is associated with feelings of fear and disgust. You might not have heard of it. But do not worry: you won\u2019t be able to forget it now. Psychologists recognise a number of phobias that can have a huge negative impact on people\u2019s lives. The new kid on the block, trypophobia, is not yet widely accepted as one of them. There is even debate about whether it is a phobia at all, because while most phobias are synonymous with abject terror, a number seemingly provoke disgust as well as fear. Some researchers think that trypophobia is based only in disgust. Asked what first triggered their trypophobia, people describe everything from a Christmas bauble to a picture of a wasps\u2019 nest, pitted bricks in a wall, bubbles in cake batter, or the way water beaded on their shoulder after a shower. As well as such triggering objects in real life, many trypophobes describe images as being particularly problematic. Pictures involving lotus seed pods are often cited as initial triggers. The lotus plant produces large green seed heads that look almost like a shower head, with many large seeds. The \u201clotus boob\u201d meme, a fake image and story about an infected breast, caused quite the stir when it started circulating on email back in 2003. There is limited research into trypophobia, but one study might help explain why that meme (debunked by the fact-checking website Snopes) spread so far and wide \u2013 it found that trypophobia is more powerful when holes are shown on skin than on non-animal objects such as rocks. The disgust is greater when holes are superimposed on faces. Of course, the lotus boob meme would not have gone anywhere without the internet. The web has been linked to the rise of other conditions that have physical or behavioural symptoms but, many believe, have their origin in the mind \u2013 so-called psychogenic conditions. From Strasbourg\u2019s dancing plague of 1518 to the 2011 case of twitching teenage girls in a small town in New York state, mass psychogenic illnesses are nothing new. They are part of the fabric of being human. But with the internet and its virtually instantaneous global avalanche of information, billions of us can be exposed to potential triggers wherever we are in the world. And anyone with a device and an internet connection is a potential agent of spread. Online communities have emerged around things such as Morgellons disease (an unexplained skin condition) and people who believe they are \u201ctargeted individuals\u201d, being stalked, surveilled or experimented on by the establishment. So, is trypophobia another of these odd conditions? Is it a product of the digital world, or simply disseminated through it? And why for the affected people are holes \u2013 of all things \u2013 the cause of utter terror? * * * Julia\u2019s boyfriend grabbed his laptop and typed furiously into a search engine. He picked a video from the results and clicked play. She lasted 10 seconds before bursting into tears and running out of the room. The video was one of many you can find today that \u201ctests\u201d if you have trypophobia. They tend to be a series of triggering images \u2013 everything from lotus flower seeds to sponges. Once she had calmed down, Julia thought about what this moment meant. \u201cI was really surprised, but also kind of happy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt kind of comforting that other people had the same thing.\u201d There was just one catch. She couldn\u2019t search online for more information because the first thing you see when you search \u201ctrypophobia\u201d is triggering images. Hence her boyfriend became her designated Googler, reading aloud anything he could find on the condition. This was also how Julia discovered and joined one of the two main Facebook groups for trypophobes. Skimming through the groups, it does not take long to realise that trypophobia creeps into all aspects of life. People affected live in constant fear of being accidentally or deliberately triggered by any number of seemingly innocuous pictures or objects, from crumpets to brake-lights. A massage therapist tells me: \u201cI can\u2019t look at certain things \u2026 I have to send some clients away if they have triggering skin issues.\u201d \u201cThe hairs on my arms rise whenever I see MANY holes,\u201d writes another person. \u201cI would come to think that I\u2019m gonna die if I keep on looking.\u201d They are also troubled by anything with \u201chairy spikes\u201d. Talking about Facebook, one person says they are \u201calways wondering if I\u2019m about to get slammed in the eyes with pods, or holes in rocks.\u201d They go on to describe watching TV or movies. \u201cThere are costume and makeup artists that love the effect for depth on screen. We\u2019ll spend the rest of our viewing time knotted up \u2026\u201d One user describes himself as a \u201c6ft 4 big guy\u201d who was \u201cabsolutely flattened\u201d by one picture. Online and in real life, trypophobic people say they are also deliberately shown triggering pictures by people looking to elicit a reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be funny to surprise me with a photo of tiny holes etc,\u201d writes one. \u201cMaking me panic is just cruel.\u201d For these people, trypophobia is a question that no one wants to have to answer: what is in those holes? * * * The patient is gowned up. A dotted black felt-tip line marks the boundaries of the bump. The doctor chooses her weapon. \u201cReady?\u201d she asks. Knife to skin. A disembodied gloved hand hovers nearby, holding gauze. Nearly. Nearly. Nearly. Then it happens. A huge jet of oatmealy pus rises out of a shoulder cyst. A blackhead yields to the forces applied to it, dead-skin gunk snaking and coiling its way out of the pore like butter being squished through a cream cracker. It is gross and mesmerising. I am weirdly fascinated by the US dermatologist Sandra Lee, AKA Dr Pimple Popper. She has 3.5 million followers on Instagram, 5.4 million on her YouTube channel, SLMD, and a TV series. Clearly, I am not alone. I cannot stop watching her videos once I start. I get a taste in my mouth \u2013 thick, slightly metallic saliva. The headrush of anticipation, impatience, tension building up before the release. If you are not au fait, then pimple popping is the trend for filming, up close and personal, the act of popping, squeezing or otherwise removing blackheads, cysts and other dermatological dementors. It is disgusting. It is also ambivalent, not in the sense of indecision or ambiguity, but rather a strong tension between opposing forces \u2013 something that researchers in the field say is \u201cequally capable of helping and harming, making laugh and making angry\u201d. For me, pimple popping is gross, but it is also compelling. Try a video on your nearest and dearest. (Mother-in-law: loves it; colleague who sits dangerously near to my desk: not so much.) Anecdotally, pimple-popping seems to divide the trypophobia community down the middle too. \u201cThey are surprisingly satisfying. I don\u2019t know why,\u201d says Julia, who is partial to the occasional popping video despite her trypophobia. Does she find them triggering? \u201cA little bit, but only on the level that it\u2019s still kind of nice. It\u2019s a super-weird mix, like doing something you know that\u2019s a bit dangerous but you kind of like it.\u201d What is in those holes? Pus, blood, gunk. Gross, but familiar. And being dealt with. * * * Think of the last time you were disgusted, I-need-to-bleach-my-brain-and-wash-my-hands-forever disgusted. Whenever it was, and whatever was behind it, we have something in common. The face that you would have made (and that you are probably making now, remembering) is the same as mine when I last stepped in warm cat sick. Your eyebrows contract, your eyes narrow, your nose wrinkles and your upper lip curls. That disgusted snarl is controlled by a muscle called the levator labii superioris \u2013 the movement of which is seen as the unique facial expression for disgust. Researchers suggest that we have evolved disgust to help us avoid pathogens \u2013 things that can cause disease \u2013 found in everything from spoiled food to poisonous plants, from vomit to dead bodies. Faced with things we associate with disease or decay, we instinctively screw up our faces, to try to stop them entering our bodies through our mouth, nose and eyes. We retch, say \u201cyuck\u201d, and back off to protect ourselves from exposure to them and their disease-laden possibilities. This pathogen-avoidance reaction is now being seen as a key part of what is called the behavioural immune system. This describes our thought processes and behaviours when we try to avoid parasites and infectious diseases. Tom Kupfer, an emotions researcher at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, thinks that trypophobia is linked to our evolutionary adaptations to avoid parasites that live on our skin \u2013 things such as headlice and sand fleas. (Is it me, or is anyone else feeling itchy?) Just as the typical disgust response evolved to stop us consuming things that could make us ill, skin-based responses like feeling itchy or that our skin is crawling may have evolved to protect us from these ectoparasites. In other words, our urge to scratch that itch is no different from a cow covered in flies swishing its tail, or a flea-ridden cat grooming itself. A study co-led by Kupfer suggests that you do not need to feel parasites on your skin to get that response. \u201cIt looks like just those images [of parasites] can trigger the skin-protective response, even though that would normally be triggered by something actually crawling on your skin,\u201d he says. While people without trypophobia were grossed out by disease-related images such as ticks clustered on a dog\u2019s ear, but not by images of innocuous things such as holes in bread, people with trypophobia reacted in exactly the same way to both sets of images. Kupfer suggests they could be overreacting in response to things that resemble pathogens or parasites but that are, in fact, harmless. Like someone scared of snakes getting a fright when they see a garden hose out of the corner of their eye. * * * As with pimple popping, there is an ambivalence within trypophobia.

People from different continents who would never otherwise meet are online now discussing things like how upsetting a scene in the Wreck-It Ralph movie is. In an online world that seems increasingly divided, subcultures like the ones based around trypophobia, ASMR and pimple-popping have one thing important in common. They remind us of our human-ness. Skin and bone. Flesh and blood. Whether with pleasure or digust, or a bit of both, we are feeling. We are alive. \u2022 This is an edited version of an article first published by Wellcome on mosaicscience.com and republished here under a Creative Commons licence.

      "body": "<p>Tuesday evening sees the first TV debate of the 2019 election \u2013 and the first chance for the potential prime ministers to lay a glove on each other. Here\u2019s your complete guide to the format, the pitfalls, and the prizes.</p> <p><strong>What is the format of the debate?</strong></p> <p>Head to head between Johnson and Corbyn \u2013 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/18/lib-dems-and-snp-lose-high-court-bid-over-tv-election-debate\">the failure of a last-minute legal challenge</a> by the Lib Dems and the SNP as they sought to force their way into the mix. The programme starts at 8pm on ITV1.</p> <p><strong>Who is the host?</strong></p> <p>Julie Etchingham, who has become ITV\u2019s go-to host for high-profile political debates, hosting the equivalent events in the 2015 and 2017 general election. She won praise for her deft handling of this summer\u2019s Conservative party leadership head-to-head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, successfully managing to make the future prime minister stop talking by glaring silently at him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b2928212581d78d1e52eb850aedc283377dc5f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b2928212581d78d1e52eb850aedc283377dc5f7/0_44_5152_3092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Etchingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julie Etchingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Frost/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How will it work?</strong></p> <p>The hour-long debate will be conducted in front of a live studio audience of about 200 people. The two leaders will stand behind podiums, Corbyn on the left side of the screen and Johnson on the right. They will each have one minute each for their opening statements and 45 seconds for their closing statements, with Corbyn speaking first in both cases after lots were drawn. In the interim between those statements they will be asked questions posed by ITV viewers from various political backgrounds and across society, submitted after the broadcaster appealed for people to get in touch.</p> <p><strong>What will the key subjects be?</strong></p> <p><strong>Brexit</strong>: The inescapable political subject of the moment. Expect sound and fury, but pretty much no new information, with Johnson again pledging to pass his deal before Christmas and Corbyn in response explaining Labour\u2019s somewhat more complex renegotiate-and-put-to-the-people solution.</p> <p><strong>The economy</strong>: A perennial subject for election clashes, but this time with a difference. While recent elections have centred on austerity, and rolling back the state, both Corbyn and Johnson have significant investment promises to tout. Yes, the scale of the pledges are very different, and both will stress this, but they are competing on the same economic playing field.</p> <p><strong>The NHS</strong>: With a winter hospital crisis looming, it will be on voters\u2019 minds. Expect Johnson to claim he has provided funding for 40 new hospitals and Corbyn to respond \u2013 accurately \u2013 that the confirmed cash is for just six so far. This was traditionally a Labour strong point, but Johnson will hope his pledges of new spending will resonate with voters.</p> <p><strong>Character</strong>: This is a function of both the increasingly presidential style of UK politics \u2013 exemplified by the debates \u2013 and the fact that both leaders are not hugely popular with the public, in their own, differing ways.</p> <p><strong>What will each leader see as their home turf?</strong></p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: The PM will be keen to repeatedly press home his key message on Brexit \u2013 vote in a Conservative government and the UK will definitely leave by the new deadline of the end of January. Last night, he wrote to Corbyn signalling four key areas he wanted to press him on: whether he would vote to remain or leave, whether Labour wants to end free movement, whether he would be prepared to pay the EU for market access and whether he could guarantee every Labour candidate supports the leader\u2019s Brexit policy.</p> <p><strong>Corbyn</strong>: Public services and austerity. The Labour leader knows that voters can see with their own eyes the way the libraries, schools, youth services and the NHS have changed under 10 years of tight spending, and might be sceptical about Conservative claims that they are the people to change this. He is also likely to highlight his new policy on free broadband for all and commitments to nationalising utilities and the railways, which polling and focus groups suggest go down well with voters.</p> <p><strong>Which questions will they dread?</strong></p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: For the PM, it could become very uncomfortable if he is pressed on either of two personal issues: his relationship with the US tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri, and how many children he has fathered. The answer will be straightforward \u2013 no comment \u2013 but on both he is vulnerable. In particular, voters might find it eye-opening that their prime minister refuses to be pinned down on even a basic element of his family biography.</p> <p><strong>Corbyn</strong>: Labour\u2019s record on tackling antisemitism seems certain to be raised, but it is a hugely difficult area. Corbyn can, as he does when it is raised, insist he opposes all forms of racism and is doing all he can to root out antisemitism among members. But when your party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">faces a formal investigation</a> from the equalities watchdog, and groups of celebrities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/concerns-about-antisemitism-mean-we-cannot-vote-labour\">write to newspapers</a> urging people to not vote Labour because of it, this is very perilous ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/errongordon/status/1196456593342238721\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The stage is set (almost) for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ITVdebate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ITVdebate</a> tomorrow at 8pm <a href=\"https://t.co/PcL6go4U0e\">pic.twitter.com/PcL6go4U0e</a></p>&mdash; Erron Gordon (@errongordon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/errongordon/status/1196456593342238721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>How have they prepared?</strong></p> <p>Preparing a candidate for a major TV debate is about 80% hard work, with the remainder a mixture of good luck and plain guesswork. Ahead of the debates, the former Labour spinner Theo Bertram <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theobertram/status/1196479637817298946\">tweeted his reminiscences</a> of grooming Gordon Brown for the 2010 version, calling it \u201cPMQs on steroids\u201d, with the team trying to anticipate every potential avenue.</p> <p>Neither side has commented publicly on their preparation. Johnson is reportedly working with Brett O\u2019Donnell, a US Republican strategist who helped him before the 2016 Brexit referendum, with Michael Gove taking the place of Corbyn in mock debates.</p> <p>Corbyn is reported to have eschewed any outside help, and is preparing with the same core team of leader\u2019s office advisers he uses for prime minister\u2019s questions.</p> <p><strong>Who will declare victory?</strong></p> <p>Aides from all parties \u2013 including those not taking part \u2013 are likely to be in the backstage \u201cspin room\u201d to give reaction and try to convince journalists that their candidate won. But increasingly the real post-debate analysis is played out on social media. Candidates will be desperate to avoid giving an answer that their opponents can clip into a negative viral video, which could reach a larger audience than the original broadcast \u2013 and seeking to crowbar in their own preferred 15-second zingers for the same purpose.</p> <p><strong>Best outcome</strong></p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: A bore-fest. Genuinely. The PM\u2019s advisers are aware that as the incumbent and the leader in the polls, he has much more to lose. While some enormous perceived own-goal for Corbyn would, of course, thrill the Conservatives, the main aim is to escape without any damage and stress key messages on Brexit and an end to austerity.</p> <p><strong>Corbyn</strong>: The Labour leader would love the questions to skirt briefly over Brexit and be dominated by voters furious at run-down public services and crumbling schools and hospitals. In an ideal world, Johnson would come across as deeply out of touch, or glib, and unable to defend his character.</p> <p><strong>Worst outcome</strong></p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: Repeated questions about his personality, tangled personal life or his decidedly unimpressive record as foreign secretary. The Conservatives have, to an extent, shielded the PM from intense scrutiny so far in the election, but this will now end.</p> <p><strong>Corbyn</strong>: The Labour leader is arguably struggling to spark Labour\u2019s campaign in quite the way he did in 2017, and a notably flat or edgy performance, especially one plagued by questions over antisemitism and infighting in Labour could spell trouble. Labour are not currently picking up the extra support they need, and this is a key opportunity to change this.</p> <p><strong>Most likely outcome</strong></p> <p>A score draw.

      "bodyText": "Tuesday evening sees the first TV debate of the 2019 election \u2013 and the first chance for the potential prime ministers to lay a glove on each other. Here\u2019s your complete guide to the format, the pitfalls, and the prizes. What is the format of the debate? Head to head between Johnson and Corbyn \u2013 after the failure of a last-minute legal challenge by the Lib Dems and the SNP as they sought to force their way into the mix. The programme starts at 8pm on ITV1. Who is the host? Julie Etchingham, who has become ITV\u2019s go-to host for high-profile political debates, hosting the equivalent events in the 2015 and 2017 general election. She won praise for her deft handling of this summer\u2019s Conservative party leadership head-to-head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, successfully managing to make the future prime minister stop talking by glaring silently at him. How will it work? The hour-long debate will be conducted in front of a live studio audience of about 200 people. The two leaders will stand behind podiums, Corbyn on the left side of the screen and Johnson on the right. They will each have one minute each for their opening statements and 45 seconds for their closing statements, with Corbyn speaking first in both cases after lots were drawn. In the interim between those statements they will be asked questions posed by ITV viewers from various political backgrounds and across society, submitted after the broadcaster appealed for people to get in touch. What will the key subjects be? Brexit: The inescapable political subject of the moment. Expect sound and fury, but pretty much no new information, with Johnson again pledging to pass his deal before Christmas and Corbyn in response explaining Labour\u2019s somewhat more complex renegotiate-and-put-to-the-people solution. The economy: A perennial subject for election clashes, but this time with a difference. While recent elections have centred on austerity, and rolling back the state, both Corbyn and Johnson have significant investment promises to tout. Yes, the scale of the pledges are very different, and both will stress this, but they are competing on the same economic playing field. The NHS: With a winter hospital crisis looming, it will be on voters\u2019 minds. Expect Johnson to claim he has provided funding for 40 new hospitals and Corbyn to respond \u2013 accurately \u2013 that the confirmed cash is for just six so far. This was traditionally a Labour strong point, but Johnson will hope his pledges of new spending will resonate with voters. Character: This is a function of both the increasingly presidential style of UK politics \u2013 exemplified by the debates \u2013 and the fact that both leaders are not hugely popular with the public, in their own, differing ways. What will each leader see as their home turf? Johnson: The PM will be keen to repeatedly press home his key message on Brexit \u2013 vote in a Conservative government and the UK will definitely leave by the new deadline of the end of January. Last night, he wrote to Corbyn signalling four key areas he wanted to press him on: whether he would vote to remain or leave, whether Labour wants to end free movement, whether he would be prepared to pay the EU for market access and whether he could guarantee every Labour candidate supports the leader\u2019s Brexit policy. Corbyn: Public services and austerity. The Labour leader knows that voters can see with their own eyes the way the libraries, schools, youth services and the NHS have changed under 10 years of tight spending, and might be sceptical about Conservative claims that they are the people to change this. He is also likely to highlight his new policy on free broadband for all and commitments to nationalising utilities and the railways, which polling and focus groups suggest go down well with voters. Which questions will they dread? Johnson: For the PM, it could become very uncomfortable if he is pressed on either of two personal issues: his relationship with the US tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri, and how many children he has fathered. The answer will be straightforward \u2013 no comment \u2013 but on both he is vulnerable. In particular, voters might find it eye-opening that their prime minister refuses to be pinned down on even a basic element of his family biography. Corbyn: Labour\u2019s record on tackling antisemitism seems certain to be raised, but it is a hugely difficult area. Corbyn can, as he does when it is raised, insist he opposes all forms of racism and is doing all he can to root out antisemitism among members. But when your party faces a formal investigation from the equalities watchdog, and groups of celebrities write to newspapers urging people to not vote Labour because of it, this is very perilous ground. How have they prepared? Preparing a candidate for a major TV debate is about 80% hard work, with the remainder a mixture of good luck and plain guesswork. Ahead of the debates, the former Labour spinner Theo Bertram tweeted his reminiscences of grooming Gordon Brown for the 2010 version, calling it \u201cPMQs on steroids\u201d, with the team trying to anticipate every potential avenue. Neither side has commented publicly on their preparation. Johnson is reportedly working with Brett O\u2019Donnell, a US Republican strategist who helped him before the 2016 Brexit referendum, with Michael Gove taking the place of Corbyn in mock debates. Corbyn is reported to have eschewed any outside help, and is preparing with the same core team of leader\u2019s office advisers he uses for prime minister\u2019s questions. Who will declare victory? Aides from all parties \u2013 including those not taking part \u2013 are likely to be in the backstage \u201cspin room\u201d to give reaction and try to convince journalists that their candidate won. But increasingly the real post-debate analysis is played out on social media. Candidates will be desperate to avoid giving an answer that their opponents can clip into a negative viral video, which could reach a larger audience than the original broadcast \u2013 and seeking to crowbar in their own preferred 15-second zingers for the same purpose. Best outcome Johnson: A bore-fest. Genuinely. The PM\u2019s advisers are aware that as the incumbent and the leader in the polls, he has much more to lose. While some enormous perceived own-goal for Corbyn would, of course, thrill the Conservatives, the main aim is to escape without any damage and stress key messages on Brexit and an end to austerity. Corbyn: The Labour leader would love the questions to skirt briefly over Brexit and be dominated by voters furious at run-down public services and crumbling schools and hospitals. In an ideal world, Johnson would come across as deeply out of touch, or glib, and unable to defend his character. Worst outcome Johnson: Repeated questions about his personality, tangled personal life or his decidedly unimpressive record as foreign secretary. The Conservatives have, to an extent, shielded the PM from intense scrutiny so far in the election, but this will now end. Corbyn: The Labour leader is arguably struggling to spark Labour\u2019s campaign in quite the way he did in 2017, and a notably flat or edgy performance, especially one plagued by questions over antisemitism and infighting in Labour could spell trouble. Labour are not currently picking up the extra support they need, and this is a key opportunity to change this. Most likely outcome A score draw. The narrative of British election debates is arguably over-reliant on the 2010 examples, where Nick Clegg helped the Lib Dems rise in the polls. However, since then they have generally been underwhelming, featuring highly drilled candidates repeating the same catchphrases to general indifference from the watching public. This time could be different, but the odds are against. Catchphrase bingo A drink is not mandatory on each repetition, but could be helpful. Get Brexit done. Dither and delay. Coalition of chaos. Propped up by billionaires. Many, not the few. Forty new hospitals. British Broadband.",

When, for the first time, statistics were released about<strong> </strong>the number of people who had died homeless, it was incredibly important. But we did not want these people to remain statistics. We wanted to tell their life stories, look at what went wrong and<strong> </strong>investigate what could have been done differently by statutory bodies and charities. We have told half a dozen stories so far, and there are three more to come.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/12/a-gifted-physicist-reduced-to-living-in-his-car-what-killed-hamid-alamdari\">A gifted physicist reduced to living in his car: what killed Hamid Alamdari?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When we began researching the Empty Doorway series, we knew reporting these stories was going to feel bleak, but we didn\u2019t realise just how bleak.

All of the people who died were addicts, and many were born into troubled families. Many might have died anyway, but every time we also came across a failing by a statutory body or charity that could have made the difference between one of these people living and dying.</p> <p>It became clear, too, that there are ways to drastically reduce street homelessness and homeless deaths \u2013 changes in law, in practice, in attitudes. Yet with barely a month to go before the election, as politicians splurge out promises, none of them seem to be about this issue.</p> <p>A decade ago, as mayor of London, Boris Johnson pledged to end rough sleeping in the city within three years. In 2009, he tweeted: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/13/boris-bonuses-homeless%0D\" title=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s scandalous that in 21st century London people have to resort to sleeping on the streets</a>.\u201d Yet since then, the figures have rocketed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/london-rough-sleeping-hits-record-high-with-18-rise-in-2018-19\" title=\"\">Figures for 2018-19 showed that 8,855 people</a> were recorded as bedding down on the capital\u2019s streets last year \u2013 two and a half times the figure for 2009-10, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/01/london-rough-sleepers-double-in-fi\" title=\"\">3,673 were recorded as rough sleeping</a>. This kind of increase is mirrored across the UK.</p> <p>Johnson, predictably, forgot about his pledge \u2013 and the homeless. Yet his opponents, including Jeremy Corbyn, have also been muted. Yes, Labour has promised <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-repeal-nineteenth-century-law-criminalising-rough-sleepers/%0D\" title=\"\">to repeal the Vagrancy Act of 1824</a>, which makes it an offence to sleep rough or beg. And last month Corbyn made a speech in Northampton in which he said that homelessness should be recorded as a contributory factor to death, when people die on the streets.</p> <p>But why is the Labour party not shouting from the rafters about the horror of homelessness? Why have they not made it <em>the</em> election issue? For those lucky enough not to be affected directly, \u201causterity\u201d can seem like an abstract<em> </em>idea. But the stark evidence is there in front of us every day. When we see people sleeping on wet cardboard boxes in tunnels or shop doorways \u2013 that is austerity. Untreated addicts shooting up or smoking spice in the street \u2013 austerity. Working people living in tents \u2013 austerity. Women on the streets because the council told them they made themselves intentionally homeless for walking out on an abusive partner \u2013 austerity. Migrants, homeless because they have been denied access to public funds \u2013 austerity.</p> <p>This is the austerity that victimises the poor, addicted, mentally ill, foreign, abused and vulnerable. It is a shaming reminder that Britain is not only a broken and blinkered country, it is a callous one. And for prospective prime ministers, it is a reminder of how much better we could and should be.</p> <p>So what to do? First and foremost,<strong> </strong>we would like to see you, the public, saying: we are not accepting homelessness in Britain any more. Then any new government should begin with the obvious: build more social housing, ideally council housing; and properly fund a nationwide <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/london-assembly/london-assembly-publications/housing-first-solution-chronic-homelessness\" title=\"\">Housing First</a> strategy. The Housing First model has been successful in places as diverse as Finland and New York. It is based on the simple principle that everybody needs a home, especially those living chaotic lives. And for those with complex needs, there is wraparound support as soon as they move in. So far, this model has been trialled in an ad-hoc, half-hearted way in this country. Often, street homeless people are told their lives are too chaotic to qualify for Housing First. And yet Housing First was devised purely for this purpose.</p> <p>Time and again we have come across people who have been punished for their addictions. To throw addicts out of accommodation because they are drinking or consuming drugs is as perverse as it is cruel. In Brighton, a young man we reported on, Jake Humm, was chucked out of the YMCA for antisocial behaviour while drinking; in Harlow, physicist Hamid Farahi Alamdari was told he could only have a home if he was clean and dry. Both are now dead.</p> <p>Many of the charities or private landlords tasked with housing homeless people have neither the knowledge nor the will to look after people with serious problems. An easy way to get rid of them is by enforcing \u201chouse rules\u201d. Hostels, emergency accommodation and long-term accommodation need to be run by local (or central) government, not profit-making companies. Another problem is that the charities or private landlords providing supported accommodation are not held accountable when disasters happen. As they are classed as providing support rather than care, they are self-regulating. This meant that, although the YMCA DownsLink group knew Jake Humm was suicidal and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/24/the-homeless-death-of-jake-humm-it-was-my-deepest-darkest-fear%0D\" title=\"\">did not check on him for at least two days after he killed himself</a>, it did not have to answer to anybody but itself.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ymcadlg.org/\" title=\"\">YMCA DownsLink Group</a> internal investigation concluded it followed its protocols so need not act differently if the situation were to arise again. If charities and private landlords are going to be charged with<strong> </strong>looking after the most vulnerable in society (which is highly questionable), surely they must be regulated in the same way as care providers, and held accountable for needless deaths.</p> <p>Charities must also win back the trust of homeless people. Having talked to people living on the streets, it is impossible to overstate the damage<strong> </strong>St Mungo\u2019s did to the reputation of homelessness charities after it was found to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/05/st-mungos-homeless-charity-helped-target-rough-sleepers-to-deport\" title=\"\">working with the Home Office to help deport EEA nationals</a>. The charity\u2019s co-operation with the Home Office made many homeless people less willing to ask such charities for help. </p> <p>Homelessness charities should also not be allowed to refuse to support people who are not eligible for benefits or denied recourse to public funds. The famous <a href=\"https://www.connection-at-stmartins.org.uk/the-bbc-radio-4-christmas-appeal-journey-together/\" title=\"\">Connection at St Martin\u2019s charity, which benefits every Christmas from the millions raised by BBC Radio 4 listeners</a>, was forced to admit to us that it had denied the homeless Hungarian Gyula Remes emergency accommodation because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/15/gyula-remes-died-on-parliaments-doorstep-was-the-outcry-of-mps-just-for-show\" title=\"\">he was not eligible for benefits</a>. Unbelievably, The Connection reasoned that it would only be able to support him if he had a full-time job or looked likely to get one. Remes died a week after being denied access to its emergency shelter.</p> <p>Then there are drugs. So many charities have told us that they can\u2019t help addicts get clean because class A drugs are illegal. The brilliant <a href=\"http://www.huggard.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Huggard centre in Cardiff</a>, for instance, has a model needle exchange in which users are provided with state-of-the-art injecting packages. And yet what it really wants to be able to provide is a safe space for addicts to use. It can\u2019t, of course, because that\u2019s illegal. CEO Richard Edwards told us that the most it can aspire to is teaching homeless people to inject safely on the streets.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics recently reported that the number of drug-related homeless deaths rose by 55% compared with 2017. Not only that, but today\u2019s addicts are so much more difficult to treat. Most addicts have three addictions (alcohol and at least two drugs) and there is no known detox pathway for spice, which is everywhere on the streets. Yet, even as more addicts have taken to the streets (or homeless people have become addicted on the streets) and the nature of addiction has become more complex, nearly 60% of local authorities have slashed their budget for addiction services.</p> <p>There are many other simple practical ways to reduce homelessness \u2013 linking benefits to the cost of living and housing, getting rid of no-fault evictions, so dodgy landlords can\u2019t turf out tenants after eight weeks, getting rid of the bedroom tax, scrapping the legislation that allows local authorities to refuse to support homeless people if they don\u2019t have a local connection, making sure victims of domestic violence are housed (a third of homeless women cite domestic violence as the reason they are on the streets) rather than telling them they have made themselves intentionally homeless and throwing them out on to the streets.</p> <p>Earlier this year, following the death of 31-year-old Kane Walker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/01/homelessness-deaths-liam-byrne\" title=\"\">Birmingham Hodge Hill MP Liam Byrne proposed introducing Kane\u2019s Law</a> to create a duty on public agencies, especially the DWP, the NHS, mental health and prison services, to work with councils to prevent homelessness. (He also suggested there should be reviews for everyone who dies homeless.)</p> <p> Two of the women we wrote about, Aimee Teese and Catherine Kenny, died shortly after being released from prison on to the streets. Joe Anderson, Liverpool mayor, said: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/17/the-homeless-death-of-aimee-teese-i-didnt-think-it-would-come-to-this-at-30\">I feel guilty because I manage a city council, a system, that is not joined up.</a> It hurts. I remember David Cameron coming in and talking about the \u2018big society\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019s the fucking broken society. That\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with. And you can\u2019t cut and cut and cut, and not accept consequences. Aimee\u2019s\u2019s death is a mixture of lack of joined-up thinking and cuts. If we\u2019d had more public health workers connecting into probation, connecting into the Prison Service, we would have been told about her\u201d. Kenny died in Belfast days after discharging herself from hospital.</p> <p>The next prime minister \u2013 whoever they are \u2013 would do well to remember Gyula Remes, who died on the streets opposite the Houses of Parliament. At the time of his death, there was an outcry from politicians \u2013 how could this happen in a civilised society? Yet 11 months on, only one thing has changed \u2013 the tunnel in Westminister leading to the Houses of Parliament, which provided people like Remes with relative warmth and security, has been shut off to rough sleepers.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 November 2019. A sentence about the response of Joe Anderson to the death of Aimee Teese was edited to more accurately reflect the statement he made.</p>",

Homelessness had become omnipresent in Britain. According to the last Shelter report, at least 320,000 people are homeless, almost 5,000 are rough sleeping (likely to be a huge underestimate) and 726 people died homeless in England and Wales in 2018 (a 22% rise from 2017).

That spurred him on to make the best speech of the campaign, pounding with indignation: \u201cWealth must serve more than the wealthy, prosperity must serve more than the prosperous and good fortune must help more than the fortunate.\u201d Many said that if he had stormed the country proclaiming his great mission on child poverty, he would have exposed David Cameron and George Osborne as pitifully hollow vessels.</p> <p>What became of Tia Sanchez? Several times over the years I tried to find her, but her family worried they might lose their jobs if they said more. One Whitehall cleaner who had the audacity to give a letter to Tory minister Francis Maude, complaining of poor pay and working conditions, was punished by the company for \u201cgross misconduct\u201d and moved to a job that he found more difficult. After that the Sanchez family vanished, losing touch with Citizens UK.</p> <p>But Tia recently got back in touch, and we met in a cafe near where she lives in Tottenham, north London. Hers is a story of tragedy and fortitude against all the odds, a story of these times. First the good news: she worked hard at school, the only one of four siblings to reach university. She graduated a year ago from Royal Holloway with a first in human resource management, a triumph (and a heavy debt). Like so many graduates, she has applied for a thousand jobs of every kind, but employers require experience. She thinks a master\u2019s degree might help, but that costs \u00a310,000. She works in Tesco and shares a flat with three men she doesn\u2019t know. Horrible, she says, but at \u00a3500 a month, it\u2019s the cheapest she can find.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/15/thousands-of-young-people-face-homeless-christmas-charity-says\">Thousands of young people face homeless Christmas, charity says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She is all alone in the world, her brothers scattered.

When they were evicted from one flat, the family spent three months living rough, sleeping on buses and park benches, missing school, until they were rescued by Catholic nuns. They moved rented homes often. \u201cMost of all, I minded hardly seeing my mother. She came home so late, so tired, she just ate and slept, getting up at 2.50am for work.

That spurred him on to make the best speech of the campaign, pounding with indignation: \u201cWealth must serve more than the wealthy, prosperity must serve more than the prosperous and good fortune must help more than the fortunate.\u201d Many said that if he had stormed the country proclaiming his great mission on child poverty, he would have exposed David Cameron and George Osborne as pitifully hollow vessels. What became of Tia Sanchez? Several times over the years I tried to find her, but her family worried they might lose their jobs if they said more. One Whitehall cleaner who had the audacity to give a letter to Tory minister Francis Maude, complaining of poor pay and working conditions, was punished by the company for \u201cgross misconduct\u201d and moved to a job that he found more difficult. After that the Sanchez family vanished, losing touch with Citizens UK. But Tia recently got back in touch, and we met in a cafe near where she lives in Tottenham, north London. Hers is a story of tragedy and fortitude against all the odds, a story of these times. First the good news: she worked hard at school, the only one of four siblings to reach university. She graduated a year ago from Royal Holloway with a first in human resource management, a triumph (and a heavy debt). Like so many graduates, she has applied for a thousand jobs of every kind, but employers require experience. She thinks a master\u2019s degree might help, but that costs \u00a310,000. She works in Tesco and shares a flat with three men she doesn\u2019t know. Horrible, she says, but at \u00a3500 a month, it\u2019s the cheapest she can find. She is all alone in the world, her brothers scattered. While she studied for her degree, she nursed her mother, who died of pancreatic cancer aged 49. Her grandmother has severe dementia and returned to Spain. Tia, now using her full name Thiara, started to cry as she remembered the hardship of her beloved mother\u2019s life. When they were evicted from one flat, the family spent three months living rough, sleeping on buses and park benches, missing school, until they were rescued by Catholic nuns. They moved rented homes often. \u201cMost of all, I minded hardly seeing my mother. She came home so late, so tired, she just ate and slept, getting up at 2.50am for work. We used to meet her halfway from work, so we could share her last bus home. We had no time together, no holidays.\u201d Now she wants to volunteer with Citizens UK, campaigning for employers to pay the real living wage \u2013 \u00a39.30 outside London, against the government\u2019s \u00a38.21: Labour pledges an immediate rise to \u00a310 everywhere. Its new \u201cliving hour\u201d campaign demands a 16-hour minimum week, with four weeks\u2019 notice of shifts. (Ikea, Aviva and Nationwide have signed up.) \u201cThat pay, those conditions, would have changed our lives,\u201d she says. Gordon Brown is making thundering poverty speeches this week. \u201cI remember Tia well,\u201d he tells me, eager to help her. \u201cI remember that Monday before the election. Both Cameron and [Nick] Clegg made big poverty pledges they broke immediately. The Liberal Democrat anti-austerity manifesto was a worse U-turn than on student fees.\u201d Brown, who cut child poverty by a million, points to the treatment of poor people since he left office. He rails against universal credit, celebrating Labour\u2019s plan to abolish it. He is appalled by the two-child limit and the cuts and long freezes to benefits, soaring numbers of families in private rentals, housing benefit no longer covering their rent. \u201cThey say they\u2019re unfreezing child benefit? That\u2019s just 35p, after they cut it by \u00a37. I am utterly shocked by the levels of child poverty.\u201d He quotes the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 2017 prediction for it to reach 5.1 million children by 2022. He is appalled, above all, by the Tories\u2019 indifference: \u201cAt least Thatcher and Major worried at rising numbers. Not now.\u201d Time was when poverty was prime electoral turf. Labour struggles to push it on to the agenda, but it makes no impact on the Tories and their press. There\u2019s no lack of brutal facts: in the last week alone the TUC reported that wages are still \u00a320 below 2009 levels, with household debt at its highest. The Resolution Foundation finds the \u201cjobs miracle\u201d is due to poor people being driven to take on extra work. Fidelity says half of non-home owners now doubt they will ever own. The Trussell Trust reports the steepest rise in food-bank use in five years, while the Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce finds four in 10 don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll have a decent standard of living in 10 years\u2019 time \u2013 \u201cthe new normal\u201d. Unsurprisingly the Office for National Statistics finds levels of debt and anxiety rising. Worse, forthcoming Child Poverty Action Group analysis finds the poor are poorer \u2013 those living below the poverty line (60% of median income) have fallen another 30% beneath the threshold. There is no sign that Boris Johnson feels any need to pretend to be concerned about the millions of Thiaras barely scraping a living. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Telstra has called on the government to help combat a misinformation campaign on the health risks of 5G that has been carried out \u201con a scale we have not seen\u201d before, driven by social media. Australian mobile telecommunications companies are only just beginning to build 5G networks around the country, but they are already facing stiff opposition from campaigns largely built online about the alleged health effects of 5G operating in higher non-ionising radio frequencies. The Labor MP Ed Husic said during a parliamentary committee hearing examining 5G on Tuesday that politicians\u2019 offices had been \u201cbombarded\u201d with emails from members of the public complaining about 5G. Many of the over 200 submissions to the inquiry from individual members of the public or from groups of concerned citizens make claims that 5G will be hazardous to humans, and call for the government to stop companies building 5G networks in Australia. Appearing before the inquiry on the Gold Coast, Mike Wood, Telstra\u2019s principal for electromagnetic energy strategy, governance and risk, said the company was doing its best to educate the public about how 5G works. He said research had been conducted on the impact of mobile networks on health, but called on the government to help with a \u201cpro-active education campaign\u201d to run with the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (Arpansa) because people were often unwilling to listen to Telstra. \u201c[People] often don\u2019t trust Telstra,\u201d he said. In Telstra\u2019s submission, the company warned that while only a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of people were concerned, the misinformation was \u201cgaining traction\u201d. \u201cThere is evidence to suggest that messaging in these campaigns is being influenced by foreign actors,\u201d Telstra said, referencing a New York Times article claiming Russian broadcaster RT is spreading 5G health-related misinformation. \u201cThe fears being raised need to be quickly and respectfully addressed,\u201d the company said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Wood said GPs would also be a good focus for a government-led education campaign. \u201cWe think medical professionals would benefit greatly if there was better information available to GPs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll find if the GPs are informed about the latest science, they\u2019ll be able to find out more information.\u201d He said Telstra had been testing 5G since the initial test run back in 2016 and 2017, and found it had EME levels around 1,000 times lower than the public safety limit set by Arpansa. Arpansa states that high levels of exposure to radio waves can cause tissue damage, but that is currently 50 times higher than the limit. Arpansa noted in its submission this count happens with the use of radio waves for welding, or close exposure to AM radio towers that operate at a low frequency but require higher power to travel further. Wood told the committee that Telstra\u2019s research had shown similar EME levels for 5G compared to 4G, 3G, wi-fi, and other household technologies like baby monitors, walkie talkies and key tags. The Department of Communications and the Arts said in its submission that there had been an increased level of misinformation spread about 5G on social media, with use of low-quality studies put forward as evidence 5G will be dangerous. Arpansa told the committee that its assessment was that \u201c5G is safe\u201d. \u201cCurrent research indicates that there is no established evidence for health effects from radio waves used in mobile telecommunications.

But McCormack said decision-making should not be \u201coutsourced to the bureaucracy\u201d. \u201cIf the people of Australia want all decisions made by government to be outsourced to the bureaucracy, we would just have a bureaucracy running Canberra, but we don\u2019t have a bureaucracy running Canberra, it\u2019s run by the government and it\u2019s run by the ministers in that government, and we made decisions based on what was best for regional Australia,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cAustralians don\u2019t want the public service running the nation, they want the people they elected running the nation and that is what we did. \u201cWe take advice from the departments, of course we do, that\u2019s natural, but at the end of the day we make the decisions based on what we think we know is best for regional Australia.\u201d Guardian Australia reported on Monday that the top eight projects recommended for funding in the Wide Bay-Burnett region, based on the department\u2019s merit-based scoring system, were all rejected by the ministerial panel. However, in the same region, two known political donors to the LNP were among those that secured funding. McCormack defended the panel\u2019s decision to overrule the department\u2019s recommendations, saying he did not \u201cget a list of political donors and tick it off\u201d. \u201cI got a list of the projects and the programs that we needed to fund, that we were encouraged to fund, and I looked at those other projects and programs which we felt was value for money and was going to help turn around the economic fortunes of those areas in which the funding was allocated,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why I know that the program is working, and that is why I know the benefits are going to be writ large across regional Australia.\u201d Guardian Australia has reported on a range of projects that have raised questions about the rigour of the RJIP application process, including a project on the NSW south coast that attempted to raise money for an aquaculture farm through a fish-based cryptocurrency. A camper trailer company in the same region won a grant while it was possibly trading insolvent, while in Queensland a company that received a grant for a ferry project is losing money, and the project is unlikely to happen for two more years. A former Nationals candidate successfully secured a $300,000 grant under the scheme, and then spruiked the project in a pre-election advertisement with the Nationals MP Michelle Landry. Labor has called on the government to release details of which projects were approved against the advice of the department, and has asked parliament\u2019s audit committee to delve into the scheme\u2019s administration. But McCormack said he believed the grants program would create \u201chundreds, if not thousands\u201d of jobs in the 10 regions targeted under the scheme. \u201cI\u2019m happy to stand beside any of those projects, to stand beside any of those proponents of any of those projects and talk about the wonderful benefits that it is going to bring to regional Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that is what is most important, not a discussion about who funded what and why they funded it.\u201d He criticised Labor\u2019s shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, saying regional funding when she was in government had gone to Labor-held seats in metropolitan areas.",

Holmes, a political counselor at the US embassy in Ukraine, is scheduled to testify publicly on Thursday.

In the run-up to The Cave\u2019s release people queued in malls to put on virtual reality headsets and watch the rescue from the perspective of Ekapol Chanthawong, the football coach and last of the 13 to be rescued. The VR experience, filmed on the set of The Cave, is intense. It simulates being strapped to a stretcher by cave divers then hauled through water and rocky passages. Late in the cycle the visual perspective flips, giving a close-up head shot of the coach, who was tranquillised with ketamine for the journey. \u201cI\u2019ve had about a dozen people who took off the headset and had tears,\u201d said Al Caudullo, who created the VR project. He suggested that the tears were induced by pride and happiness rather than fear. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a backlash [against Tham Luang media projects] for quite some time. It\u2019s going to ride high on the spirit of nationalism surrounding it. Even when the Netflix one comes out, it\u2019s just going to keep the same spirit going.\u201d Four divers involved in the rescue \u2013 Erik Brown, Mikko Paasi, Jim Warny and Tan Xiaolong \u2013 played themselves in The Cave. On Monday night Warny, whose has a particularly prominent role in the film, was mobbed by selfie-seeking fans after the film screening. Caudullo was nearby, manning the VR headsets. \u201cPeople see it as a victory story,\u201d he said.",

The investigative mechanisms in the NT (and Australia-wide) preclude such an approach because investigative procedures are embedded in the policing apparatus.</p> <p>Second, it is crucial that the family of the deceased is engaged at every stage.</p> <p>Finally, it should consider broader systemic circumstances that govern police shootings, police powers, and training.</p> <p>The rise of the police state in the NT has taken on a clearer guise since the late 1990s when the Howard government disbanded the bipartisan federal approach to Aboriginal self-determination.

Criminalisation was spearheaded by police who held racist attitudes, as <a href=\"https://justice.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/728163/Pathways-to-the-northern-territory-aboriginal-justice-agreement.pdf\">recently identified</a> by the Aboriginal justice unit of the NT government.</p> <p>The intervention variously criminalised and precluded the deployment of customary law to resolve disputes, a set of practices that had been quietly tolerated for decades under previous governance regimes.</p> <p>Unprecedented numbers of fines were issued to people not wearing seatbelts, for driving unroadworthy vehicles, for driving with suspended licences.</p> <p>Through the same period the police force in central Australia has significantly expanded. Alice Springs, for example, already boasts three times the national average of police officers per head of population and aims to <a href=\"https://www.alicespringsnews.com.au/2019/05/13/whenever-you-need-a-cop-there-are-three/\">raise its force to 1,500 officers</a> by mid-2020.</p> <p>Additional \u201cpolice auxiliary liquor inspectors\u201d are stationed at the threshold of all stores selling alcohol, a program funded to the tune of $11m a year.

These arm police with broader powers to arrest and detain a person for four hours, or if intoxicated, \u201cfor as long as they are judged to no longer be intoxicated\u201d.</p> <p>In the first seven months after the paperless laws were passed NT police took 1,295 people into custody. Close to 80% were Aboriginal.</p> <p>In May 2015 another Warlpiri man, Kumunjayi Langdon, closely related to Walker, was arrested under these laws while drinking quietly with kin in Darwin parkland.</p> <p>While the maximum penalty for drinking alcohol in a designated area is a fine of $74, Mr Langdon was fined, handcuffed and removed to the Darwin police station in a police van.</p> <p>Three hours later he was found dead in a holding cell.</p> <p>This is the police state of the Northern Territory into which Kumanjayi Walker was born and grew up.</p> <p>The time of his childhood and youth was defined by policies and public attitudes that pathologise Warlpiri ways of life and signal that there is no future in places governed by Aboriginal authority.</p> <p>If there is just an inkling of a silver lining to these grim circumstances it is to be found in the galvanising effect ricocheting through the call for \u201cjustice for Walker\u201d.</p> <p>After many years of demoralised fragmentation, the days after the shooting have brought Warlpiri people and their supporters together in a stunning display of common purpose and dignity.</p> <p>As Warlpiri call for justice for Walker, they make clear they want not only a fair trial, but also a more basic kind of justice: the recognition of the sanctity and sovereignty of their own law and a life of hope for their children.</p> <ul> <li><p>Melinda Hinkson is an associate professor of anthropology at the Alfred Deakin institute, Deakin University, and director of the Institute of Postcolonial Studies.

However, it is glaringly obvious that these leaders of government and police have direct oversight of a legal regime that has been systematically and adversely brought to bear on Aboriginal lives over the past two decades. Walker\u2019s death is not an aberrant event but a predictable outcome of an expanding law and order complex that has increasingly penetrated NT Aboriginal communities. If more deaths are to be avoided, any interrogation into Walker\u2019s death needs to examine the constellation of coercive measures affecting the everyday lives of Aboriginal people in the territory. There are three necessary ingredients for an adequate investigation into Walker\u2019s death. First, that it is independent. The investigative mechanisms in the NT (and Australia-wide) preclude such an approach because investigative procedures are embedded in the policing apparatus. Second, it is crucial that the family of the deceased is engaged at every stage. Finally, it should consider broader systemic circumstances that govern police shootings, police powers, and training. The rise of the police state in the NT has taken on a clearer guise since the late 1990s when the Howard government disbanded the bipartisan federal approach to Aboriginal self-determination. The Northern Territory government then governed through criminal justice policies, including by introducing a mandatory sentencing regime. These new laws were instrumental in delivering Aboriginal youth and adults into detention for crimes committed against property. A young person was required to serve a minimum of 28 days\u2019 detention for their second offence. Virtually all young people detained under this law were Aboriginal. These laws contributed to the death of 15-year-old Johnno Johnson Wurramarba who was detained in Don Dale for stealing stationery. Although these property-related laws were repealed in 2001, mandatory sentencing continues for violent offences. Since the 2007 Northern Territory intervention, Aboriginal Territorians have been subjected to an expanding system of policing and surveillance, instantiated most strikingly in the erection of spacious police stations and Centrelink offices in several Aboriginal towns including Yuendumu and a new supreme court in Alice Springs that towers high above all other buildings. The intervention legislation dissolved distinctions between public and private space, allowing police to enter any Aboriginal home without a warrant. Around the same time, the NT government dismantled primary structures of Aboriginal community authority \u2013 community government councils \u2013 in favour of shires that now govern and deliver services at a distance. As power was systematically taken from them, further actions systematically criminalised Aboriginal youth and adults. Criminalisation was spearheaded by police who held racist attitudes, as recently identified by the Aboriginal justice unit of the NT government. The intervention variously criminalised and precluded the deployment of customary law to resolve disputes, a set of practices that had been quietly tolerated for decades under previous governance regimes. Unprecedented numbers of fines were issued to people not wearing seatbelts, for driving unroadworthy vehicles, for driving with suspended licences. Through the same period the police force in central Australia has significantly expanded. Alice Springs, for example, already boasts three times the national average of police officers per head of population and aims to raise its force to 1,500 officers by mid-2020. Additional \u201cpolice auxiliary liquor inspectors\u201d are stationed at the threshold of all stores selling alcohol, a program funded to the tune of $11m a year. These point-of-sale checks systematically target Aboriginal people and lead to fines and arrests. One of the clearest cases of a dispersed policing regime rests with so-called paperless arrest laws, introduced in 2014. These arm police with broader powers to arrest and detain a person for four hours, or if intoxicated, \u201cfor as long as they are judged to no longer be intoxicated\u201d. In the first seven months after the paperless laws were passed NT police took 1,295 people into custody. Close to 80% were Aboriginal. In May 2015 another Warlpiri man, Kumunjayi Langdon, closely related to Walker, was arrested under these laws while drinking quietly with kin in Darwin parkland. While the maximum penalty for drinking alcohol in a designated area is a fine of $74, Mr Langdon was fined, handcuffed and removed to the Darwin police station in a police van. Three hours later he was found dead in a holding cell. This is the police state of the Northern Territory into which Kumanjayi Walker was born and grew up. The time of his childhood and youth was defined by policies and public attitudes that pathologise Warlpiri ways of life and signal that there is no future in places governed by Aboriginal authority. If there is just an inkling of a silver lining to these grim circumstances it is to be found in the galvanising effect ricocheting through the call for \u201cjustice for Walker\u201d. After many years of demoralised fragmentation, the days after the shooting have brought Warlpiri people and their supporters together in a stunning display of common purpose and dignity. As Warlpiri call for justice for Walker, they make clear they want not only a fair trial, but also a more basic kind of justice: the recognition of the sanctity and sovereignty of their own law and a life of hope for their children.

      "bodyText": "The robodebt program will be completely renovated after the government committed to abandon a central plank of the program\u2019s automation which has seen tens of thousands of welfare recipients overcharged for alleged debts. In an email to staff on Tuesday the department of human services revealed it would abandon sole reliance on the controversial \u201cincome-averaging\u201d method and instead require additional proof before demanding welfare recipients pay back alleged debts. The department also revealed it would review all existing alleged debts and freeze existing debt recovery pending the review. The dramatic overhaul of the program could result in hundreds of millions of dollars of debts waived as part of the $3.7bn program, and comes just months after Labor lent its support to a class action challenging the legality of the program. Bill Shorten, the shadow government services minister, declared that the government had taken robodebt \u201cto the wreckers yard\u201d by finally \u201cjunking the reverse onus of proof where victims have to prove they don\u2019t owe the debts\u201d. The robodebt program operates by sending automatically generated notices to welfare recipients urging them to clarify alleged discrepancies in their income or pay back an alleged debt to the commonwealth. The former Administrative Appeals Tribunal senior member Terry Carney has warned the alleged debts are unlawful \u2013 as income averaging is not a proper basis to claim a debt. In an internal email, seen by Guardian Australia, the department promised to strengthen the program by \u201cno longer raising a debt where the only information it relies on is [its] own averaging of Australian Taxation Office income data\u201d. In future, the department will seek more information to determine if a debt exists \u2013 even if the recipient of a notice refuses to respond \u2013 rather than proceed on the assumption it does. \u201cWe will methodically work through previous debts identified as part of the online income compliance program,\u201d the email by the general manager of the customer compliance division said. \u201cWe will focus on debts where the person did not respond to our requests for clarification. We will look at each of those instances with a view to assessing whether further information is available to clarify what debt may still be owed. \u201cFor customers who are affected, the department will freeze debt recovery as they are identified and will then look at each debt. The department will write to customers to let them know this will happen automatically.\u201d At a press conference in Sydney, the government services minister, Stuart Robert, played down the significance of the \u201crefinement\u201d of the program. Robert repeatedly said that only a \u201csmall cohort\u201d have a debt based solely on income-averaging, refusing to specify the number of people affected. \u201cThere is no change to the construct of the onus of proof \u2013 we will still reach out to Australians to say that income-averaging indicates they may possibly have a debt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe use other proof points as well and we will ask them to engage with the department to identify, through bank statements or through payslips or other means, that they indeed don\u2019t have a debt.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Shorten said the changes amounted to an admission from Robert that \u201chis pet scheme that terrorises innocent Australians \u2013 is not actually alright\u201d. \u201cMr Robert has repeatedly assured the public the scheme is fine, and that there is nothing immoral or illegal or overwhelmingly inaccurate about it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now under immense pressure from Labor and with a looming class action he has hit the emergency brakes on this scheme.\u201d The Australian Council of Social Services chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said it had \u201crepeatedly warned the government that robodebt is grossly unfair and contrary to basic legal principles\u201d. \u201cWhile we\u2019re relieved to hear that the government is finally halting the use of averaging to calculate debts, we call on the government to replace the entire error-ridden program with a humane form of debt recovery,\u201d she said. The Community and Public Sector Union welcomed the \u201cstunning reversal of its controversial robodebt program\u201d but called on the department to lift its staffing cap to deal with the workload of reviewing debts. The CPSU national secretary, Melissa Donnelly, said: \u201cThis is a really important shift and acknowledges the dedication and expertise of CPSU members working in DHS, as well as the community members and community advocates who spoke out to tell their stories and worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the issues.\u201d On Thursday Robert was asked at the National Press Club about the contention that robodebts are unlawful, and two-high profile cases in May and September when Centrelink waived the debt rather then defend the legality of the program. Robert responded that \u201caveraging as the basis to say to a citizen \u2018there may be a debt, please engage with us\u2019 was entirely appropriate\u201d. \u201cAs Australians engage with us and provide information to us, many times they can actually prove that they haven\u2019t earned too much, and in fact in 19.9% of cases, Australians when they engage with us actually demonstrate through their bank account records or salary payslips that they don\u2019t have a debt,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "A mysterious inmate in a Canberra prison who was prosecuted and jailed in complete secrecy has been subjected to an extraordinary crackdown after he wrote a prison memoir, including federal police raids on him and his family and freezing his phone and email access. Little is known about the identity of the prisoner or his crimes, even by senior prison staff at the Alexander Maconochie centre, the ACT\u2019s jail, where he was held from 2018 until earlier this year. It is understood the man was a senior military officer involved in intelligence, but publishing information about his offending has been banned. It is not known when he was convicted. The nature of the case has led to unusual restrictions on the inmate\u2019s contact with his family and friends while behind bars. When he started serving his time, the Australian federal police asked prison staff to inform it at any point if it appeared someone was about to disclose the nature of his crimes, including if he attempted to receive any \u201cunusual visitors\u201d. In February the AFP learned the man, known only by the pseudonym Alan Johns, had written a memoir of his time in prison. Johns wrote the memoir with the approval of the prison general manager, Ian Robb, and on the advice of ACT mental health workers, who told him writing could help his long-term recovery. Robb then left the jail and a new manager, Corinne Justason, was appointed. Johns asked Justason whether a Canberra author \u2013 whose identity was kept anonymous by the courts \u2013 could visit him to help publish the work. Johns\u2019s plans were communicated to the AFP, which acted swiftly. Officers raided the prisoner\u2019s cell and his brother\u2019s home, seizing the memoir and other documents. The inmate\u2019s access to the prison email system \u2013 which is closely monitored for all inmates \u2013 was severely restricted. He was temporarily denied all contact with his family, and indefinitely prevented from sending attachments. Information about the existence of the mystery prisoner came to light only because he fought the actions of prison staff and the ACT government in the ACT supreme court. The judgment on his battle with prison authorities over the memoir was delivered publicly by Justice John Burns earlier this month, although it contained no identifying information outlining his crimes or his past. Burns noted that it was an ACT mental health nurse who had first advised Johns to begin writing on 12 September 2018 as part of his mental health recovery plan. \u201cOne of the goals in that plan was that the plaintiff would write and submit three manuscripts over a period of six months,\u201d Burns said. \u201cThe plaintiff stated that he began writing, and produced two novel-length manuscripts. \u201cHe described one as being \u2018an alternative history fiction novel\u2019, and the other as a memoir exploring aspects of his time in the [Alexander Maconochie centre].\u201d The novels were written on prison computers. Two months later, Johns said he met Robb.

Nine days later he learned that police had raided his brother\u2019s home searching for the memoir. His email access was restricted and police raided his cell and seized copies of his memoir and other writings. Johns complained to Justason, and later complained to the official visitor and ombudsman, to no avail. Justason said police had asked prison staff to notify them at any point if it appeared commonwealth orders imposing strict secrecy on the case were at risk of being breached. This included \u201cif any unusual visitors were added, or sought to be added, to the list of approved visitors or callers to the plaintiff\u201d. \u201cMs Justason stated that, consistent with the practice that had developed, she contacted the AFP on 6 February 2019 to indicate that this person [the author] had sought to visit the plaintiff and to ask whether the AFP would have any concerns about the person visiting him,\u201d Burns wrote in his judgment. \u201cMs Justason said that, in reply, the AFP indicated that they may have concerns if the person appeared to be an author.\u201d Johns argued in court that the prison authorities had improperly exercised their powers in notifying the AFP and restricting his email. He sought judicial review of both decisions. Johns wanted the prison to \u201cprovide him with copies of any existing court orders and/or other applicable restrictions or expectations of his behaviour for the remaining tenure of his incarceration\u201d and for restrictions on his email to be lifted. But Burns said it was not possible to grant the relief he sought because he was no longer an inmate at the prison. Burns also said none of the inmate\u2019s rights had been infringed by the prison\u2019s actions. \u201cThe declarations sought by the plaintiff are simply not available,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe has not established that the declarations are aimed towards legal controversies regarding rights that are protected or enforced in the courts.

      "bodyText": "The House of Representatives\u2019 top lawyer told a federal court on Monday that the House is investigating whether Donald Trump lied to the special counsel Robert Mueller, and the attorney urged the judges to order the release of still-secret material from Mueller\u2019s investigation. The president provided Mueller with written answers to some of the special counsel\u2019s questions but refused to sit for an interview with his team. Mueller also wrote in his final report that he considered some of Trump\u2019s answers to be incomplete or imprecise. The House general counsel, Douglas Letter, told the judges that the need for the still-secret material redacted from the Mueller report is \u201cimmense\u201d because it will help House members answer the question: \u201cDid the president lie? Was the president not truthful in his responses to the Mueller investigation?\u201d in his written responses. Letter said people connected to the investigation have already been convicted of lying to Congress about issues related to what Mueller was investigating. So, he said, it\u2019s far from a stretch for Congress to investigate whether Trump lied. \u201cThere is evidence, very sadly, that the president might have provided untruthful answers. This, therefore, is obviously a key part of a possible impeachment inquiry.\u201d He said the House impeachment inquiry is proceeding on two tracks: the \u201cUkraine matter\u201d as well as \u201cthe Mueller report\u2019s discussion: Did the president carry out obstruction of justice and related bad acts?\u201d The House judiciary committee is seeking grand jury testimony and other details redacted from the public version of Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Lawyers for the House suggested in a previous court filing that the grand jury material from Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation could help them determine whether Trump was truthful in his answers to the special counsel. \u201cNot only could those materials demonstrate the president\u2019s motives for obstructing the special counsel\u2019s investigation, they also could reveal that Trump was aware of his campaign\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks,\u201d the lawyer\u2019s wrote in the late September filing. They added, \u201cThose materials therefore have direct bearing on whether the president was untruthful, and further obstructed the special counsel\u2019s investigation, when in providing written responses to the special counsel\u2019s questions he denied being aware of any communications between his campaign and WikiLeaks.\u201d Two of the three judges who heard arguments on Monday seemed prepared to order at least some of the material sought by the House to be turned over. Democrats\u2019 articles of impeachment are likely to focus mostly on Ukraine, though they have not ruled out wrapping in additional investigations. Any mentions of Mueller would be more likely to fall under articles on obstruction of Congress or obstruction of justice. The questions about whether Trump lied in his written testimony to Mueller come as Trump tweeted on Monday that he might be willing to offer written testimony as part of the House impeachment inquiry. Other redactions cited in the court papers relate to contacts members of the Trump campaign had with Ukrainian officials \u201cand therefore may be relevant to the House\u2019s examination of whether the president committed impeachable offenses by soliciting Ukrainian interference in the 2020 presidential election\u201d. At the court hearing on Monday, Griffith asked Letter whether the material sought was still relevant, given the apparent recent focus on Ukraine as opposed to the Mueller report. \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you\u2019ve read in the press,\u201d Letter responded.",

She is one of about a dozen women suing the late financier\u2019s estate for alleged sexual abuses. \u201cPrince Andrew, and any others that are close to Epstein, should come forward and give a statement under oath on what information they have,\u201d Jane Doe 15 said. Allred said that she had called upon Andrew to \u201cvoluntarily meet with the FBI and prosecutors who are investigating this criminal case in New York, and also to provide his deposition under oath\u201d. Their entreaty comes in the wake of a bombshell BBC Newsnight interview in which Andrew was pressed on his friendship with Epstein \u2013 who killed himself in a Manhattan jail several months ago following his arrest on sex trafficking charges. Andrew claims he met Epstein through Ghislaine Maxwell \u2013 the daughter of the media baron Robert Maxwell \u2013 who has been accused of serving as Epstein\u2019s procurer. Virginia Giuffre has claimed that Epstein flew her to London on his private jet around 2001, when she was 17 years old. After dining and dancing, Giuffre and the prince had a sexual encounter at Maxwell\u2019s Belgravia home, she has alleged. Andrew denies the claim. Maxwell has also emphatically denied wrongdoing. She said that after she returned home from New Mexico, an Epstein assistant invited her to his Virgin Islands home. She claimed the assistant said Andrew would be among the guests and added that she declined the invitation. \u201cEpstein took my sexual innocence,\u201d the woman said during the presser. The royal family did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The prince is not accused of wrongdoing in relation to Jane Doe 15 and claims to have severed ties with Epstein in 2010. Court papers detail the alleged abuse. Jane Doe 15 said she was lured into Epstein\u2019s dark world when she was in New York City on a school trip. She was permitted to visit her sister, who was a model in New York City, for one day. Jane Doe 15\u2019s sister, who knew Epstein, invited her to his town house, she claims. Upon her arrival at his townhouse in the tony Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, his secretary allegedly began \u201cgrooming Jane Doe 15 to be used as Epstein\u2019s sexual object \u2013 she took photos of Jane Doe 15, gave her an iPod, and told Jane Doe 15 that Epstein really wanted to meet her\u201d. The secretary took down Jane Doe 15\u2019s contact information, the lawsuit says. Several weeks later, she claims the secretary emailed Jane Doe 15, saying \u201cEpstein was excited by the photos and that he was very interested in [her]\u201d \u2013 she and her sister were invited to a magic show in Las Vegas, and then to Epstein\u2019s New Mexico ranch. For Jane Doe 15, who \u201cgrew up in a poor household in the Midwest\u201d, the prospect of travel seemed \u201cthrilling\u201d. She convinced her mother to let her go on the trip. She then received ticket information from the secretary. Following the show, the girl and her sister were taken to an airport, where they boarded Epstein\u2019s private plane. Epstein was present \u201calong with several young girls\u201d, she claims. Upon their arrival at the ranch, Jane Doe 15 and the others were told they could do whatever they wanted \u2013 such as riding horses or ATVs or using the hot tubs or pool. At one point during her stay at the ranch, Jane Doe 15 says, she was asked to the main house and taken to Epstein\u2019s bedroom, where he was allegedly wearing a bathrobe and demanded a massage. The girl says she sensed that Epstein wanted her to engage in sexual activity, \u201cbut she did not know what it was. Epstein seemed to get frustrated as a result.\u201d He then assaulted her with a device, according to court papers. She says she left the ranch after three or four days. A lawyer representing the executors of Epstein\u2019s estate did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Fund manager James Mawhinney made quite the splash when he arrived in the small north Queensland town of Mission Beach a few weeks ago. The boss of the controversial investment empire Mayfair 101 brought with him pop singer Ricki-Lee Coulter, independent MP Bob Katter \u2013 and a pledge to spend $135m buying properties in town. Mawhinney was in town on 25 October to throw a party celebrating Mayfair\u2019s purchase of nearby Dunk Island, a cyclone-ravaged resort that he says his group will restore to its former glory. In between posing in front of white letters on the beach spelling DUNK ISLAND, about 250 Instagram influencers and locals sipped Moet while a saxophonist wailed away, social media posts show. \u201cI had a wonderful time over the weekend discovering the beautiful #DunkIsland\u201d, Coulter later gushed. The meet and greet was just one part of a promotional push for Mayfair\u2019s investment empire that has also included a mammoth press advertising campaign. On top of the ad blitz \u2013 which includes a full page ad in Brisbane tabloid the Courier-Mail as recently as last Tuesday and another full page in the Australian Financial Review last week \u2013 Mayfair is taking the show on the road, visiting all capital cities in a fortnight for what it is billing as \u201cthe must-see investment event of 2019\u201d. The group has plenty to spruik. On top of Dunk, there\u2019s a basket of investments in technology and cryptocurrency companies, some of which are hard to trace, and another abandoned island, Santo Spirito, in the Venetian lagoon \u2013 an area gripped by a state of emergency due to heavy flooding this week. But it is Mawhinney\u2019s promise to buy more than 230 properties in Mission Beach that has the local community buzzing \u2013 and Mayfair on the hunt for yet more millions from investors. Documents obtained by the Guardian show that to put its foot on a portfolio taking in houses, vacant lots and even a shop near local attraction the Big Cassowary, Mayfair has so far paid deposits totalling $7.4m to Mission Beach property owners. The documents show the options are held through a series of property trusts that are ultimately controlled by a company called Sunseeker Holdings. This company, which Mayfair spokeswoman Joanne Painter said was part of the broader Mayfair group, boasts as directors Mawhinney and Brigette Panetta, who according to a LinkedIn profile is Mayfair\u2019s finance director. If Instagram posts depicting Panetta and Mawhinney together \u2013 including one where he is wearing a costume jewellery gold chain emblazoned with the letters BOSS \u2013 are accurate, she also appears to be his partner in life. There is no suggestion the Sunseeker structure provides Mawhinney or Panetta with any personal benefit. Meanwhile, Mayfair hopes that property prices in Mission Beach will rise once Dunk Island is up and running, potentially delivering a healthy profit. To complete the string of property purchases, Mayfair has pledged to pay a total of $135m at various times between this month and September next year. As it looks for cash, Mayfair has been circulating an information memorandum among Australian real estate investors. In it, Mayfair claims to have raised about $170m so far over its two years in existence, and says it aims to raise another $250m by the end of next year. The document also shows how much money Mayfair will have to spend each month to settle on the properties in Mission Beach it has committed to buy. It shows that almost $18.3m is due to property owners this month , rising to a peak of almost $42.5m in March next year. On top of that, there\u2019s the $31.5m Mayfair says it has spent on Dunk itself. Painter said the purchase of Dunk Island settled on 30 September, but how much cash changed hands is unclear as the seller, a company associated with former Linc Energy boss Peter Bond, holds a mortgage over the island. \u201cThe Group\u2019s investment in the region will be funded through a combination of Mayfair 101 resources, and third-party capital including funds from family offices, high-net-worth investors and other strategic financiers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are well advanced in finalising the funding resources required to complete settlements.\u201d If Mayfair can bring it off it would be \u201chuge\u201d for the local community, Pete Faulkner, an economist who is also president of the Mission Beach Community Association, said. \u201cAt the initial stages when that was first announced there was a good deal of, I would say, healthy scepticism around,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThat has subsequently decreased \u2026 the longer it goes the more people are becoming aware that things do appear to be happening.\u201d He said the area has had a rough trot for 15 years after being hit by Cyclone Larry in 2006 and then, just as it was beginning to recover, suffering Cyclone Yasi in 2011. \u201cWe\u2019re in a better place now than we have been but we\u2019d be in a better place still if Dunk reopened,\u201d he said. Hopes of a tourism-driven economic revival for the area now depend on whether Mayfair can muster the financial firepower to seal the many deals to which it has committed. The Cassowary Coast regional council seems to be on board; on Thursday it gave Mayfair \u201cin principle\u201d rights to develop the Dunk Island spit, a triangle of land between two beaches controlled by local government. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly talking the talk and as far as we can see at the moment they\u2019re walking the walk to the degree that some of the properties that they had contracts on have already settled, some of them are yet to settle,\u201d Faulkner said. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be a process.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Tuesday\u2019s blog: The Justice Department inspector general will testify before the Senate judiciary committee on December 11. The IG has been investigating whether officials violated surveillance rules by looking into Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. The US official who overheard a conversation between EU ambassador Gordon Sondland and Donald Trump will reportedly testify publicly on Thursday in the House impeachment inquiry. Republican senator Ron Johnson, who was part of the US delegation at the Ukrainian president\u2019s inauguration, questioned officials who have testified in the inquiry. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said Israel\u2019s West Bank settlements are no longer considered illegal, breaking with previous US policy and international law. The Hill is reportedly reviewing work by John Solomon, a former columnist for the publication after Marie Yovanovitch on Friday denied claims he published, according to Politico. In her testimony last week, Yovanovitch denied Solomon\u2019s claim that she gave Ukraine\u2019s then-top prosecutor a list of who not to prosecute. Solomon\u2019s reporting has been promoted by Fox News and Donald Trump. The conservative columnist defended his work. \u201cAll facts in those stories are substantiated to original source documents and statements,\u201d he told Politico. Meanwhile, it seems Pete Buttigieg has moved supporters to... move in puzzling ways. Buttigieg supporters have taken to performing a coordinated dance to \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d by Panic at the Disco!. Here\u2019s a performance from September, in Iowa: Here\u2019s a supporter, explaining the choreography: But why? \u201cThis dance is fun!\u201d GrandmasforPete tweeted. Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz will appear before the senate Judiciary Committee to testify on an upcoming report looking into whether the FBI violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) during the Russia probe. Horowitz will testify publicly on Dec. 11, according to Senate judiciary committee chair Lindsay Graham. He\u2019s likely to address whether the FBI\u2019s court-ordered surveillance of a former Trump campaign aide was handled properly Graham and other Trump allies have suggested that the upcoming report will undermine the credibility of the Russia probe by providing improper conduct during the early stages of the investigation. The report is likely to be released at the height of the impeachment inquiry and could bolster Republicans who claim that Trump has been unfairly targeted by government officials investigating his actions. Ron Johnson, a Republican senator from Wisconsin, responded to Republican congressmen involved in the impeachment hearings with his account of the Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. In a letter to Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan, Johnson said that Trump denied a link between investigations and aid to Ukraine, and that the president said he \u201cbarely knew\u201d EU ambassador Gordon Sondland. Johnson also questioned the motives of witnesses who have testified in the impeachment inquiry, and called the inquiry a \u201c \u201ccontinuation of a concerted, and possibly coordinated effort to sabotage the Trump administration\u201d. The Republican senator and frequent Trump defender attended Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May as part of a delegation that also included Sondland, Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, energy secretary Rick Perry, Trump\u2019s energy secretary; National Security Council official Alexander Vindman. Politico and the Democratic National Committee are reportedly at odds over the ideology of a proposed moderator of the December presidential primary debate. Because Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine, used to write for the National Review, a conservative magazine and has spent much of his recent career reporting on the Republican Party, DNC officials are concerned that he\u2019s ill-suited to moderate a debate that\u2019s meant to better inform Democratic voters, sources told NBC news. Journalists for various outlets have come to Alberta\u2019s defense, noting that he is a non-partisan journalist. Some pointed out that other Democratic debate moderators have had an ideological bias. The US official who overheard a key phone conversation between Eu ambassador Gordon Sondland and Donald Trump will testify publicly as part of the House impeachment inquiry, according to CNN. David Holmes, the counselor for political affairs at the US Embassy in Ukraine, said in a closed-door testimony last week he overheard Sondland tell Trump that the Ukrainian president \u201cloves your ass\u201d. Holmes will testify alongside former White House official Fiona Hill on Thursday, CNN reported, citing a Democratic aide. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced the US does not consider Israel\u2019s West Bank settlements to be a violation of international law, marking a significant Middle East policy shift. Pompeo also dodged questions about the impeachment inquiry, including whether he still has confidence in acting US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor. House lawyers told a federal court that lawmakers are investigating whether Trump lied to Robert Mueller as the Justice Department seeks a stay on congressional Democrats receiving the special counsel\u2019s grand jury materials. Trump said he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d testifying in the impeachment inquiry, but that suggestion was met with skepticism given the president\u2019s past refusals to sit for an interview with Mueller. The Supreme Court issued a temporary stay on a House committee receiving Trump\u2019s financial records from a subpoena it issued. The House will vote on a continuing resolution tomorrow that would fund the government through Dec. 20 and avert a shutdown. New polls confirmed Joe Biden maintains a strong lead in South Carolina as his fellow Democratic presidential candidates have struggled to put a dent in his polling advantage among African American voters. Maanvi will have much more coming up on the news of the day, so stay tuned. The House intends to vote tomorrow on a continuing resolution to fund the government through Dec. 20 as concerns mount about a potential shutdown amid the impeachment inquiry. Current government funding expires on Thursday, and the Democrats leading the House are proposing to keep spending at current levels for another month, with the hope they\u2019ll be able to strike a deal with Republicans on a full spending bill by Dec. 20. The new Quinnipiac poll of South Carolina has given Tom Steyer his final qualifying poll for the December debate, and Andrew Yang now only needs one more to cross the polling threshold. Steyer still needs to meet the donor requirement, but he is reportedly on track to do so, and Yang has already attracted enough donors to qualify. If they do meet the requirements, the billionaire activist and tech entrepreneur would be the seventh and eighth candidates to qualify for the December debate. Another poll has been released showing Joe Biden with a commanding lead in the early voting state of South Carolina, buoyed by the support of African American voters. According to the Quinnipiac poll, Biden has the support of 33% of South Carolina Democrats, putting him 20 points ahead of Elizabeth Warren. Bernie Sanders hit 11%, and Pete Buttigieg trails at 6%. Among the state\u2019s African American Democrats, Biden hits 44% compared to Sanders\u2019 10% and Warren\u2019s 8%. Buttigieg attracted 0% of the support of black Democrats in South Carolina, once again underscoring the Indiana mayor\u2019s difficulties in appealing to African American voters. Buttigieg has surged in the mostly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire, but his struggles to attract the support of African Americans -- who make up a large share of the Democratic primary electorate -- could hinder his candidacy in the later-voting states. During his press conference announcing the policy shift on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, secretary of state Mike Pompeo notably dodged a question on whether he still trusted Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine. Trump has reportedly expressed frustration with Pompeo for asking Taylor to step in after the ouster of Maria Yovanovitch, accusing the secretary of state of jeopardizing his presidency by hiring officials who have testified in the impeachment inquiry. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has announced the US does not consider Israel\u2019s West Bank settlements to be a violation of international law, marking a significant policy shift in the Middle East. The New York Times reports: The United States has in the past described the settlements as illegitimate, and Palestinians have demanded the land for a future state, a goal that has been backed by the international community. But President Trump has been persistent in changing United States policy on Israel and the Palestinian territories \u2014 moves aimed at boosting political support for Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister who has failed to form a government after two rounds of elections with razor-close outcomes. Pompeo also tried to brush off questions about the House impeachment inquiry just three days after Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, criticized state department leadership for not standing by its foreign service officers. \u201cI always defend state department employees,\u201d Pompeo told reporters. Nancy Pelosi also argued in her \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter on the impeachment inquiry that the investigation is crucial to protecting the integrity of US elections. \u201cThe weak response to these hearings has been, \u2018Let the election decide,\u2019\u201d the House speaker wrote. \u201cThat dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.\u201d Some of Trump\u2019s allies have argued the inquiry is undermining the 2020 race because lawmakers are considering whether the president should be impeached and removed from office just a year before the election. House speaker Nancy Pelosi just released a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter defending the impeachment inquiry amid Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on the investigation. Pelosi emphasized the House is continuing to work on legislation related to government funding and trade, even as the investigation intensifies. Trump has repeatedly claimed the impeachment inquiry is interfering with the House\u2019s legislative agenda. \u201cAt the same time we legislate, we continue to investigate and litigate, as the impeachment inquiry proceeds,\u201d Pelosi said. The House speaker went on to lay out the accusations against Trump, once again using the term \u201cbribery\u201d to describe the president\u2019s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. \u201cThe facts are uncontested: that the President abused his power for his own personal, political benefit, at the expense of our national security interests,\u201d Pelosi wrote. \u201cThere are also some who say that no serious wrongdoing was committed, because the military assistance to Ukraine was eventually released. The fact is, the aid was only released after the whistleblower exposed the truth of the President\u2019s extortion and bribery, and the House launched a formal investigation.\u201d A bipartisan pair of senators are considering an IRS whistleblower\u2019s claim that a Trump political appointee may have interfered with the routine audit of the president and vice president\u2019s tax returns. The Washington Post reports: Staff members for Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Wyden (Ore.), the chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, met with the IRS whistleblower earlier this month, those people said. Follow-up interviews are being scheduled to further explore the whistleblower\u2019s allegations. It could not be learned to what extent the senators consider the whistleblower a credible source. Trump administration officials have previously played down the complaint\u2019s significance and suggested that it is politically motivated. The whistleblower, a career IRS official, initially filed a complaint in July, reporting that he was told that at least one Treasury political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president\u2019s or vice president\u2019s tax returns. In recent weeks, the whistleblower filed additional documentation related to the original complaint, which was given to congressional officials in July, [two people familiar with the matter] said. Representative Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the House ways and means committee, previously said the complaint raised \u201cserious and urgent concerns\u201d about the IRS audit process, which is supposed to be protected from political interference. Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who became famous following his speech condemning Trump at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, has announced he is endorsing Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cI\u2019m supporting Joe Biden for President because of the America he stands for and the one he will fight for \u2014 the country that my son, Humayun Khan, believed in and fought for so bravely,\u201d Khan said in a statement released by Biden\u2019s campaign. \u201cBeating Donald Trump and the hatred he promotes is the top priority in this election. But after Trump is gone, we need someone to help unite us and help us heal. I trust Joe Biden to be that person because I know his heart like I know my own.\u201d In his 2016 speech, Khan reflected upon the loss of his son in the Iraq War and lambasted Trump\u2019s proposal to block Muslims from entering the country. \u201cLet me ask you, have you even read the United States constitution?\u201d Khan famously said, addressing Trump. Producing a reproduction of the constitution from his pocket, Khan added, \u201cI will gladly lend you my copy.\u201d The speech sparked an attack from then-candidate Trump, who claimed Khan had not \u201callowed\u201d his wife Ghazala to speak. That triggered criticism from both Republicans and Democrats and was considered by many to be one of the lowest points of Trump\u2019s campaign. The Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay on the House subpoena demanding access to Trump\u2019s financial records, fulfilling the president\u2019s wishes for the time being. The House\u2019s top lawyer previously said lawmakers would consent to a 10-day delay to allow for the filing of all applicable briefs in the case, but the counsel emphasized that a longer delay should not be necessary. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump said he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d testifying in the impeachment inquiry, possibly in writing, but that suggestion was met with skepticism given the president\u2019s refusal to be interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller. House lawyers told a federal court that lawmakers are investigating whether Trump lied to Mueller, as the Justice Department seeks a stay on congressional Democrats obtaining the special counsel\u2019s grand jury material. The Ukrainian president reportedly felt pressured to announce an investigation into Joe Biden months before his July phone call with Trump, undercutting his denials of such a campaign by the president\u2019s allies. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign issued an explanation on how a woman from Kenya ended up featured on its website promoting the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s \u201cDouglass Plan: A Comprehensive Investment in the Empowerment of Black America.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s rapid response communications director said that the picture has been removed and noted the stock photo was not initially labeled as having been taken in Kenya. The staffer added that the campaign\u2019s web operations have been moved in-house to prevent such errors in the future. Two House Republicans are requesting information from a Senate Republican on conversations he reportedly had with Trump and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, about the frozen military aid to Ukraine. \u201cBecause the Democrats have abandoned fundamental fairness and objectivity in their \u2018impeachment inquiry,\u2019 we reluctantly write to request any firsthand information you have about President Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine between April and September 2019,\u201d representatives Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes wrote to senator Ron Johnson. The Wisconsin Republican said yesterday he likely would not testify in the inquiry but would be willing to \u201csupply my telling of events\u201d in a written statement. Johnson told the Wall Street Journal last month that Sondland explicitly tied the frozen aid to an announcement of investigations, but Trump later told the Senate Republican that the two were not connected. According to a new poll, 70% of Americans believe Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to have Ukraine investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, were wrong. The ABC News/Ipsos poll found that 51% of Americans think Trump should be impeached and removed from office. Another 19% say Trump\u2019s actions were wrong but that he should not be removed from office, and 25% believe the president did nothing wrong. And as the second week of impeachment hearings begins tomorrow, only 21% of Americans say they are following the hearings very closely. Lawyers for the House suggested in a previous court filing that the grand jury material from Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation could help them determine whether Trump was truthful in his answers to the special counsel. \u201cNot only could those materials demonstrate the president\u2019s motives for obstructing the special counsel\u2019s investigation, they also could reveal that Trump was aware of his campaign\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks,\u201d the lawyer\u2019s wrote in the late September filing. They added, \u201cThose materials therefore have direct bearing on whether the president was untruthful, and further obstructed the special counsel\u2019s investigation, when in providing written responses to the special counsel\u2019s questions he denied being aware of any communications between his campaign and WikiLeaks.\u201d The House told a federal court that it is investigating whether Trump lied to Robert Mueller as the Justice Department seeks a stay on lawmakers receiving grand jury material from the special counsel\u2019s investigation. The president provided Mueller with written answers to some of the special counsel\u2019s questions but refused to sit for an interview with his team. Mueller also wrote in his final report that he considered some of Trump\u2019s answers to be incomplete or imprecise. Even though he has not yet officially launched his presidential bid, billionaire Michael Bloomberg has already picked up a key endorsement in the early voting state of South Carolina. The AP reports: Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, told The Associated Press on Monday that he\u2019s ready to back the billionaire if he decides to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. \u2018He\u2019s got what it takes and he\u2019s got the resources to take it to Trump,\u2019 Benjamin said in an interview. \u2018I believe firmly that Mike Bloomberg can win. I think resources are going to matter.\u2019 First elected in 2010, Benjamin is one of South Carolina\u2019s highest-profile black politicians. He\u2019s met with nearly all of the Democratic White House hopefuls, offering advice as they wind their way through South Carolina, home to the first southern primary next year and a contest in which support from black voters is critical. Other Democratic presidential candidates have struggled to put a dent in Joe Biden\u2019s lead in South Carolina. A new CBS News/YouGov poll from the state showed Biden attracting the support of 45% of South Carolina Democrats, putting him 28 points ahead of second-place finisher Elizabeth Warren. An endorsement from a prominent African American politician could help Bloomberg start to chip away at Biden\u2019s polling advantage, particularly given South Carolina\u2019s large black electorate. The former New York mayor also visited a black church yesterday to apologize for championing \u201cstop and frisk\u201d despite its disproportionate effect on people of color. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has sent a letter to defense secretary Mark Esper asking him to ensure that two of the witnesses in this week\u2019s impeachment hearing, Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Laura Cooper, are protected from retaliation. \u201cSince their identities were revealed, LTC Vindman and Ms. Cooper have been vilified and attacked by individuals in the media and elsewhere,\u201d Schumer wrote. \u201cAccordingly, I request that you formally notify all civilian and military personnel of their legal rights to make protected disclosures to Congress. I also request that you brief me on what actions are being taken to ensure that LTC Vindman, Ms. Cooper, and other whistleblowers like them are afforded appropriate protections\u2014both from workplace reprisals and for their personal safety and that of their families.\u201d Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the national security council, is scheduled to testify tomorrow morning, and Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, will speak to impeachment investigators on Wednesday afternoon. The Federal Reserve has just announced that its chairman, Jerome Powell, met with Trump and Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin in a sit-down that was not on the president\u2019s original public schedule. The central bank said in a statement after the meeting, \u201cAt the President\u2019s invitation, Chair Powell met with the President and the Treasury Secretary Monday morning at the White House to discuss the economy, growth, employment and inflation. \u201cChair Powell\u2019s comments were consistent with his remarks at his congressional hearings last week. He did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economy. \u201cFinally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective and non-political analysis.\u201d That final sentences appears to be a clear dig at Trump, who has tried to pressure Powell to lower interest rates more quickly by criticizing him over Twitter. However, Trump was purely positive in his latest tweet about Powell, claiming their meeting was \u201cvery good &amp; cordial.\u201d Testifying to Congress last week, Powell said that he was confident the Fed\u2019s plan for lowering interest rates would help the US economy, although he acknowledged the trade war with China (among other factors) has harmed growth. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reportedly felt pressure to announce an investigation into Joe Biden even before his July phone call with Trump, which sparked the impeachment inquiry. The AP reports: In early May, staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were briefed on a meeting Zelenskiy held in which he sought advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in, according to two people with knowledge of the briefings. He was concerned that Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S. presidential race, the people said. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue. The briefings show that U.S. officials knew early that Zelenskiy was feeling pressure to investigate Biden, even though the Ukrainian leader later denied it in a joint news conference with Trump in September. This new reporting undermines Zelenskiy\u2019s denials that he felt White House pressure to investigate Biden, which Republicans have repeatedly cited to push back against Democrats\u2019 accusations in the impeachment inquiry. A CNN reporter noted that it is smart to be skeptical of Trump\u2019s claim that he might testify in the impeachment inquiry, given the president\u2019s repeated promises to answer questions from special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump did eventually answer some written questions from Mueller\u2019s team, but the president refused to sit down for an interview despite the special counsel\u2019s requests. Mueller also said in his report that he found a number of Trump\u2019s written answers to be incomplete or imprecise. The accelerating impeachment inquiry has reportedly created tension in the relationship between Trump and secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who has previously been considered one of the cabinet members with the most sway over the president. NBC News reports: Trump has fumed for weeks that Pompeo is responsible for hiring State Department officials whose congressional testimony threatens to bring down his presidency, the officials said. The president confronted Pompeo about the officials \u2014 and what he believed was a lackluster effort by the secretary of state to block their testimony \u2014 during lunch at the White House on Oct. 29, those familiar with the matter said. Inside the White House, the view was that Trump \u2018just felt like, \u2018rein your people in,\u2019\u2019 a senior administration official said. Trump particularly blames Pompeo for tapping Ambassador Bill Taylor in June to be the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, the current and former senior administration officials said. According to his public schedule, Trump is set to meet with Pompeo at 4 p.m. today, so the subject of state department officials testifying in the inquiry may arise again. Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was back on the bench today after missing one day of oral arguments last week because of a \u201cstomach bug.\u201d The liberal justice, who is the oldest member of the court at 86 years old, has had some health issues in recent months and has fought cancer several times. David Holmes, a staffer at the US embassy in Kyiv, has arrived on Capitol Hill to review his closed-door testimony in the impeachment inquiry. According to his opening statement, Holmes today impeachment investigators that Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, had referenced a \u201cBiden investigation\u201d in Ukraine as a possible boon to the president. The testimony undermines Sondland\u2019s assertion to the House committees investigating impeachment that he was not aware of a connection between the Ukrainian energy company Burisma and the Bidens. Meanwhile, on the 2020 campaign trail, it was a very mixed weekend for Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. On the plus side, the Indiana mayor surged into first place in a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. Buttigieg has hit 25% in the first caucus state \u2013 putting him nine points ahead of Elizabeth Warren and 10 points ahead of Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. However, the Intercept also published an article on the Buttigieg campaign\u2019s outreach (or lack thereof) to African American voters, who make up a large portion of the Democratic primary electorate. According to the Intercept, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign recently released a list of 400 endorsers of his \u201cDouglass Plan: A Comprehensive Investment in the Empowerment of Black America.\u201d However, some of the most prominent endorsers said they actually had misgivings about the plan or felt their support for the proposal had been purposely misconstrued as an endorsement of Buttigieg\u2019s candidacy. To top it all off, at least half of the people on the list were white, even though the campaign had billed the endorsements as a demonstration of support for Buttigieg within the black community. The Intercept reporter who wrote the story later added that a woman in Kenya was confused to see a picture of her used as a stock photo on Buttigieg\u2019s website for the Douglass Plan. The campaign removed the photo and blamed the error on a contractor who helped build the website. Long story short: Buttigieg is in a strong position in Iowa. But the question of how he will build his campaign beyond the mostly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire remains largely unanswered. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer echoed House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s suggestion that Trump come testify in the impeachment inquiry. \u201cIf Donald Trump doesn\u2019t agree with what he\u2019s hearing, doesn\u2019t like what he\u2019s hearing, he shouldn\u2019t tweet. He should come to the committee and testify under oath,\u201d the New York Democrat said yesterday. \u201cAnd he should allow all those around him to come to the committee and testify under oath.\u201d Schumer argued Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the inquiry, as well as his efforts to block aides from testifying, beg the question: \u201cWhat is he hiding?\u201d Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU who is set to testify on Wednesday, reportedly kept some senior administration officials aware of the campaign to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. The Wall Street Journal reports: Several witnesses have testified to impeachment investigators that they were alarmed by what they perceived as dual channels of U.S. policy on Ukraine\u2014one traditional, and the other led by Mr. Sondland and Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, which focused on the president\u2019s push for certain investigations. Mr. Sondland kept several top officials\u2014including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Energy Secretary Rick Perry\u2014apprised of that push, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal, in the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart that spurred a whistleblower complaint and, ultimately, the impeachment probe. Sondland will almost be certainly be pressed on who in the White House knew what and when during his public testimony in the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday. Trump is using his light schedule today to tweet out more criticism of Democrats for their handling of the House impeachment inquiry. However, the president interestingly said he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d testifying in the impeachment inquiry, possibly in writing. Nancy Pelosi suggested that Trump testify while appearing on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d yesterday. \u201cIf he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it,\u201d the House speaker said. Pelosi added that Trump \u201ccould come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants.\u201d Good morning, live blog readers! The second round of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump begins tomorrow, and Republicans\u2019 defenses of the president\u2019s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, are going to be put to the test. Republicans on the House intelligence committee sought to dismiss last week\u2019s damning testimony from Bill Taylor, Gorge Kent and Maria Yovanovitch as secondhand information because none of the state department officials spoke directly to Trump as the Ukraine controversy unfolded. However, Trump\u2019s congressional allies will need to devise a new defense this week. Some of this week\u2019s most anticipated witnesses \u2013 Lt Col Alexander Vindman, who will testify tomorrow, and Gordon Sondland, who will testify Wednesday \u2013 did speak to Trump directly about the pressure campaign. Vindman was even on Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president that sparked the initial whistleblower complaint. As the hearings get closer and closer to the White House, congressional Republicans will have to quickly work out a new strategy if they want to protect Trump from the accelerating inquiry. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on today: Trump has no public events today but will meet with secretary of state Mike Pompeo this afternoon. Democratic presidential candidate Deval Patrick will make his first visit to Iowa since launching his campaign. The House and the Senate are back in session. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "body": "<p>Shortly after news emerged last week that another player would step away from the game indefinitely, Cricket Australia sought to dispel suggestions of an emerging mental health crisis. Young batsman Will Pucovski ruled himself out of selection for Australia\u2019s upcoming Tests against Pakistan less than a fortnight after Victorian teammates Glenn Maxwell and Nic Maddinson similarly revealed their own personal struggles. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/14/will-pucovski-pulls-out-of-test-contention-and-requests-mental-wellbeing-break\">Cameron Bancroft and Joe Burns return to Australia Test squad at expense of Ashes flops</a> </p> </aside>  <p>CA was adamant, however, that their sport was merely reflecting a wider issue. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in our players is a snapshot of society,\u201d head of sports science Alex Kountouris said. \u201cThey\u2019re not more vulnerable or less vulnerable than others in society of a similar age group.\u201d This was reiterated by newly appointed executive general manager of national teams Ben Oliver: \u201cThis is not a sport thing. It\u2019s not a cricket thing, it\u2019s a society thing.\u201d</p> <p>Research indicates CA is likely correct. To date there is little to no evidence to suggest professional sports people experience mental health issues at a higher rate than the general population. But sports psychologists say cricket\u2019s unique demands may exacerbate existing issues. While crammed scheduling and social media abuse have been raised as key elements of the mental health debate, the sport\u2019s relentless mental challenges may also play a role.</p> <p>\u201cIf we look at cricket and the unique individual battles and the way you can be exposed if you show weakness, that can really be something that people play on,\u201d Dr Richard Keegan, sport and exercise psychologist at the University of Canberra, tells Guardian Australia. \u201cThat has the potential to really play into vulnerability and self-awareness.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In some sports you make a mistake and you\u2019re straight into the next point or phase. That\u2019s not always the case in cricket</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Richard Keegan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most people familiar with the game, from park cricket upwards, know the sport is almost encased in anxiety and insecurity. Superstitions and dressing room idiosyncrasies reflect this, particularly those waiting to bat. It is perhaps no surprise that five high-profile Australian cricketers who acknowledged mental health issues in the last 12 months are all (predominantly) batters \u2013 Maxwell, Maddinson, Pucovski, Nicole Bolton and Moises Henriques.</p> <p>\u201cIn some sports you make a mistake and you\u2019re straight into the next point or phase,\u201d Keegan says. \u201cThat\u2019s not always the case in cricket. It places a premium on not making mistakes and avoiding failure. That particular mindset, that avoidance of failure and intolerance of failure, often underpins a lot of commonalities in different mental illnesses.\u201d</p> <p>When Henriques spoke with the ABC\u2019s 7.30 last year detailing his long struggle with depression, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-15/moises-henriques-opens-up-about-his-battle-with-mental-illness/10501446\">he confirmed</a> this was his mindset. \u201cI was so afraid of failure, I was so afraid of missing out,\u201d he said. \u201cI was blaming cricket for my anxiety and I wanted to do well so much that it just took over. It just wasn\u2019t healthy at all.\u201d</p> <p>Compared with the football codes, few get the chance to play elite cricket in Australia. Dr Bradley Elphinstone, lecturer in psychology at Swinburne University, says when goals are not achieved at the ultra-competitive selection table, players can struggle. \u201cIf you have a professional athlete in any sport who base their self worth and identity on performing at a very high level and they don\u2019t, in addition to all the media and social media criticism, they are putting a lot of negativity onto themselves. I can certainly see how that builds up and causes mental health issues.\u201d</p> <p>Elphinstone agrees that cricket presents challenges different to most other sports. \u201cI think it is unique in a lot of ways,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a real demand on long-term concentration that may be beyond a lot of other sports\u2026the need to concentrate for a sustained period of time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2bb4cdf539648bc2225144454c126ebc91db2d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2bb4cdf539648bc2225144454c126ebc91db2d8/0_0_4872_3287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Pucovski\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Pucovski made himself unavailable to Australian Test selectors due to mental health issues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nature of each player\u2019s personal issues, as has been seen in the past fortnight, are markedly different. For some the relentless nature of modern scheduling has proved overly taxing, while for others the relentless negativity of social media has taken its toll.</p> <p>Positively, the player perhaps best placed to understand the challenges of relentless travel and social media abuse is Shane Watson, who was last week appointed president of the Australian Cricketers\u2019 Association. He has already declared mental health as his number one priority in the role. Other positives have also emerged, in particular Virat Kohli\u2019s strong support of Maxwell and admission of his own struggles.</p> <p>Both experts say self-reporting is rightfully being praised.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s obviously the traditional view that if you can play for your club or country then you should, no questions asked,\u201d Keegan says. \u201cBut that\u2019s typically how people can get into trouble and push themselves too far. By stepping up and speaking out, that begins to normalise these conversations, and takes these thoughts from being suppressed or taboo.\u201d</p> <p>Elphinstone adds: \u201cThere is a shift in the social narrative from it being a sign of weakness.\u201d </p> <p>A sharpened focus on the issue from both the ACA and CA would suggest the sport\u2019s key bodies won\u2019t be caught unaware should further players seek time away from the game. No one could say how many that might be, but some believe the issues of the last fortnight may be the tip of the iceberg \u2013 a view reinforced by Henriques <a href=\"https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode/321339\">earlier this year</a>. \u201cI think it [mental health issues] is very prevalent in cricket. I definitely think there are a lot more people that suffer in silence.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after news emerged last week that another player would step away from the game indefinitely, Cricket Australia sought to dispel suggestions of an emerging mental health crisis. Young batsman Will Pucovski ruled himself out of selection for Australia\u2019s upcoming Tests against Pakistan less than a fortnight after Victorian teammates Glenn Maxwell and Nic Maddinson similarly revealed their own personal struggles. CA was adamant, however, that their sport was merely reflecting a wider issue. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in our players is a snapshot of society,\u201d head of sports science Alex Kountouris said. \u201cThey\u2019re not more vulnerable or less vulnerable than others in society of a similar age group.\u201d This was reiterated by newly appointed executive general manager of national teams Ben Oliver: \u201cThis is not a sport thing. It\u2019s not a cricket thing, it\u2019s a society thing.\u201d Research indicates CA is likely correct. To date there is little to no evidence to suggest professional sports people experience mental health issues at a higher rate than the general population. But sports psychologists say cricket\u2019s unique demands may exacerbate existing issues. While crammed scheduling and social media abuse have been raised as key elements of the mental health debate, the sport\u2019s relentless mental challenges may also play a role. \u201cIf we look at cricket and the unique individual battles and the way you can be exposed if you show weakness, that can really be something that people play on,\u201d Dr Richard Keegan, sport and exercise psychologist at the University of Canberra, tells Guardian Australia. \u201cThat has the potential to really play into vulnerability and self-awareness.\u201d Most people familiar with the game, from park cricket upwards, know the sport is almost encased in anxiety and insecurity. Superstitions and dressing room idiosyncrasies reflect this, particularly those waiting to bat. It is perhaps no surprise that five high-profile Australian cricketers who acknowledged mental health issues in the last 12 months are all (predominantly) batters \u2013 Maxwell, Maddinson, Pucovski, Nicole Bolton and Moises Henriques. \u201cIn some sports you make a mistake and you\u2019re straight into the next point or phase,\u201d Keegan says. \u201cThat\u2019s not always the case in cricket. It places a premium on not making mistakes and avoiding failure. That particular mindset, that avoidance of failure and intolerance of failure, often underpins a lot of commonalities in different mental illnesses.\u201d When Henriques spoke with the ABC\u2019s 7.30 last year detailing his long struggle with depression, he confirmed this was his mindset. \u201cI was so afraid of failure, I was so afraid of missing out,\u201d he said. \u201cI was blaming cricket for my anxiety and I wanted to do well so much that it just took over. It just wasn\u2019t healthy at all.\u201d Compared with the football codes, few get the chance to play elite cricket in Australia. Dr Bradley Elphinstone, lecturer in psychology at Swinburne University, says when goals are not achieved at the ultra-competitive selection table, players can struggle. \u201cIf you have a professional athlete in any sport who base their self worth and identity on performing at a very high level and they don\u2019t, in addition to all the media and social media criticism, they are putting a lot of negativity onto themselves. I can certainly see how that builds up and causes mental health issues.\u201d Elphinstone agrees that cricket presents challenges different to most other sports. \u201cI think it is unique in a lot of ways,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a real demand on long-term concentration that may be beyond a lot of other sports\u2026the need to concentrate for a sustained period of time.\u201d The nature of each player\u2019s personal issues, as has been seen in the past fortnight, are markedly different. For some the relentless nature of modern scheduling has proved overly taxing, while for others the relentless negativity of social media has taken its toll. Positively, the player perhaps best placed to understand the challenges of relentless travel and social media abuse is Shane Watson, who was last week appointed president of the Australian Cricketers\u2019 Association. He has already declared mental health as his number one priority in the role. Other positives have also emerged, in particular Virat Kohli\u2019s strong support of Maxwell and admission of his own struggles. Both experts say self-reporting is rightfully being praised. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously the traditional view that if you can play for your club or country then you should, no questions asked,\u201d Keegan says. \u201cBut that\u2019s typically how people can get into trouble and push themselves too far. By stepping up and speaking out, that begins to normalise these conversations, and takes these thoughts from being suppressed or taboo.\u201d Elphinstone adds: \u201cThere is a shift in the social narrative from it being a sign of weakness.\u201d A sharpened focus on the issue from both the ACA and CA would suggest the sport\u2019s key bodies won\u2019t be caught unaware should further players seek time away from the game. No one could say how many that might be, but some believe the issues of the last fortnight may be the tip of the iceberg \u2013 a view reinforced by Henriques earlier this year. \u201cI think it [mental health issues] is very prevalent in cricket. I definitely think there are a lot more people that suffer in silence.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Other international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org",

      "bodyText": "Tony Abbott has accused China of bullying its neighbours and warned Australia\u2019s relations with it are unlikely to rise above a \u201ccold peace\u201d. In a speech to the India Foundation in New Delhi overnight, the former Liberal prime minister promised to champion further engagement with India, suggesting Australia had \u201cput too many eggs into the China basket\u201d. The comments are at odds with former Labor prime minister Paul Keating who suggested on Monday that Australia\u2019s approach to China has been supplanted by the phobias of security agencies and the hysteria of \u201cpious\u201d and \u201cdo-gooder\u201d journalists. The intervention comes as Liberal MPs are hardening their stance against China, with senator Eric Abetz suggesting on Tuesday the \u201cbarbaric\u201d practice of forced organ harvesting may constitute genocide of members of Falun Gong. In June the independent China tribunal found that the killing of detainees in China for organ transplants is continuing, and victims include imprisoned followers of the Falun Gong movement. Abetz, the chair of the Senate foreign affairs committee, told Radio National he had asked the Australian government its position on the report and the international community needs to tell China the practice is \u201cillegal, barbaric and a breach of every fundamental human right\u201d. \u201cGenocide \u2013 in relation to Falun Gong \u2013 is something that might be an appropriate description,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the evidence is there the Falun Gong seem to be the main target but Buddhists, Uighurs, house Christians and indeed criminals have all been targeted for organ harvesting.\u201d Abetz said the practice should be condemned \u201cno ifs and buts\u201d and Australia \u201cshould be able to join\u201d with the European Union, US House of Representatives and Canadian parliamentary subcommittee in calling for an international investigation. Abetz said Australians should be blocked from travelling to China for organ transplants, arguing that to do so condones forced transplants, and universities need to ensure they \u201care not unwittingly\u201d supporting the trade by having greater transparency on cooperation with Chinese institutions. According to Abbott in a speech first reported in the Nine newspapers, Australian governments have \u201ccarefully cultivated\u201d the relationship with China but must now be \u201cvery cautious\u201d about further engagement. \u201cThe often-glossed-over reality is that it\u2019s hard for Australia to be a meaningful strategic partner to a country that thinks it can bully its neighbours on the basis of confected territorial claims that it refuses to submit to arbitration and tries to resolve unilaterally in its favour,\u201d Abbott reportedly said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for any country to be [anything] other than a client, or a strategic competitor, with a country that still regards itself as the \u2018middle kingdom\u2019 and that has now dropped the mask of hiding its strength and biding its time.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see relations with China rising much above the level of a \u2018cold peace\u2019 any time soon.\u201d Australia would \u201ccontinue to offer China the food and resource security it craves and to share our thinking on what makes an economy more prosperous and a society more humane\u201d, Abbott reportedly said. \u201cWe should be very cautious about the kind of technical engagement that leaves us relatively weaker and China relatively stronger.\u201d On Friday China blocked the visas of Liberal MPs Andrew Hastie and James Paterson, two of the most strident critics of the Chinese Communist party, who intended to travel there on a China Matters study tour.

In addition, almost six in 10 (58%) believe this winter will be the toughest yet for the service. The views expressed by senior NHS figures on Tuesday will heighten the anxiety in Conservative ranks that the health service\u2019s growing problems risk derailing the party\u2019s campaign in an election members hoped would be dominated by Brexit. The Labour party is seeking to capitalise on public dissatisfaction over delays in accessing treatment and the increasingly visible gaps in staffing. In a further sign of Tory concern, ministers have agreed an extraordinary deal for the NHS to pay doctors\u2019 pension tax bills this year, which could cost hundreds of millions of pounds. The scheme is aimed at halting the sharp recent increase in doctors working fewer shifts in order to avoid being hit with unexpected tax bills of up to \u00a3100,000.

However, the deal immediately triggered claims that it has been agreed between ministers and NHS England in defiance of \u201cpurdah\u201d rules that stipulate that governments must not undertake changes of policy during an election campaign. It is being presented as an \u201coperational decision\u201d by NHS England, but was signed off \u2013 and some believe instigated \u2013 by the Treasury, Cabinet Office and the Department of Health and Social Care. A senior medical source involved in brokering the unprecedented \u201cstopgap\u201d policy suggested it came about because ministers were \u201cdesperate\u201d to avoid fewer shifts by doctors compounding hospitals\u2019 struggles this winter. The source said: \u201cThey have so massively breached purdah regulations it\u2019s unbelievable. This isn\u2019t an operational matter. This is policy. It\u2019s outrageous, because purdah rules say that you can\u2019t announce a change of policy during an election.\u201d The 131 chief executives, chairs and directors of NHS trusts in England expressed their serious concern about the deteriorating state of the service in a survey conducted by the NHS Confederation. The findings came days after the latest official figures showed that hospitals\u2019 performance against key waiting times for A&amp;E care, cancer treatment and planned operations had fallen to its worst ever level. However, many service chiefs told the confederation that delays will get even longer when the cold weather creates extra demand for care. \u201cThere is real concern among NHS leaders as winter approaches and this year looks particularly challenging,\u201d said Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the confederation, which represents most NHS bodies, including hospital trusts, in England. \u201cHealth leaders are deeply concerned about its ability to cope with demand, despite frontline staff treating more patients than ever. \u201cThere is the very real prospect of gaps in clinical shifts and patients not receiving the quality of care they need because NHS trusts do not have the staff they need.\u201d \u201cDespite doing everything within their power, 90% of health leaders we surveyed said that understaffing was putting patients at risk. \u201cWe have 100,000 clinical vacancies [in England] and the prospect of ever-rising demand unless we face up to the scale of the challenge,\u201d added Dickson. Last week\u2019s figures showed that one in four people who attend a hospital-based A&amp;E are waiting more than four hours to be dealt with, record numbers are having to wait on a trolley while they are found a bed and seven of the eight clinically vital cancer treatment targets are being missed. Dickson added that, even if the next government provided more money to tackle widespread staff shortages, it would take time to reduce the high vacancy rates that are common in many hospitals. The NHS is short of about 43,000 nurses and almost 10,000 doctors as well as paramedics and other health professionals. He warned political parties not to raise voters\u2019 expectations unreasonably in the run-up to polling on 12 December about how quickly the NHS can get back on track. \u201cMore investment is needed but even with that this is a system that will take time to turn around and the electorate must not be fed with overpromises over the coming weeks,\u201d he said. The King\u2019s Fund voiced concern at the results of the research. \u201cAmidst the political rhetoric of the general election campaign, these findings underline the stark reality facing patients across the country who are struggling to access NHS services,\u201d said Sally Warren, the thinktank\u2019s director of policy. \u201cWorkforce shortages are already having a direct impact on the quality of people\u2019s care, with national patient surveys repeatedly highlighting difficulties for patients accessing NHS services and performance against key waiting time targets at their worst in over a decade. \u201cThese NHS leaders are correct \u2013 without urgent action patient safety will be at risk.\u201d The confederation\u2019s survey of 131 hospital bosses also found that: 76% say staff shortages are the NHS\u2019s most pressing problem. 83% say the dispute over senior doctors\u2019 pensions is making understaffing even worse. 69% say doctors deciding to work fewer hours is damaging patient care. 98% say the deepening crisis in social care is leading to more older people needing hospital care.",

Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, said it was his aim to stop the parents of murdered children seeing the \u201csickening\u201d spectacle of their killers walking free. He said a Conservative government would change the sentencing guidelines to advise that the premeditated murder of a child under 16 by an adult over 21 should be subject to a \u201cwhole life order\u201d, so they would never be able to apply for release. The current rules require the murder to be of multiple children or to be sexually or sadistically motivated. The move is one of several policies on tougher sentencing as the Tories seek to make tackling crime a central election issue. This is despite it causing problems for the party in the 2017 election, when Theresa May was repeatedly challenged over her cuts to the police service while home secretary. Buckland said: \u201cThere can be no more sickening injustice than that of heartbroken parents watching the killer of their child walk free. \u201cThat\u2019s why under a Conservative majority government, the law will be rewritten to be absolutely clear: any murderer who denies a young, innocent child the right to life surrenders their own right to liberty.
