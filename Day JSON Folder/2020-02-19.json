In a judgment handed down on Thursday, the federal court, sitting as the court of disputed returns, said it would not refer Simon Frost to the high court, despite his admission that the signs, which were written in Chinese and used at the 2019 election, were intended to look like the AEC\u2019s material. The court was required to decide whether it would refer Frost after it handed down a decision in December over a challenge to the election of the Liberals Gladys Liu, in Chisholm and the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in Kooyong. It found the purple and white signs were misleading or deceptive, but it dismissed the challenge to Liu and Frydenberg\u2019s victories, saying there was \u201cno real chance\u201d the corflutes could have affected the results. On Thursday, federal court justices James Allsop, Andrew Greenwood and Anthony Besanki said in their decision that the nature of the court challenge meant it had not examined enough evidence to satisfy by the \u201crelevant fault element\u201d. \u201cGiven the limited nature of our findings in the December reasons and the way the hearing of the petitions was conducted we are not in a position to draw such conclusion about Mr Frost\u2019s state of mind and knowledge and it would be unfair on him so to do,\u201d the judgment said. The court found that the signs were \u201conly misleading or deceptive when placed adjacent to the AEC material\u201d and that \u201cMr Frost was not cross-examined on any instructions about the placement of the corflutes\u201d. Submissions from Frost\u2019s counsel had \u201ccorrectly pointed out\u201d that Frost had not been represented in court and \u201cthat there were many loose ends in his evidence, to a degree favourable to him\u201d, the court said. \u201cNo findings were made, nor did the proceeding address, any fault element to allow any conclusion that Mr Frost acted in a way that may be said to amount to the committal of an offence,\u201d the judgment said. The challenge was brought by climate campaigner Vanessa Garbett, who lives in Liu\u2019s electorate of Chisholm, in Melbourne\u2019s east. The two signs \u2013 one in traditional Chinese characters, and one in simplified Chinese \u2013 were used in seven electorates in Victoria and said the \u201ccorrect way to vote\u201d was to put 1 next to the Liberal candidate. In their judgment that asked Frost to explain why he should not be referred to the high court, the justices said: \u201cThe deliberateness of the attempt to make the sign look like an AEC sign by someone in Mr Frost\u2019s position bespeaks a view of someone with experience in political campaigning that there was some advantage in doing so.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Tropical Cyclone Winston struck Abhishek Sapra\u2019s farm exactly four years ago, the damage was monumental. Sapra suffered losses of over $F500,000 (US$227,000).</p> <p>\u201cThe trees were stripped of all their leaves, a lot of heritage trees fell over, crops were almost completely wiped out,\u201d says Sapra. \u201cUnless it was underground it didn\u2019t survive.\u201d</p> <p>The majority of the production losses to Sapra\u2019s 90-acre farm in Taveuni, the third-largest island in Fiji, were to his kava crop, a valuable cash crop which is fragile to strong winds. But Sapra also saw a drop in the numbers of native parrots, doves and bats which are instrumental for pollination.</p> <p>The damage to Sapra\u2019s land, his family has been farming for nearly a century, was reflected across the country. Winston, which struck Fiji on 20 February 2016, was the most intense cyclone in the southern hemisphere. It killed 44 people in Fiji and resulted in huge losses for Fiji\u2019s economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/05/the-great-kava-boom-how-fijis-beloved-psychoactive-brew-is-going-global\">The great kava boom: how Fiji's beloved psychoactive brew is going global</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While all aspects of Fiji\u2019s economy were affected by Winston, the impacts were particularly felt in agriculture, which contributes 10.75% to Fiji\u2019s GDP. About 45% of Fijian households derive some form of income from agriculture, and it is particularly important to people living below or close to the poverty line, with women comprising nearly 37% of those employed.</p> <p>But since the storm, Sapra has been rebuilding and re-planting differently and his methods may help the country\u2019s agricultural sector mitigate damage from future \u2013 and increasing \u2013 cyclone events.</p> <h2>Climate-resilient farming</h2> <p>Surveying the aftermath of Winston, Sapra noticed two key things that convinced him that there was a need to return to older farming practices.</p> <p>The first was in his kava fields.</p> <p>\u201cIn areas with tree cover, the kava was saved since the trees created natural windbreaks, branches that fell formed a protective blanket. But where there were no trees the crops were completely uprooted,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ba83471baa0c0c9b4c00a0dc362b3be43ab7bb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ba83471baa0c0c9b4c00a0dc362b3be43ab7bb4/0_303_4543_2726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abhishek Sapra has been engaging in regenerative farming practices at his farm in Taveuni Fiji, after it experienced huge damage from Cyclone Winston, four years ago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abhishek Sapra has been engaging in regenerative farming practices at his farm in Taveuni Fiji, after it experienced huge damage from Cyclone Winston, four years ago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nilesh Pawar/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second observation was that down by the coast, most of the land had been eaten away by the strong waves that swept 30-50 feet inland, except the area held in place by the roots of a massive heritage tree that had been growing for more than 100 years.</p> <p>In the years before the cyclone struck, farming on Sapra\u2019s estate was cleared of forests, which meant weeds and vines, naturally controlled by the shade of the trees, proliferated.</p> <p>\u201cMy grandfather began using herbicides to control the weeds, and as the soil quality began to worsen he implemented the use of chemical fertilisers to keep production at a steady rate. Gradually our soil began to disappear revealing mostly volcanic rock making planting more difficult and the land became more acidic.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Sanjay Anand, a professor of soil science at the University of the South Pacific, says this practice of land-clearing has led to a loss of biodiversity and increase in soil erosion, and is on the rise across Fiji.</p> <p>\u201cAs the population grows, so does the need for more food production, leading to more new areas being cleared for farming,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On his regular hikes into the forest, Sapra observed the structure of the forest \u2013 where large trees, which provided shelter to fruit bats and birds, would shelter smaller plants.</p> <p>As he tried to rebuild and replant his farm in the wake of the cyclone, Sapra planted a variety of crops \u2013 intercropping kava with coffee, turmeric, ginger \u2013 in ways that mimicked the structure of nearby forests, underneath large trees to provide shelter.

      "bodyText": "When Tropical Cyclone Winston struck Abhishek Sapra\u2019s farm exactly four years ago, the damage was monumental. Sapra suffered losses of over $F500,000 (US$227,000). \u201cThe trees were stripped of all their leaves, a lot of heritage trees fell over, crops were almost completely wiped out,\u201d says Sapra. \u201cUnless it was underground it didn\u2019t survive.\u201d The majority of the production losses to Sapra\u2019s 90-acre farm in Taveuni, the third-largest island in Fiji, were to his kava crop, a valuable cash crop which is fragile to strong winds. But Sapra also saw a drop in the numbers of native parrots, doves and bats which are instrumental for pollination. The damage to Sapra\u2019s land, his family has been farming for nearly a century, was reflected across the country. Winston, which struck Fiji on 20 February 2016, was the most intense cyclone in the southern hemisphere. It killed 44 people in Fiji and resulted in huge losses for Fiji\u2019s economy. While all aspects of Fiji\u2019s economy were affected by Winston, the impacts were particularly felt in agriculture, which contributes 10.75% to Fiji\u2019s GDP. About 45% of Fijian households derive some form of income from agriculture, and it is particularly important to people living below or close to the poverty line, with women comprising nearly 37% of those employed. But since the storm, Sapra has been rebuilding and re-planting differently and his methods may help the country\u2019s agricultural sector mitigate damage from future \u2013 and increasing \u2013 cyclone events. Climate-resilient farming Surveying the aftermath of Winston, Sapra noticed two key things that convinced him that there was a need to return to older farming practices. The first was in his kava fields. \u201cIn areas with tree cover, the kava was saved since the trees created natural windbreaks, branches that fell formed a protective blanket. But where there were no trees the crops were completely uprooted,\u201d he said. The second observation was that down by the coast, most of the land had been eaten away by the strong waves that swept 30-50 feet inland, except the area held in place by the roots of a massive heritage tree that had been growing for more than 100 years. In the years before the cyclone struck, farming on Sapra\u2019s estate was cleared of forests, which meant weeds and vines, naturally controlled by the shade of the trees, proliferated. \u201cMy grandfather began using herbicides to control the weeds, and as the soil quality began to worsen he implemented the use of chemical fertilisers to keep production at a steady rate. Gradually our soil began to disappear revealing mostly volcanic rock making planting more difficult and the land became more acidic.\u201d Dr Sanjay Anand, a professor of soil science at the University of the South Pacific, says this practice of land-clearing has led to a loss of biodiversity and increase in soil erosion, and is on the rise across Fiji. \u201cAs the population grows, so does the need for more food production, leading to more new areas being cleared for farming,\u201d he said. On his regular hikes into the forest, Sapra observed the structure of the forest \u2013 where large trees, which provided shelter to fruit bats and birds, would shelter smaller plants. As he tried to rebuild and replant his farm in the wake of the cyclone, Sapra planted a variety of crops \u2013 intercropping kava with coffee, turmeric, ginger \u2013 in ways that mimicked the structure of nearby forests, underneath large trees to provide shelter. He has eschewed chemical fertilisers in favour of mulch and organic-based fertilisers such as those made from seaweed. Within a year of starting this project, Sapra began noticing renewed health of the soil and increased blooms and fruit production from his citrus, breadfruit and mango plants. His kava plants, which are planted among a mix of trees known for their nitrogen fixing properties, as well as others that act as windbreakers and provide shade, have a much lower incidence rate of \u201cshot-hole\u201d disease, which damages the health of the kava plant and is identifiable by several spots and holes in its heart shaped leaves. As maturing trees have shed their leaves, natural mulch is created, which feeds snails, centipedes and various fungi species. On re-planting heritage species, he saw a rise in the numbers of iconic and endemic birds, such as doves and red shining parrots and bats each year. \u201cThe ground is softer, easier to dig into, holds more moisture, and is a rich black colour. And with trees in place, the rich top soil does not wash away as easily in the rain,\u201d he says. John Bennett, a prominent ethnobotanist in the Pacific region, says such an approach is ideal, but as prices for some crops soar \u2013 particularly kava, the root of which is ground up and mixed with water into a traditional psychoactive brew, which is starting to gain international appeal \u2013 it is difficult to persuade some farmers, especially those with limited leases, to prioritise soil health over profit. \u201cSome farmers practice intercropping,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cBut with increased mono-cropping of kava due to its increased value, many areas are being opened up to plant kava with little regard to sustainability\u201d. After witnessing the positive results, farmers who work on Sapra\u2019s farm have begun adopting similar practices on their lands. When Fiji was hit by Tino, a category-3 cyclone in January \u2013 the second cyclone to hit the country in less than a month \u2013 there was minimal damage to Sapra\u2019s crops and soil, something he credits to the regenerative agriculture practices he has implemented. As experts warn that warming seas will result in more frequent cyclones across the Pacific, working to protect agricultural land is essential. Bennett says Sapra is on the right path. \u201cAbhishek\u2019s holistic approach is, without question, both appropriate, and, with our present climate anomalies, imperative.\u201d For Sapra, his methods are equally motivated by philosophy and economy. \u201cThe main purpose is to create a working farm resilient to harsh climate, where people are able to make economical use of the land without degrading the environment,\u201d said Sapra.",

But the shared message was one of defiance.</p> <p>Sandwiched by two examples of Gabriel Jesus\u2019s curious reluctance to shoot when he had only the goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to beat came a new addition to the City songbook. \u201cFuck you Uefa, we\u2019ll see you in court,\u201d were the lyrics and who, a few years ago, thought they would be singing about the court of arbitration for sport rather than Sergio Ag\u00fcero or Kevin De Bruyne, that they would be watching one of the most successful sides in English history and chanting about the connotations of allegedly inflated commercial revenues?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/manchester-city-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City coast to comfortable victory against West Ham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a sense, they were correct. As Soriano said emphatically earlier on Wednesday, City will appeal against their two-year ban from the Champions League. The court of public opinion at the Etihad Stadium would not have found in favour of European football\u2019s governing body. One banner behind the goal where Rodri struck proclaimed \u201cUefa mafia\u201d. Another homemade effort read \u201cUefa scam\u201d. Some, perhaps, would have selected a different vowel in the second word. A third said \u201cUefa cartel\u201d, which isn\u2019t a noun often found on placards at football grounds.</p> <p>There was something of a siege mentality and perhaps City\u2019s strategy has helped to generate that. And yet this was not a cauldron of hate. The loudest chants were more upbeat affairs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Guardiola,\u201d for instance, which was sung lustily. Pep Guardiola, that improbable successor to Brian Horton and Alan Ball, is set to stay for a fifth season, with or without the carrot of Champions League football.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was \u201cCity, the best team in the world\u201d, a sentiment they used to voice in the knowledge it was preposterous. There was \u201cwe\u2019re not really here\u201d, which dates back two decades, sung when their peers were Macclesfield, not Real Madrid, and York, not Juventus, and reflects the surreal nature of City\u2019s recent history. Many were there watching mediocrity and glory and, whether or not their trophies were tainted, will be there again.</p> <p>Above all there were the salutes to Pablo Zabaleta, the West Ham substitute who was making his final appearance on the ground he graced for nine years. Signed a few weeks before Sheikh Mansour\u2019s takeover, his brand of wholehearted commitment made him a City cult hero. The Argentinian has lost the power that allowed him to hurtle up and down the right flank but not his place in supporters\u2019 affections. He exited the Etihad Stadium with arms aloft, acknowledging the appreciation. A last goodbye to Zabaleta energised more fans than any bitterness towards anyone else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"71e24032732cc4de544d8d28e0369018eb84880e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71e24032732cc4de544d8d28e0369018eb84880e/0_138_3144_1886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Foden embraces former teammate Pablo Zabaleta at the final whistle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Foden embraces former teammate Pablo Zabaleta at the final whistle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Flathers/Manchester City FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The difference in the decibel level was instructive. There were clearly some, even if it is impossible to prove how many, who joined in the chants in support of their club, their manager and their returning favourite, but not those against Uefa. It is probably simplistic to talk of the vocal minority and the silent majority but no fanbase is homogenous. There are the realists and the extremists, those who seem philosophical and those who feel persecuted. There are those who want to know more and those who made their opinion apparent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/manchester-city-claim-uefa-ban-less-about-justice-and-more-about-politics-ferran-soriano\">Manchester City claim Uefa ban 'less about justice and more about politics'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than once, they sang the name of Mansour, the man who bankrolled their rise; suspiciously, Uefa feels. The songs about the Glazers and Mike Ashley do not tend to be flattering but City\u2019s fans are altogether fonder of their owner. Soriano, one of his key lieutenants, had claimed Uefa\u2019s allegations are false. There were times, though, when he looked bored on Wednesday night in a match lacking in intensity and, at times, atmosphere, amid a sense that the destinies of these clubs will be decided on other days; in City\u2019s case, in a different environment.</p> <p>There was vitriol but also, as Moonchester defeated Hammerhead in a race between the mascots, frivolity and normality. The mood before kick\u2011off was of quiet contemplation. A ground sometimes derided as the \u201cEmptihad\u201d had more empty seats than usual, though that could have been because those who bought tickets for the original game were unable to attend a rearranged fixture. Storm Ciara had forced a postponement 10 days earlier. Storm Uefa may yet do more lasting damage to City.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There was probably more menace in the message from the chief executive than the chorus from the stands, even if Ferran Soriano\u2019s language contained fewer expletives. But the shared message was one of defiance. Sandwiched by two examples of Gabriel Jesus\u2019s curious reluctance to shoot when he had only the goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to beat came a new addition to the City songbook. \u201cFuck you Uefa, we\u2019ll see you in court,\u201d were the lyrics and who, a few years ago, thought they would be singing about the court of arbitration for sport rather than Sergio Ag\u00fcero or Kevin De Bruyne, that they would be watching one of the most successful sides in English history and chanting about the connotations of allegedly inflated commercial revenues? In a sense, they were correct. As Soriano said emphatically earlier on Wednesday, City will appeal against their two-year ban from the Champions League. The court of public opinion at the Etihad Stadium would not have found in favour of European football\u2019s governing body. One banner behind the goal where Rodri struck proclaimed \u201cUefa mafia\u201d. Another homemade effort read \u201cUefa scam\u201d. Some, perhaps, would have selected a different vowel in the second word. A third said \u201cUefa cartel\u201d, which isn\u2019t a noun often found on placards at football grounds. There was something of a siege mentality and perhaps City\u2019s strategy has helped to generate that. And yet this was not a cauldron of hate. The loudest chants were more upbeat affairs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Guardiola,\u201d for instance, which was sung lustily. Pep Guardiola, that improbable successor to Brian Horton and Alan Ball, is set to stay for a fifth season, with or without the carrot of Champions League football. There was \u201cCity, the best team in the world\u201d, a sentiment they used to voice in the knowledge it was preposterous. There was \u201cwe\u2019re not really here\u201d, which dates back two decades, sung when their peers were Macclesfield, not Real Madrid, and York, not Juventus, and reflects the surreal nature of City\u2019s recent history. Many were there watching mediocrity and glory and, whether or not their trophies were tainted, will be there again. Above all there were the salutes to Pablo Zabaleta, the West Ham substitute who was making his final appearance on the ground he graced for nine years. Signed a few weeks before Sheikh Mansour\u2019s takeover, his brand of wholehearted commitment made him a City cult hero. The Argentinian has lost the power that allowed him to hurtle up and down the right flank but not his place in supporters\u2019 affections. He exited the Etihad Stadium with arms aloft, acknowledging the appreciation. A last goodbye to Zabaleta energised more fans than any bitterness towards anyone else. The difference in the decibel level was instructive. There were clearly some, even if it is impossible to prove how many, who joined in the chants in support of their club, their manager and their returning favourite, but not those against Uefa. It is probably simplistic to talk of the vocal minority and the silent majority but no fanbase is homogenous. There are the realists and the extremists, those who seem philosophical and those who feel persecuted. There are those who want to know more and those who made their opinion apparent. More than once, they sang the name of Mansour, the man who bankrolled their rise; suspiciously, Uefa feels. The songs about the Glazers and Mike Ashley do not tend to be flattering but City\u2019s fans are altogether fonder of their owner. Soriano, one of his key lieutenants, had claimed Uefa\u2019s allegations are false. There were times, though, when he looked bored on Wednesday night in a match lacking in intensity and, at times, atmosphere, amid a sense that the destinies of these clubs will be decided on other days; in City\u2019s case, in a different environment. There was vitriol but also, as Moonchester defeated Hammerhead in a race between the mascots, frivolity and normality. The mood before kick\u2011off was of quiet contemplation. A ground sometimes derided as the \u201cEmptihad\u201d had more empty seats than usual, though that could have been because those who bought tickets for the original game were unable to attend a rearranged fixture. Storm Ciara had forced a postponement 10 days earlier. Storm Uefa may yet do more lasting damage to City.",

Let\u2019s be loyal to the boys and tell they did everything they could do. Lamela? You know how many training sessions he made with the team? Zero. Direct from injury to recovering on the pitch with the physios, to 20 minutes of a game in the Champions League. That is our team. You can see it from two perspectives. One perspective is, it\u2019s an amazing group with amazing guys. They try everything. By another side you see how we are in this moment. You look to the other guys, they play with Schick and Werner and Nkunku. Nkunku is tired, come out, there\u2019s Forsberg. Schick is tired, come out, there\u2019s Poulsen. This is our situation, it\u2019s like going to a fight with a gun but without bullets. You can tell me we had luck in some moments. I disagree. We had a great goalkeeper, that is not luck, that is a great goalkeeper. We had our chances and tried everything. I thank the fans. What worries me is,these are our players for the next, I don\u2019t know how many matches. In the next few matches we could see Lucas dead, Bergwijn dead, Lo Celso dead. I am so proud of them. But we are really in trouble. Don\u2019t tell me that Lamela and Ndombele could start the game, because they could not. But I could not be happier to have guys like them with the limitations we have, but here we go! Chelsea are drinking sparkling water with lemon while watching the game on TV, and Saturday morning, thank you very much, we are there again.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4db2ce8f0811db2fafacc5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T22:13:21.870Z\">10.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg was our man at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this evening.</strong> His verdict is in ... and here it is!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/tottenham-rb-leipzig-champions-league-match-report\">Spurs fall to Leipzig's Timo Werner but grateful for Lloris heroics</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4db13b8f0811db2fafacbd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T22:09:21.445Z\">10.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hugo Lloris speaks.</strong> \u201cI want to stay positive, especially after the last 20 minutes.

But we have to give a lot of credit to Leipzig, they press very high and are a very good team. We have to stay positive, not give up, not try to find excuses, and fight to the end.

It is the same for Tottenham and Leipzig, we have injured players. But I think Ethan Ampadu will do well.

Too many matches in the knockout stage of the Champions League are thought of emotionally as one match. But this is only a half-match. So we need to be very intelligent in our approach, knowing what we have and what we don\u2019t have, and be positive with a good feeling. We are going to play against a team that normally play with five at the back, are very consistent and very fast. So I think a very difficult match. But we know what to do. Emotional control. It is not about fighting and running. We need to be clinical with our chances, but also knowing how to manage the game and the tempo. It is February, we are fighting for the top four, we are in the knockouts, and the last 16 of the FA Cup, so it is a big effort from the boys to be here. I think the crowd will be with them.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4d87948f086a28115aec4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T19:10:21.935Z\">7.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Gedson Fernandes makes his Champions League debut for Spurs. </strong>His presence allows Giovani Lo Celso to move upfield in the space left by the injured Son Heung-min. </p> <p><strong>Leipzig\u2019s defensive crisis means a start for Ethan Ampadu, on loan from Chelsea. </strong>One-time Everton striker Ademola Lookman is on the bench.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4d85828f08e13324746540\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T18:59:53.649Z\">6.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tonight's teams</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur: </strong>Lloris, Aurier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Davies, Winks, Fernandes, Lo Celso, Alli, Bergwijn, Lucas Moura.<br><em>Subs: Vertonghen, Lamela, Dier, Gazzaniga, Ndombele, Skipp, Tanganga.</em></p> <p><strong>RB Leipzig: </strong>Gulacsi, Mukiele, Klostermann, Halstenberg, Angelino, Laimer, Ampadu, Sabitzer, Nkunku, Schick, Werner.<br><em>Subs: Haidara, Poulsen, Forsberg, Lookman, Wolf, Olmo, Mvogo.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Referee: </strong>Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey).</em><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4d0f6d8f086a28115ae6d2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T17:41:29.888Z\">5.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Only three teams have ever lifted the European Cup the season after tasting defeat in the final: Milan in 1994, Bayern Munich in 2013 and Liverpool last year. </strong>Three in 63 seasons; that\u2019s a one-in-21 hit rate. If history counts for anything, Tottenham Hotspur have their work cut out if they\u2019re to go one better than last season. On behalf of all Spurs fans: bah.</p> <p><strong>But hold on! </strong>Spin it another way, and the feat has been achieved twice in the last seven seasons. It\u2019s far from a pipe dream in the modern game. So on behalf of all Spurs fans: yay!</p> <p><strong>Mind you, the first knockout hurdle on the road to Istanbul looks a toughie. </strong>And not just because Spurs lost 7-2 the last time a German team came to N17, a mere four months ago. Bayern Munich, Tottenham\u2019s tormentors that horrific evening, are currently leading the Bundesliga, but they\u2019re being pursued all the way by tonight\u2019s visitors RB Leipzig. The club might only be celebrating its 11th birthday come May, but this is clearly a team capable of mixing it with the older boys. So you\u2019ll forgive Spurs, 137, if they feel a little trepidation tonight.</p> <p><strong>It doesn\u2019t help that Spurs will be without their first-choice front line of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. </strong>But Leipzig have defensive worries: Dayot Upamecano is suspended while Ibrahima Konate and Willi Orban are out injured. Ethan Ampadu, on loan from Chelsea, may get a start as a result. So it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. Throw in the fact that Leipzig have only won one of their last five in all competitions, while Spurs are three wins on the bounce, and we\u2019ve got ourselves a game. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>8pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T19:15:34.428Z\">at 7.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And so the evening ends with another man-management masterclass from Jose Mourinho. If you squint really hard, and peer between the lines, you may conclude that he\u2019s not totally happy with his lot. Should Chelsea beat Spurs at the weekend, his post-match interview could be the most riotous thing transmitted live on television on a Saturday lunchtime since the days of Tiswas. You\u2019ll join us for that one, yes? See you soon! It\u2019s not quite up there with his famous Chelsea-Southampton soliloquy, but Jose Mourinho\u2019s post-match interview is quite something. BT Sport\u2019s Des Kelly tries to get proceedings off to a positive start, asking whether we \u201csaw the real Spurs in the last 20 minutes\u201d. A glance is shot, Mourinho\u2019s steely gaze lingering longer than is strictly comfortable. \u201cCome on. What do you mean by the real Spurs? Come on. Tch. Come on. Let\u2019s be loyal to the boys and tell they did everything they could do. Lamela? You know how many training sessions he made with the team? Zero. Direct from injury to recovering on the pitch with the physios, to 20 minutes of a game in the Champions League. That is our team. You can see it from two perspectives. One perspective is, it\u2019s an amazing group with amazing guys. They try everything. By another side you see how we are in this moment. You look to the other guys, they play with Schick and Werner and Nkunku. Nkunku is tired, come out, there\u2019s Forsberg. Schick is tired, come out, there\u2019s Poulsen. This is our situation, it\u2019s like going to a fight with a gun but without bullets. You can tell me we had luck in some moments. I disagree. We had a great goalkeeper, that is not luck, that is a great goalkeeper. We had our chances and tried everything. I thank the fans. What worries me is,these are our players for the next, I don\u2019t know how many matches. In the next few matches we could see Lucas dead, Bergwijn dead, Lo Celso dead. I am so proud of them. But we are really in trouble. Don\u2019t tell me that Lamela and Ndombele could start the game, because they could not. But I could not be happier to have guys like them with the limitations we have, but here we go! Chelsea are drinking sparkling water with lemon while watching the game on TV, and Saturday morning, thank you very much, we are there again.\u201d Jacob Steinberg was our man at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this evening. His verdict is in ... and here it is! Hugo Lloris speaks. \u201cI want to stay positive, especially after the last 20 minutes. Obviously if we started the game in the same way, the score would be different. But there is a second leg, we still have a chance. We are still alive. We were a bit more proactive with the ball. But we have to give a lot of credit to Leipzig, they press very high and are a very good team. We have to stay positive, not give up, not try to find excuses, and fight to the end. We are not really happy, but we have to deal with that. Let\u2019s hope we can create another story.\u201d He\u2019s then given the man-of-the-match award, and doesn\u2019t look particularly pleased to receive it. \u201cEr, OK, but I\u2019d have preferred a win.\u201d Spurs depart for the dressing room looking glum. They were second best for most of that game. The match winner, Timo Werner, was excellent. So was Patrik Schick, though he missed one glorious chance to put Spurs in all sorts of trouble. Tottenham can take heart from the performance of Giovani Lo Celso, who sparkled in attack, and their performance during the last 20 minutes, when Lo Celso and Erik Lamela finally asked a few questions of Leipzig. But they\u2019ve got a big job on in Saxony in three week\u2019s time. The visitors stay on the pitch and celebrate with their fans. After this half-match (\u00a9 Jose Mourinho) they\u2019re halfway to the quarter finals. Bergwijn nearly beats Ampadu to a long ball down the middle, but the young Welsh defender holds firm, and that\u2019s that. Spurs have been outplayed at home and are reasonably fortunate to have limited the damage to a single goal. But all is not lost. They\u2019ve been here before. Two words: Ajax Amsterdam. 90 min +4: Lamela is booked for leaving a stiff arm in Sabitzer\u2019s startled coupon. 90 min +3: Bergwijn slips a pass down the inside right, forcing Ampadu into a desperate interception, sliding the ball out for a corner. But Lo Celso\u2019s delivery is overcooked and flies out the other side for a goal kick. 90 min +2: Winks tries to guide a shot towards the top right from the best part of 30 yards. It\u2019s weakly struck and easily snaffled by Gulacsi. 90 min +1: Leipzig knock it around the middle. Sixty seconds fly by. 90 min: Ampadu goes down with cramp. Mukiele needs a couple of swabs up a bloody nose. The clock ticks on. There will be five extra minutes. 89 min: Some pinball on the edge of the Leipzig box. Davies loops a cross in from the left. Halstenberg mistimes his jump, missing the ball and gifting Moura a free header, six yards out. He\u2019s got to work the keeper at the very least, surely, but slaps his header over the bar. What a chance. 87 min: Forsberg and Werner combine well down the left and earn a corner off Alderweireld. Leipzig don\u2019t commit many players upfield, and the set piece is easily cleared. 86 min: The corner is hit deep. Moura does well to rise highest, but can\u2019t get a header on target. A melee, in which a couple of Spurs players fall over. Nobody claims for a penalty. 85 min: Leipzig are beginning to ask for trouble, sitting deep and allowing Spurs to come at them. Moura comes racing down the middle and is upended by Forsberg. A free kick from a central position, 30 yards out. Lamela takes, curling one towards the bottom right. It\u2019s going wide, but Gulacsi turns it around the post anyway. A free corner for Spurs. 84 min: Some space down the right for Aurier, who whips a cross into the mixer. It\u2019s easy meat for Gulacsi. 83 min: Emil Forsberg takes Konrad Laimer\u2019s place. 82 min: Laimer goes down clutching his shoulder. He\u2019ll be replaced. He takes his own sweet time to leave, in the grand clock-management style. 80 min: Halstenberg clearly obstructs Aurier as the Spurs man looked to break clear down the right. No foul, according to the referee. That\u2019s a preposterous decision, and no wonder Jose Mourinho, on the touchline, performs the internationally recognised jig of fury, throwing his arms about, spinning around, effin\u2019 and jeffin\u2019 into the cool night air. 79 min: A lot of frantic nonsense in the midfield. Both teams fully aware of how important the next 11 minutes, plus stoppages, could be. 77 min: Spurs have enjoyed most of the possession during the last ten minutes, so Nagelsmann makes another switch. Yussuf Poulsen replaces Patrik Schick. 75 min: Lamela puts himself about in the Argentinian style, a sly block here, a cheeky clip there. That\u2019s also got the crowd shouting again. Plenty of noise as Spurs look for a precious equaliser. 74 min: Leipzig make their first change of the evening. Christopher Nkunku is replaced by Amadou Haidara. 73 min: Lo Celso curls one towards the top left. It\u2019s a wonderful free kick, sailing in, but it\u2019s tipped onto the post by Gulacsi and out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but that\u2019s got the crowd going for the first time in ages. Lo Celso has been seriously impressive this evening. 72 min: Lo Celso runs hard at Leipzig again. He\u2019s clearly being tugged back by Nkunku, and earns a free kick, just to the right of the D. Nkunku is booked. A promising position, this, though before the whistle blew for the foul, Lo Celso had Aurier in acres to his right. But this is where we are. 70 min: Leipzig sit back and stroke it around with great confidence. Time is already on their side. 68 min: Lo Celso has been Tottenham\u2019s best player this evening, their only hope in attack. He dribbles elegantly down the inside-right channel, momentarily threatening to tie Leipzig up in knots. But he can\u2019t find the killer pass. 66 min: Dele Alli is seething. But Mourinho had to do something. Here\u2019s Peter Crosby: \u201cAh Ben Davies. Ah, Serge. We\u2019re back to the glory days of my youth when Dean Austin and Justin Edinburgh were tearing up and down the flanks letting in goals left, right and centre.\u201d 64 min: Spurs make a double change. Off goes Gedson Fernandes and an affronted Dele Alli; on come Erik Lamela and Tanguy Ndombele. 62 min: Leipzig nearly score after a wonderful sweeping move. There\u2019s acres for Angelino down the left. He rolls a pass inside for Werner, who throws Alderweireld off the scent with a sensational dummy, letting the ball roll to Schick, free on the penalty spot. He has to score, but flashes his shot straight at Lloris. Great save, but he should never have been allowed to make it. What a lovely move that was. Werner is living up to his billing. 61 min: A little space for Bergwijn down the left. He drifts inside then checks back and tees up Lo Celso, who pearls a decent strike towards the bottom right from 20 yards. It\u2019s well read and easily gathered by Gulacsi, though. 60 min: Spurs try to bounce back immediately, Lo Celso bursting down the right into space. But there\u2019s nobody near his pullback, and the visitors can clear with ease. There\u2019s a break on, with the livewire Werner romping down the left, but he\u2019s well marshalled away from the danger zone by Sanchez. Werner, as cool as a pickled cucumber, fires a low penalty into the bottom left. Lloris had guessed correctly, but even at full stretch couldn\u2019t get anywhere near it. A crucial away goal for the Germans. 57 min: Laimer took a bit of a whack. Looks like he\u2019ll be OK, but there\u2019s a pause before Werner can take the spot kick. 56 min: Leipzig stroke it around the back awhile, then suddenly spring forward, triangulating at speed down the right. The ball\u2019s switched to the other flank. Werner glides inside and slips a pass down the middle for Laimer, who takes a touch, enters the box, and is upended by a crude block by Davies. Foul, booking, penalty. No question. 54 min: A simple ball down the middle causes Sanchez all sorts of problems. He heads it straight into the air and back down towards Werner, who accepts the gift and purchases a cheap corner. Nothing comes from the set piece, but after a slow start to the second half, Leipzig are beginning to reestablish their earlier control. 52 min: Nkunku tries to whip one over the wall and into the top left. It\u2019s not a good effort, the ball sailing serenely over the crossbar. 51 min: Schick bursts down the left and is cynically clipped from behind by Aurier. Not exactly sure why the Spurs full-back hasn\u2019t gone into the book, but there we are. It\u2019s a free kick in a dangerous position, though, 25 yards out, just to the left of the D. 50 min: Leipzig loop crosses into the Spurs box from the left and then from the right. The home defence holds firm, though Werner was again buzzing around their heels with great purpose. It\u2019s very odd that this game remains goalless. 48 min: Spurs launch their first meaningful attack of the evening. Aurier swings a low cross in from the right. Moura extends a leg and forces Gulacsi into a parry from close range. Bergwijn hoicks the rebound harmlessly wide left. But that\u2019s so much better from the hosts, and the home fans respond accordingly. And we\u2019re off again! Spurs get the second half underway, and there have been no half-time changes. Not long after the restart, the Leipzig fans fling on a few toilet rolls. Everyone\u2019s a critic. They unfurl a banner which reads STAND UP FOR A FAIR PRICE CAP. Applause from all four corners of the stadium. After a clean-up operation, the game eventually restarts. Spurs weren\u2019t great in that first half, but their fans remain four-square behind the team. \u201cThe way I see it, Tottenham have no striker, no defensive midfield, and are keeping a clean sheet against a team in form,\u201d argues Gregory Greene. \u201cOur attackers aren\u2019t fluffing chances (they aren\u2019t getting any honestly), and I\u2019ve seen Tottenham defend worse. I can\u2019t really be mad.\u201d Meanwhile James Hopkin thinks a happy ending is written: \u201cThe big question in tonight\u2019s game (apart from which minute with Spurs score a late smash and grab winner) is why do a couple of the RBL players (e.g. Timo Werner) have all-white logos on their shirts and others have full colour red bulls?\u201d I have no idea. To get us all talking about everybody\u2019s favourite nerve-end-bothering beverage? Half-time entertainment. There have been goals in tonight\u2019s other match. Simon Burnton has the details. But don\u2019t forget to come back, y\u2019all. Alli busies himself down the left, flatly refusing to give up possession and winning a corner off Halstenberg. The same Leipzig defender heads the corner clear, and there\u2019s that whistle. Spurs will be pleased to get to the break without conceding. Leipzig have been by far the better side, and will wonder how they haven\u2019t bagged a crucial away goal. Some work for Mourinho to do during the break. 45 min: And that half-time whistle will be heard in roughly 60 seconds time. 44 min: Werner probes again down the left. Aurier just about holds him up. Spurs could do with the half-time whistle, though in retrospect that\u2019s been the case since the 26-second mark. 42 min: Here comes Werner again, down the left, winning another corner off Sanchez. The corner, once again, is not worthy of our time or consideration. 41 min: Werner whizzes down the left and nearly finds Schick in the middle, six yards out. Schick would be slamming home a sidefoot, but Sanchez slides in to bundle the ball out for a corner. What a glorious saving tackle. The resulting corner is a complete non-event. 39 min: Mukiele is back on. Good news for Leipzig, as he\u2019s been involved in a lot of their best attacks. Out on the other flank, Fernandes drops a shoulder to get past Angelino, and whips a cross to the near post, but Alli can\u2019t get his head on the ball. Tottenham\u2019s best half-chance of this half-match. 38 min: Mukiele is down in some pain, having taken an accidental whack to the left knee. That knee\u2019s already covered in tape, so he could have aggravated an existing problem. He grimaces an awful lot as he limps off for more treatment. 36 min: Leipzig should be leading. Schick and Halstenberg bus the ball right to left, and find Werner free, just inside the area. Werner\u2019s one on one with Lloris, but slams it straight at the keeper. The resulting corner is a waste of time. That\u2019s a poor effort from the much-heralded Werner, who is on a run of five matches without scoring. 34 min: They kind of have a point, but then Sabitzer, already in the book, gets away with a blatant clip on Fernandes. A free kick, nothing more. The Leipzig captain wants to watch himself here. One more clumsy one and he could be walking. 33 min: Winks shoves Schick in the back but gets away with it and races off up the left touchline. Werner sticks out a leg. There\u2019s no contact, but Winks goes over, and Werner goes into the book. Several Leipzig players, plus the manager, wear affronted looks. 32 min: The corner is sent long and half cleared. From 25 yards, Fernandes slaps a wild shot deep into the stand behind the goal. 31 min: Yet more space for Angelino down the left, sent away by Werner. But there\u2019s nobody to cross to, so he buys a corner off Sanchez. The same defender clears the set piece, and suddenly Lo Celso is tearing down the left in sensational style. He slips a pass forward to Bergwijn, who wins a corner for Spurs. Good end-to-end fun. 29 min: Spurs are struggling to keep hold of possession. Moves consisting of more than two or three passes are at a premium right now. The home fans are getting a little concerned. 27 min: Schick slips a ball down the left for the relentless Angelino, whose low cross is only just missed by a lunging Werner, hoping to poke home from six yards. The flag goes up for offside, belatedly and correctly, but Spurs are giving Angelino so much space on the left. They need to sort this out, because at some point the Leipzig attack is going to click in the final third. 26 min: Spurs enjoy a little possession for the first time in the game. They don\u2019t go anywhere in particular, but that should give them a little confidence in midfield, where they\u2019ve been thoroughly out-passed so far. 24 min: The right wing-back Mukiele flashes a crossfield ball towards his opposite number Angelino, whose cross-cum-shot is blocked. Leipzig are switching the play time and again, in the style of the reigning champions Liverpool. Julian Nagelsmann less Baby Mourinho, more Baby Klopp. 22 min: Atalanta have taken an early lead in their tie with Valencia. Hans Hateboer with the opening goal on 16 minutes in that one. Simon Burnton is all over that one. 20 min: The Tottenham plan is obviously to play on the break. Moura gets the better of Ampadu under a long ball, but can\u2019t see off Halstenberg. For a second, it looked as though he might break free. But the defender purchases a cheap free kick and Leipzig are off back up the other end, pinging the ball around once more. 19 min: Werner bursts down the left and finds Schick in the middle. Schick can\u2019t get either a header or shot away, and a combination of Sanchez and Winks manage to half-clear. Angelino comes again, sending a fizzer down Lloris\u2019s throat from a tight angle on the left. Spurs are getting mauled at the moment. 17 min: Schick rises miles above Davies and sends a downward header inches wide of the bottom right. Had that been on target, it was a goal; Lloris was rooted to the spot. Leipzig are getting closer and closer. 16 min: An awful lot of space for Werner down the left. He nearly frees the overlapping Sabitzer with a cute pass, but Sanchez reads play and pokes out for a corner. From which ... 14 min: Ampadu sprays a pass wide left for Angelino, who hits a first-time volleyed cross down the corridor of uncertainty. Nobody in black, red and blue dashes has taken a gamble, and there are no scares for Spurs. 12 min: Laimer tries to send Werner clear down the left. The striker\u2019s in space, but the pass is poor and sails out harmlessly for a goal kick. Spurs try to counter, but Bergwijn is clipped from behind by Sabitzer, and it\u2019s now one yellow card apiece. There\u2019s little sense that this fast, open game will end goalless, and it might not end with a full complement of players either. 10 min: Lo Celso is booked for a late trip on Sabitzer, who was hoping to burst off down the left. The Spurs man doesn\u2019t bother complaining, he was bang to rights. A long evening on a yellow, one poor challenge away from an early shower, stretches out ahead. 9 min: Angelino dinks a little pass down the inside left for Schick, who whistles a shot towards the bottom left. Lloris is behind it all the way. 8 min: Perhaps the best form of defence is attack. Lo Celso slips a ball down the left that forces Mukiele into conceding a corner. The set piece is only half cleared, but Spurs come back again down the left, Lo Celso finding Bergwijn, who curls towards the bottom right. Gulacsi sticks out a strong hand, and the flag goes up for offside. But that\u2019s better from the home side. Somewhere, in a parallel universe, it\u2019s 1-1. 6 min: Mukiele drives down the right and finds Werner on the edge of the box. Winks throws himself in the way of a shot. Great block, but once again Leipzig opened Spurs up with ease, and Spurs surely can\u2019t keep making last-ditch blocks and saves all night. 4 min: Such an electric start by the visitors. Four efforts on goal within the first 120 seconds. Three of them very decent chances. Some decent last-ditch defending by Spurs, but that\u2019ll have rattled them. Leipzig coming at them from all angles. 2 min: What a start this is by Leipzig! Werner\u2019s snap effort from six yards is blocked by Sanchez. The ball breaks left to Angelino, who hammers a shot straight at Lloris from a tight angle. Lloris deflects the ball onto the post and away. The visitors recycle possession, Mukiele and Werner buzzing down the inside right and forcing Lloris to turn the ball around the post. The flag goes up for offside to release the pressure. But wow. And we\u2019re off! Leipzig get the first leg of this round-of-16 tie underway. A huge roar crackles the north London air. And after 26 seconds, Schick juggles the ball down the middle and sends a decent effort bouncing inches wide of the right-hand post. The teams are out! A cracking Champions League atmosphere at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Spurs wear their famous lilywhite, while Leipzig sport their bespoke European away shirt, a cascade of black, red and blue dabs and dashes that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in Claude Monet\u2019s garden. In other shirt news, Harry Kane has presented Hannah and Danny Greaves, granddaughter and son of the absurdly brilliant former Spurs striker Jimmy, with a Spurs top to celebrate the living legend\u2019s 80th birthday tomorrow. On the back: GREAVES 80. If you get a chance to watch the new BT Sport documentary about Greavsie, snatch it with both hands. A marvellous celebration of the greatest English striker of all time. Anyway, we\u2019ll be off in a minute! Julian \u2018Baby Mourinho\u2019 Nagelsmann, who at 32 is only 22 years older than the club he manages, talks to BT Sport. \u201cIt is the first time at this stage for Leipzig, so we are all excited. We are a young team, perhaps a bit nervous, but we will try to do our own style. It is a great stadium and it\u2019s a pleasure to be here. It is the same for Tottenham and Leipzig, we have injured players. But I think Ethan Ampadu will do well. This is not a tactical battle between the managers, it is about the players, the performance of the guys. The emotional things are the more important, if you can deal with the pressure.\u201d If Spurs win this evening, Jose Mourinho will break the all-time record for victories as a manager in the knockout stage of the Champions League. He\u2019s currently tied on 27 wins with Sir Alex Ferguson, Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola. A 28th knockout victory will catapult him to the top of that particular tree, though of course Ancelotti has won the competition three times, as opposed to everyone else\u2019s two. Ancelotti also has two European Cup wins as a player to his name (Pep has one) so his medal haul knocks the other three into a cocked hat. A pre-match chat with Jose Mourinho. \u201cThis is a half-match. Too many matches in the knockout stage of the Champions League are thought of emotionally as one match. But this is only a half-match. So we need to be very intelligent in our approach, knowing what we have and what we don\u2019t have, and be positive with a good feeling. We are going to play against a team that normally play with five at the back, are very consistent and very fast. So I think a very difficult match. But we know what to do. Emotional control. It is not about fighting and running. We need to be clinical with our chances, but also knowing how to manage the game and the tempo. It is February, we are fighting for the top four, we are in the knockouts, and the last 16 of the FA Cup, so it is a big effort from the boys to be here. I think the crowd will be with them.\u201d Gedson Fernandes makes his Champions League debut for Spurs. His presence allows Giovani Lo Celso to move upfield in the space left by the injured Son Heung-min. Leipzig\u2019s defensive crisis means a start for Ethan Ampadu, on loan from Chelsea. One-time Everton striker Ademola Lookman is on the bench. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Davies, Winks, Fernandes, Lo Celso, Alli, Bergwijn, Lucas Moura. Subs: Vertonghen, Lamela, Dier, Gazzaniga, Ndombele, Skipp, Tanganga. RB Leipzig: Gulacsi, Mukiele, Klostermann, Halstenberg, Angelino, Laimer, Ampadu, Sabitzer, Nkunku, Schick, Werner. Subs: Haidara, Poulsen, Forsberg, Lookman, Wolf, Olmo, Mvogo. Referee: Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey). Only three teams have ever lifted the European Cup the season after tasting defeat in the final: Milan in 1994, Bayern Munich in 2013 and Liverpool last year. Three in 63 seasons; that\u2019s a one-in-21 hit rate. If history counts for anything, Tottenham Hotspur have their work cut out if they\u2019re to go one better than last season. On behalf of all Spurs fans: bah. But hold on! Spin it another way, and the feat has been achieved twice in the last seven seasons. It\u2019s far from a pipe dream in the modern game. So on behalf of all Spurs fans: yay! Mind you, the first knockout hurdle on the road to Istanbul looks a toughie. And not just because Spurs lost 7-2 the last time a German team came to N17, a mere four months ago. Bayern Munich, Tottenham\u2019s tormentors that horrific evening, are currently leading the Bundesliga, but they\u2019re being pursued all the way by tonight\u2019s visitors RB Leipzig. The club might only be celebrating its 11th birthday come May, but this is clearly a team capable of mixing it with the older boys. So you\u2019ll forgive Spurs, 137, if they feel a little trepidation tonight. It doesn\u2019t help that Spurs will be without their first-choice front line of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. But Leipzig have defensive worries: Dayot Upamecano is suspended while Ibrahima Konate and Willi Orban are out injured. Ethan Ampadu, on loan from Chelsea, may get a start as a result. So it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. Throw in the fact that Leipzig have only won one of their last five in all competitions, while Spurs are three wins on the bounce, and we\u2019ve got ourselves a game. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm GMT.",

Substitute Denis Cheryshev scored a consolation goal for Valencia to give the Spanish team a glimmer of hope ahead of the second leg on March 10.</p> <p>Atalanta were forced into a late change as defender Berat Djimsiti picked up a knock during the warmup and had to be replaced in the starting lineup by Mattia Caldara. The home side started brightly and Alejandro \u201cPapu\u201d Gomez sent a free kick narrowly over before Mario Paali forced a smart stop from Valencia goalkeeper Jaume Dom\u00e9nech.</p> <p>Atalanta broke the deadlock in the 16th minute when Hateboer slid in at the back post to turn in Gomez\u2019s cross from the left. Robin Gosens hit the side netting shortly afterwards before Valencia got into the match and almost levelled on the half-hour mark following a quickly-taken free kick, but Ferr\u00e1n Torres\u2019 effort crashed off the right post. </p> <p>Valencia went close again when Gon\u00e7alo Guedes cross-shot flew past Eliaquim Mangala sliding in at the far post. But Atalanta doubled their lead three minutes from the break as Ilicic held off two defenders before firing into the top left corner.</p> <p>Atalanta dominated from the restart and Freuler extended his side\u2019s lead in the 57th minute, curling a spectacular effort into the top right corner.</p> <p>The noise in the stadium was ramped up even more five minutes later when Hateboer ran almost half the length of the pitch before shooting past Dom\u00e9nech.</p> <p>Cheryshev replaced Guedes in the 64th and pulled one back for Valencia two minutes later, drilling a low shot into the bottom corner to give the Spanish side a glimmer of hope. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4db28f8f0811db2fafacc3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T22:11:36.505Z\">10.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And one on </strong>Manchester City\u2019s comfortable coast against West Ham:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/manchester-city-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City coast to comfortable victory against West Ham</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4db26b8f08e133247466c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T22:11:15.151Z\">10.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u2019s a report </strong>on Leipzig\u2019s easier-than-it-looks victory over Spurs:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/tottenham-rb-leipzig-champions-league-match-report\">Spurs fall to Leipzig's Timo Werner but grateful for Lloris heroics</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4db04b8f0811db2fafacbb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T22:05:36.659Z\">10.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Well that didn\u2019t disappoint. </strong>Atalanta were excellent, with Josip Ilicic outstanding (though that might just be because he\u2019s so tall) but threats coming from all angles at times.

Atalanta are not only in the Champions League places again this year, they\u2019re the top-scoring side in Serie A by a standard country mile, and in Josip Ilicic and Luis Muriel they have the division\u2019s fourth and sixth highest scorers. In the last couple of months there have been two 5-0 wins and a 7-0 away victory at Torino, and a total between them and their opponents of 35 goals in nine games at nearly four goals per match. Between them and Valencia there has been a total of one goalless draw all season.</p> <p>In short, a jolly good time is guaranteed for all. Well, not <em>exactly </em>guaranteed, but likely.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I wish you adieu. It\u2019s been a blast. Bye! Here\u2019s an Associated Press report on the Atalanta v Valencia game: Hans Hateboer scored twice as Atalanta beat Valencia 4-1 in the first leg of the Champions League\u2019s round of 16, putting the Italian team on the verge of a quarter-final spot in its first season in the competition. Roughly a third of the population of the small town of Bergamo was present at Milan\u2019s San Siro stadium to see Hateboer, Josip Ilicic and Remo Freuler score for Atalanta. Substitute Denis Cheryshev scored a consolation goal for Valencia to give the Spanish team a glimmer of hope ahead of the second leg on March 10. Atalanta were forced into a late change as defender Berat Djimsiti picked up a knock during the warmup and had to be replaced in the starting lineup by Mattia Caldara. The home side started brightly and Alejandro \u201cPapu\u201d Gomez sent a free kick narrowly over before Mario Paali forced a smart stop from Valencia goalkeeper Jaume Dom\u00e9nech. Atalanta broke the deadlock in the 16th minute when Hateboer slid in at the back post to turn in Gomez\u2019s cross from the left. Robin Gosens hit the side netting shortly afterwards before Valencia got into the match and almost levelled on the half-hour mark following a quickly-taken free kick, but Ferr\u00e1n Torres\u2019 effort crashed off the right post. Valencia went close again when Gon\u00e7alo Guedes cross-shot flew past Eliaquim Mangala sliding in at the far post. But Atalanta doubled their lead three minutes from the break as Ilicic held off two defenders before firing into the top left corner. Atalanta dominated from the restart and Freuler extended his side\u2019s lead in the 57th minute, curling a spectacular effort into the top right corner. The noise in the stadium was ramped up even more five minutes later when Hateboer ran almost half the length of the pitch before shooting past Dom\u00e9nech. Cheryshev replaced Guedes in the 64th and pulled one back for Valencia two minutes later, drilling a low shot into the bottom corner to give the Spanish side a glimmer of hope. And one on Manchester City\u2019s comfortable coast against West Ham: Here\u2019s a report on Leipzig\u2019s easier-than-it-looks victory over Spurs: Well that didn\u2019t disappoint. Atalanta were excellent, with Josip Ilicic outstanding (though that might just be because he\u2019s so tall) but threats coming from all angles at times. Valencia did threaten as well, hitting the bar and missing a couple of exceptional chances, one of them absolutely giftwrapped, and the margin of defeat is probably a little overharsh. They created enough to know that they have a chance at home in the second leg, but it is a very slim one, and will disappear entirely as soon as Atalanta score. 90+5 mins: They take it short, pass it back into their own half, and the final whistle sounds. Valencia have a magnificent first-leg victory and a three-goal lead to take to the Mestalla. 90+4 mins: The game will end with an Atalanta corner. 90+1 mins: There will be about four minutes of stoppage time. It starts with Ferran Torres shooting high when well placed, and Atalanta bringing Adrien Tameze on for Pasalic. 88 mins: Toloi suddenly pops up in the penalty area, but his touch just fails to take the ball past the miraculously-recovered Diakhaby, who was the only person between him and a fantastic shooting chance. 85 mins: Atalanta break, with Valencia overcommitted in attack, but the ball through to Zapata isn\u2019t quite right, forcing him to run wide of goal, and then it gets stuck under his feet, and it all comes to nothing. 84 mins: The ball is played up to Zapata, inside the penalty area. Pasilic is just behind him, completely unmarked, but Zapata lacks eyes in the right place to spot him and passes back instead, and the chance is lost. 82 mins: A bit of a delay while Mouctar Diakhaby receives treatment, after being hit in the head by Zapata\u2019s arm. He eventually gets to his feet, but is bleeding from his mouth and seems quite unstable and surely can\u2019t play on. 81 mins: Atalanta\u2019s captain, Bapu Gomez, comes off and Ruslan Malinovskyi comes on. 80 mins: A fine crossfield pass finds Wass running into the penalty area. He blasts the ball across goal where Jose Gaya is just beaten to it. 80 mins: Hateboer loses the ball to Cheryshev, pulls him back and earns the night\u2019s first booking. 79 mins: Valencia continue to push for the second/sixth goal that would blow the tie wide open, or at least slightly ajar, once again. Kondogbia\u2019s shot from 22 yards or so flies over the bar. 75 mins: Duvan Zapata replaces Mattia Caldara, tonight\u2019s unexpected starter, Gasperini deciding that the best way out of the barrage his defence has been under for the last few minutes is to take off a defender and add a forward.. 75 mins: Daniel Wass sends in a cross from the right that leads to a few seconds of panic, which ends when Carlos Soler throws himself to the ground. VAR checks for a penalty, and doesn\u2019t find one. 73 mins: Another change for Valencia, to take off Maxi Gomez, who seems to have completely misplaced his shooting boots, and bring on Kevin Gameiro. 70 mins: Another big miss from Valencia! A cross from the right falls for Maxi Gomez, who completely misses his kick! It falls kindly for Cheryshev, who needed to shoot first-time but instead took a few touches, Gollini came out and the shot when it came hit the goalkeeper. And they have scored! Palomino totally fluffs an attempt to bring the ball out of defence, strolling forward and then passing it beyond De Roon to Cheryshev, whose low shot from 20 yards zips beyond Gollini! 65 mins: Valencia have brought Denis Cheryshev on for Guedes. Surely they now need to score tonight to have any chance, and probably more than once. 64 mins: The goal stands! Ilicic was offside, but presumably he didn\u2019t touch the ball as it rolled past him. 63 mins: VAR is checking that goal, presumably for a possible offside. And now it\u2019s four! Ilicic distracts two defenders just beyond the halfway line and a pass heading his way instead rolls through to Hateboer, who sprints infield from the right flank and blasts a low shot past Domenech! 61 mins: What a miss! What a potentially tie-transforming miss! Gollini\u2019s pass towards Gosens on the left is intercepted by Ferran Torres, who runs into the area and squares to an unmarked Maxi Gomez, 10 yards out and with the goal at his absolute mercy, whose first-time shot goes straight into the arms of Gollini! Easier to score, etc. It\u2019s a third for Atalanta! And it\u2019s an absolute cracker from Remo Freuler, who collects the ball beyond the left-hand corner of the area, cuts inside under little pressure and then curls a delicious shot from just beyond the 18-yard line that nestles inside the far post! 57 mins: In tonight\u2019s other Champions League game, RB Leipzig have just taken a 1-0 lead at Spurs, Werner scoring with a penalty. 55 mins: I am enjoying this game. Valencia find themselves in the delicious (for the neutral) position of being one goal away from a very decent away result, or a goal in the other net away from complete disaster, and it is a tightrope they are very much running up and down. Both sides are still pushing for goals. 52 mins: Now Valencia nearly score! Ferran Torres curls in a low cross from the right, and Soler meets it at the near post but pokes just wide! 50 mins: Nearly a third! Gomez is played into a huge amount of space on the left, and his cross flicks off Diakhaby\u2019s foot and loops across goal, dipping just beyond the far post with a couple of Atalanta players ready to turn it in had it just dropped a little sooner. 47 mins: Atalanta win a corner. It\u2019s headed out to Bapu Gomez, who shimmies a bit and lays off to Ilicic, whose cross looks dangerous, but is eventually cleared. 46 mins: Peeeeeep! They\u2019re off! Again! The players are back out. No sign of any substitutions. The teams have shared possession evenly, and Atalanta lead only 7-6 on shots, but Valencia are yet to have a shot on target, and have therefore not scored. They have had a couple of chances - Ferran Torres hit the bar, and someone could easily have turned Goncalo Guedes\u2019 cross-shot - but they haven\u2019t made them count. It\u2019s interesting that Eliaquim Mangala, the centre-back, was one of the players throwing himself at the Guedes shot, while Jose Luis Palomino, one of Atalanta\u2019s front three, was on the edge of the six-yard box when Hateboer scored the opening goal. These are, in short, two enterprising teams, and this tie is not over yet. 45+2 mins: It\u2019s all over, at least for now. Atalanta have only had three shots on target, but they\u2019ve certainly made them count (well, two of them). 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be a minute or so. 45 mins: Valencia push forwards, but their approach play is a little too intricate and eventually a pass hits a defender, and Atalanta can break. Atalanta double their lead! The ball is curled to Ilicic, 20 yards out and bang central, and he controls it, holds off Soler, touches it forwards and then hits a right-footed shot across goal and into the top corner! Domenech gets his fingers to it, but can\u2019t keep it out! 40 mins: Ilicic passes the ball through to Bapu Gomez, who sprints 40 yards into the penalty area, shoots over the bar, and is then, quite a lot of effort later, given offside. 37 mins: Now Atalanta have a shot, a tackle sending the ball rolling to De Roon, whose half-volley sends the ball dipping over the bar. 36 mins: Close! The ball is chipped over the defence for Guedes, who runs into the left-hand side of the penalty are and then slams in a vicious low cross-shot that is wide of the far post, but not wide enough that either of his teammates can get a foot to it as they slide in. 35 mins: Atalanta seem strangely shot-shy. They have another decent attack, but nobody\u2019s willing to take a shot and eventually Hateboer crosses badly. 33 mins: This is so far a reasonable game between well-matched teams who have no inclination of overcommitting at this stage of proceedings. 30 mins: Valencia hit the woodwork! Ferran Torres is released by a quick free-kick, and from an acute angle he slams a shot past Gollini and against the meat of the bar! 28 mins: Atalanta get into a good position, but Ilicic makes another poor decision, choosing not to shoot or pass with his left foot but to cut outside and head for the line. His pull-back doesn\u2019t lead to anything very much. 24 mins: What with Atalanta being the top goalscorers in Italy for a second successive year, this really isn\u2019t the ideal game to be missing both your first-choice centre-backs. Valencia are seeing quite a lot of the ball, but look creakier in defence than they seem threatening in attack. 21 mins: Atalanta threaten again, but Ilicic refuses to shoot when well placed and Gosens then does shoot when poorly placed. Goal kick. 19 mins: Guedes dives in front of Marten de Roon and the linesman buys it, giving Valencia a free-kick from the right flank. Maxi Gomez wins the header, but his effort hits a teammate. The home side take the lead! Bapu Gomez approaches the penalty are from the left, Ferran Torres backing away and pretty much letting him do as he wants, his cross takes a slight deflection, and Hans Hateboer gets in front of Jose Gaya to prod in from four yards! 14 mins: Maxi Gomez is cynically brought down by Palomino, wide on the right. Michael Oliver\u2019s cards remain in his pocket for now. 12 mins: Valencia are doing a bit of gentle probing, though the Atalanta rearguard are keeping things under control for now. 8 mins: Incredible miss! Ilicic passes through to Pasalic, Valencia\u2019s defence melts away into nothingness, and from the penalty spot he sidefoots a shot that Domenech anticipates and touches over the bar! 7 mins: Toloi boots a bouncing ball into Guedes, and it flicks off his shin flush into his face. That does look painful, to be fair, and Guedes is evidently pained. 5 mins: Papu Gomez has the shot, but blasts the ball over the bar. 4 mins: Parejo brings down Gomez right on the edge of the penalty area, and the first shot of the night will surely follow from the free kick. 3 mins: There has already been one team change: Mattia Caldara is in the starting XI for Atalanta, replacing Berat Djimsiti, who was injured in the warm-up. 1 min: Peeeeeep! Valencia, in white shirts and the orangest shorts, get the game under way. They are out, have shaken all the hands and tossed all the coins. The players are in the tunnel! Football incoming! I\u2019m all for a bit of security, but it seems extraordinarily mean to hide the Valencia fans up there. England\u2019s very own Michael Oliver will be wielding the whistle this evening, and by the looks of things is quite happy about it: Valencia make just the one change to the team that drew 2-2 against Atletico Madrid on Friday: Gabriel Paulista drops out of the squad entirely, suspended for headbutting Ajax\u2019s Dusan Tadic back in the group stage, and Mouctar Diakhaby comes into the defence. No Luis Muriel in Atalanta\u2019s starting line-up, which is perhaps not a great surprise as he\u2019s been a substitute more often than not this season, but Duvan Zapata has almost always started when fit. Gasperini did talk at his press conference yesterday about life without him: With Zapata, we had some great results last year. This year we missed him for a long time and we found alternatives. Sometimes we used Luis Muriel, sometimes we didn\u2019t field a specialised striker. This has enriched us, giving us alternatives. We have always been prolific in the penalty area and this is an asset that we can use in upcoming game. The team sheets are in, and the names upon them are these: Atalanta: Golloni, Toloi, Palomino, Djimsiti; Hateboer, De Roon, Freuler, Gosens; Pasalic; Ilicic, Gomez. Subs: Sportiello, Caldara, Tameze, Muriel, Malinovskyi, Castagne, Zapata. Valencia: Domenech; Wass, Mangala, Diakhaby, Gaya; Ferran Torres, Parejo, Kondogbia, Soler; Goncalo Guedes, Maxi Gomez. Subs: Cillessen, Correia, Costa, Gameiro, Cheryshev, Sobrino, Gutierrez. Referee: Michael Oliver (England). Atalanta, eh? In the Champions League knock-out rounds, of all places. Who\u2019d have thought it? It\u2019s a throwback to the days when the likes of Videoton, Mechelen and Carl Zeiss Jena could get into European finals, days when fans of almost any club, almost any where, could dream of their team one day being Pretty Good Actually. Not like now, when everything\u2019s been ruined by [insert gripe of choice here]. And this might not be the last of it. Atalanta are not only in the Champions League places again this year, they\u2019re the top-scoring side in Serie A by a standard country mile, and in Josip Ilicic and Luis Muriel they have the division\u2019s fourth and sixth highest scorers. In the last couple of months there have been two 5-0 wins and a 7-0 away victory at Torino, and a total between them and their opponents of 35 goals in nine games at nearly four goals per match. Between them and Valencia there has been a total of one goalless draw all season. In short, a jolly good time is guaranteed for all. Well, not exactly guaranteed, but likely. Probable, let\u2019s go with probable. People are already having a good time. Look, here\u2019s proof: So, to summarise, welcome! We\u2019re amount to have a tremendous amount of fun. Now, here\u2019s some pre-match reading:",

Some half-decent weather and a good win this weekend could swiftly change all that but with Eddie Jones going through one of his periodic stand\u2011offs with the media and yet more rain pouring down it would be inaccurate to describe Bagshot as fun central.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/bono-andy-farrell-ireland-the-edge-england-six-nations\">Bono drops in to help give Andy Farrell's Ireland the edge against England</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the great scheme of things that should not matter but, at a time when the Rugby Football Union could use some sweetness and light to distract from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/championship-clubs-rfu-brutal-slash-funding\">Championship-funding saga</a>, there is little of it sloshing . Courtesy costs nothing and, following his trash-talking before the France and Scotland games, Jones\u2019s curt attitude towards broadcasters posing even straightforward questions is not a great look.</p> \n<p>Unlike in boxing, the Six Nations has no need of motormouth head coaches to help sell tickets but perceptions matter and the goodwill generated during the World Cup in Japan is in danger of evaporating. While that may also be deliberate \u2013 Jones delights in doing the opposite of what many people might prefer \u2013 it makes victory on Sunday increasingly important if this particular England campaign is to end positively.</p> \n<p>On that front it helps that the previously injured Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade are back among the 27 familiar names retained ahead of the team announcement on Friday but, following a disappointing display in Paris and a narrow, weather-battered success in Edinburgh, Jones will be looking for something whizzier against Andy Farrell\u2019s Ireland.</p> \n<p>One of the main features of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/ireland-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">last year\u2019s 32-20 triumph in Dublin</a>, as well as their World Cup semi-final crushing of New Zealand, was the spectacular start England made, and the tone of the entire Irish contest could well be set in the opening quarter. Jones, stretching for the right analogy, compared it to a Formula One grid. \u201cIt\u2019s like F1. Get out of the blocks quickly. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to want to do the same thing. We\u2019ll see who can get out of the blocks the quickest.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Given that five locks have been retained in his 27-man squad, including Bath\u2019s Charlie Ewels, it is equally possible Jones wants to repeat his 6:2 bench split and rely less on speed than power to achieve the desired outcome. When asked if there was an element of injury cover involved, an RFU spokesman would only volunteer the term \u201cgeneral niggles\u201d. Could that be what Jones really meant when he described Scotland as \u201cniggly\u201d a fortnight ago?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/17/england-supporters-urged-to-take-stand-against-championship-cuts\">England supporters urged to take stand against Championship cuts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What no one disputes is Jones\u2019s belief that breakdown excellence will be crucial against the Irish and, in addition to Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, there is a decent case for the Saracens flanker Ben Earl retaining a place in the 23.</p> \n<p>It will also be interesting to see if Luke Cowan-Dickie is finally handed a Six Nations start following a rollercoaster month. His new son, born seven weeks prematurely, is still being cared for in hospital but the Exeter hooker is in regular contact with his partner and says his rugby remains unaffected. \u201cI know he is in safe hands and it is the best place for him.

      "bodyText": "In contrast to Ireland, with their unchanged team and more relaxed managerial regime, things are less serene in the England camp. Some half-decent weather and a good win this weekend could swiftly change all that but with Eddie Jones going through one of his periodic stand\u2011offs with the media and yet more rain pouring down it would be inaccurate to describe Bagshot as fun central. In the great scheme of things that should not matter but, at a time when the Rugby Football Union could use some sweetness and light to distract from the Championship-funding saga, there is little of it sloshing . Courtesy costs nothing and, following his trash-talking before the France and Scotland games, Jones\u2019s curt attitude towards broadcasters posing even straightforward questions is not a great look. Unlike in boxing, the Six Nations has no need of motormouth head coaches to help sell tickets but perceptions matter and the goodwill generated during the World Cup in Japan is in danger of evaporating. While that may also be deliberate \u2013 Jones delights in doing the opposite of what many people might prefer \u2013 it makes victory on Sunday increasingly important if this particular England campaign is to end positively. On that front it helps that the previously injured Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade are back among the 27 familiar names retained ahead of the team announcement on Friday but, following a disappointing display in Paris and a narrow, weather-battered success in Edinburgh, Jones will be looking for something whizzier against Andy Farrell\u2019s Ireland. One of the main features of last year\u2019s 32-20 triumph in Dublin, as well as their World Cup semi-final crushing of New Zealand, was the spectacular start England made, and the tone of the entire Irish contest could well be set in the opening quarter. Jones, stretching for the right analogy, compared it to a Formula One grid. \u201cIt\u2019s like F1. Get out of the blocks quickly. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to want to do the same thing. We\u2019ll see who can get out of the blocks the quickest.\u201d Given that five locks have been retained in his 27-man squad, including Bath\u2019s Charlie Ewels, it is equally possible Jones wants to repeat his 6:2 bench split and rely less on speed than power to achieve the desired outcome. When asked if there was an element of injury cover involved, an RFU spokesman would only volunteer the term \u201cgeneral niggles\u201d. Could that be what Jones really meant when he described Scotland as \u201cniggly\u201d a fortnight ago? What no one disputes is Jones\u2019s belief that breakdown excellence will be crucial against the Irish and, in addition to Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, there is a decent case for the Saracens flanker Ben Earl retaining a place in the 23. It will also be interesting to see if Luke Cowan-Dickie is finally handed a Six Nations start following a rollercoaster month. His new son, born seven weeks prematurely, is still being cared for in hospital but the Exeter hooker is in regular contact with his partner and says his rugby remains unaffected. \u201cI know he is in safe hands and it is the best place for him. It is on my mind [but] I speak to [my partner] quite a bit about how he is getting on and about how she is getting on.\u201d Cowan-Dickie has been the form hooker in the Premiership this year but has started on the bench for 19 or his 22 Tests, the exceptions being the World Cup pool game against the USA and two warm-up Tests against Wales last summer. \u201cFor everyone it is your goal to start a Test match,\u201d the 26-year-old Cornishman said. \u201cIf I start, then absolutely brilliant, I have always wanted to. If I am on the bench, I know what my role will be.\u201d Jones, for his part, was similarly diplomatic on the subject of Johnny Sexton \u2013 \u201cwe can\u2019t control how he speaks to the referee\u201d \u2013 and has also dismissed the suggestion that a more attacking mindset might benefit England on Sunday. \u201cThe only thing you\u2019ve got to do in the Six Nations is win \u2026 that\u2019s the only thing that counts,\u201d the head coach said.

Their next game is Liverpool away on Monday; City go to Leicester on Saturday.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4da6638f0811db2fafac70\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T21:19:34.266Z\">9.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90+1 min</strong> Four minutes of added time.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T21:19:47.955Z\">at 9.19pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4da5768f0811db2fafac68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T21:15:49.942Z\">9.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>89 min </strong>Tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4da5028f086a28115aed5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T21:14:35.617Z\">9.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>87 min </strong>Declan Rice has quietly had an excellent game for West Ham.

We\u2019re all friends here, most of us anyway, so let us speak frankly: there will be more attention on Pep Guardiola\u2019s pre- and post-match interview than the actual football. The match is largely meaningless to City, who are going to finish second or third this season regardless. West Ham need every point they can get, though, and a draw tonight would move them out of the relegation zone.</p> <p>It\u2019ll be interesting to see what mood City are in. There\u2019s a fair chance they will take our their FFP frustrations on West Ham, and maybe even exceed the 5-0 victory at the London Stadium on the opening weekend of the season. But they could also be subdued and lacking in motivation, in which case West Ham might nick something. We\u2019ll soon find out.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 7.30pm GMT.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-19T17:41:10.188Z\">at 5.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s blog. Thanks for your company - goodnight! Pep has been chatting about City\u2019s European ban on Sky Sports. The club believes [the ban] is unfair so we will appeal, and we are going to wait. All we can do is focus on what we do on the pitch. I trust my club 100 per cent, because they explained what happened, so now we are going to wait. We are optimistic that the truth will prevail. If they don\u2019t sack me, I will stay here, 100 per cent. I want to stay here, more than ever. I said before, I say now, and I will say it until the end of my contract: I want to stay, I want to help the club maintain this level as long as possible. Why should I leave? I love this club. Whatever happens, I will be here next season. Kevin De Bruyne is chatting on Sky about the European ban \u201cWe were on holiday when the Uefa statement was released. We came back and trained like normal and nothing really changed. It is what it is. I don\u2019t know, as players, what else we can do \u2013 we just play football. The club is doing its thing and we trust them. It\u2019s a legal issue so we can\u2019t really say anything.\u201d Peep peep! An easy victory for City, who cruised in second gear all night. Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne \u2013 whose imagination and skill made an otherwise pointless match worthwhile \u2013 scored the goals. West Ham were content to leave town without significant damage to their goal difference. Their next game is Liverpool away on Monday; City go to Leicester on Saturday. 90+1 min Four minutes of added time. 89 min Tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka. 87 min Declan Rice has quietly had an excellent game for West Ham. It\u2019s the best I\u2019ve seen him play, in fact. 85 min David Silva limps off with what looks like a hamstring problem. Phil Foden replaces him. He seems quite relaxed, so I think it\u2019s a precaution as much as anything. 84 min Noble shoots high and wide from 30 yards. 82 min West Ham look like a team with goal difference in mind. They aren\u2019t taking any risks to try to get back in the match. 80 min Jarrod Bowen comes on for his West Ham debut, with Robert Snodgrass doing one. 79 min The utterly magnificent Kevin De Bruyne - who made one, scored one and made an otherwise boring match worthwhile - is replaced by Ilkay Gundogan. 77 min De Bruyne flicks another unreal pass over the West Ham defence for Jesus, whose close-range shot is blocked by Fabianski. He could have had a hat-trick tonight. De Bruyne\u2019s pass took seven West Ham players out of the game. West Ham counter-attack through Antonio, who is dispossessed just outside the City area by... De Bruyne. 76 min Kevin De Bruyne, though. There\u2019s never been a player quite like him. 74 min This match was over before it started. Antonio has a rare West Ham shot, blasting high and wide from the edge of the area. 70 min Aguero controls Walker\u2019s low cross on the six-yard line, turns and hits a shot that is blocked by Ogbonna. 67 min \u201cZabaleta must be wondering which side he is playing for,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cA team put together and housed at great expense and now in danger of a freefall from grace or ANY OTHER FOOTBALL CLUB!\u201d 65 min John Stones replaces Aymeric Laporte. De Bruyne played a good return pass to Bernardo Silva in the area and kept running. Bernardo twisted back outside Cresswell, at which point De Bruyne called shotgun and slid the loose ball past Fabianski at the near post. That\u2019ll do. 61 min Bernardo Silva cuts inside from the right and curls a lovely shot that goes just wide of the far post. 60 min Fredericks is able to walk off, in fact, but he looks very groggy and one of the physios is holding his arm to his chest. Zabaleta comes on to a lovely ovation from the home fans. 59 min Fredericks is being moved very slowly onto a stretcher. David Moyes takes the opportunity to give Robert Snodgrass some tactical instructions. 57 min Fredericks falls awkwardly after a sly foul from Rodri, damaging his shoulder in the process. He is going to be replaced by City legend Pablo Zabaleta. 56 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cThis afternoon, I saw the five films nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short (Live Action). The best of them started with a five-minute discussion about the relative merits of Lionel Messi and Riyad Mahrez - which wasn\u2019t what I was expecting. PS The Greavsie film is better than the Maradona one.\u201d 54 min Aguero almost makes it 2-0 on the break. He ran around the defence, as he has done so often down the years, and drove the ball wide of the far post from a tight angle. 53 min Rice, who has had a brilliant start to the second half, intercepts De Bruyne\u2019s pass and waves an outside-of-the-foot through pass towards Antonio. Otamendi gets there first to slide the ball out for a throw-in. 50 min A poor ball from Rodri is intercepted by Rice, who runs 60 yards down the right before curling a dangerous cross that is half cleared by Otamendi. Eventually Antonio is penalised for handball, though the chance had gone anyway. 47 min De Bruyne plays an outrageously good pass to Walker, whose low cross is kicked away at the near post by Fabianski. 46 min Peep peep! West Ham begin the second half. Half-time reading Peep peep! A subdued Manchester City lead through Rodri\u2019s header. It was a boring half, in truth, with City totally dominant even though they were nowhere near their exhilarating best. See you in 15 minutes for the second half. 45 min Masuaku is booked for fouling De Bruyne just outside the area on the right. 44 min Aguero has a shot on the turn blocked by Ogbonna. That was City\u2019s 13th attempt on goal to West Ham\u2019s one. 43 min West Ham\u2019s best attack of the half. Antonio moved out to the right to receive a pass from Rice, looked up and whacked a superb curling cross that flashed across the face of goal. 40 min Meanwhile, a new angle shows that Laporte didn\u2019t touch that ball over the line, so it was definitely Rodri\u2019s goal. 39 min Bernardo Silva cuts inside and crosses towards the near post, where David Silva stabs wide on the stretch. I think Fabianski blocked it, on reflection, but a goalkick was given. 38 min This match is absurdly one-sided, and that\u2019s with City nowhere near their best. 36 min It looks like the goal has been given to Rodri. Strange, as I\u2019m pretty sure Laporte Craigjohnstoned it on the line, but no matter. 34 min \u201cDid the City fans not voice their support for their downtrodden brothers,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cOr perhaps a plaintive rendition by older supporters of \u2018Hello darkness my old friend\u2019.\u201d All that pretty passing, and City take the lead with a simple corner. De Bruyne clipped it to the near post, where the unmarked Rodri leapt to flick the ball across goal and into the net. West Ham had nobody on the far post. The ball was going in anyway but Laporte made sure, and I suspect it will eventually go down as his goal. 29 min Mendy\u2019s mishit cross is punched behind at the near post by Fabianski. City are nowhere near their best. They\u2019ll still win 5-0, probably, but it\u2019s been a subdued performance so far. 26 min City have had 77 per cent of the possession. 25 min I think 3-5-1-1 was a generous interpretation of West Ham\u2019s formation. It\u2019s 5-4-1, basically, and it is working pretty well. 22 min Nothing comes of that West Ham corner. Meanwhile, replays show that a) Aguero was almost certainly onside and b) Ogbonna fouled him, and felt him up for that matter, so it should have been a penalty to City. 21 min West Ham break forward in numbers for the first time in the match, and Fredericks wins a corner. 20 min City appeal for a penalty when Aguero appears to be pulled back in the area. I think the flag had already gone up for offside, and there\u2019s no sign of VAR getting involved. 18 min City haven\u2019t been at their best, even though they should be 2-0 up. Their passing has been slow by their standards. 15 min \u201cWest Ham\u2019s \u2018dignity\u2019, Rob?\u201d sniffs Matt Dony. \u201cJazz-mag funding, least practical place to play football since 1914 (but with none of the heartwarming humanity), a consistently hilarious player recruitment policy, banning a fan for wearing a t-shirt they didn\u2019t like, and Karren Brady. Bit late with that stable door, there.\u201d 14 min: Jesus misses another great chance! He was put through by De Bruyne but faffed unnecessarily, 10 yards from goal, and that allowed Cresswell to come from behind to make two vital blocks. West Ham thought Jesus was offside; he wasn\u2019t. 13 min De Bruyne rifles a low, long-range strike that is kicked away by Fabianski. He was going the wrong way, so it may have taken a deflection. 11 min West Ham cross the halfway line. 8 min De Bruyne eases a pass into Aguero in the D. He controls the ball and then, out of nothing, flicks an imaginative effort with the outside of the foot that goes just wide. 6 min Jesus misses an excellent chance. He was put through on goal by a beautiful pass from David Silva and decided to go round Fabianski rather than shoot. That allowed Fredericks to nip in and poke the ball behind for a corner. 3 min City have made a dominant start, as you\u2019d expect. 2 min \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cAs a sympathetic, entirely neutral, Watford-born observer, I sincerely hope West Ham\u2019s goal difference doesn\u2019t take an absolute shoeing this evening.\u201d 1 min Peep peep! City kick off from left to right. There are a surprising number of empty seats at the Etihad. Pre-match music It\u2019s almost time for action. I fear for West Ham\u2019s dignity tonight, not to mention their goal difference. Pep Guardiola speaks \u201cAfter the game, we can talk about whatever you want\u2026 There was an impact on the players [when the ban was announced], but only for a few hours. We support the club 100 per cent. [Has it been harder to lift the players?] The players are exceptional professionals.\u201d He\u2019s in no mood. Alternative association football action Pre-match reading Manchester City (4-3-3) Ederson; Walker, Otamendi, Laporte, Mendy; De Bruyne, Rodri, D Silva; B Silva, Aguero, Jesus. Substitutes: Bravo, Stones, Cancelo, Gundogan, Fernandinho, Mahrez, Foden. West Ham (3-5-1-1) Fabianski; Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell; Fredericks, Noble, Rice, Soucek, Masuaku; Snodgrass; Antonio. Substitutes: Randolph, Balbuena, Zabaleta, Felipe Anderson, Lanzini, Bowen, Haller. Referee Kevin Friend Hello and welcome to live coverage of the rearranged Premier League match between Manchester City and West Ham United. We\u2019re all friends here, most of us anyway, so let us speak frankly: there will be more attention on Pep Guardiola\u2019s pre- and post-match interview than the actual football. The match is largely meaningless to City, who are going to finish second or third this season regardless. West Ham need every point they can get, though, and a draw tonight would move them out of the relegation zone. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what mood City are in. There\u2019s a fair chance they will take our their FFP frustrations on West Ham, and maybe even exceed the 5-0 victory at the London Stadium on the opening weekend of the season. But they could also be subdued and lacking in motivation, in which case West Ham might nick something. We\u2019ll soon find out. Kick off is at 7.30pm GMT.",

He was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/politics/cnn-poll-biden-lead-increases/index.html\">ahead in the polls</a>. And despite allegations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/03/joe-biden-women-personal-space-new-allegations\">unwanted touching</a>, and repeated calls for him to apologize over his intrusive questioning of Anita Hill in the 90s, he still had strong <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/19/biden-holds-lead-over-warren-sanders-buttigieg-in-2020-race-nbc-wsj-poll.html\">support among</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/19/biden-holds-lead-over-warren-sanders-buttigieg-in-2020-race-nbc-wsj-poll.html\"> women</a>.</p> <p>And then this happened. In response to a question about domestic violence, Biden highlighted an interesting tactic: domestic violence should be punched.

They want to be reread Haley\u2019s testimony relating to when she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Weinstein in July 2006 as well as a second encounter in which she had sex with him in a Beverly Hills hotel about two weeks later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/feb/19/should-the-harvey-weinstein-jury-really-be-forbidden-to-review-books\">Should the Harvey Weinstein jury really be forbidden to review books?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The jurors also asked to see all emails between Weinstein and Haley, and between Weinstein and any third party relating to Haley.</p> <p>The requests appear to go to the heart of the most fraught element of the Weinstein prosecution in which he faces possible life imprisonment on five counts of rape, forced oral sex and predatory sexual assault. In an exceptionally rare move, the New York district attorney\u2019s office decided to press ahead to trial with two main accusers \u2013 one of whom is Haley \u2013 who kept in touch with their alleged attacker even after they claim they were sexually assaulted by him.</p> <p>That aspect of the case has been heavily emphasized by Weinstein\u2019s defense lawyers. In cross-examination, Haley admitted she had accepted plane tickets to Los Angeles and London paid for by Weinstein shortly after the alleged sex attack, and that she kept in touch with him professionally via email.</p> <p>\u201cYou wanted a connection with Mr Weinstein to help your career,\u201d Damon Cheronis, a lawyer on the defense team, asked her on the witness stand.</p> <p>In her testimony, Haley said that she had been lured to Weinstein\u2019s apartment on 10 July 2006. There he turned on her, pushed her on to his bed and forced her to have oral sex.</p> <p>When she protested that she was on her period, he allegedly yanked out her tampon and carried on. \u201cI was just crying, \u2018No.\u2019 I kept trying to tell him, \u2018No, don\u2019t go there.\u2019 I was in such shock that I just checked out,\u201d she told the court.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d28059b9dc4011669794085f9d913c8a0fc5aa7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d28059b9dc4011669794085f9d913c8a0fc5aa7/0_0_4070_2492/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In a courtroom sketch, the jury in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape trial listens to Miriam Haley\u2019s testimony in New York, New York, on 19 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"612\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In a courtroom sketch, the jury in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape trial listens to Miriam Haley\u2019s testimony in New York, New York, on 19 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elizabeth Williams/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The jury has asked to have that part of her testimony reread to them. They also want to hear again the section of the court transcript in which she described agreeing to meet Weinstein again just two weeks later on 26 July 2006 in the Tribeca Grand hotel in Beverly Hills.</p> <p>Asked why she would have accepted an invitation to meet her alleged attacker so soon after a violent and degrading experience, she said: \u201cI feel like I was trying to regain some sort of power or something.\u201d</p> <p>In tune with their general strategy, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers have made much of the second sexual encounter, which is not included in the charges. In cross-examination and in closing arguments they have argued it proves that Haley was in a consensual sexual relationship with the defendant and that she lied about him forcing oral sex on to her in the earlier incident.</p> <p>In fact, Haley\u2019s testimony about the Tribeca Grand incident is far more ambiguous than that. \u201cI just laid there. He had intercourse with me. I was laying there motionless, I felt like an idiot and I felt numb,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Her testimony described a sexual event that was not so much consensual but one in which she failed to resist.

      "bodyText": "The jury at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape trial in New York is wrestling with one of the most fiercely contested aspects of the case \u2013 the contact the disgraced movie mogul maintained with his accusers even after he allegedly sexually assaulted them. As the jury entered the second day of their deliberations at the New York supreme court in Manhattan on Wednesday, the five women and seven men sent a note to the judge asking to see key evidence relating to Miriam Haley, a former Project Runway assistant producer. They want to be reread Haley\u2019s testimony relating to when she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Weinstein in July 2006 as well as a second encounter in which she had sex with him in a Beverly Hills hotel about two weeks later. The jurors also asked to see all emails between Weinstein and Haley, and between Weinstein and any third party relating to Haley. The requests appear to go to the heart of the most fraught element of the Weinstein prosecution in which he faces possible life imprisonment on five counts of rape, forced oral sex and predatory sexual assault. In an exceptionally rare move, the New York district attorney\u2019s office decided to press ahead to trial with two main accusers \u2013 one of whom is Haley \u2013 who kept in touch with their alleged attacker even after they claim they were sexually assaulted by him. That aspect of the case has been heavily emphasized by Weinstein\u2019s defense lawyers. In cross-examination, Haley admitted she had accepted plane tickets to Los Angeles and London paid for by Weinstein shortly after the alleged sex attack, and that she kept in touch with him professionally via email. \u201cYou wanted a connection with Mr Weinstein to help your career,\u201d Damon Cheronis, a lawyer on the defense team, asked her on the witness stand. In her testimony, Haley said that she had been lured to Weinstein\u2019s apartment on 10 July 2006. There he turned on her, pushed her on to his bed and forced her to have oral sex. When she protested that she was on her period, he allegedly yanked out her tampon and carried on. \u201cI was just crying, \u2018No.\u2019 I kept trying to tell him, \u2018No, don\u2019t go there.\u2019 I was in such shock that I just checked out,\u201d she told the court. The jury has asked to have that part of her testimony reread to them. They also want to hear again the section of the court transcript in which she described agreeing to meet Weinstein again just two weeks later on 26 July 2006 in the Tribeca Grand hotel in Beverly Hills. Asked why she would have accepted an invitation to meet her alleged attacker so soon after a violent and degrading experience, she said: \u201cI feel like I was trying to regain some sort of power or something.\u201d In tune with their general strategy, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers have made much of the second sexual encounter, which is not included in the charges. In cross-examination and in closing arguments they have argued it proves that Haley was in a consensual sexual relationship with the defendant and that she lied about him forcing oral sex on to her in the earlier incident. In fact, Haley\u2019s testimony about the Tribeca Grand incident is far more ambiguous than that. \u201cI just laid there. He had intercourse with me. I was laying there motionless, I felt like an idiot and I felt numb,\u201d she said. Her testimony described a sexual event that was not so much consensual but one in which she failed to resist. Asked whether Weinstein had forced himself on her at the Tribeca Grand, she replied: \u201cI didn\u2019t physically resist but I felt that, yeah.\u201d The jury is now grappling with what to make of all these interactions. The eventual interpretation they reach could have immense consequences, resulting in a possible acquittal on a couple of the five counts facing Weinstein or alternatively conviction of a criminal sex act that carries a minimum sentence of five years in prison. By Wednesday afternoon the jury appeared to have moved on from Haley to consider the evidence relating to Sciorra. They sent a fresh request to the judge asking to reread the testimony of the actor Rosie Perez who said she had been told by her friend Sciorra that she had been raped. The jury also wanted to see all emails and digital communication between Weinstein and his friend Paul Feldsher, who was called by the defense to give evidence. Feldsher testified that Sciorra had told him she had done a \u201ccrazy thing with Harvey\u201d \u2013 implying that their sexual encounter was consensual and not rape. But Feldsher\u2019s testimony backfired on Weinstein when the witness was forced under cross-examination to admit that he had called the defendant a \u201csex addict\u201d. As an additional request, the jury asked to see all emails between Weinstein and Black Cube, the detective firm of former Israeli intelligence agents employed by the defendant to investigate Sciorra before she went public with her allegations.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 20 February. Top stories Donald Trump offered Julian Assange a pardon if he denied Russian involvement in the leaking of Democratic party emails, a court in London has heard. The 2016 leaks, published by Wikileaks, were highly embarrassing to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, and in 2018 a dozen Russian intelligence officers were charged for email hacking. Assange\u2019s lawyer claimed in a statement that in 2017 former US Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher visited Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy offering a pardon deal if the Wikileaks founder \u201csaid Russia had nothing to do with the DNC leaks\u201d. Assange is battling to prevent extradition to the US where he faces 18 charges over the publication of US military information, carrying a term of 175 years. During the recent bushfire crisis Australians breathed air pollution at levels up to 26 times above that which is considered hazardous. In the latest episode of Guardian Australia\u2019s series, The Frontline, experts admit the long-term health impacts are not necessarily known. \u201cWe\u2019re all currently living in a big experiment,\u201d said associate professor Donna Green. \u201cWe know it will be bad, we just don\u2019t know how bad.\u201d Hannah Baxter, the 31-year-old woman involved in an \u201chorrific\u201d car fire in Brisbane, has died, succumbing to injuries sustained in the fire that claimed her three children and husband. Baxter died at the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s Hospital early on Wednesday evening. Her husband Rowan Baxter died alongside their children Laianah, Aaliyah and Trey on a suburban street in Brisbane\u2019s east on Wednesday morning. Another man who tried to help at the scene was also taken to hospital with facial burns. Australia Tony Abbott was asked to consider registering as an agent of foreign influence, after he spoke at a conference organised by the Hungarian government in praise of the country\u2019s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The registry is run by the attorney general\u2019s office to trace foreign influence on Australian politics, with Abbott\u2019s address at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an event affiliated with US conservative politics, also potentially requiring the former prime minister to register. Liberal MP Lucy Wicks has denied a conflict of interests, after the leader of a wealthy Pentecostal church who had described her as a \u201cdear friend\u201d was awarded a $8,580 grant to soundproof its auditorium under the Stronger Communities scheme. Child protection advocates have condemned Andrew Bolt\u2019s use of the phrase \u201chit on\u201d to describe the sexual grooming of a year 9 school boy by his athletics coach, saying the language was inappropriate and minimised the seriousness of the offence. Software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie have promised up to $12m to install solar and battery systems in communities disconnected from the electricity grid by bushfire or flood. The world Iran has announced the death of two citizens from the coronavirus, while a leading economic forecaster has predicted the disease could cost the global economy more than $1tn in lost output if it turns into a pandemic. Bernie Sanders has firmed strongly as the Democratic frontrunner in national opinion polls, with the Vermont senator soaring to 32% as Joe Biden tanked to 17%. Late runner Mike Bloomberg rose 6% to third with 14% ahead of Elizabeth Warren, who remained unchanged on 11% support. Brussels has dispelled the UK\u2019s hopes of a post-Brexit, Canada-style trade deal with the EU, with chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning that the UK\u2019s \u201cparticular proximity\u201d meant it could not hope for similar advantages as the North American nation. Lingerie giant Victoria\u2019s Secret has come under fire for excessive waste within the fashion industry, after hundreds of bras were found dumped in a bin, not far from one of its stores in Colorado.

Hidden from view, models are transformed from gawky 19-year-olds into the living embodiment of a luxury brand\u2019s vision via the judicious application of make-up and wigs.</p> <p>The Gucci show in Milan on Wednesday took an unexpected turn, then, by positioning its backstage area on a revolving curtained platform in the middle of the catwalk. Dry ice filled the room, the curtain raised and the key players were revealed: models in their white dressing gowns, make-up artists, hair stylists and dressers, brushing hair, applying lipstick, pulling up socks and arranging hat brims just so.

Something sacred, liturgical, almost like a religion.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/14/gucci-channels-the-inner-child-at-milan-mens-fashion-week\">Gucci channels the inner child at Milan men's fashion week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Michele has been an industry sensation since 2015, when he radically transformed Gucci, then a fading icon of glossy noughties glamour, into a purveyor of quirky, eccentric maximalist chic. His shows present a disparate cast of characters, who appear to have been beamed in from the world\u2019s most comprehensive and luxurious thrift shop. This season\u2019s stand-out looks included full-skirted, Tudor-style dresses styled with bondage harnesses and high-shine neck cuffs, and black velvet dresses with Puritan collars. There was a childlike air to some of the collection \u2013 socks pulled up to the knee, a buttercup yellow knee-length dress with a Peter Pan collar.</p> <p>Michele said he had been thinking about his childhood a lot, and collecting vintage children\u2019s clothing from the second world war, and from the 1970s, which he found inspiring \u201cin the perfection of its proportions and its freedom. Children don\u2019t have to justify what they do or what they wear.\u201d There were crucifixes too, which Michele said tied into the ritualistic nature of fashion and attending a fashion show, \u201ca symbol of belonging, of loyalty to something\u201d.</p> <p>In its celebration of difference and individuality the Michele era at Gucci aims to distill the aspirations for a certain type of open-minded, urban, millennial consumer, with whom it has had a large amount of success. Brand ambassadors include Harry Styles, who wore a Gucci suit with pearl necklace and, later, a Gucci lace jumpsuit to the Brit awards on Tuesday night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"200fa42ff7fd6a5cd3fdc6560342672c7ebbeac4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/200fa42ff7fd6a5cd3fdc6560342672c7ebbeac4/0_191_3712_2227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A runway model in a buttercup-yellow dress with Peter Pan collar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A runway model in a buttercup-yellow dress with Peter Pan collar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixelformula/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A number of incidents have undermined that inclusive vision, however, notably the backlash around a polo-neck jumper that looked offensively like blackface, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/07/gucci-withdraws-jumper-blackface-balaclava\">had to be removed from shops</a> last February. Afterwards the brand apologised and <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/gucci-diversity-inclusion-renee-tirado\">appointed a diversity chief</a>.</p> <p>Gucci accounts for 80% of parent company Kering\u2019s sales. Its sales are still rising \u2013 up by 10.7% to \u20ac2.37bn in the third quarter of 2019 \u2013 but no longer as meteorically as during Michele\u2019s first couple of years. It is also among the many luxury brands impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>The Kering CEO, Francois-Henri Pinault, recently warned investors to expect a dip: \u201cOur environment has changed significantly with the coronavirus outbreak.

      "bodyText": "The backstage area of a fashion show is where the magic happens. Hidden from view, models are transformed from gawky 19-year-olds into the living embodiment of a luxury brand\u2019s vision via the judicious application of make-up and wigs. The Gucci show in Milan on Wednesday took an unexpected turn, then, by positioning its backstage area on a revolving curtained platform in the middle of the catwalk. Dry ice filled the room, the curtain raised and the key players were revealed: models in their white dressing gowns, make-up artists, hair stylists and dressers, brushing hair, applying lipstick, pulling up socks and arranging hat brims just so. The soundtrack, Ravel\u2019s Bolero, lent a balletic air to the calm, methodical work. \u201cI wanted to show what happens on the other side,\u201d said creative director Alessandro Michele after his show. \u201cFashion is not only about garments, about clothing. That is only part of the story. I wanted to say that fashion is a complex mechanism. It is also a ritual. Something sacred, liturgical, almost like a religion.\u201d Michele has been an industry sensation since 2015, when he radically transformed Gucci, then a fading icon of glossy noughties glamour, into a purveyor of quirky, eccentric maximalist chic. His shows present a disparate cast of characters, who appear to have been beamed in from the world\u2019s most comprehensive and luxurious thrift shop. This season\u2019s stand-out looks included full-skirted, Tudor-style dresses styled with bondage harnesses and high-shine neck cuffs, and black velvet dresses with Puritan collars. There was a childlike air to some of the collection \u2013 socks pulled up to the knee, a buttercup yellow knee-length dress with a Peter Pan collar. Michele said he had been thinking about his childhood a lot, and collecting vintage children\u2019s clothing from the second world war, and from the 1970s, which he found inspiring \u201cin the perfection of its proportions and its freedom. Children don\u2019t have to justify what they do or what they wear.\u201d There were crucifixes too, which Michele said tied into the ritualistic nature of fashion and attending a fashion show, \u201ca symbol of belonging, of loyalty to something\u201d. In its celebration of difference and individuality the Michele era at Gucci aims to distill the aspirations for a certain type of open-minded, urban, millennial consumer, with whom it has had a large amount of success. Brand ambassadors include Harry Styles, who wore a Gucci suit with pearl necklace and, later, a Gucci lace jumpsuit to the Brit awards on Tuesday night. A number of incidents have undermined that inclusive vision, however, notably the backlash around a polo-neck jumper that looked offensively like blackface, and had to be removed from shops last February. Afterwards the brand apologised and appointed a diversity chief. Gucci accounts for 80% of parent company Kering\u2019s sales. Its sales are still rising \u2013 up by 10.7% to \u20ac2.37bn in the third quarter of 2019 \u2013 but no longer as meteorically as during Michele\u2019s first couple of years. It is also among the many luxury brands impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. The Kering CEO, Francois-Henri Pinault, recently warned investors to expect a dip: \u201cOur environment has changed significantly with the coronavirus outbreak. Due to the evolving nature of the situation, it is impossible at this time to fully evaluate the impact on business and how fast it will recover.\u201d",

Vu said he supported the strike, and criticised money being spent on renovations and \u201cutilities such as fancy catering and new buildings\u201d rather than investing in teaching and research. Not everyone who contacted the Guardian supported the strike, however. One lecturer in the politics department at the University of Edinburgh, calling it misguided. \u201cA very large proportion of my department is intending to strike but I feel strongly that I should not strike. Although I would certainly not mind being paid more, lecturers have comfortable salaries. \u201cAnd while I cannot speak to others\u2019 circumstances, my workload is not oppressive in the least \u2013 I used to work at a university in the States where demands were much greater. There are those of us staff who believe strongly that the rationale for the strike is misguided.\u201d Earlier this week, university employers said they had moved a long way to address staff concerns but union demands on pensions, pay and conditions were unaffordable and would put vulnerable institutions that were already in deficit at even greater risk. Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: \u201cVice-chancellors have had months to come up with serious offers to avoid widespread disruption on UK campuses. Their failings are clear for all to see today and the blame for the disruption caused by the strikes lays squarely at their door.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Inflation jumped to a six-month high of 1.8% in January after a surge in petrol prices and an increase in the cost of gas and electricity over last year. The surprise increase in the consumer prices index (CPI), which exceeded forecasts of a rise to 1.6%, brought the main measure of inflation closer to the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. The Office for National Statistics said an increase in fuel and energy costs forced up household heating bills and fed into the transport industry\u2019s overheads. Price increases also affected clothing, footwear and restaurants and hotels, while there was downward pressure from heavy discounting in furniture, household equipment, food and non-alcoholic drinks. Gas and electricity price increases in part reflected a comparison with January last year, when the government imposed a cap on energy companies, the ONS said. Petrol prices also compared unfavourably with January 2019, which was a period of falling costs on garage forecourts. The ONS said prices at the pump rose between December 2019 and January 2020 by 2.3 pence a litre but fell in the same period a year earlier. Prices for clothing overall fell by 3.3% between December 2019 and January 2020, compared with a fall of 4.6% in the same period a year earlier. The ONS said its preferred measure of inflation, CPIH, which includes housing costs, jumped from 1.4% in December to 1.8% in January. In December, inflation fell to 1.3%, its lowest level for more than three years, down from 1.5% in November. The Bank of England had been expected to cut interest rates last month in response to the fall in inflation and data that showed the economy stagnated in the last quarter of 2019. The monetary policy committee (MPC) decided to keep the base rate at 0.75%. A rebound this year in business confidence, an expected increase in government spending and the latest rise in consumer prices means the MPC is likely to keep the rate unchanged when it meets next month. The TUC said the jump in inflation to 1.8% would put a squeeze on living standards after regular wages growth fell for sixth months in a row until December. The growth in average weekly pay dropped to 3.2% in the three months to December, down from 3.4% in the same period to November. Growth in total wages \u2013 which includes one-off payments, fell to 2.9%, from 3.2% a month earlier. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cThe economy needs an urgent boost to bring back solid growth.\u201d The GMB union said a rise in the retail prices index, which the government uses to set annual train fare increases and the interest rate on student loan repayments, jumped from 2.2% to 2.7%, adding to the burden faced by workers who commute and young graduates. The consultancy Capital Economics said there were few price pressures in the economy and inflation was likely to remain subdued. \u201cFor the MPC, the fact that inflation is evolving in line with its projections provides another reason not to cut interest rates in the near term,\u201d it said. The new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: \u201cFamilies across the country are better off as a result of the strong wage growth and low inflation over the last 18 months.\u201d Janine Boshoff, an economist and forecaster at the National Institute for Economic and Social, said the December dip in inflation was always likely to be reversed in January. \u201cCPI is likely to remain volatile in the months ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cHigher prices in the housing and household services as well as transport categories were not fully offset by sales in the month of January.\u201d In line with most City economists, Boshoff said the January increase was unlikely to be the precursor to runaway price increases.",

She tried to report an incident in 1997 but she was disbelieved and felt let down by them.\u201d Parnham added that the woman suffers from nightmares, flashbacks, PTSD and anxiety and that coming forward after so many years had been \u201chell\u201d. The other victim also suffers from PTSD, depression and bulimia. The defendants are: Usman Ali, 34, from Huddersfield, who was jailed for eight years for two counts of rape. Banaras Hussain, 39, from Shipley, who was jailed for 9 and a half years for one count of rape. Abdul Majid, 36, from Huddersfield, who was jailed for 11 years for two counts of rape. Gul Riaz, 44, from Huddersfield, who was jailed for 15 years for two counts of rape and two counts of indecent assault. Two men \u2013 aged 36 and 30 \u2013 who cannot be named for legal reasons, were jailed for eight and four years respectively for one count of rape. A seventh defendant, a 37-year-old man who cannot be named, has been found guilty of one count of rape and will be sentenced on Thursday.",

For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1%.</p> <p>In a explanatory thread on Twitter, Kucharski said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s well established there are likely far more symptomatic cases in China than have been detected/confirmed. If we are calculating \u2018deaths/cases\u2019, and we underestimate number of cases, it will cause us to *overestimate* fatality risk.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, he said another factor might mean the current mortality rate of 2% is an underestimate. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the number of cases starts to slow down, fatalities will climb faster than cases (because they were infected when the epidemic was growing faster).</p> </blockquote> <p>He concludes by saying the two factors could cancel each other out and mean that current estimates for the mortality rate are actually accurate. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The widely quoted 2% fatality for China is calculated incorrectly, because it\u2019s based on data that is under-reported and doesn\u2019t account for delays. But, confusingly, these errors may actually cancel out, leading to an estimate that is right for the wrong reasons.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamJKucharski/status/1229708011519823873\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This effect means that as the number of cases starts to slow down, fatalities will climb faster than cases (because they were infected when the epidemic was growing faster).

for Research on Energy and Clean Air who covers air quality and energy trends in China, the analysis found levels of NO2 air pollution over China are down 36% on the same period last year.</p> <p>Over the same two-week period in 2019, China released around 400m tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2), meaning the measures introduced to control the virus could have cut global emissions by 100MtCO2 to date. </p>

      "bodyText": "Inspectors in protective suits have been going door to door in Wuhan in an effort to find every infected person, the Associated Press reports. Wednesday marked the final day of a campaign to root out anyone with symptoms whom authorities may have missed so far. \u201cThis must be taken seriously,\u201d said Wang Zhonglin, the city\u2019s new Communist party secretary, adding that if a single new case was found after Wednesday, the district\u2019s leaders would be held responsible. His remarks were published on Hubei\u2019s provincial website alongside a declaration that \u201cif the masses cannot mobilise, it\u2019s impossible to fight a people\u2019s war.\u201d Britons returning home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that has had more than 600 cases of coronavirus will be quarantined at the same NHS facility that housed people flown back to the UK from Wuhan. The Department of Health said: \u201cWe can confirm that an accommodation block on the Arrowe Park NHS site will be used to isolate those returning from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. They will be kept in this location for the 14-day quarantine period, with around-the-clock support from medical staff at all times.\u201d Officials stressed there was no risk to the public and that the hospital in Wirral would continue to run as normal. This comes after the Foreign Office told British passengers onboard the ship to stay put or risk not being allowed on an evacuation flight later this week. An FCO statement read: \u201cWe are planning an evacuation flight from Tokyo to the UK as soon as possible for Britons who are on the Diamond Princess. We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities. \u201cHowever there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight. We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight.\u201d Here is the full story: Two people who were diagnosed with coronavirus in Iran have died, a state-run news agency has reported. The IRNA news agency said the two victims were elderly Iranian citizens. IRNA quoted Alireza Vahabzadeh, a health ministry official, who said both victims were located in Qom, about 86 miles (140km) south of the capital, Tehran. Officials had confirmed the cases earlier on Wednesday. It\u2019s been a fast-paced day with a number of major coronavirus developments, so if you\u2019re looking to catch up, here\u2019s a quick summary of the latest stories: The Foreign Office has advised Britons to stay on the infected Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan - they may not be able to board the evacuation flight later this week if they disembark. Meanwhile, concerns continue to be raised over how the virus was able to spread so rapidly on the ship, with one expert describing infection control on board as \u201cchaotic\u201d. Another 79 passengers onboard were diagnosed with the infection - taking the total to 621. A British couple on the ship will not be able to join the evacuation flight as they have tested positive for the virus. China has expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters from the country over what Beijing deemed a racist headline in the paper. South Korea confirmed 20 new cases in the country, taking the total infected to 51. Iran confirmed its first two coronavirus cases. China is taking steps to stimulate production in manufacturing hubs by easing infection control measures. The final passengers disembarked from the MS Westerdam cruise ship in Cambodia, after all tested negative for the Covid-19 virus. Over 15,000 people have recovered from coronavirus, the latest figures show. In China, where the bulk of cases have been, there have been 2,009 deaths and 14,938 recoveries - out of a total of 74,185 cases. In some Chinese provinces the recovery rate has increased to 40%, although the rate for Hubei is still below 15% - possibly due to the extra strain on medical resources there, experts have suggested. In the UK, eight of the nine people diagnosed have made a full recovery. In Thailand, nearly half of the 35 cases in the country have recovered. Earlier this week the World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said it is estimated four out of five patients in mainland China have mild symptoms and are expected to recover. Al Jazeera has reported the case of Yangyang, a 28-year-old from Wuhan who has recovered from the disease. She said: I hope this trend offers people battling the disease across the country a beacon of hope and the courage to continue the fight. Once she has finished her 14-day quarantine she hopes to donate her blood plasma, with initial trials showing the blood plasma of recovered patients is beneficial to those still fighting the disease. The Swiss government has postponed an annual summit on patient safety due to the coronavirus outbreak. The Ministerial Summit on Patient Safety, due to be held in Montreux near Lake Geneva on 27 and 28 February, \u201chas been postponed because numerous participants must remain in their own countries to deal with the Covid-19 epidemic\u201d, it said in a statement. The summit will be rescheduled. The coronavirus fatality rate may change over the coming weeks as those who were infected at the start of the epidemic come to the end of their illness. Adam Kucharski, a mathematician and epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the potential under-reporting of cases in China, and the fact that fatalities will continue as the number of new cases slows down, meant the death rate could vary over time. The mortality rate for the new coronavirus is estimated to be around 2.5%. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1%. In a explanatory thread on Twitter, Kucharski said: It\u2019s well established there are likely far more symptomatic cases in China than have been detected/confirmed. If we are calculating \u2018deaths/cases\u2019, and we underestimate number of cases, it will cause us to *overestimate* fatality risk. However, he said another factor might mean the current mortality rate of 2% is an underestimate. As the number of cases starts to slow down, fatalities will climb faster than cases (because they were infected when the epidemic was growing faster). He concludes by saying the two factors could cancel each other out and mean that current estimates for the mortality rate are actually accurate. The widely quoted 2% fatality for China is calculated incorrectly, because it\u2019s based on data that is under-reported and doesn\u2019t account for delays. But, confusingly, these errors may actually cancel out, leading to an estimate that is right for the wrong reasons. Russia will continue to issue official, business, humanitarian and transit visas to Chinese nationals, the country\u2019s foreign ministry has said, clarifying the conditions of a sweeping entry ban for Chinese citizens announced yesterday. The ban comes into effect on Thursday at midnight Moscow time. It was imposed due to the worsening epidemiological situation in China, the office of the deputy prime minister, Tatyana Golikova, said in a statement. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry clarified that the ban is temporary and only applies to visitors with tourist, private, student and work visas. It said in a statement: We reiterate our willingness to continue close cooperation with China in order to efficiently eradicate this common threat. Russia has had three confirmed cases of the Covid-19 disease. These were two Chinese citizens in Russia who were treated and released, and a Russian national infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Russian authorities have taken significant steps to try to keep the virus from spreading, including keeping hundreds of people in hospital as a precaution and monitoring more than 14,000 people after they returned from China. Russia halted most air traffic to China, suspended all trains to China and North Korea, and temporarily stopped issuing work visas to Chinese citizens. Chinese students studying in Russia were told not to return until 1 March. This month Russia\u2019s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, said Russia might start deporting foreigners infected with the virus. The Covid-19 virus has now infected more than 75,000 people globally. Three more people in Singapore have tested positive for the virus, one of whom was first admitted to hospital as a Dengue patient. South Korea reported 20 new cases. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest figures reported by each government\u2019s health authority, as of Wednesday in Beijing: Mainland China: 2,004 deaths among 74,185 cases, mostly in Hubei province Hong Kong: 63 cases, two deaths Macau: 10 cases Japan: 693 cases, including 621 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, one death Singapore: 81 South Korea: 51 Thailand: 35 Malaysia: 22 Taiwan: 22 cases, one death Vietnam: 16 Germany: 16 United States: 15 cases; separately, one US citizen died in China Australia: 14 France: 12 cases, one death United Kingdom: 9 United Arab Emirates: 9 Canada: 8 Philippines: three cases, one death India: 3 Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Iran: 2 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Egypt: 1 There is no need for people to panic about the coronavirus, said Scotland\u2019s public health minister as he visited one of the country\u2019s two testing laboratories. Joe FitzPatrick said there was no current evidence to suggest it is necessary for people in Scotland to wear masks to protect against the Covid-19 virus. Screening laboratories in Glasgow and Edinburgh have tested 202 possible cases since testing began in Scotland on 10 February, with all proving negative. Combined with the previous tests at the Public Health England facility in Colindale, London, 290 tests from Scotland have been carried out since the outbreak began, with none coming back positive. FitzPatrick said although it is likely there will be a case of coronavirus in Scotland, the country is well prepared to deal with the situation. There is no need for people to be panicked. We are clear that this is a serious threat that we are taking seriously and we\u2019re preparing for worst case scenarios but right now the risk in Scotland, as in the rest of the UK, remains low so there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that people should be walking around Scotland wearing face masks at this time. He added: \u201cAlthough all Scottish tests have so far been negative, we are prepared for the high likelihood that we will also see a positive case. We have a proven track record of dealing with challenging health issues and have been preparing for this possibility since the beginning of the outbreak. The coronavirus outbreak has temporarily reduced China\u2019s CO2 emissions by a quarter, according to analysis by Carbon Brief. Electricity demand and industrial output remain far below usual levels after authorities introduced stringent measures to stop the spread of the disease. Daily data of coal use at power stations is at a four-year low, while oil refinery operating rates in Shandong province are at the lowest level since 2015, the report said. Carried out by Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air who covers air quality and energy trends in China, the analysis found levels of NO2 air pollution over China are down 36% on the same period last year. Over the same two-week period in 2019, China released around 400m tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2), meaning the measures introduced to control the virus could have cut global emissions by 100MtCO2 to date. However, the report notes that this is likely to only have a short-term impact and shutdowns of a week or more are not uncommon in China. Cutting energy consumption and emissions by 25% for two weeks would only reduce annual figures by around 1%, it states. However, reduced consumer demand \u2013 potentially caused by unpaid wages during the outbreak \u2013 could have a more significant long-term effect. For instance, car sales are set to fall by 25-30% in the January-February period, according to preliminary forecasts. In total, containment measures have resulted in reductions of 15% to 40% in output across key industrial sectors, according to the report. The virus has had a severe impact on China\u2019s economy, with Shanghai making a list of companies eligible for millions of dollars in subsidised loans to help keep them afloat. In recent days, Chinese industrial hubs have taken measures to stimulate production again, after factories remained closed for around 10 days after the Lunar New year holiday to help with infection control. China has ordered three reporters from American newspaper the Wall Street Journal to leave the country, over what Beijing deemed a racist headline. The expulsion came as Beijing slammed Washington\u2019s decision to tighten rules on Chinese state media organisations in the United States, calling the move \u201cunreasonable and unacceptable\u201d, AFP reports. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Journal op-ed - titled \u201cChina is the Real Sick Man of Asia\u201d - had a \u201cracially discriminatory\u201d and \u201csensational\u201d headline, and slammed the newspaper for not issuing an official apology. Geng told a press briefing: As such, China has decided that from today, the press cards of three Wall Street Journal reporters in Beijing will be revoked. The Journal reported that deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both US nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, had been ordered to leave the country in five days. The three journalists are in the Wall Street Journal\u2019s news section, which is not linked to the editorial and opinion section. The op-ed, written by Bard College professor Walter Russell Mead, criticised the Chinese government\u2019s initial response to the new coronavirus outbreak. It called the Wuhan city government \u201csecretive and self-serving\u201d, while dismissing national efforts as ineffective. The phrase \u201csick man of Asia\u201d originally referred to China in the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was exploited by foreign powers during a period sometimes called the country\u2019s \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d. The 3 February piece \u201cslandered the efforts of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to fight the epidemic\u201d, said Geng. The new coronavirus epidemic has killed over 2,000 people in China and infected more than 74,000, and has spread to at least two dozen countries. \u201cThe editors of the Wall Street Journal have nailed themselves to the pillar of shame,\u201d wrote the nationalistic Global Times in an op-ed on Tuesday before the reporters were expelled. The WSJ\u2019s remarks \u201csound like gloating, and they disgust Chinese people\u201d, it said. The expulsions come a day after the United States angered China for classifying five state media outlets, including Xinhua news agency and the China Global Television Network, as foreign missions, with State Department officials saying they were part of Beijing\u2019s growing \u201cpropaganda\u201d apparatus. Voicing China\u2019s \u201cstrong dissatisfaction\u201d, Geng added cryptically: \u201cWe reserve the right to respond further to this matter.\u201d Japanese health officials said 79 new coronavirus cases have been detected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, taking the total to 621. The positive cases on board the vessel amount to the biggest cluster of infected people outside China, and Japan is facing mounting scrutiny of its quarantine measures as passengers begin to disembark and travel across the world. Iranian authorities have confirmed two cases of coronavirus, the first in the country, the Associated Press has reported. Citing the semi-official Isna news agency, the report states there was also an unspecified number of other suspected cases and that those individuals have been quarantined. Their are currently no details on the nationality of the two people infected by the virus or the state of their health. Isna quoted an official in the country\u2019s health ministry, Kiyanoush Jahanpour, as saying two confirmed cases were detected in the central province of Qom. Subsequent tests were in progress and the results of these tests will be released to the public, once they are finalised, Jahanpour said. A total of 781 guests who disembarked from the Westerdam cruise ship in Cambodia have tested negative for Covid-19, Holland America, the ship\u2019s operator, said. Testing of passengers is now complete, while testing of 747 crew members is expected to continue for the next few days, the company said. The Foreign Office previously confirmed Britons were among those tested. A number of guests and crew had previously flown home, triggering international concern after an American passenger was diagnosed with the virus in Malaysia. Holland America said: \u201cThese results provide the required clearance for remaining guests in Cambodia to begin their onward journey home. \u201cThose who travelled home previously will be contacted by their local health department and provided further information.\u201d The are no indications the new coronavirus has spread to North Korea, the World Health Organization said, after South Korean media suggested there were cases and deaths there being covered up by the Pyongyang authorities. Experts have raised concerns that the disease, which has now killed over 2,000 people in neighbouring China, could be devastating for North Korea\u2019s under-resourced health system. Aid agencies have called for exceptions to international trading sanctions to make it easier if needed to help Pyongyang fight the disease. Dr Mike Ryan, head of WHO\u2019s emergencies programme, said: \u201cAt the moment there are no signals, there are no indications we are dealing with any Covid-19 there.\u201d A WHO spokesman, Tarik Jasarevic, said North Korea had reported checking nearly 7,300 travellers entering the country over a six-week period to 9 February. He also said 141 travellers with fevers had been tested for the virus and all had tested negative. Jasarevic said the WHO would provide North Korea with supplies including laboratory reagents for tests and protective equipment such as goggles, gloves, masks and gowns for health workers. A former North Korean diplomat, Thae Yong-ho, who defected to South Korea in 2016 said the ability of the WHO to evaluate the situation in North Korea was probably limited, as its staff and other foreigners would mostly be confined in the capital Pyongyang. Already one of the world\u2019s most closed-off countries, North Korea has stopped flights and train services with its neighbours, established month-long mandatory quarantines, suspended international tourism and imposed a near-complete lockdown on cross-border travel. South Korea has now confirmed 20 new cases of the coronavirus, including 14 people involved in an outbreak traced to several church services in the central city of Daegu. The jump in new cases is unprecedented so far in South Korea and brings the number of people infected in the country to 51. Including the cases announced on Wednesday, 19 have been reported in Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongsang province, with 16 of them tied to an earlier confirmed carrier, Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement. The earlier case was confirmed on Tuesday in a 61-year-old woman known as \u2018Patient 31\u2019. She had no recent record of overseas travel but had attended church services and sought care at a hospital before being tested for the virus, the agency said. According to a Reuters report, at least 15 people who attended religious services with \u2018Patient 31\u2019 have tested positive for the virus. One other person, who came in contact with her at a hospital, has also come down with the disease. Hundreds of people are believed to have attended services with \u2018Patient 31\u2019 in recent weeks at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, a religious movement founded in 1984 by South Korean Lee Man-hee, who is revered as a messiah by followers. On Tuesday, Shincheonji Church posted a statement on its website confirming the woman had attended services and advised its members to stay home. It encouraged members who had attended meetings on 9 and 16 February to be tested and quarantine themselves. \u201cThe Daegu branch has been shut down since this morning and is conducting prevention measures,\u201d the statement said. Health authorities view the Daegu case as a \u201csuper-spreading event\u201d, The KCDC director, Jeong Eun-kyeong, told briefings on Wednesday. Besides the church, \u2018Patient 31\u2019 also visited a hotel and, eventually, a hospital, the Daegu mayor, Kwon Young-jin, said in a Facebook post. None of the woman\u2019s family members has shown symptoms, while taxi drivers who were in contact with her are now in self-quarantine, Kwon said. A clinic that treated Patient 31 after a traffic accident on 6 February said she refused to be tested for the virus at that time, despite a fever, because she had not travelled abroad recently or been in contact with known patients. KCDC officials said they were reviewing policies governing people who refuse to be tested, and added police could be involved in such cases. After her symptoms worsened, she was finally tested for the virus on 17 February, according to the KCDC. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has called for stringent infection control measures and every possible action to boost the economy, which he said was in an emergency situation as the result of the epidemic. As the quarantine of the Diamond Princess cruise ship ends today, questions continue to swirl over how the virus spread so readily on the ship. Via Japan\u2019s state broadcaster NHK, health minister Katsunobu Kato defended Japan\u2019s efforts to halt the outbreak: Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases, including sending infected people to hospital But some health experts have criticised the measures taken to control the disease on board. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Japan\u2019s efforts might have slowed down the virus but were not enough. In a statement it said: CDC\u2019s assessment is that it may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship. From the start, experts raised questions about quarantine on the ship. Passengers weren\u2019t confined to their rooms until 5 February. The day before, as officials screened them, onboard events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class, one passenger said. A number of readers have asked about the air conditioning employed on the ship, and whether this could have contributed to the spread of the virus. Previously health authorities said the air conditioning was not a problem. However, Princess Cruises\u2019 executive vice-president, Rai Caluori ,said that, \u201cin an abundance of caution\u201d, the amount of fresh air going through the system was maximised. Dr Richard Darwood, a medical director and specialist in travel medicine, told Metro.co.uk: \u201cIf air is being ducted between one part of the ship to another then that could possibly be a factor.\u201d A video by Prof Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital, has been circulated widely on social media. He doesn\u2019t mention the air conditioning system, but he says the cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control, with no distinction between the green zone (which is free of infection) and the red zone (which is potentially contaminated by the virus). \u201cIt was completely chaotic. I was so scared of getting Covid-19, because there was no way to tell where the virus is,\u201d he said. He said there was no professional infection control person in charge on the ship and the bureaucrats in control were violating all infection control principles. He said he met a health worker who had completely given up wearing protection because they said they had already been infected with the coronavirus. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Iwata said: I felt much safer when I was in Africa [during the Ebola crisis] because you know where the virus exists and you know where the patient is. But inside the Diamond Princess you have no idea where the virus is.\u201d The remaining passengers who were stuck onboard a cruise ship docked in Cambodia for almost a week have left the vessel after testing negative for the coronavirus. The MS Westerdam arrived in the port of Sihanoukville on 13 February having been turned away from five other ports after leaving Hong Kong, which has reported more than 60 cases of the virus and two deaths. The ship came under renewed scrutiny following Cambodia\u2019s quick clearance for passengers to fly home, a move which was criticised after one American woman who had been on the cruise ship tested positive for the virus over the weekend in Malaysia. On Wednesday, a series of cheers went up from people lining the lower deck of the cruise ship and there were several loud blasts of the ship\u2019s horn as passengers began disembarking, 18 days after the ship first left Hong Kong. Kheang Phearum, spokesman for Preah Sihanouk province, where Sihanoukville is located, said: The last 233 passengers on MS Westerdam are disembarked and will continue to Phnom Penh by buses. Holland America Line, the ship\u2019s operator, confirmed in a statement the last passengers had been given health clearances to leave the ship and make their way home. Upon leaving the vessel, passengers received traditional checkered Cambodian scarves as souvenirs. The passengers will spend a night in capital Phnom Penh and then fly home, said Sun Chan Thol, Cambodia\u2019s minister of public transport. Holland America said the ship would remain at dock in Sihanoukville while hundreds of crew members were being tested. The last of the Australians who were in quarantine on Christmas Island have left and been declared free of coronavirus, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said. More than 200 Australians spent two weeks in quarantine on the remote island, best known for its immigration detention centre, after being evacuated from Wuhan in China. Morrison also confirmed that 170 Australians on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan will be flown home tomorrow, and they will also be subject to two weeks in quarantine on arrival. Shanghai has compiled a list of firms, including local units of multi-nationals Unilever PLC and 3M Co, as eligible for millions of dollars in subsidised loans to ease any blow from the coronavirus outbreak, according to bankers and documents seen by Reuters. In an economically bruising three weeks, China has cordoned off cities and suspended transport links in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. \u201cEvery bank in Shanghai is rushing to lend to the companies on its list, to earn political goodwill,\u201d said one banker who had seen a list with 194 firms, including restaurant operators and property developers. Companies have the option to nominate themselves to be added to the overall list. Each lender then determines independently whether to approach a company on its list and offer finance, according to the bankers. Companies producing medical supplies and which are \u201cbackbone enterprises\u201d providing daily necessities are eligible for the special loans, according to a notice on the Shanghai MIIT\u2019s website. China is trying to deal with a nationwide shortage of medical supplies, from face masks to protective suits, while hospitals in central Hubei province - the epicentre of the outbreak - struggle to manage hundreds of new cases a day. There is no indication from the list that loans offered will necessarily be sought, or that such firms are in any financial need. The Bank of Shanghai Co Ltd told Reuters it will lend 5.5 billion yuan ($786 million) to 57 firms on its list. The aim of the loans is to ensure financial support to key companies helping prevent and fight the epidemic, the Shanghai government notice said. A spokeswoman from Unilever said it had \u201cno current plans to apply for any financing support\u201d. 3M and other companies listed including Shanghai Kindly Enterprise Development Group and Tellgen did not respond to requests for comment. Big Chinese manufacturing hubs are starting to ease curbs on the movement of people and traffic, Reuters reports, as local governments prod factories to restart production following weeks of stoppages due to the coronavirus outbreak. The tough restriction measures slowed the sprawling industrial sector to a crawl, with companies unable to resume production or restore output to normal levels due to a lack of workers after the Lunar New Year holiday which was extended by around 10 days. Many have also been unable to take delivery of raw materials or send products to clients due to logistical hurdles, with the disruptions spilling over into supply chains worldwide. Beijing is trying to balance stamping out the epidemic which has infected more than 70,000 people and killed over 2,000, while also shielding the already weakened economy from more damage. The city of Foshan, a large manufacturer of electronics and household appliances in southern Guangdong province, said late on Tuesday that businesses no longer need to seek prior approval before resuming operations and they returning workers will not need to provide proof of their health. On Monday, the nearby city of Zhongshan similarly lowered administrative barriers. In eastern Zhejiang province over the weekend, the cities of Hangzhou and Ningbo also pared back the approval process for companies looking to restart. Morgan Stanley research said: Macro and micro data suggest production activities are resuming at a slow pace in China, reaching 60-80% of normal levels by end-Feb and normalising only by mid-to-late March,\u201d Morgan Stanley wrote in a research noted. If the spread of the virus is not contained within the next two weeks, the disruption to production could extend into the second quarter. Some cities in Guangdong and Zhejiang this week organised buses and trains to ferry workers back from their hometowns. The city of Taizhou, in Zhejiang, even arranged for several planes to pick up migrant workers from Chongqing, Guiyang, Chengdu, Kunming and Xian, with the local government of Taizhou footing a third of the bill. The outbreak has also chilled consumer demand and hammered the services sector, with restaurants, hotels, cinemas and travel agents among the segments most visibly hit. In a bid to revive consumption, Foshan announced stimulus measures for its auto market, the first city in China to do so amid the outbreak. The city government will offer subsidies of 2,000 yuan ($285) for purchases of new cars and 3,000 ($429) yuan for replacement of existing cars, according to a document published on its website.

The Foreign Office has confirmed that although most passengers are free to leave the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan today after its official quarantine comes to an end, those who do so many not be able to board the UK evacuation flight planned for later this week. In a statement, the Foreign and Commonwealth office said: We are planning an evacuation flight from Tokyo to the UK as soon as possible for Britons who are on the Diamond Princess. We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities. At 0700 local time on Wednesday, the Diamond Princess cruise operator and Japanese authorities allowed passengers to disembark from the cruise ship. However there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight. We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight. I\u2019m handing over the blogging duties to my colleagues in London. Thanks for reading but here\u2019s a summary of the main developments today so far: Deaths from the virus have risen above 2,000 after a 40% spike in fatalities in Hubei overnight. However, the number of new cases in China has fallen again. Passengers have begun leaving the Diamond Princess cruise ship which has been anchored in Yokohama for two weeks. Questions remain about how Covid-19 has spread to infect 540 passengers and crew. One Japanese health expert says the quarantining was inadequate. A second person has died from the virus in Hong Kong. China\u2019s authorities are stepping up their control on people\u2019s movement \u2013 but could be risking a backlash A senior nurse in a Wuhan hospital has become the latest health worker to die from the virus. South Korea has recorded 15 new cases, 10 of them centred around a church in Daegu. Casual staff at Australian universities fear for their livelihoods amid a slump in enrolments caused by the travel ban on Chinese students. Stock markets have bounced back across Asia Pacific, shrugging off increasing evidence of a widespread shutdown in the Chinese economy. Casual staff at Australian universities fear for their livelihoods amid a slump in enrolments caused by the travel ban on Chinese students. Part-time teachers are \u201cpanicking\u201d in fear that they won\u2019t get paid if there no students to teach. \u201cThe casual workforce gets hired based on enrolments. Casual teaching contracts require student numbers to be confirmed. People were panicking,\u201d one lecturer said. Stephanie Convery has the full story: Justin McCurry in Tokyo has cleared up the confusion about the diagnosis of David Abel, a British passenger onboard the Diamond Princess, and his wife. It turns out he and Sally Abel are both positive after all, despite a suggestion earlier today that they weren\u2019t: Abel posted on Facebook on Tuesday night that he and his wife, Sally, had both tested positive, but then cast doubt on his diagnosis after being told by Japanese doctors that the couple were to be taken off the ship and placed in a hostel \u201cfor four or five days\u201d rather than being sent to hospital. But on Wednesday afternoon, Abel said they had confirmed their positive status after talking to an English-speaking doctor, and were preparing to be taken off the ship, which has been moored in Yokohama, near Tokyo, since 3 February. \u201cWe\u2019ve since spoken to a doctor that speaks English ... and it has been confirmed by him that we are both positive,\u201d Abel said in a YouTube video, adding that he believed they would spend a few days in a hostel while they wait for hospital beds to become available. \u201cI can\u2019t see that there\u2019s going to be any way we\u2019ll be on that flight to the UK,\u201d he said, referring to plans by the British government to send a chartered flight to Japan this week to collect about 70 British passengers on the Diamond Princess. Following on from Verna Yu\u2019s story (last post but one) about the crackdown on dissent in China, the Global Times has tweeted about the ongoing enforcement of rules in Huanggang, a city in Hubei hard-hit by the virus. The Chinese news site says people who violate the rules of the lockdown will be sent to \u201cdesignated places to learn and recite government official documents\u201d. Shades of Xinjiang. The relief of this passenger from the Diamond Princess is palpable. As it would be. Our reporter Verna Yu has been looking at how the government in Beijing has ruthlessly cracked down on dissent as it has tried to contain the spread of Covid-19. The situation is especially brutal in Wuhan where people risk jail if they dare to even leave their homes. One resident of the city told us: People are gripped by fear and anxiety, and we are extremely angry because this disaster is entirely man-made. The bubbling resentment felt about the draconian controls can be seen on social media, Verna writes, with images of people being beaten by police for not wearing masks and paraded in chains. It\u2019s a serious test of Xi Jinping\u2019s authority. Hu Jia, a veteran activist who has been previously jailed and often detained, says it\u2019s the \u201cgravest challenge to the authorities since 1989 (Tiananmen pro-democracy movement)\u201d. Stocks across the Asia Pacific region have rebounded today after the Apple-induced falls of Tuesday. In Sydney, the benchmark ASX200 rose 0.43% to close at a record high of 7144.6 points. That is also just 1 point off the all time intra-day high of 7145.7 which was set earlier in the year. In Tokyo the Nikkei is up 1% with only 30 minutes of trading to go. The Shanghai Composite is up 0.3% and the Hang Seng has climbed 0.44% today. The Kospi in Seoul is, however, off 0.2%, despite the government announcing billions of won in stimulus to help businesses through the Covid-19-driven slowdown. Our full story on the exodus from the Diamond Princess has just gone live on the site. Here it is: Reuters has given us a fascinating insight into what\u2019s happening inside the Chinese economy and how people are losing their jobs amid the unprecedented shutdown. Mark Xia, a cameraman at a video prooducer in Shanghai, returned to work this month to be told he had to take three months unpaid leave. The company rejected his request to pay at least half his monthly salary during the suspension so he has quit and is now looking for a new job. \u201cI understand the company\u2019s cash-flow is tight,\u201d Xia, 25, told Reuters. \u201cWe postponed some shooting due to the coronavirus outbreak, and that\u2019s had a huge impact on our revenues, that\u2019s the reality.\u201d The government has rolled out special loans for small businesses facing loss of business and cash flow problems. But the real human cost to people like Xia could be profound if multiplied across China\u2019s vast economy. As we saw in an earlier post, the government is pushing hard to get people back to work but faces some serious problems in the shape of travel restrictions on migrant workers. The Global Times said a little while ago that the government is urging provinces \u2013 except Hubei \u2013 to relax the restrictions on migrants. More grim news from the frontline in Wuhan. A nurse at Wuchang hospital in the city has died from the virus, the Global Times reports. Liu Fan, 59, was deputy chief nurse and had worked in the injection room until 2 February. She then developed a fever and was admitted to hospital on 7 February. She died on 14 February after contracting pneumonia. Liu\u2019s parents and brother have also died of the virus. Her husband and daughter are under quarantine but have not been found to be infected. Liu Zhiming, a senior doctor at the hospital, has also died of the virus, as we reported yesterday. Australian Olympic chief John Coates has assured athletes, fans and officials that it will be safe to attend the games scheduled for Tokyo at the end of July. Coates said he had travelled to Tokyo last week and was briefed by organisers about contingency plans for dealing with Covid-19 ahead of the games. There was no question of the games being cancelled, he said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re very satisfied that all the checks and balances will be there by the time the athletes and the spectators enter the country.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Ten staff from a Japanese news agency, Kyodo News, were reportedly driven in a hired vehicle in January and early February by a man who has since tested positive for Covid-19. The Japan Times reports that the staff were sent home to self-quarantine. In 14 days since their last contact with the man, seven of the staff members have shown no symptoms and will soon return to work. Three remain at home. None have actually been tested for the virus. The Japan Times points out, however, that some of the staff could be political journalists who attend briefings at the office of prime minister Shinzo Abe. When contacted by The Japan Times, Kyodo declined to comment on whether any of the workers are reporters. The death rate from the novel coronavirus has risen to 2.67%, based on today\u2019s official figures from China. That\u2019s based on 2,010 deaths worldwide and 75,199 confirmed cases. The rate was thought to be around 2%. I\u2019m not an expert in infectious diseases but that figure is growing. A second person has died from Covid-19 in Hong Kong, according to the South China Morning Post. The 70-year-old man had underlying health problems and was declared dead on Wednesday morning. He had visited the Chinese mainland in January. The territory has 62 confirmed cases. The team at Capital Economics have been producing charts tracking coal consumption and traffic congestion and other factors in China in an effort to give a picture of how the virus is affecting the economy. The official line from China is that much of the workforce is back in action and that targets can be hit. But there is a lot of evidence to suggest that things are far from being back to normal. Take this chart, for example, tracking coal consumption in power stations. It shows a slight pickup in the last few days but not much more. Electricity use is routinely used by economists as a proxy for economic activity in China as a counterpoint to official growth figures. The charts are compiled from sources such as WIND, a Chinese data tracker, and CEIC. This one on daily passenger traffic also shows a slight uptick but only just: And traffic congestion as garnered from Amap, China\u2019s version of Google Maps: More on the disembarking passengers from Justin in Tokyo: Japanese TV showed passengers leaving the ship late on Wednesday morning to board waiting buses. Local health authorities said about 500 passengers were expected to disembark on Wednesday, with around 2,500 others to follow over the next two days. Only those who tested negative and did not share cabins with infected passengers are being permitted to disembark, amid widening criticism of Japan\u2019s handling of the ship\u2019s quarantine. Anyone who has had contact with an infected passenger will have to undergo 14 more days in quarantine. In addition, the crew will begin a new quarantine when the last passenger has disembarked. The Diamond Princess has proved a fertile breeding ground for the virus with at least 542 positive cases \u2013 making the ship home to the largest cluster of infections outside mainland China. \u201cNEGATIVE! Me, son, husband, mom and dad! Thank you Lord for protecting us... So emotional now,\u201d tweeted passenger Yardley Wong, who has been cooped up with her six-year-old son. Those with no symptoms and a negative test received an official certificate saying they posed \u201cno risk of infection of nCoV, as the said person has also presented no symptoms including fever at the time of infection.\u201d Some in Japan have raised concerns about allowing people from the cruise ship to board flights home or spread out into crowded cities such as Tokyo, saying there was a chance that secondary infections had occurred on the ship during its 14-day quarantine. Several countries, including Britain, Hong Kong and Australia, appear to have lost patience with the on-board quarantine and have prepared chartered planes to bring back their citizens. More than 300 Americans were flown home on Monday, although 14 of the passengers tested positive during the evacuation. The US government has told Americans who chose to remain on the ship that they will not be allowed back into the country until they have completed another two weeks of quarantine after disembarking. Early Wednesday, South Korea flew six of its nationals plus a Japanese spouse to Seoul. They will be placed in isolation for 14 days, the Yonhap news agency reported. Other countries will require repatriated people to undergo another two weeks of quarantine after they return home. Beijing\u2019s leading medical adviser has warned that human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 has still not been stopped in Wuhan, the state-owned Global Times reports. Zhong told a press conference in Guangzhou on Tuesday that despite huge efforts to lock down the city of 11 million, the authorities had failed to separate patients from healthy people and to separate COVID-19 patients from flu patients. Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the Global Times that transmission of the common flu had also worsened in Wuhan alongside the spread of Covid-19. \u201cThe human-to-human transmission of flu worsened the human-to-human transmission situation of novel coronavirus in Wuhan,\u201d Yang said, as it has made screening for coronavirus patients more difficult. The Global Times also reports criticism by local people of the authorities\u2019 response to the outbreak. One resident called Chen said residential areas were sealed off too late to stop the spread. \u201cOur community only arranged the collective purchase of daily necessities today, after it was completely locked down. A few days ago, I heard that people went to the supermarket nearby, which led to a public gathering,\u201d she said. \u201cLocal authorities acted too slowly, missing the best opportunity to contain the virus spread,\u201d she added. Justin McCurry, our man in Tokyo, has been speaking to a Japanese health expert who fears some of the cruise ship passengers could yet turn out to be carrying the virus: Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital in western Japan who spent several hours on the luxury cruise liner on Tuesday, told the Guardian that passengers cleared of the virus should continue to be monitored for another two weeks in case they develop symptoms of Covid-19. He told us: It is a good idea to allow people to disembark because conditions on the ship are dangerous, but it is possible that some people who recently tested negative could turn out to be positive. Certainly those who are due to leave should not be allowed to wander around freely. They have to be monitored so they can quickly receive medical treatment if they show symptoms. Passengers have begun leaving the Diamond Princess cruise ship after spending two weeks in quarantine off Yokohama, near Tokyo, public broadcaster NHK said. Around 500 people were expected to disembark on Wednesday with the entire process to be completed by Friday, NHK reported. The South Korean disease control centre (KCDC) has confirmed our earlier report that the country has 15 new cases of the virus, taking the total to 46. It says 13 cases were identified in Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongbuk province about 250km south of the capital, Seoul. Eleven of the cases are linked to the 31st patient who is identified as a 60-year-old woman. She had been in a car accident and treated at a local hospital since 7 February. She developed the fever on 10 February and was tested for Covid-19 on Monday. She was confirmed positive on Tuesday and is now in isolation in hospital. She has not been abroad since December, 2019. An epidemiological investigation is currently underway. Ten of these people attend the same church as the woman, the KCDC said. Officials are in the process of finding out how another two people from the area were infected. Another new is the daughter of a previously confirmed case who has been hospitalised for treatment at Seoul National University Bundang hospital. The 15th new case is a 43-year-old man in Seongdong-gu, Seoul, who is being hospitalised for isolation. A countermeasures team has been dispatched to the Daegu area to implement emergency defense measures with the local government. China is doing its utmost to get its huge state-owned industrial sector back to work following the shutdowns amid the Covid-19 outbreak, state media reports. According to CGTN, the state council\u2019s assets supervision and administration commission (SASAC) said it would stick to this year\u2019s production targets and \u201cguide enterprises to resume work in a safe and orderly manner\u201d. Ren Hongbin, vice chairman of the SASAC, told media on Tuesday that more than 80% of state-owned enterprise (SOE) production subsidiaries had resumed operation, and more than 95% of the companies in the sectors of petroleum and petrochemical, communication, electricity and transport have resumed work. However, according to a report by the Financial Times on Tuesday, companies are having difficulty getting migrant workers back into their factories because of the travel restrictions imposed around the country. The newspaper claimed Foxconn\u2013 which manufactures for Apple \u2013 is struggling to get enough workers onto the iPhone assembly line at its plant in Zhengzhou, in China\u2019s Henan province. Many workers left the cities to return home for new year and are now unable to return to work because of compulsory quarantine in Foxconn dormitories. Henan has seen the most deaths of any province outside Hubei, with 19. The FT explains: The rooms, which usually pack in eight workers, had quickly filled, causing Foxconn to halt the return of additional staff, explained a Zhengzhou-based factory recruiter, who asked not to be named. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough room,\u201d the recruiter said, adding that workers could now sign up and wait for quarantine availability. \u201cThere\u2019s no one snoring. There\u2019s no one bothering you. The internet is finally fast,\u201d said one worker of the comfortable conditions in quarantine. The seven other bunks in his dorm room \u2014 consisting of only wood planks without mattresses \u2014 were empty. Justin McCurry in Tokyo reports that a British couple did not after all test positive: David Abel, a British passenger onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, has said he and his wife Sally did not test positive for the coronavirus Covid-19 - as he had initially reported - and were still on the ship waiting to disembark. Abel, who said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that the couple had both tested positive, blamed the mix-up on communication problems with Japanese officials. \u201cSally &amp; I packed and waited 8 hours in the cabin to be transported to a hostel. We are still on the ship!\u201d he said in an update on Wednesday morning. \u201cThey do NOT send folk with the virus to a hostel! Massive communication error yesterday. The Japanese quarantine officials to not speak any English. They came to our door &amp; told us to be ready to be taken to the hostel. My mindset was \u2018virus\u2019 and said \u2018positive then\u2019. He nodded. I don\u2019t think he was saying yes to the virus but positive we were moving out?? He followed up by saying it will probably be just 4 or 5 days. You would not say that to a virus victim.\u201d Abel said he and Sally were being helped by the British embassy in Tokyo, adding: I am being listened to and Sally &amp; I feel really well. I will get more info out when I know what\u2019s happening. Thank you for your love and concern. Sally &amp; David xx\u201d Japan\u2019s health ministry said on Wednesday that Diamond Princess passengers who tested negative and had not shared a cabin with someone who tested positive would start leaving the ship around mid-morning after spending two weeks in quarantine. The ministry said the disembarkation would be completed by Friday. More than 500 of the 3,700 passengers and crew originally on the Diamond Princess have been diagnosed with Covid-19, making it home to the largest cluster of infections outside mainland China. Some experts have criticised quarantine conditionsonboard the ship, fearing it has become an incubator for the virus. The luxury cruise liner was placed in lockdown at the port of Yokoyama early this month after it emerged that a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus at the end of last month. Sticking with South Korea, the finance minister has outlined some emergency funding measures to prop up the local economy, which is very exposed to the slowdown in China. Hong Nam-ki said: The government will provide 100bn won (US$84m) in reserve funds to help local authorities stem the spread of the virus. Small tourism businesses will receive a total of 50bn won of credit-based loans with a 1% interest rate. 300bn won worth of support for low-cost airlines suffering liquidity shortages. South Korea has 15 new cases of the coronavirus and will announce the positive test results later on Wednesday, according to Yonhap news agency, which cited unnamed health officials. The new cases are in the city of Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongsang province, Yonhap said. Health officials declined to confirm the Yonhap report, Reuters said. There have been 31 cases of Covid-19 in South Korea as of Tuesday. It comes as South Korean citizens arrived back in the country after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Stock markets in Asia are in positive territory today after a dip yesterday caused largely by Apple\u2019s shortages warning. Sydney is up 0.15%, Tokyo is 0.4% to the good and Seoul is 0.5% better off. In case you missed it, our economics editor Larry Elliott has been looking at what Apple\u2019s warning tells us about the impact of the virus on the Chinese and global economies. Covid-19 is unusual because it is both a demand and a supply shock to Apple, he writes, with shoppers in China unable to get out and the supply of devices mostly made in China now drying up because of factory closures. So far financial markets have \u201cblithely asumed\u201d that everything will be back to normal, Larry writes, but Germany, Japan and China \u2013 the top three economies behind the US \u2013 are all struggling and former two could be in recession soon. There are also signs the US economy might not be as strong as the occupant of the White House thinks. He concludes with a grim warning of his own: Bulls in the financial market have seen every dip in share prices as a buying opportunity, primarily because they are confident that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will step in and provide ample stimulus if things start to look grim. In the short-term, the bulls are right. In the long term, central banks will be legitimising reckless behaviour and risking the crash to end all crashes. Here\u2019s the full article: Reuters has the latest health commission numbers. It says 2,004 people have died from the virus in mainland China, making a total around the world of 2,009 by my reckoning. Confirmed cases on the mainland are 74,185. When you add Taiwan (22) and Hong Kong (62) that\u2019s a total of 74,279. Globally the total is 75,152. The NHC website still hasn\u2019t updated its daily briefing page. Chinese media are reporting that the total deaths from the virus are now more than 2,000. I\u2019m hoping to get the official confirmation of national health commission figures shortly but Tencent reports 2,003 deaths in mainland China with one in Hong Kong. There have been four more deaths around the world. The Johns Hopkins University tracker puts the total deaths, including those around the world, at 2,007, so there\u2019s a discrepancy of one between the two figures. Total cases in mainland China stands at 74,139, according to Johns Hopkins. Looking at more depth at the latest health figures from Hubei shows that deaths in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, rose markedly on Tuesday with 116 new fatalities, up from 72 on Monday. A total of 1,497 people have now died from the virus in Wuhan. New confirmed cases in Wuhan stood at 1,660, up from 1,600 on Monday. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the main points today: Another 132 people have died from the virus in Hubei as of midnight on Tuesday, the provincial health commission has said on Wednesday morning, making a total of 1,921. That represents a jump from 93 deaths recorded on Monday, or a rise of more than 40%. The number of new cases in the province is 1,693, taking the total to 61,682. It is the lowest number since 11 February and the second consecutive day below 2,000. The other main developments are: After a 14-day quarantine, passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are preparing disembark if they have tested negative. Flights from nations including the UK and Australia will be standing by to take them home. Fourteen South Korean passengers and crew arrived back home on Wednesday morning on the presidential jet, Yonhap news agency said Chinese people in Britain have reported a rise in abuse relating to the virus A Chinese film director and his family are among the latest victims of the virus The UK\u2019s largest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has warned it is running out of parts for its factories. Stocks on Wall Street and in Europe fell after Apple\u2019s warning about a shortage of iPhones And our health editor Sarah Boseley has been analysing how China\u2019s handling of the outbreak has created a diplomatic balancing act for the WHO",

Why didn\u2019t he go the newspaper editorial route instead? \u201cI have to admit, what I want is a picture on the wall, a whammo picture,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in sitting down to a workday where you draw little pictures. Not for me.\u201d The first politicians he chose to scorch were Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson. \u201cI just picked them, I made them extreme and totally psychotic,\u201d said Saul. The artist read psychiatric books for inspiration. \u201cWith the real shockers, biographies of people executed, murderers, I became interested in showing symptoms of mental illness in my pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would deepen the picture and keep it from being predicable.\u201d In his 1984 painting, Ronald Reagan in Grenada, the former president invades the Caribbean island with a wad of cash. \u201cReagan suits my art style perfectly, the way he looks,\u201d said Saul. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help my art be interesting, can we have a painting that\u2019s interesting to look at?\u201d One of his strongest pieces is a portrait of George W Bush alongside a mutated prisoner at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, from 2006. \u201cBush is the worst of the modern presidents, in my opinion, because he killed the most people,\u201d said Saul. \u201cHe\u2019s the main one.\u201d His latest skewering of Donald Trump shows the president as a crocodile \u2013 literally, the president\u2019s head on a reptile \u2013 in a 2017 painting called Donald Trump in Florida. \u201cBy the time I got around to painting Trump, 10,000 artists had already totally insulted him, so what\u2019s the point?\u201d asks Saul. \u201cI felt it would be good to make him into a crocodile. I also did a painting of ducks in his hair.\u201d Why ducks? \u201cWhy not?\u201d he asks. \u201cI don\u2019t always have a reason.\u201d In other Trump paintings on view, Saul paints the president\u2019s blond locks floating around a canvas. In another, Trump is gussied up as Wonder Woman. \u201cI figured the only fresh approach to Trump is to make a positive picture,\u201d said Saul. \u201cIf he gets re-elected, I\u2019ll do him as a woman a few more times. I didn\u2019t think anyone will vote for him, but here he is.\u201d Saul has also taken a stab at historical landscapes, like Custer\u2019s Last Stand and Washington Crossing the Delaware. \u201cThey are so boring to look at, such boring paintings, I thought I could do better without doing any research,\u201d he Saul. In his Washington version, the politician rides a sinking boat, while riding a pink polka-dotted horse. \u201cEven though I\u2019m a timid person, I like the idea of a crazy kind of art,\u201d said Saul. Shuffling through the exhibition, Saul stops before his paintings and says things to himself like: \u201cThis one is far out, gee whiz,\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with me? Who knows.\u201d \u201cThe paintings are filled with inexcusable lies,\u201d said Saul. \u201cI\u2019m showing the negativity of the Iraqi war and the Gulf war.\u201d He does so with Donald Duck, Bush and Adolf Hitler all packed into an airplane. He stops before a painting of Joseph Stalin he painted in 2007. \u201cI do better with the bad guys, the bad guys suit me,\u201d he says. But why? \u201cWeakness of the art style.\u201d In another painting, Stalin and Mao Zedong knock the heads off German and Japanese soldiers. \u201cWhen I start painting, I forget about myself,\u201d he said. \u201cThis artwork is my attempt to make paintings that are hot rather than cool. It\u2019s like reaching for the hot sauce at a restaurant so your dish has more oompf.\u201d",

Heisting the murky sounds of UK drill sounds \u2013 shadowy synths, gritty drums, swallowing womp-womp effects \u2013 the pair blazed a new form of New York City rap best exemplified by Pop\u2019s breakthrough muscle and brawn hit, Welcome to the Party. Since its release last year, the song has crumbled pavements from Flatbush to Bed-Stuy, its power mostly drawn from Pop\u2019s voice: an impossibly gruff thing that sounded half 50 Cent, half cacodemon. He rapped like someone who had no problem welcoming gloaming into the soul, a chilling sense of doom embedded into those thick vocal cords. Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/19/us-rapper-pop-smoke-20-shot-and-killed-in-home-invasion\">reports</a> emerging that Pop, just 20 years old, was shot and killed in his Hollywood Hills house last night by two masked men in what appears to be a home-invasion robbery are shocking in their senselessness and brutality. How could this happen? How could that voice \u2013 so forceful, so unbending \u2013 now be silenced forever?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usu0XY4QNB0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usu0XY4QNB0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Hailing from Brooklyn\u2019s Canarsie neighbourhood, the son of a Jamaican mother and a Panamanian father saw his promising high school basketball career derailed when he was diagnosed with a heart murmur. There was a notable incident in his formative years when a video of him being slapped on the street by kids gained viral traction. Unwilling stars of internet fame rarely find any positives from the experience, but the clip\u2019s reach seemed to add extra steel to Pop. \u201cI\u2019m glad it happened as a kid,\u201d he said in<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/arts/music/pop-smoke-rap.html\"> a New York Times profile</a>. \u201cI realised it\u2019s time to boss up \u2013 life ain\u2019t sweet.\u201d His brief existence included two years under house arrest on a gun charge, yet the man who claimed he was kicked out of eighth grade for bringing a firearm to class asserted his hopes to make music for all the young people who \u201cgot to carry their guns to school because it ain\u2019t safe, but they still got to make sure they get they diploma \u2018cause they mom could be happy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1f28ba833eec725396a2ba1f09d6ab8787bd701\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1f28ba833eec725396a2ba1f09d6ab8787bd701/0_305_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>To invoke the cliche that Pop\u2019s rise was meteoric seems insufficient \u2013 it was so much faster than that. His recording career was only months old when Welcome to the Party dropped, yet nobody who knows anything about Pop would tether his success to one viral hit. Every record showed he had charisma to burn. Like 50 Cent, Pop could be a walking hook machine. The vicious Dior painted high-fashion threads as a street hustler\u2019s uniform; Christopher Walking played like an evil version of 50s sci-fi single Ayo Technology and saw Pop declare himself king of New York, that most deified of hip-hop crowns, synonymous with his regional forefather the Notorious BIG. Pop was nothing if not supremely confident. And while it\u2019s fair to say he had room to develop more ripples to his artistry, he leaves behind two tapes in Meet The Woo and Meet The Woo 2 that clearly laid out his sonic philosophy and threatened to push New York hip-hop into strange new places. Maybe they still will. That\u2019ll be the legacy.</p> <p>Pop Smoke was due to go on tour next month, increasing his reach and visibility. As devastation has had it, he joins recent fallen rappers Mac Miller, Lil Peep, the problematic XXXTentacion, Nipsey Hussle and Juice WRLD \u2013 mostly very young men who were making music that helped define their generation. Rap has suffered losses incalculable to the culture. It\u2019s impossible not to consider how different the landscape of the next 20 years would be had they lived to help design it. In the tragedy of Pop Smoke, all there is to cling to is the records he left behind and reminder that few people have done so much with so little.</p>",

Heisting the murky sounds of UK drill sounds \u2013 shadowy synths, gritty drums, swallowing womp-womp effects \u2013 the pair blazed a new form of New York City rap best exemplified by Pop\u2019s breakthrough muscle and brawn hit, Welcome to the Party. Since its release last year, the song has crumbled pavements from Flatbush to Bed-Stuy, its power mostly drawn from Pop\u2019s voice: an impossibly gruff thing that sounded half 50 Cent, half cacodemon. He rapped like someone who had no problem welcoming gloaming into the soul, a chilling sense of doom embedded into those thick vocal cords. Yet reports emerging that Pop, just 20 years old, was shot and killed in his Hollywood Hills house last night by two masked men in what appears to be a home-invasion robbery are shocking in their senselessness and brutality. How could this happen? How could that voice \u2013 so forceful, so unbending \u2013 now be silenced forever? Hailing from Brooklyn\u2019s Canarsie neighbourhood, the son of a Jamaican mother and a Panamanian father saw his promising high school basketball career derailed when he was diagnosed with a heart murmur. There was a notable incident in his formative years when a video of him being slapped on the street by kids gained viral traction. Unwilling stars of internet fame rarely find any positives from the experience, but the clip\u2019s reach seemed to add extra steel to Pop. \u201cI\u2019m glad it happened as a kid,\u201d he said in a New York Times profile. \u201cI realised it\u2019s time to boss up \u2013 life ain\u2019t sweet.\u201d His brief existence included two years under house arrest on a gun charge, yet the man who claimed he was kicked out of eighth grade for bringing a firearm to class asserted his hopes to make music for all the young people who \u201cgot to carry their guns to school because it ain\u2019t safe, but they still got to make sure they get they diploma \u2018cause they mom could be happy\u201d. To invoke the cliche that Pop\u2019s rise was meteoric seems insufficient \u2013 it was so much faster than that. His recording career was only months old when Welcome to the Party dropped, yet nobody who knows anything about Pop would tether his success to one viral hit. Every record showed he had charisma to burn. Like 50 Cent, Pop could be a walking hook machine. The vicious Dior painted high-fashion threads as a street hustler\u2019s uniform; Christopher Walking played like an evil version of 50s sci-fi single Ayo Technology and saw Pop declare himself king of New York, that most deified of hip-hop crowns, synonymous with his regional forefather the Notorious BIG. Pop was nothing if not supremely confident. And while it\u2019s fair to say he had room to develop more ripples to his artistry, he leaves behind two tapes in Meet The Woo and Meet The Woo 2 that clearly laid out his sonic philosophy and threatened to push New York hip-hop into strange new places. Maybe they still will. That\u2019ll be the legacy. Pop Smoke was due to go on tour next month, increasing his reach and visibility. As devastation has had it, he joins recent fallen rappers Mac Miller, Lil Peep, the problematic XXXTentacion, Nipsey Hussle and Juice WRLD \u2013 mostly very young men who were making music that helped define their generation. Rap has suffered losses incalculable to the culture. It\u2019s impossible not to consider how different the landscape of the next 20 years would be had they lived to help design it. In the tragedy of Pop Smoke, all there is to cling to is the records he left behind and reminder that few people have done so much with so little.",

      "body": "<p>There was a solitary question on the ballot paper in the 2016 referendum. It asked: \u201cShould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u201d The result \u2013 the majority vote to leave \u2013 was clear but close. Boris Johnson\u2019s government has now begun to implement it and would like to pretend that the issue is done and dusted.</p> <p>This is patently not the case. For one thing, most of the terms on which Brexit Britain will coexist alongside the EU remain to be decided. For another, it was common ground among leavers and remainers that a lot of umbilically linked questions clustered around the core EU argument. Among them were such things as austerity, business confidence, inequality, regional decline, hostility to London, nationalist narratives, resentment of elites \u2013 and immigration. Ever since 2016, these other Brexit-powered questions have helped to reshape British politics at least as much as Brexit itself has done.</p> <p>The principal surrogate takeaway from the leave vote in the Conservative party has been immigration controls. Theresa May was a remainer. But she became Tory party leader in part because, as the former home secretary, she was identified with the strict immigration policy that leave voters were judged to be demanding in the referendum. May repeatedly made it clear that she saw border controls and curbs on migrant numbers as synonymous with the leave mandate. That baton has now passed to Johnson, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/18/uk-to-close-door-to-non-english-speakers-and-unskilled-workers\" title=\"\">post-Brexit immigration plans were published on Wednesday</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Tory party has become a nationalist party, sustained by the tabloid press, rather than a class party</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this respect, Johnson is carrying on where May left off. He sees his immigration plan as second only to EU withdrawal itself in establishing the foundations of the post-Brexit Britain over which he wishes to preside. That\u2019s partly why the policy has been announced while parliament is in recess. Headlines like the Mail\u2019s \u201cImmigration Revolution: Boris\u2019s Border Blueprint\u201d on Wednesday have had a perfect launch.</p> <p>But it is important to be clear why Johnson, like May before him, thinks this way. It\u2019s because, in the final analysis, the driving force behind this week\u2019s new curbs is primarily political, not economic. It is as much about driving a wedge into the opposition parties as it is about achieving specific migration goals. It thus underscores a crucial change in the Tory party to which its rivals may not have yet adjusted.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s immigration debate has always been about both control and the appearance of control. In political terms, it is the appearance that counts most. That has been true ever since the 1960s, when the mantra of <a href=\"https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/2005/feb/23/immigration-and-asylum\" title=\"\">\u201cfirm but fair\u201d immigration control</a> as the precondition for domestic racial harmony and equality first took root. Johnson\u2019s proposals this week, fleshing out the so-called points-based immigration system proposed in the party\u2019s election manifesto, sit broadly within that tradition.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the immigration issues that Britain faces in the 2020s are different in kind from those it faced in the 1960s. That is because the EU and EEA freedom of movement rights, which went with Britain\u2019s 43 years of EU membership, are due to cease on 31 December. The large rise in EU freedom of movement after 2004 did more than anything else to drive up migrant numbers in the years before the referendum, even though it was the refugee crisis in Syria and north Africa that made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/01/immigration-to-uk-hit-record-levels-in-run-up-to-brexit-vote-latest-figures-show\" title=\"\">the issue truly toxic in 2016</a>.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s plan is a political initiative masquerading as an economic one. Britain\u2019s departure from the EU and its rejection of EU freedom of movement mean that new immigration rules are needed. But the governing approach in the new plan is to impress the voting public rather than to solve labour market issues that face businesses and domestic or overseas workers. The practical side takes second place to the message. Home secretary Priti Patel talked on Wednesday as though the new system would at last enfranchise 8 million UK workers to get the jobs that foreigners had been filling until now. This is total nonsense. The economically inactive are overwhelmingly students, retired or long-term sick. But it\u2019s the immigration revolution headlines that matter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cc63a02c81b988341cfb977fef14ebd3f1ef90a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cc63a02c81b988341cfb977fef14ebd3f1ef90a/269_96_3123_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Home secretary Priti Patel at Imperial College London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Home secretary Priti Patel at Imperial College London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The details of the Johnson-Patel package matter more to businesses than they do to ministers or the public. Sectors such as construction, where 14% of the existing labour force is said to be non-UK (the figure is 54% in London) face a real hit unless the boundary between skilled (good) and unskilled (bad) migrants is better managed than the government plan implies. The knock-on effect for Johnson\u2019s ambitious infrastructure projects and hospital building pledges would be pretty dire if this does not happen. The hospitality industry will similarly be on an economic knife-edge, with destructive implications for the already struggling high street. There are likely to be many tweaks to this evolving plan once the news spotlight has moved elsewhere.</p> <p>That is because these details pale into relative insignificance for the government when compared with the political dividends the Tories expect from the parade of tough action. Even though net migration has increased a lot in the past 20 years, <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/publication/1970-01/sri-perceptions-and-reality-immigration-report-2013.pdf\" title=\"\">public opinion routinely exaggerates</a> its scale. It is likely to go on doing so as long as the Mail is around. The post-2016 fall in EU migration to the UK has made little difference. The <a href=\"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/\" title=\"\">polls consistently show</a> that a majority (albeit a slowly declining one) want immigration cut. Everything Patel ever says shows that, however little she understands or cares about the detailed impact of this week\u2019s plan, she absolutely gets that this is intended to be another \u201cjob done\u201d moment for the government, just like Brexit itself.</p> <p>The Johnson government\u2019s approach to immigration is of a piece with its general approach to Brexit. The idea that the interests of business are the government\u2019s priority, or that the modern Tory party can any longer be seen as the party of business, is largely for the birds. That internal battle was fought and lost in the Brexit battles of the last parliament. The Tory party has become a nationalist party, sustained by the tabloid press, rather than a class party sustained by traditional business interests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/19/immigration-firms-will-need-to-train-more-uk-workers-says-priti-patel\">Immigration: firms will need to train more UK workers, says Priti Patel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Tory party has also discovered, without necessarily intending to, something that centre-right parties and movements have simultaneously discovered in other parts of the world.

France wants to maintain agricultural spending and boost EU defence funds. Germany wants a speedy agreement, to avoid having to solve the budget during its EU presidency in the final six months of the year. \u201cThe Germans face a dilemma,\u201d said the senior EU diplomat. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to own this hot potato. But will they pay up just to avoid it?\u201d</p> <p>As well as the Brexit gap, the UK leaves another poisonous legacy: the rebate. After Margaret Thatcher secured the British rebate in 1984, some other countries were granted one, effectively a discount on their EU membership fee. While the European commission proposed sweeping away all \u201ccorrections\u201d, Michel has proposed that five net payers should keep their rebates. \u201cThe rebate is not there just for fun. It is there because otherwise things would really get out of hand and off the scale,\u201d said a diplomat from one country that gets a rebate.</p> <p>Other countries, including net payers such as France, think the rebate has had its day. \u201cWhy these five countries? Just because they already had one [a rebate],\u201d said another diplomat. \u201cIt is very unfortunate that we continued with this tinkering.\u201d</p> <p>Although the arguments are big, the sums are relatively small. The \u201cfrugal four\u201d want to limit the EU budget to 1% of the EU\u2019s economy, as measured by gross national income (GNI). The European commission proposed 1.11% of GNI, while Michel has almost split the difference with his 1.07% compromise plan.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a plan\u201d, said an EU diplomat from one of the self-styled frugal member states. \u201cPlan A is the 1% and the rebate. And we have a plan B which is 1% and the rebate.\u201d The \u201cfrugal four\u201d argue that while they are content to be net payers to the seven-year budget, the additional contributions being sought by Michel put an intolerable burden on their taxpayers. The Dutch estimate that the proposals put forward would increase their contribution by 20%.</p> <p>The battle threatens to be even more ferocious than that in 2013 when David Cameron helped force through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/08/eu-budget-austerity-first-time\">first-ever cut in the EU\u2019s budget</a>.

Gobsmacked.\u201d Sayeeda Warsi, the former chair of the Conservative party, wrote: \u201cAfter the appalling appointment of #Sabinsky &amp; the shameful lack of condemnation this week from No10 this performance felt like a necessary wake up call in the most provocative way.\u201d Two weeks ago at the Super Bowl, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira included caged children in their half-time performance to pass comment on Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy. Stephens said politically charged performances were being seen more regularly at awards shows as artists used them as a platform to express anger about issues that affect them. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a crop of artists who are emerging from a world where youth centres have been shut down as youth crime has risen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s the backdrop of the Windrush scandal and Grenfell. There\u2019s a lot of anger at the moment. I don\u2019t think this is a case of artists jumping on the bandwagon to get some time in the spotlight. This is genuinely how they feel.\u201d Patterson suggested overtly political performances had become more commonplace because acts had the security of huge social media followings that were loyal and not put off by negative press. \u201cThat pulling power is very important here, because these guys are not afraid to lose a fan or two who look at things on a basic level.\u201d Stephens said he was at the Brits the year Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys made a speech about the \u201cdeath of rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d, and said there was always \u201csome kind of fight\u201d playing out at awards shows. \u201cIt just so happens that the very real and imminent battle cannot be anything other than one of rebellion against what black culture considers to be a hostile government,\u201d he said.",

The Trinity protest was aimed at the plan to dig up farmland in Kirton, Suffolk, to build a mammoth lorry park, which would ruin three villages. This particular proposal has now been rejected.</p> <p>You also report on the need for better natural drains to protect against floods (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/17/uk-must-prepare-for-more-intense-storms-climate-scientists-say\" title=\"\">Better natural drains needed as storms get more intense, warn scientists</a>, 18 February). However, the main natural drain in Suffolk is precisely the farmland and marshland that Trinity is infamous for building on (the plan for a lorry park has now been replaced with plans for a de facto new town). Digging up green belt land and farmland is a flood risk. The water that used to be stored in the ground has to go somewhere. Suffolk was spared this time round, but last year had floods in areas adjacent to new-builds that had never flooded before. Other counties may not have been so lucky \u2013 there was building uphill just outside Tenbury Wells.</p> <p>Flooding isn\u2019t only about climate change. Concreting the countryside in the present reckless manner increases flood risks, and the consequences of those risks are seldom borne by the people doing the building, or by Trinity College.<br><strong>Dr Jon Mulberg</strong><br><em>Felixstowe, Suffolk</em></p> <p>\u2022 The environment secretary, George Eustice, insists the government has a \u201cfirm grip\u201d on the issue of flooding (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/18/pms-refusal-to-call-cobra-meeting-hampering-storm-recovery\" title=\"\">PM accused of hindering recovery from floods</a>, 19 February). Let\u2019s not confuse a \u201cfirm grip\u201d with a proper grip. It is entirely understandable that devastated local communities want local flood defences. But if the events of the last fortnight are to become \u201cthe new normal\u201d, we need leadership at the highest level to deliver a fully thought-through, integrated response to flooding at the large river catchment scale. The sticking-plaster solution of building more, and ever higher, flood defences (with the intergenerational commitment that this implies) runs the risk of efficiently channeling flood flows to weak points downstream and disconnecting rivers from their floodplains. It may be shocking to see vast expanses of muddy water from the air, but this is what rivers do \u2013 and must be allowed to do.<br><strong>Prof</strong><strong> Tom Spencer</strong><br><em>Department of geography, University of Cambridge</em></p> <p>\u2022 As scientists who have been studying the impact of burning on ecosystems in the British uplands, we would like to raise several issues in George Monbiot\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/11/flooding-moorland-river-calder-flooded-peatlands\" title=\"\">One way to cut flooding is to stop burning the moorland</a>, 12 February).</p> <p>\u201cThe burning of peatlands, research suggests, is likely to exacerbate floods downstream,\u201d he writes. This research is a single paper that forms part of the EMBER project \u2013 research that has been found to be flawed and unreliable. The study was not a randomised controlled trial \u2013 burnt and unburnt rivers were both located within different areas of moorland sites that were studied in the project. Consequently, we cannot be sure if the results presented are linked to burning or rather due to the environmental differences between the various sites. Furthermore, the study artificially increased the treatment-level sample size of streamflow measurements by 2,400%. This is known as pseudoreplication \u2013 a process that greatly increases the chance of finding a statistically significant effect and severely limits the generalisation of findings.</p> <p>Finally, Mr Monbiot cites a paper investigating the impact that the restoration of bare peat has on the downstream flood control potential of blanket bog.

      "bodyText": "There is a link between the Trinity College protest (Cambridge college lawn dug up by XR protesters, 18 February) and the flooding on which you also report. The Trinity protest was aimed at the plan to dig up farmland in Kirton, Suffolk, to build a mammoth lorry park, which would ruin three villages. This particular proposal has now been rejected. You also report on the need for better natural drains to protect against floods (Better natural drains needed as storms get more intense, warn scientists, 18 February). However, the main natural drain in Suffolk is precisely the farmland and marshland that Trinity is infamous for building on (the plan for a lorry park has now been replaced with plans for a de facto new town). Digging up green belt land and farmland is a flood risk. The water that used to be stored in the ground has to go somewhere. Suffolk was spared this time round, but last year had floods in areas adjacent to new-builds that had never flooded before. Other counties may not have been so lucky \u2013 there was building uphill just outside Tenbury Wells. Flooding isn\u2019t only about climate change. Concreting the countryside in the present reckless manner increases flood risks, and the consequences of those risks are seldom borne by the people doing the building, or by Trinity College. Dr Jon Mulberg Felixstowe, Suffolk \u2022 The environment secretary, George Eustice, insists the government has a \u201cfirm grip\u201d on the issue of flooding (PM accused of hindering recovery from floods, 19 February). Let\u2019s not confuse a \u201cfirm grip\u201d with a proper grip. It is entirely understandable that devastated local communities want local flood defences. But if the events of the last fortnight are to become \u201cthe new normal\u201d, we need leadership at the highest level to deliver a fully thought-through, integrated response to flooding at the large river catchment scale. The sticking-plaster solution of building more, and ever higher, flood defences (with the intergenerational commitment that this implies) runs the risk of efficiently channeling flood flows to weak points downstream and disconnecting rivers from their floodplains. It may be shocking to see vast expanses of muddy water from the air, but this is what rivers do \u2013 and must be allowed to do. Prof Tom Spencer Department of geography, University of Cambridge \u2022 As scientists who have been studying the impact of burning on ecosystems in the British uplands, we would like to raise several issues in George Monbiot\u2019s article (One way to cut flooding is to stop burning the moorland, 12 February). \u201cThe burning of peatlands, research suggests, is likely to exacerbate floods downstream,\u201d he writes. This research is a single paper that forms part of the EMBER project \u2013 research that has been found to be flawed and unreliable. The study was not a randomised controlled trial \u2013 burnt and unburnt rivers were both located within different areas of moorland sites that were studied in the project. Consequently, we cannot be sure if the results presented are linked to burning or rather due to the environmental differences between the various sites. Furthermore, the study artificially increased the treatment-level sample size of streamflow measurements by 2,400%. This is known as pseudoreplication \u2013 a process that greatly increases the chance of finding a statistically significant effect and severely limits the generalisation of findings. Finally, Mr Monbiot cites a paper investigating the impact that the restoration of bare peat has on the downstream flood control potential of blanket bog. However, this was conducted on a severely degraded area of bare peat and is, therefore, not a valid comparison to grouse moors. Thus, apart from the findings of a single flawed report, there is currently no clear link between burning on blanket bog and flooding downstream. More robust research is needed to guide land management and policy with respect to the effects of rotational burning on our uplands. Dr Mark Ashby Researcher, Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University Dr Andreas Heinemeyer Senior research fellow, Stockholm Environment Institute, University of York \u2022 George Monbiot berates land managers and government over recent floods, blaming them on what he sees as poor practice. The reality is that thousands of hectares of peatland have been restored on moorland across the UK, with many more such projects planned and all aiding the natural flood management he advocates. Moor owners and managers are evolving their practices so that they can play a full part in climate regulation, natural flood management and biodiversity. The whole of society is adjusting to the changes needed to deal with the climate emergency and biodiversity crisis, and results will not be seen overnight. However, rather than criticise, the Heather Trust takes a different approach. We work across sectors and interests to support the development of moorland management practices to ensure they deliver for these new and important agendas. Building consensus and common purpose does not grab headlines, but it does lead to lasting change. Anne Gray Director, The Heather Trust \u2022 I was very disappointed at the opinion expressed by George Monbiot in describing the vital role and work of our internal drainage boards (IDBs), who manage water when it reaches the lowest parts of our catchments. IDBs very much support better upper-catchment management and natural flood management measures to reduce run-off to lower parts of the catchment which they help manage. That management focuses on the correct balance of the needs of the environment, local economy and people, with added emphasis on reducing flood risk and carefully providing water to agricultural areas in times of its scarcity. Mr Monbiot claims that IDBs don\u2019t appear to be answerable to any government department. IDBs are defined as a risk management authority under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, and operate to governance rules set out in the Land Drainage Act (1991). Effectively acting as small local authorities, they are accountable bodies which undertake their flood risk management functions in line with England\u2019s national flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy, and are scrutinised by local authority committees, as well as reporting annually to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Yes, the predecessors of IDBs were originally formed by groups of landowners interested in managing water for their interests and benefit as far back as the 13th century, but today IDBs are highly efficient and democratic, operating for the wider public benefit of an area set out in legislation. Indeed, as a result of the work they carry out and their environmental stewardship of our water corridors, people are demanding that IDBs be allowed to increase their area of activities where other authorities are unable to justify looking after our rivers. Lower down the catchment, where there is the complex interface between people and economic activity, infrastructure, etc, our rivers and waterways need careful management using a variety of tools; IDBs are very well placed, skilled and equipped to do that.

      "bodyText": "Marcus Rashford\u2019s chances of playing for Manchester United again this season are \u201ctouch and go\u201d, according to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r who said the striker\u2019s back injury is more severe than first thought. It leaves Rashford\u2019s participation at Euro 2020 in major doubt. Rashford sustained a double stress fracture in the FA Cup win against Wolves in January, and Solskj\u00e6r was asked whether the 22-year-old\u2019s chances of featuring for United were rated 50-50. \u201cI would hope he\u2019s playing this season but it\u2019ll just be touch and go towards the end,\u201d the manager said in the lead\u2011up to the Europa League last\u201132 first leg at Club Brugge on Thursday. \u201cHopefully we can get through this tournament and prolong the season. It takes time. I\u2019m not a doctor but obviously I was hoping he would recover quicker. It actually looks like he\u2019s going to be out so another few months definitely.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r admitted the initial diagnosis proved errant. \u201cHe had a scan and it was maybe more severe, that fracture, than what we hoped and expected because he felt fine the few days before that. I\u2019ve never had anatomy in school so I didn\u2019t know it takes that time to recover but when he recovers and it heals he\u2019ll be stronger for it so it\u2019s important we won\u2019t rush him.

Plans include 18 tournaments per year, of 54 holes, and a team element. Discussion over the proposal has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/12/tiger-woods-premier-league-golf-ewan-murray\">dominated the start of this golfing year</a> and McIlroy, who was previously circumspect regarding it, used pre-tournament duties for the WGC Mexico Championship to issue a firm rebuttal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/18/patrick-reed-was-building-sandcastles-in-pga-tour-event-says-koepka\">Patrick Reed 'was building sandcastles' at Bahamas event, says Koepka</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe more I\u2019ve thought about it, the more I don\u2019t like it,\u201d said the world No 1. \u201cThe one thing as a professional golfer in my position that I value is the fact that I have autonomy and freedom over everything that I do. I pick and choose; this [week] is a perfect example. Some guys this week made the choice to not come to Mexico. If you go and play this other golf league, you\u2019re not going to have that choice.</p> <p>\u201cI read a thing the other day where it said if you take the money they can tell you what to do, so if you don\u2019t take the money, they can\u2019t tell you what to do. I think that\u2019s my thing, I\u2019ve never been one for being told what to do, and I like to have that autonomy and freedom over my career. I feel like I would give that up by going to play this other league.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, I\u2019m out. My position is I\u2019m against it until there may come a day that I can\u2019t be against it. If everyone else goes I might not have a choice, but at this point I don\u2019t like what they\u2019re proposing.\u201d</p> <p>Intriguingly, McIlroy also suggested the new domain will be of little interest to Tiger Woods. \u201cTiger is 44,\u201d the Northern Irishman said. \u201cHe\u2019s got two young kids. He openly said last week he wants to play 12 times a year, this league is proposing 18, so he\u2019s not going to do it.\u201d</p> <p>McIlroy did concede that top-level golf is \u201cvery split\u201d over the prospect.

      "bodyText": "Rory McIlroy has delivered what may well prove to be a fatal blow to plans for a breakaway golf tour by stating he has no interest in taking part. The Premier Golf League hoped to coax McIlroy and leading players away from the PGA and European tours with eye-watering sums of guaranteed cash \u2013 as linked in part to Saudi Arabia \u2013 and a model akin to Formula One. Plans include 18 tournaments per year, of 54 holes, and a team element. Discussion over the proposal has dominated the start of this golfing year and McIlroy, who was previously circumspect regarding it, used pre-tournament duties for the WGC Mexico Championship to issue a firm rebuttal. \u201cThe more I\u2019ve thought about it, the more I don\u2019t like it,\u201d said the world No 1. \u201cThe one thing as a professional golfer in my position that I value is the fact that I have autonomy and freedom over everything that I do. I pick and choose; this [week] is a perfect example. Some guys this week made the choice to not come to Mexico. If you go and play this other golf league, you\u2019re not going to have that choice. \u201cI read a thing the other day where it said if you take the money they can tell you what to do, so if you don\u2019t take the money, they can\u2019t tell you what to do. I think that\u2019s my thing, I\u2019ve never been one for being told what to do, and I like to have that autonomy and freedom over my career. I feel like I would give that up by going to play this other league. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m out. My position is I\u2019m against it until there may come a day that I can\u2019t be against it. If everyone else goes I might not have a choice, but at this point I don\u2019t like what they\u2019re proposing.\u201d Intriguingly, McIlroy also suggested the new domain will be of little interest to Tiger Woods. \u201cTiger is 44,\u201d the Northern Irishman said. \u201cHe\u2019s got two young kids. He openly said last week he wants to play 12 times a year, this league is proposing 18, so he\u2019s not going to do it.\u201d McIlroy did concede that top-level golf is \u201cvery split\u201d over the prospect. It is, however, likely his sentiment will strike a chord with some of his fellow competitors. Players and representatives have been in regular meetings, with more scheduled for next week during the Honda Classic. Phil Mickelson initially stated he was \u201cintrigued\u201d by the project before appearing to backtrack last week at the Genesis Invitational, where the left-hander said he was \u201cnot really ready to talk about\u201d his position. The Premier League had the ambitious goal of launching in 2022, decades on from Greg Norman failing with a similar scheme. Then, Arnold Palmer was a critic. \u201cMoney is cheap, money is the easy part,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be the driving factor. Look, for some people it is and we\u2019re professional golfers and we\u2019re out here playing golf to make a living, but at the end of the day I value my freedom and my autonomy over everything else. \u201cI would like to be on the right side of history with this one, just sort of as Arnold was with the whole Greg Norman thing in the \u201990s.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000.

Oxford Economics warned that the spread of the virus to regions outside Asia would knock 1.3% off global growth this year, the equivalent of $1.1tn in lost income. The consultancy said its model of the global economy showed the virus was already having a \u201cchilling effect\u201d as factory closures in China spilled over to neighbouring countries and major companies struggled to source components and finished goods from the far east. Apple told investors earlier this week that it would fail to meet its quarterly revenue target because of the \u201ctemporarily constrained\u201d supply of iPhones and a dramatic drop in Chinese spending during the virus crisis. Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, adding its voice to a chorus of companies complaining about supply problems, said it could run out of car parts at its British factories by the end of next week if the coronavirus continued to prevent parts arriving from China. Oxford Economics said it expected China\u2019s GDP growth to fall from 6% last year to 5.4% in 2020 following the spread of the virus so far. But if it spreads more widely in Asia, world GDP would fall by $400bn in 2020, or 0.5%. If the virus spreads beyond Asia and becomes a global pandemic, world GDP would drop $1.1tn, or 1.3% compared to the current projection. A $1.1tn decline would be the same as losing the entire annual output of Indonesia, the world\u2019s 16th largest economy. \u201cOur scenarios see world GDP hit as a result of declines in discretionary consumption and travel and tourism, with some knock-on financial market effects and weaker investment,\u201d it said. Rival consultancy Capital Economics said the situation in China was still developing and it remained unclear how long before the quarantine rules across much of China\u2019s central belt would lead to mass job layoffs and wage cuts becoming more widespread. It said 85% of larger stock market-listed firms had enough funds to meet their liabilities and wage bills formore than six months without any further revenue. But thousands of small and medium-sized businesses, which are responsible for half of urban jobs, \u201cmay not heed government orders not to shed jobs\u201d. A survey of 1,000 SMEs conducted by two Chinese universities found that unless conditions improved, one-third of the firms would run out of cash within a month, the consultancy said. Another survey of 700 companies found that 40% of private firms would run out of cash within three months. The firm\u2019s Asia analyst, Julian Evans Pritchard, said: \u201cOur best guess is that there is still a window of another week or so during which, if economic activity rebounds, the bulk of employees including at vulnerable SMEs would probably keep their jobs. \u201cAnd with large-scale layoffs avoided, consumer spending would bounce back quickly due to pent-up demand, which in turn would help the self-employed and family-run businesses to recoup much of their recent loss of income. \u201cBut with each day that the disruption drags on, the risk of a protracted slump in output rises.

Usually, it is both. Think about it: Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid. Karren Brady and Alan Sugar.

      "bodyText": "Female celebrities\u2019 most minor hair modifications often make headlines, but the fuss around Sharon Osbourne\u2019s new do gave me pause. After dyeing it a vibrant burgundy red once a week for 18 years, she is now the chic spitting image of The Devil Wears Prada\u2019s Miranda Priestly, pictured with a luminous white bob. Just a week before, Jane Fonda visited the same colourist for a stylish grey pixie cut for the Oscars. Osbourne had reportedly felt \u201cobligated\u201d to dye previously, according to colourist Jack Martin, due to her role as a host on a US chatshow, The Talk. How little we see grey and white hair on primetime television \u2013 on women at least. This is either because they are much younger than the men they host with or dyeing to appear so. Usually, it is both. Think about it: Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid. Karren Brady and Alan Sugar. I have never seen a hint of grey on a female X Factor judge, but Louis Walsh has had white hair since it began in 2004. The Great British Bake Off seems to be one of the few places where silver manes among the judges are not gendered. Unlike the gradual greying we celebrate in \u201csilver foxes\u201d such as Jeff Goldblum or Steve Carrell, many famous older women suddenly stop dyeing after a long-coming \u201csod it\u201d moment. Jamie Lee Curtis said she abruptly quit after wondering: \u201cWhat the eff am I doing putting a chemical on my head that burns?\u201d Osbourne\u2019s decision was unlikely to have been taken lightly; the academic Mary Beard fronted an entire Radio 4 documentary called Glad to be Grey, in which she spoke of the backlash she receives for daring not to dye while on TV. In 2012, Fiona Bruce said she doesn\u2019t let her grey hairs show when reading the news; eight years later, it is still the case. Much of the hubbub surrounding Keanu Reeves\u2019s \u201cage-appropriate\u201d girlfriend was undoubtedly down to her hair colour. She is eight years younger than him, but far greyer. Society makes the odd allowance, for majestic actors such as Helen Mirren and Judi Dench or elegant, older models in high fashion campaigns such as Carmen Dell\u2019Orefice or Iris Apfel. Cara Delevingne, Rihanna and Lady Gaga have all sported #grannyhair too, a look that once dominated Pinterest and Instagram: because a shock of silver is celebrated when it is on someone so young it\u2019s unlikely it\u2019s natural.

Ahmed said the staff shortages had been 10 years coming and the issue was not Brexit-related. \u201cI can understand why the government is using Brexit as a lever on immigration but it would be better if they talked about providing staff in the care sector in the short, medium and long term, rather than ruling them out completely,\u201d she said. The migration advisory committee report that informed the government\u2019s immigration policy noted that the social care sector was \u201cstruggling to recruit and retain workers\u201d but cited a \u201cfailure to offer competitive terms\u201d. It said its view was that low pay was not an immigration issue despite argument for special treatment for a sector that was perceived as \u201clower paid but higher value\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "As an Australian working abroad, Cate Blanchett never found it easy talking about her home government \u2013 in particular, the trauma it has inflicted on asylum seekers in need. \u201cThey knew nothing about the Tamils on the roof, nothing about children sewing their lips together [in detention centres],\u201d Blanchett says of her American friends. \u201cThey would actually start with nervous laughter because they thought I was exaggerating.\u201d We meet in Adelaide in 2019, where she is filming scenes for the upcoming series Stateless. Premiering next week at Berlinale before landing on the ABC on 1 March, the six-episode show \u2013 co-created by Blanchett, Tony Ayres and Elise McCredie \u2013 takes a deep dive into Australia\u2019s controversial immigration policies. \u201cThere\u2019s a profound anxiety about where we\u2019re all heading and the erosion of empathy and, of course, that\u2019s the space where the drama takes place,\u201d Blanchett says, during an interview with all three co-creators. \u201cNone of us are interested in preaching to the converted.\u201d When I meet Blanchett she looks the epitome of geek chic: a navy shirt flecked with tiny white stars, tucked into cropped jeans; a mannish blue pinstripe blazer, oversized trainers and chunky glasses. She is thoughtful and intellectual, with a willingness to examine ideas. She asks as many questions as she answers. Blanchett explains that inspiration for the TV show \u2013 in which she stars alongside other heavy-hitters including Dominic West (The Wire), Yvonne Strahovski (The Handmaid\u2019s Tale) and Jai Courtney (Suicide Squad) \u2013 was the story of Cornelia Rau. That story was well-reported at the time. In 2004, Rau was sedated, put in restraints and transported against her will to South Australia\u2019s Baxter detention centre. Authorities suspected she was an illegal immigrant; in fact, Rau was a German citizen and Australian permanent resident who suffered from a mental illness. It was only four months later, after her family, who had reported her missing, recognised her in the media, that she was finally granted her freedom. In Stateless, Strahovski plays Sofie, a German-Australian air hostess who is also mentally ill. The show spans everything from Sofie\u2019s time in a cult to her breakdown and unlawful imprisonment. Rau\u2019s story is \u201cso rich and so complicated and so painful and so unlikely and so surprising and bewildering that you could make a series in itself\u201d, explains Blanchett. But, she adds, \u201cthere were so many things we wanted to talk about\u201d. Stateless is smart, intelligent viewing \u2013 less a star vehicle and more a detailed character study on the psychological repercussions for four characters who all end up, in one way or another, inside a barren, soulless detention centre in the dusty South Australian desert. They include Ameer (Fayssal Bazzi), an Afghan asylum seeker trying to escape the Taliban with his family; Cam (Courtney), a working-class father of two who attempts to carve a better life for himself by becoming a guard; and Clare (Asher Keddie), an ambitious, hard-nosed bureaucrat from Canberra who is under pressure to sort out a PR mess as human rights abuses are leaked to the press. Other moments are also eerily reminiscent of real life: from the tragic sinking of an asylum seeker boat bound for Christmas Island in 2011 (which left one teenage survivor without a mother or sister) to three Iranian asylum seekers who protested on the roof at Baxter after having been detained for four years. It is Sofie, however, played with eye-wincing rawness by Strahovski, who becomes the series\u2019 Trojan horse. As co-creator and writer Elise McCredie explains: \u201cShe leads us into this world \u2026 We\u2019re opening the door through Sofie\u2019s eyes.\u201d Set in the early 2000s, when Australia started its policy of turning back refugee boats, Stateless is pinned together by the question of identity. The act of seeking asylum, insists McCredie, \u201cReally interrogates who you are. People in long-term detention, their identity gets stripped away.\u201d Madness becomes a theme, too, as many of the characters begin to lose their grip on reality. As Blanchett sees it, madness also extends to the systems of government and institutionalisation that have taken hold of Australia and beyond. \u201cYou\u2019re living in a system that has gone mad,\u201d she declares, leaning forward intently to plead her case. \u201cThe absurdity of what is going on in these institutions! In the prison system, the mental health system, in the detention centres!\u201d Adding an extra layer to the drama \u2013 and drawing out these threads of madness and identity \u2013 is Gopa, a cult Sofie is drawn to early in the series. It resembles a real sect in which Rau became entangled: Kenja, created by Jan Hamilton, an actress, and Ken Dyers, a world war two veteran, who offered two-way meditations for cash. (Dyers was later charged with sexual offences against four underage girls.) In Stateless, Gopa is led by a husband-wife team, performed by West and Blanchett, who promise transformation through song, dance and sinister one-on-one healing sessions, which have a dark sexual undertone. For Blanchett the idea of a cult becomes \u201ca metaphor for people who are seeking change so they\u2019re at a profound point of vulnerability\u201d. \u201cThey enter a cult to find self-realisation and they emerge in pieces. That becomes a wonderful metaphor for how dislocated the political system is from the people they\u2019re meant to serve.\u201d West plays Gordon a man, as he puts it, of the \u201cmost astonishing mediocrity\u201d who nonetheless manages, through a combination of cheesy empowering talk and bullying malice, to get rich and get kicks, all the while controlling his charges. Gordon is also fond of pastel slacks and blow-dried hair. \u201cIt\u2019s been really fun doing it, especially with Cate, because we wear the most appalling clothes,\u201d riffs West, slouched on a chair in Adelaide with one leg propped up on a sofa, his shirt unbuttoned. \u201cBut actually the scenes that I do are deeply distressing.\u201d West had never heard about Australia\u2019s immigration policies before taking on the role. \u201cMost people in the UK assume Australia is quite enlightened and progressive about everything and also that it has a lot of space and, like many countries, is based on immigrants and is pretty welcoming to them \u2013 so it\u2019s shocking to read about what is happening on offshore detention centres,\u201d the British actor says. The issues, he adds, \u201caren\u2019t really being talked about except in very simplistic terms. People are being duped into thinking it\u2019s an easy political football, an easy political point to be scored against refugees\u201d. Stateless, its creators hope, will succeed where news reporting often fails: by gripping the public and holding their attention. And through displaying abuses through the eyes of Sofie \u2013 a blonde, blue-eyed Aussie who comes from a nice suburban home \u2013 Stateless seeks to show this is a story that doesn\u2019t affect the \u201cother\u201d but all of us. Or, as an asylum seeker puts it to Sofie in the detention centre: \u201cThey will want to know why someone who looks just like them is trapped in a place like this. You could be our voice. The face of our suffering.\u201d \u2022 Stateless premieres at Berlinale on 26 February before debuting on the ABC on 1 March. \u2022 This article was changed 21 February to clarify the context of a quote used in the headline.",

The Hope Unlimited Church, largely based on the New South Wales Central Coast, was awarded an $8,580 grant in November to upgrade its auditorium with soundproof acoustic panels and a new partition wall. The grant was delivered through the federal government\u2019s Stronger Communities scheme, which gives local politicians significant power in shaping who can receive money. Hope Unlimited Church is led by Mark and Darlene Zschech, a prominent Christian singer who previously worked alongside Hillsong\u2019s Brian Houston. Darlene Zschech has previously described Wicks, the MP for Robertson, as a \u201cdear friend\u201d. Wicks has attended Hope Unlimited Church on multiple occasions, speaking on stage during a 2015 event and praising the church in parliament following a subsequent visit in 2017, saying it was \u201crun by two incredible people, Mark and Darlene Zschech\u201d. Wicks has strongly denied any suggestion of a conflict between her position as the local MP, her links to Zschech and her role in the grants process. Wicks said she was not a member of the church and that her relationship with Darlene Zschech was \u201cpurely professional\u201d and within her remit as the local MP. She said she had visited many churches in her electorate and such visits were \u201cusually at the request of a church for their special events\u201d. \u201cI can confirm at the time Hope Unlimited Church applied for the grant there was no conflict of interest,\u201d Wicks told the Guardian. \u201cI was not and am not currently a member of Hope UC.

But the case again highlights the potential dangers of politicising grants schemes, an issue brought to the fore by Bridget McKenzie\u2019s sports rorts saga. A statement from Mark and Darlene Zschech said the church had no contact with Wicks about the grant application. They said the grant application was made after seeing advertising on social media. \u201cLucy Wicks MP has attended HopeUC from time to time for special events by invitation and is welcome anytime, as is any Member of Parliament where we would enjoy praying for them,\u201d their statement said. Darlene Zschech said the \u201cdear friend\u201d reference to Wicks was simply an \u201cexpression of my gratitude for a person and their service to our community\u201d. The Stronger Communities program has rules designed to address any potential conflict of interest, including any \u201cprofessional, commercial or personal relationship with a party who is able to influence the application selection process\u201d. Local MPs are obliged to declare any potential conflicts, as are applicants. The broader grant process also gives significant power to MPs. Organisations wanting a grant must have a formal invite from the local MP to be eligible. Those without an invite are shut out of the process. Politicians identify applicants and set up community consultative committees to consider their merits, before applications are assessed by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, the administering body.

      "bodyText": "Tony Abbott was asked to consider registering as an agent of foreign influence for speaking at a conference organised by the Hungarian government, at which he gave a controversial speech on migration and praised the country\u2019s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The revelation is contained in documents released under freedom of information laws after the Institute of Public Affairs investigated why Abbott was also asked to register under the foreign influence transparency scheme for an address to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). The documents reveal Abbott\u2019s office was in discussion about the possible need to register for months and missed a self-imposed deadline to sign up to the register for foreign entities and their agents to declare when they are seeking to influence Australian politics. An aide told the Attorney General\u2019s Department on 22 October that the former prime minister was \u201chappy to register if [CPAC] is found to be a registerable event\u201d despite later complaining publicly the suggestion he do so was \u201cabsurd\u201d. The first CPAC Australia conference, held in August, boasted Abbott, Liberal senator Amanda Stoker, former deputy prime minister John Anderson and Liberal candidates Warren Mundine and Jacinta Price among its speakers. Founded by the American Conservative Union, the conference is closely affiliated with the US Republican party and is set to become a regular feature of the Australian political landscape with plans for another conference in August. The documents reveal the attorney general\u2019s office was informed in August about the organisers of CPAC, LibertyWorks, being contacted about their obligations. They were told that five speakers might need to register as a result of their participation at the conference, including Abbott. Talking points drafted by the Department for the Attorney General on 2 August suggest that, if asked, Christian Porter might reply that his department \u201chas written to the president of LibertyWorks, Mr Andrew Cooper\u201d drawing his attention to the scheme and seeking his cooperation \u201cto ensure those speaking at the conference are also aware of the obligations imposed by the scheme\u201d. The documents suggest that after the 9 August conference, registrations \u201cshould have been lodged\u201d within a fortnight. Multiple emails and file notes indicate that on 30 August Abbott\u2019s office promised the attorney general\u2019s department he would complete a registration \u201cshortly\u201d. One email recorded that an Abbott staffer had verbally advised that Abbott was on leave for a week and \u201ca registration would be completed on Mr Abbott\u2019s return with respect to CPAC\u201d. Lucinda Atkinson, the assistant secretary of the department\u2019s transparency frameworks section, wrote to Abbott on 15 October noting it had \u201cnot yet received your registration\u201d. \u201cI also seek your cooperation to consider whether you may have further registration obligations in relation to activities you have undertaken subsequently, including your address to the Budapest Demographic Summit in early September, a forum which we understand was hosted by the Hungarian government.\u201d In that speech Abbott praised Orb\u00e1n, warned about \u201cmilitary age\u201d male immigrants \u201cswarming\u201d Europe and accused the left of attempting to undermine western society with migration and the \u201cclimate cult\u201d. LibertyWorks disputed the need to register, arguing there was no input from the US government in the CPAC conference, resulting in a further email on 22 October in which a public servant noted it was \u201creasonable\u201d of Abbott to hold off until the issue was resolved and proposing the department follow up in a month. \u201c[Redacted] indicated he [Abbott] would be happy to register if it is found to be a registerable event,\u201d it said. On 2 November, the Australian reported that Tony Abbott and LibertyWorks had been asked to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d which Abbott labelled \u201cabsurd\u201d and had reportedly \u201cangered\u201d Porter. \u201cI have made it clear to my department that I expect it to demonstrate a focus on the most serious instances of noncompliance,\u201d Porter reportedly said. In January, the Liberal senator James Paterson claimed Labor\u2019s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, had encouraged the department to investigate CPAC. The documents show that on 22 July Dreyfus had \u201cqueried the application of the scheme to foreign political organisations holding events in Australia\u201d. \u201cHe specifically raised the upcoming [CPAC event] \u2026 as an example of an event that may trigger registration obligations under the scheme and asked what the department planned to do about it\u201d.",

Through 2017 and 2018 annual wages growth kept improving \u2013 incredibly slowly, but improving nonetheless. But now we have had four consecutive quarters where annual private sector wages growth has fallen: The current annual growth of 2.2% is the worst since June 2018. It means the government\u2019s prediction in the December mid-year economic and fiscal outlook for a growth rate of 2.5% by June is in a fair bit of trouble: That of course should not be a shock \u2013 the history of the recent budgets is predictions of strong wage growth that failed to occur: And worse, the disappointment is happening across the economy.

The best thing you can say is that wages are at least growing faster than inflation. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean real wages are growing, let alone real household incomes, because we need to factor in taxation and government payments, but at least it is some good news: The problem is that it is only occurring because inflation growth is woeful \u2013 and well below the long-term Reserve Bank target of between 2% and 3%. This era of low wages and inflation growth is one where workers are much less confident about their employment situation. This is something the shadow assistant minister for treasury and charities, Andrew Leigh, noted in a speech he gave on Wednesday to the John Cain Foundation. He noted that over the past decade workers were much less likely than before to switch jobs. And because most people switch jobs for better pay and conditions, this desire to stay put and hold on to what you have is a major factor in lower wages. Not only are people choosing more hours over higher wages, they are choosing to stay in their job rather than risk going elsewhere.

To reach 2.5% wages growth we would now need unemployment to fall to around 4.7%, and to reach the 3% that the government hopes will occur by June 2023, it would need to fall to 3%. Given the government predicts the unemployment rate to remain at 5% out till 2023, it is rather tough to work out just how wages are going to grow faster than they are now.

In 2018 Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory faired marginally better. In 2017 it was Brisbane Roar, Western Sydney Wanderers and Adelaide United who all fell at the group stage. With clubs either de-prioritising the continental competition or increasingly unequipped to prosper in it, it\u2019s a cautionary tale of club-level narrow-mindedness and league-wide lack of foresight. The kind of situation that Postecoglou railed against in 2017 and begged administrators to heed. And yet the gulf between Asia\u2019s pedigree clubs and its also-rans has only exacerbated across the past four seasons. Between 2015-2020 Chinese clubs spent an eye-watering $1.54bn on player transfers (and that\u2019s merely those for which fees have been disclosed). Clubs in the Saudi Pro League threw out at least $337m, the UAE Gulf League $157m and the Qatari Stars League $100m. Such flagrant spending could, and should never, be emulated by Australian clubs \u2013 but it shows the scale of investment circulating rival leagues across Asia \u2013 investment that Australian clubs and players are increasingly peripheral to as the men\u2019s domestic league withers back towards regional obscurity. If the success of the A-League is the chief revenue driver of the game domestically, then success in Asia has to be a top priority for A-League clubs. In addition to $1.5m prize money following their 2014 triumph, Wanderers sold two players for over $1.3m each to Asian rivals eager to emulate their success. It was income equivalent to the entire salary allowance for clubs from Football Federation Australia. Across the past four years Korean clubs have attracted over six times the transfer fees of Australian clubs, with much being reinvested into youth academies, training infrastructure or sport science departments. Half a decade ago, Postecoglou asked Australian football to dare to believe in itself, to have the courage to compete \u2013 to challenge its existing parameters and think outside the box. Australian football didn\u2019t listen then \u2013 it cannot afford to do so a second time. Competition in Asian football\u2019s preeminent club competition is not a birthright, it is something earned. And on the past four year\u2019s performances, that could soon be taken away.",

Guardian Australia can reveal that in October the deputy prime minister joined Drum to meet the Murchison Community Action Group, in Drum\u2019s Victorian seat of Nicholls, and promised community members the DP Jones centre would be kept open with federal government assistance. While a spokesman for the deputy prime minister said \u201cno commitments were made\u201d by the deputy prime minister during the 31 October meeting, this was disputed by multiple sources present at the meeting. A month after the meeting, the government paid administrators of the home a $400,000 grant over a three-month period. Following the undertaking, Drum also told the community the centre was \u201cstaying open, end of story\u201d, but last week it closed after the administrators were unable to secure a takeover. Warwick Gregory, the chair of the Murchison Community Action Group who was in the meeting with McCormack, said the community had been \u201cdevastated\u201d that the commitment had not been fulfilled. \u201cYou take a man for his word, that\u2019s the old country saying, isn\u2019t it? It might be different in the city, but if you say you are going to do something in the country, you do it,\u201d Gregory told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe are devastated \u2013 it rips the guts out of the town.\u201d The involvement of McCormack in the centre\u2019s fate comes as the Nationals leader fends off internal criticism about his leadership style following a spill against him earlier this month aimed at restoring Barnaby Joyce to the role. Drum is seen as a key ally of McCormack and was offered the position of deputy speaker following a reshuffle of Nationals\u2019 positions in the aftermath. However, he missed out after Labor successfully nominated renegade MP Llew O\u2019Brien \u2013 one of McCormack\u2019s chief critics \u2013 for the role. In a further sign of the political sensitivity surrounding the centre\u2019s closure, Drum has conducted negotiations with another operator, Honeysuckle Regional Health, to try to keep the centre open. Honeysuckle had submitted a formal expression of interest to the administrator about taking over the centre but was knocked back because it was dependent on government funding and not seen as financially viable. Despite this, following discussions and an in-principle agreement between the Honeysuckle chief executive, Barry Hobbs, and Drum, Hobbs attended the centre last week to try to keep it open. This led to the court-appointed administrators refusing him access to the site given the centre is now being liquidated according to the requirements of the Corporations Act. Hobbs said he had been hopeful that \u201cwhen the paperwork was completed\u201d with the federal government for further funding, the centre could remain open under his company\u2019s operation. \u201cI turned up on the Monday when the facility was closing to see if we could keep it open, but the liquidator took control and said no,\u201d Hobbs told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt was my understanding that the federal government would be able to stop [the closure] through my conversations with the federal government before I went down there.\u201d Asked who he had been negotiating with, Hobbs said: \u201cI was going through Drum, but he was going to the department.\u201d Minister for aged care Richard Colbeck has said discussions with \u201cpotential future operators\u201d for the centre were continuing, while Drum has said he is still working on trying to save the centre. Gregory said the decision was now in the hands of the department, describing the situation as a \u201cterrible mess\u201d. \u201cIt is now up to the department; the politicians can only do a certain amount.\u201d A spokesperson for McCormack confirmed that McCormack had attended the meeting, but denied he had made a commitment to keep the centre open. \u201cWhile no commitments were made by the deputy prime minister, the federal government is working with the administrator to find an alternative provider for the facility.\u201d As reported by Guardian Australia, the Department of Health has told the Senate the decision to provide financial assistance to the Murchison centre was made by the government, not the department. \u201cThis was a decision of government.

You see this kind of thing in Andaluc\u00eda and in Castilla-La Mancha and Castilla y Le\u00f3n, but not really in Madrid.\u201d He said the ceiling would probably have been plastered over as protection against the plague. \u201cIt would have been covered up during one of the European pandemics,\u201d De la Vega said. \u201cA lot of sick people were brought into churches and people thought that the disease wouldn\u2019t spread if you covered everything and whitewashed everything. That happened in a lot of churches and what was underneath was forgotten for centuries.\u201d His team also uncovered and restored a long-lost window that lets in the sun, and a decorative layer of shields and other motifs that runs beneath the ceiling. They, however, are not the only treasures of the church, the oldest section of which dates back to the late 15th century. Another carved wooden ceiling, albeit rather simpler, remains buried in plaster over the nave. \u201cThis church is just a jewel,\u201d said the architect. \u201cThis is the only complete, surviving example of a latticework wooden ceiling over both the altar and the nave in Madrid.\u201d The artistry, he added, is testament to Canillejas\u2019 geographical importance. These days, the neighbourhood is best known as the barrio of El Yiyo, the matador fatally gored in 1985 [paywall], and as a meeting place for thirsty football fans on their way to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Wanda Metropolitano stadium. But it was also once a village halfway along the road from the city of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares to Madrid, making it a place where important people would break the journey \u2013 among them St Teresa of \u00c1vila. Marta Rivera de la Cruz, Madrid\u2019s regional culture minister, visited the church on Wednesday, declared it \u201ca 16th century jewel\u201d, and said she hoped the restoration would bring in visitors from other parts of the area and beyond. According to Jos\u00e9 Crespo, the current parish priest, word has already got out. For the past few months, visitors from across Spain and overseas have been descending on the church, keen to see it famous ceiling. After decades of anonymity, Canillejas is creeping back on to the map. Father Jos\u00e9 welcomes the visitors \u2013 as do his proud parishioners. Few, however, can compare with the nun and mystic who is thought to have stopped into the church on more than one occasion. \u201cSt Teresa was here,\u201d said the priest. \u201cWhat really moves me is that she was here and she would have seen this same ceiling we\u2019re seeing today.\u201d",

It is feared she may be the sixth person to die in Storm Dennis over the last five days.</p> <p>The landslide on Sunday took place at Tylorstown, in the Rhondda Valley, 10 miles from Aberfan where 116 children died in the 1966 disaster. Ben Curtis, a local mining historian, said the Tylorstown incident \u201cevokes memories\u201d of Aberfan.</p> <p>\u201cThe Aberfan disaster was such an unspeakably horrific thing that cast a deep shadow over popular memory in the area,\u201d he said. \u201cSo whenever we see anything like this, which is distressing in itself, it evokes images of Aberfan.\u201d</p> <p>Cliff Durham, a former miner, watched the Tylorstown landslide as it happened on Sunday. He said: \u201cAs soon as I saw this, I thought of Aberfan straight away. Believe me, you don\u2019t want to see that again.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s tonnes and tonnes of coal still around. The authorities should drill it so the water could go down but they can\u2019t leave it like that. They\u2019ve got to take it away because it could come again.\u201d</p> <p>Lisa Pinney, the chief executive of the Coal Authority, said inspections were being carried out to keep communities safe. She said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any major issues at any of these sites but we are ensuring that all drainage channels and trash screens are free from debris so they perform as they should.\u201d</p> <p>Another downpour is expected in south Wales and five flood warnings are in place across the region.</p> <p>The leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, Andrew Morgan, said 800 homes had been hit in his area. He said: \u201cWe have to consider homelessness because some houses will not be able to be lived in for some time.\u201d</p> <p>The Welsh government has promised \u00a310m for councils to spend on flood relief, but Morgan said the bill was likely to be higher. \u201cThat \u00a310m is the initial amount for householders and businesses and we have released \u00a31m from our own reserves.

      "bodyText": "The effects of Storm Dennis could set off another Aberfan-style disaster, experts have warned, as former coal tips in the Welsh valleys undergo emergency inspections before further flooding is expected. More than 20 tips are being checked after a landslide at a former tip site in south Wales. Across some areas of Britain, a month\u2019s worth of rain is predicted to fall over the next 24 hours, the Environment Agency has said. In Devon, meanwhile, concerns are growing for an elderly woman who is thought to have fallen into the flooded River Exe at Tiverton on Monday morning. It is feared she may be the sixth person to die in Storm Dennis over the last five days. The landslide on Sunday took place at Tylorstown, in the Rhondda Valley, 10 miles from Aberfan where 116 children died in the 1966 disaster. Ben Curtis, a local mining historian, said the Tylorstown incident \u201cevokes memories\u201d of Aberfan. \u201cThe Aberfan disaster was such an unspeakably horrific thing that cast a deep shadow over popular memory in the area,\u201d he said. \u201cSo whenever we see anything like this, which is distressing in itself, it evokes images of Aberfan.\u201d Cliff Durham, a former miner, watched the Tylorstown landslide as it happened on Sunday. He said: \u201cAs soon as I saw this, I thought of Aberfan straight away. Believe me, you don\u2019t want to see that again. \u201cThere\u2019s tonnes and tonnes of coal still around. The authorities should drill it so the water could go down but they can\u2019t leave it like that. They\u2019ve got to take it away because it could come again.\u201d Lisa Pinney, the chief executive of the Coal Authority, said inspections were being carried out to keep communities safe. She said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any major issues at any of these sites but we are ensuring that all drainage channels and trash screens are free from debris so they perform as they should.\u201d Another downpour is expected in south Wales and five flood warnings are in place across the region. The leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, Andrew Morgan, said 800 homes had been hit in his area. He said: \u201cWe have to consider homelessness because some houses will not be able to be lived in for some time.\u201d The Welsh government has promised \u00a310m for councils to spend on flood relief, but Morgan said the bill was likely to be higher. \u201cThat \u00a310m is the initial amount for householders and businesses and we have released \u00a31m from our own reserves. No doubt we will have to release more in the coming weeks. But the repair bill is going to run into millions and millions of pounds.\u201d In Monmouth, south Wales, utilities officials have delivered 40 tankers of water after a treatment centre was washed out by rain and residents were told to ration their use. Dwr Cymru Welsh Water said: \u201cReducing water use now will ensure that we can restore full supplies as quickly as possible once we can access our site.\u201d In Devon, emergency services were carrying out searches for Jean Disney, 87, who was last seen in Tiverton around 3am on Monday. Urging the public to stay away from areas adjacent to the river, a Devon and Cornwall police spokesman said: \u201cThese searches are currently confined to the River Exe, as evidence at this time has strongly indicated that Jean fell into the water in the early hours of Monday.\u201d Transport for Wales said heavy rain over the coming days could affect rugby fans travelling to Cardiff for Saturday\u2019s Wales v France match in the Six Nations.

Or the vast and so far vague spending pledges associated with \u201clevelling up\u201d of the regions, which the Financial Times says may be practically impossible. Let\u2019s not even get into the lunacy of the Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge. Those of us who have been around government since the Blair years understand why the state has tried so hard to make the civil service more diverse, and why the civil service needs a diverse cabinet: to counteract the deadly groupthink that usually prefigures major policy disasters. It\u2019s no accident that a sudden centralisation of power has taken place almost immediately after a narrowing of cabinet diversity. No administration is immune to groupthink. But the current one seems intent on political conformity. Civil servants across Whitehall have been chilled by the symbolism of the reshuffle, which sent a clear message that anyone who dared criticise or query the progress of Johnson\u2019s government had no place at the top table. Meanwhile, Cummings\u2019 plan to hire legions of disruptive geniuses, weirdos and data wonks to transform the delivery of the \u201cpeople\u2019s priorities\u201d has resulted in the hiring of Andrew Sabisky, an adviser with an interest in pseudo-scientific theories that have become fashionable among certain parts of the right. It\u2019s true that we need fresh talent. But what good will a dazzling new cohort of advisers do if they are working in a culture that makes poor use of the talent already there? Or if they\u2019re scared of being sacked? Or if the government can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) distinguish between crackerjacks and crackpots? As always, the civil service must be ready to work with any minister sent our way. But a combative and ideologically conformist approach is spreading fear in Whitehall \u2013 and may eventually derail this government\u2019s towering ambitions. \u2022 The civil servant works in a Whitehall department and was part of Operation Yellowhammer",

Clijsters had no reason to expect anything more after so long but she left the court seething at her mistakes. Her marathon has begun.",

There were also doubts about what share of fossil methane was naturally released and what share was from industry.</p> \n<p>Earlier estimates were based on intermittent, bottom-up monitoring of oil and gas companies and comparisons with geological evidence from the end of the Pleistocene epoch, about 11,600 years ago.</p> \n<p>For a more accurate comparison, a team at the University of Rochester in the US examined levels of methane in the pre-industrial era about 300 years ago. This was achieved by analysing air from that period trapped in glaciers in Greenland. The sample \u2013 made up of about a tonne of ice \u2013 was extracted with a <a href=\"https://icedrill.org/equipment/blue-ice-drill\">Blue Ice Drill</a>, capable of producing the world\u2019s biggest ice cores.</p> \n<p>The findings, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1991-8\">published</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1991-8\"> in Nature</a>, suggest the share of naturally released fossil methane has been overestimated by \u201can order of magnitude\u201d, which means that human activities are 25-40% more responsible for fossil methane in the atmosphere than thought.</p> \n<p>This strengthens suspicions that fossil fuel companies are not fully accounting for their impact on the climate, particularly with regard to methane \u2013 a colourless, odourless gas that many plants routinely vent into the atmosphere.</p> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6398/186\">earlier study</a> revealed methane emissions from US oil and gas plants were 60% higher than reported to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> \n<p>Accidents are also underreported. A single blowout at a natural gas well in Ohio in 2018 discharged more methane over three weeks than the oil and gas industries of France, Norway and the Netherlands released in an entire year. At the time, the company said it was unsure of the size of the leak. The immense scale was only revealed a year later when <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/52/26376\">scientists analysed satellite data</a> provided by the European Space Agency.</p> \n<p>Fracking also appears to have <a href=\"https://www.desmogblog.com/2019/12/22/methane-leaks-venting-blowouts-fracking-climate-change\">worsened the problem</a>. Atmospheric methane had started to flatten off at the turn of the century, but rose again after a surge in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/17/activists-warn-of-fracking-by-stealth-and-call-for-acid-fracking-ban\">fracking activity</a> in the US and elsewhere. The industry, however, continues to claim that the energy source can be used as a \u201cbridge fuel\u201d because it has lower carbon emissions than oil or coal, but this fails to account for leaks and flares of methane and other gases during extraction.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ca4c21ae-11f5-49e2-8a71-643d1aec7156\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to \u201cavoid dangerous climate change\u201d, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way.

In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time&nbsp;to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster.

      "bodyText": "The oil and gas industry has had a far worse impact on the climate than previously believed, according to a study indicating that human emissions of fossil methane have been underestimated by up to 40%. Although the research will add to pressure on fossil fuel companies, scientists said there was cause for hope because it showed a big extra benefit could come from tighter regulation of the industry and a faster shift towards renewable energy. Methane has a greenhouse effect that is about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and is responsible for at least 25% of global heating, according to the UN Environment Programme. In the past two centuries, the amount of methane in the atmosphere has more than doubled, though there has long been uncertainty about whether the source was biological \u2013 from agriculture, livestock or landfills \u2013 or from fossil fuels. There were also doubts about what share of fossil methane was naturally released and what share was from industry. Earlier estimates were based on intermittent, bottom-up monitoring of oil and gas companies and comparisons with geological evidence from the end of the Pleistocene epoch, about 11,600 years ago. For a more accurate comparison, a team at the University of Rochester in the US examined levels of methane in the pre-industrial era about 300 years ago. This was achieved by analysing air from that period trapped in glaciers in Greenland. The sample \u2013 made up of about a tonne of ice \u2013 was extracted with a Blue Ice Drill, capable of producing the world\u2019s biggest ice cores. The findings, published in Nature, suggest the share of naturally released fossil methane has been overestimated by \u201can order of magnitude\u201d, which means that human activities are 25-40% more responsible for fossil methane in the atmosphere than thought. This strengthens suspicions that fossil fuel companies are not fully accounting for their impact on the climate, particularly with regard to methane \u2013 a colourless, odourless gas that many plants routinely vent into the atmosphere. An earlier study revealed methane emissions from US oil and gas plants were 60% higher than reported to the Environmental Protection Agency. Accidents are also underreported. A single blowout at a natural gas well in Ohio in 2018 discharged more methane over three weeks than the oil and gas industries of France, Norway and the Netherlands released in an entire year. At the time, the company said it was unsure of the size of the leak. The immense scale was only revealed a year later when scientists analysed satellite data provided by the European Space Agency. Fracking also appears to have worsened the problem. Atmospheric methane had started to flatten off at the turn of the century, but rose again after a surge in fracking activity in the US and elsewhere. The industry, however, continues to claim that the energy source can be used as a \u201cbridge fuel\u201d because it has lower carbon emissions than oil or coal, but this fails to account for leaks and flares of methane and other gases during extraction. Growing calls for tighter controls will be strengthened by the new study. The lead author, Benjamin Hmiel, said the paper was cause for optimism because it showed that action on methane \u2013 which has a relatively short shelf life, persisting in the atmosphere for about nine years \u2013 could give a strong short-term boost to efforts to stabilise the climate. \u201cPlacing stricter methane emission regulations on the fossil fuel industry will have the potential to reduce future global warming to a larger extent than previously thought,\u201d Hmiel said. \u201cMethane is important to study because if we make changes to our current methane emissions, it\u2019s going to reflect more quickly.\u201d Other scientists who were not involved in the research concurred there were positive implications in the findings, but only if governments were able to rein in fossil fuel companies, which has not been the case until now. \u201cThis indicates that the fossil fuel sector has a much more polluting impact beyond being responsible for the overwhelming majority of carbon dioxide emissions.

Vermut I A La G\u00e0bia specialises in homemade vermouth, poured from the barrel and drunk neat with a green olive and a slice of orange, or with a splash of soda water (ask for a <em>sif\u00f3</em>, the traditional glass siphon, and then top up as you sip).

The brief journey transports you from the anonymity of a big-city station neighbourhood into an arty Parisian quartier with character and charm. Billili also serves a small-plates menu that changes regularly but runs to dishes such as a sandwich filled with roasted pumpkin, marinated carrots and coriander pesto; <em>terrine de campagne</em>; and saut\u00e9ed octopus with morteau sausage in beaujolais wine sauce. <br>\u2022<em> Glass of wine and single small plate from \u20ac20, 136 rue du Faubourg-Poissonni\u00e8re, </em><em>75010, </em><em>on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Billili-188000842132545/\" title=\"\">Facebook</a></em><br><strong>Alexander Lobrano</strong></p> <h2>Parlour, Prague</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee5c44e8f237553da5846be9754c08a25c7003c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee5c44e8f237553da5846be9754c08a25c7003c2/0_1457_3710_3710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cocktail at Parlour bar, Prague, Czech Republic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Part-speakeasy, part-alchemist\u2019s living room, this cocktail den is a barely known marvel. Opened seven years ago by brothers Martin and Jakub, the bar seeks to provide a meaningful, interactive drinking experience. As such, there\u2019s no menu or fixed price list: simply tell the bartender what tastes you like and they\u2019ll wizard you up a drink. \u201cOur guests show us the way,\u201d says Martin. \u201cWe just try and mirror their ideas.\u201d And it works.

The tiny, wood-panelled bar is perfect for rail travellers as it\u2019s just minutes from Centraal station. It serves <em>fluitjes</em> (small beers) for \u20ac2.80 but it is also a tasting room with a choice of 15 types of jenever, the ancestor of modern gin (\u20ac3.50-\u20ac12.50), and 40 liqueurs (from \u20ac4.50), some distilled in Amsterdam since the 1700s. Many of the liqueurs have curious names: Bruidstranen (Bride\u2019s tears) is a rose-flavoured liqueur blended with gold and silver leaf, which was served at weddings and drunk during marital tiffs \u2013 to remind spouses of their vows.<br>\u2022 <em>Sint Olofspoort 1, <a href=\"http://www.proeflokaaldeooievaar.nl/\" title=\"\">proeflokaaldeooievaar.nl</a></em><br><strong>Deborah Nicholls-Lee</strong></p> <h2>King Charles I, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d64253597f69ca77ca8438aaec44a000592e040\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d64253597f69ca77ca8438aaec44a000592e040/0_79_528_528/500.jpg\" alt=\"King Charles pub, King\u2019s Cross, London\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Name the drink and there\u2019s a bar for it around King\u2019s Cross, often with its own particular spin: <a href=\"https://spiritland.com/location/spiritland-kings-cross/\" title=\"\">Spiritland\u2019s</a> sound system, <a href=\"https://www.drinkshopdo.co.uk/whats-on\" title=\"\">Drink, Shop, Do</a>\u2019s craft nights, pastel-hued glamour at <a href=\"https://www.linastores.co.uk/kings-cross/\" title=\"\">Lina Stores</a>, art-deco design at the <a href=\"https://gnhbar.com/\" title=\"\">GNH</a> \u2026 But in the age of gentrification, when trad pubs are closing down, it\u2019s refreshing to come across a thriving no-frills boozer. The King Charles I is small, convivial and determinedly untrendy. There\u2019s no food (unless you count crisps) and music comes courtesy of the jukebox in the corner or occasional live bands.

You may only have time to grab a quick gueuze between trains at the bar, but \u20ac7 buys two beers and a self-guided tour of the vats and fermentation room.

Gatsby is a 10-minute walk from Termini station. \u2022 Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II 106, gatsby.cafe Alexandra Bruzzese Vermut I A La G\u00e0bia, Barcelona The area around Sants station is low on leafy squares, so Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Osca \u2013 flanked by plane, rosewood and pagoda trees \u2013 has become the hub of barrio life, with a host of bars and cafes. Vermut I A La G\u00e0bia specialises in homemade vermouth, poured from the barrel and drunk neat with a green olive and a slice of orange, or with a splash of soda water (ask for a sif\u00f3, the traditional glass siphon, and then top up as you sip). A plate of marinated sardines makes the perfect accompaniment. \u2022 Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Osca 7, on Facebook Sally Davies Billili, Paris It\u2019s a five-minute walk from Gare du Nord to this popular new wine bar with glossy forest-green tiles on the walls behind the bar, mostly natural and organic wines on shelves, and great choices by the glass. The brief journey transports you from the anonymity of a big-city station neighbourhood into an arty Parisian quartier with character and charm. Billili also serves a small-plates menu that changes regularly but runs to dishes such as a sandwich filled with roasted pumpkin, marinated carrots and coriander pesto; terrine de campagne; and saut\u00e9ed octopus with morteau sausage in beaujolais wine sauce. \u2022 Glass of wine and single small plate from \u20ac20, 136 rue du Faubourg-Poissonni\u00e8re, 75010, on Facebook Alexander Lobrano Parlour, Prague Part-speakeasy, part-alchemist\u2019s living room, this cocktail den is a barely known marvel. Opened seven years ago by brothers Martin and Jakub, the bar seeks to provide a meaningful, interactive drinking experience. As such, there\u2019s no menu or fixed price list: simply tell the bartender what tastes you like and they\u2019ll wizard you up a drink. \u201cOur guests show us the way,\u201d says Martin. \u201cWe just try and mirror their ideas.\u201d And it works. Through the dim glow of candles and backdrop of downtempo jazz, customers\u2019 faces radiate with contentment as they sip. \u2022 Cocktails from \u00a35, Krakovsk\u00e1 15, parlour.cz Mark Pickering Panorama Sky Bar, Warsaw This bar is at the top of the hotel preferred by American presidents: Barack Obama stayed at the Warsaw Marriott in 2014 on his way to the G7 summit in Brussels. It\u2019s also opposite the city\u2019s main railway station. Cocktails are served from its blingy gold bar \u2013 a Belvedere Polish vodka martini costs \u00a310.50, cocktails start from around \u00a37 and beers from \u00a33.30 \u2013 but the views north up Emilia Plater street and east across the Vistula River are priceless. \u2022 Aleje Jerozolimskie 65/79, panoramaskybar.pl Keith Lockram Proeflokaal de Ooievaar, Amsterdam In medieval times, the northern gates to the city once stood here; now it\u2019s the place to find Ooievaar (stork). The tiny, wood-panelled bar is perfect for rail travellers as it\u2019s just minutes from Centraal station. It serves fluitjes (small beers) for \u20ac2.80 but it is also a tasting room with a choice of 15 types of jenever, the ancestor of modern gin (\u20ac3.50-\u20ac12.50), and 40 liqueurs (from \u20ac4.50), some distilled in Amsterdam since the 1700s. Many of the liqueurs have curious names: Bruidstranen (Bride\u2019s tears) is a rose-flavoured liqueur blended with gold and silver leaf, which was served at weddings and drunk during marital tiffs \u2013 to remind spouses of their vows. \u2022 Sint Olofspoort 1, proeflokaaldeooievaar.nl Deborah Nicholls-Lee King Charles I, London Name the drink and there\u2019s a bar for it around King\u2019s Cross, often with its own particular spin: Spiritland\u2019s sound system, Drink, Shop, Do\u2019s craft nights, pastel-hued glamour at Lina Stores, art-deco design at the GNH \u2026 But in the age of gentrification, when trad pubs are closing down, it\u2019s refreshing to come across a thriving no-frills boozer. The King Charles I is small, convivial and determinedly untrendy. There\u2019s no food (unless you count crisps) and music comes courtesy of the jukebox in the corner or occasional live bands. Come here for \u00a33.90 pints (four ales, three lagers on tap) and a taste of King\u2019s Cross before it became one of Europe\u2019s largest regeneration projects. \u2022 55-57 Northdown Street, King\u2019s Cross Isabel Choat Bierochs Bierkeller, Vienna About 15 minutes\u2019 walk south from the Hauptbahnhof, Bierochs Bierkeller, on the corner of Raaber-Bahn-Gasse and Planetengasse, has a barrel-shaped door and is in one of those ornate buildings that look like one of the city\u2019s famous cakes. Fun, cave-like, cosy and a locals\u2019 favourite, it does great toasted rye sandwiches and serves dozens of types of beer from around the world. \u2022 Raaber-Bahn-Gasse 12, 1100, on Facebook Christopher Brennan Looking for a holiday with a difference?

After Jonathan Glazer\u2019s weirdly compelling Birth (2004), in which Nicole Kidman believes her dead husband has been reincarnated as a young boy, came the not entirely dissimilar Stephen Daldry film Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close (2011), in which she played the grandmother of a boy searching for signs of his dead father in the wake of 9/11. Caldwell wrote a highly readable early autobiography, I Will Be Cleopatra (2001). She was appointed OBE in 1970. Robert died in 2002. Caldwell is survived by their sons, Sam and Charles, and by two grandchildren. \u2022 Zoe Ada Caldwell, actor and director, born 14 September 1933; died 16 February 2020 \u2022 This article was amended on 20 February 2020. It originally implied that Caldwell used the name Zoe in preference to her given name of Ada, but her full name at birth was Zoe Ada Caldwell.",

Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion since 2010, insisted she has done nothing wrong, but said she cannot comment further as investigations by the parliamentary commissioner for standards are confidential. News of the investigation came after a former Ukip candidate made a complaint about a pre-election fundraiser in which Lucas\u2019s team raised nearly \u00a318,500 by offering rewards in exchange for donations, such as a cake baked by the MP if you gave \u00a3100. Another item was the chance for one person to received a 3o-minute \u201cpersonal guided tour of House of Commons\u201d if Lucas was re-elected, in return for a donation of \u00a3150. According to the code of conduct and related rules of the house, a 150-page document given to all MPs, members \u201cmust not offer tours of the house or of the Elizabeth Tower or Big Ben in raffles or auctions\u201d. Stuart Bower, formerly a Ukip council candidate in Brighton and Hove, told the Brighton Argus newspaper that he had complained to the commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, about \u201cunethical\u201d conduct by Lucas, but that he had received a reply saying another complaint on the same matter was already being investigated. It is understood that the initial complaint was made by a Conservative MP, whose identity remains unknown. It is also understood that Stone asked Bower to keep the matter confidential, but that he opted to go to his local newspaper. In a statement, Lucas, the Greens\u2019 first and only MP, said: \u201cI\u2019m aware that a case against me has been brought to the commissioner, and an investigation is currently under way. I do not believe I have done anything wrong. \u201cI have been advised that the commissioner\u2019s investigations are confidential so it would not be appropriate for me to say anything more at this time.\u201d It is not unusual for candidates from smaller parties or independents to seek financial help to fight a general election campaign.

In a critical report, the Industrial Strategy Council (ISC) said the policy to earmark government support for key sectors of the economy had made only limited progress since Theresa May first unveiled the plan three years ago. The strategy comprises about \u00a345bn of government funds, the equivalent of 2% of GDP, that has been committed to plans to improve the quality and scale of housing, transport, digital infrastructure and research and development. However, the ISC said much of the funding was narrowly focused and that the majority of the 142 policies in the strategy had very limited funding, or no funds at all. In a rebuke to ministers, the report said: \u201cAs a result, they are very unlikely to be operating at a scale necessary to have a material impact on the economy.\u201d The watchdog said it remained unclear whether the strategy had led to policy being better coordinated across government. Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England and ISC chair, said: \u201cAn effective industrial strategy is central to tackling some of the deep-seated structural challenges facing the UK economy, among them the climate crisis, \u2018levelling up\u2019 the regions, the skills deficit and the productivity puzzle. \u201cAt present, these policies are not yet operating with the consistency and coordination, nor with the scale, necessary to meet these challenges.\u201d The strategy has faced criticism for a lack of progress from employers groups before.

      "bodyText": "A campaign has been launched to erect a statue of Dame Thora Hird in her home town of Morecambe. The Bafta winner, best known for playing Edie Pegden in Last of the Summer Wine and for performing Alan Bennett monologues, died in 2003 aged 91. A blue plaque already pays tribute to her career in the north-west seaside town, but a group of local heritage campaigners believe she deserves a statue. They have found a renowned Lancastrian sculptor to immortalise Hird, who is to be depicted sitting in a deck chair, with an empty chair beside her for people to sit on next to her and have their photo taken. Peter Hodgkinson, who made a statue of the painter LS Lowry that props up the bar in Sam\u2019s Chop House in Manchester, and another of the footballer Tom Finney outside Preston North End\u2019s stadium, has agreed to take on the commission if Morecambe Heritage can raise \u00a392,000 to pay for it. He said his homage to Hird would depict the actor in her 60s: \u201cThat is how most people remember her, with her big glasses on.\u201d A statue of Eric Morecambe already graces the town\u2019s prom, bringing sunshine to visitors who mirror his one-legged pose. Born John Eric Bartholomew, he chose the name of his beloved home town as his stage name. Hird, who won a Bafta in 1989 for performing Alan Bennett\u2019s solo piece A Cream Cracker Under the Settee in the original Talking Heads series on the BBC, was proud of being a Morecambe lass, never forgetting her roots. Famously loquacious, an interviewer from the Guardian once spent four hours recording Hird, stopping only because he ran out of tapes. Christine Stebbing, the chair of Morecambe Heritage, said it had long been her wish to put up a statue of the actor in her birthplace. She said the council had given permission for the statue to be situated on the site of the Royalty theatre, where Hird was carried on stage at eight weeks old by her actor mother, and where her father was manager. She told ITV: \u201cThis is the ideal place for the statue to be placed and the chief planning officer and others on the town team were in agreement. The statue will be a seated Thora in a deck chair with an empty one beside her for people to sit and have a photo. \u201cI have sourced a sculptor, Peter Hodgkinson, who has produced \u2013 among others \u2013 the Tom Finney Splash statue, which is erected at the Preston North End stadium in Preston, and the LS Lowry statue in Salford.\u201d Stebbing has set up an appeal on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe, having so far been turned down for grants. Hodgkinson said he hoped Lancaster city council, which administers Morecambe, would contribute towards the cost. A good statue would pay for itself, he said, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no better example of this than the Eric Morecambe statue. Within about a month of it being unveiled the council had taken the money it cost in parking fees. You had coaches full of Women\u2019s Institutes and all sorts coming from all around the country to see it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Nasdaq index in New York has hit its latest record high, with investors apparently circumspect about the risks of the coronavirus outbreak worsening and the prospect of central banks stepping in to help the economy along. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.6% in early trading on Wall Street, hitting 9,795 points for the new record. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average also rose by about 0.3% apiece. The continued gains for stock markets around the world illustrate just how sanguine investors are feeling \u2013 even if the potential costs of the coronavirus are large and fears over possible recessions in advanced economies are brewing. The People\u2019s Bank of China added that it would help anti-virus efforts by extending credit, including by providing favourable loans or interest rates to companies involved in controlling the epidemic. It all adds to quite a cocktail for policymakers at the Bank of England. Inflation moved towards its 2% target in January, suggesting that an interest rate cut is less likely \u2013 but with fears over the economy and the ever-present uncertainty of Brexit trade talks still looming, there will be many clamouring for the Bank to give the economy some support. And one of the biggest corporate stories of the day came from Seattle, where Boeing has ordered inspections of its entire fleet of grounded 737 Max planes after it found debris in the fuel tanks of some of the aircraft, in the latest setback for the US plane-maker. Thank you for following our coverage of business, economics and markets today \u2013 and do come back tomorrow for more of the same. JJ Qatar Airways has spent about \u00a3460m on increasing its stake in British Airways-owner IAG to increase its holding to 25.1%, strengthening its position ahead of a change in IAG management, Reuters reports: In an endorsement of the Anglo-Spanish group just weeks before its founder Willie Walsh steps down, Qatar said on Wednesday the move showed its support for IAG and its strategy. Qatar previously held 21.4% of IAG, which also owns Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling and Ireland\u2019s Aer Lingus. IAG\u2019s share price has risen by 52% in the last six months. The move comes after some unnamed non-EU investors sold their shares. EU rules mean that airlines must be majority owned within the bloc \u2013 a situation that will be complicated after the Brexit transition period. There\u2019s a mighty row brewing around Britain\u2019s biggest mining project in North Yorkshire. Mining giant Anglo American has offered \u00a3405m to buy Sirius Minerals, the troubled owner of the multi-billion-pound project to develop the Woodsmith fertiliser mine. However, Odey Asset Management, the hedge fund owned by outspoken financier and political donor Crispin Odey, said the offer was too low. In an open letter, Odey, which held a 1.29% economic interest in Sirius as of Feb. 18, said it would only vote in favour of a bid at 7 pence per share or more \u2013 not the 5.5p suggested by Anglo. In its letter it said: The lack of \u2018final\u2019 offer, in Odey\u2019s opinion, suggests that Anglo American would be willing to bid substantially more for Sirius, with the investment case remaining highly attractive for Anglo American, even at a materially higher bid level. Anglo American declined to comment. Sirius said in a statement that its board was unanimous in recommending shareholders vote for Anglo\u2019s bid as it stands \u2013 and that the company could fail if it doesn\u2019t secure the deal. Read the full story here: It\u2019s still looking like an easy day for European stock market investors: blue-chip shares have notched up another record high. The 0.6% gain for the Stoxx 600 index gives it a 3.5% increase for 2020 so far, and we\u2019re only halfway through February. The FTSE 100 index has fallen back slightly to 7,434 points, a 0.7% rise \u2013 likely because the pound has strengthened slightly. (Stronger sterling means the large chunk of US dollar earnings is less valuable in nominal terms.) Laura Ashley has agreed emergency funding with its bank, Wells Fargo, staving off the threat of bankruptcy. The struggling fashion and homeware retailer said it \u201cshould be able to utilise requisite funds from its working capital facility with Wells Fargo to meet its immediate funding requirements\u201d. Laura Ashley, which is listed in the UK, had said it would have to \u201cconsider all appropriate options\u201d if it could not get hold of more cash, raising fears for the jobs of more than 2,700 workers. Majority owner MUI Asia, which is controlled by the multimillionaire shareholder Khoo Kay Peng, did not inject any cash as part of the deal, but longer-term options are still under consideration. The company\u2019s statement said: The company welcomes the support from MUI Asia Limited and continues to review its working capital needs on an ongoing basis. The company will update shareholders in due course in relation to the review of its working capital needs. Financial leaders of the world\u2019s 20 largest economies (G20) will say that the coronavirus epidemic is a downside risk to forecasts of global growth, according to a draft communique. Private sector estimats of the cost suggest it could be big \u2013 but temporary. Reuters has seen the document, ahead of the meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors due this weekend. With 73,332 confirmed cases of the Covid-19 virus worldwide, and widespread quarantine conditions in China, there is little doubt among economists that global growth will be impacted. The question is the scale of the hit. Oxford Economics, a consultancy, has today put out research that suggests that a global pandemic could cost the global economy $1.1tn (\u00a3850bn). GDP would be 1.3% lower than their model otherwise suggests. If the epidemic is confined to Asia the cost would be a still considerable $400bn, or 0.5% of 2020 GDP \u2013 although in either scenario the economy recovers by the end of next year. A global pandemic would represent \u201ca short but very sharp shock on the world economy\u201d, wrote Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics. Our scenarios see world GDP hit as a result of declines in discretionary consumption and travel and tourism, with some knock-on financial market effects and weaker investment. A quick currencies update (on a pretty quiet day in foreign exchange markets): sterling has lost 0.1% against the US dollar, with brief gains from the inflation beat failing to hold. \u201cPound hugs $1.30\u201d is the headline from Reuters \u2013 perhaps not the most exciting development. It\u2019s worth noting that against the euro the pound is at levels, above \u20ac1.20, not seen since the EU referendum in 2016 \u2013 barring the post-election result spike. The Japanese yen has fallen by 0.5% against the dollar. It was announced last night, but if you haven\u2019t caught up yet, there are some pretty momentous plans in train for the UK\u2019s post-Brexit immigration system. Britain is to close its borders to unskilled workers and those who can\u2019t speak English as part of a fundamental overhaul of immigration laws that will end the era of cheap EU labour in factories, warehouses, hotels and restaurants, reported the Guardian\u2019s front page this morning. Unveiling its Australian-style points system on Wednesday, the government said it is grasping a unique opportunity to take \u201cfull control\u201d of British borders \u201cfor the first time in decades\u201d and eliminate the \u201cdistortion\u201d caused by EU freedom of movement. Business groups reacted with horror, saying it would damage the economy, but the home secretary, Priti Patel, this morning essentially told them to like it or lump it. There are 8m \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d Britons who could do the jobs, she said \u2013 although with the UK thought to be at or near full employment it is unclear how many of those could be tempted back into the labour market. The Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott, described it as \u201cthe biggest structural change to the UK labour market in decades\u201d. The new policy represents a break with the past and is highly interventionist. As a member of the European Union, the government was only able to limit migration from non-EU countries. Under the new approach, the UK will be open to highly skilled workers from anywhere in the world, but the door to those with low skills will be closed. Here\u2019s the full detail on the inflation figures, from the Guardian\u2019s Phillip Inman: Inflation jumped to a six-month high of 1.8% in January after a surge in petrol prices and an increase in the cost of gas and electricity over last year. The surprise increase in the consumer prices index (CPI), which exceeded forecasts of a rise to 1.6%, brought the main measure of inflation closer to the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. The rise in fuel and energy costs forced up household heating costs and fed into the transport industry, the Office for National Statistics said. Read the whole story here: US stock markets are looking up. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 suggest the US benchmark index will gain 0.2% when it opens later today, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is expected to rise by 0.3%. Economists are wondering whether the Bank of England\u2019s efforts to raise interest rates from historical lows will be short-lived, given fears over the state of the global economy. Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, said: Inflation rose closer to the Bank of England\u2019s target, but underneath the noise of the headline figures, domestically-driven inflation still looks weak. Business sentiment and the follow-through to activity data will, however, be the more important determinant of whether the Bank of England cut rates or not in coming months. Jing Teow, an economist at PwC, said there could be risks of increasing inflation on the horizon \u2013 suggesting that the Bank would hesitate before a cut to interest rates. A prolonged shutdown in production activity as a result of Covid-19 could exert a drag on industrial production and disrupt global supply chains, which could lead to further inflationary pressures as the shortage of inputs and key components start to bite. Looking towards the medium-term, a modest recovery this year that spurs further business activity, combined with continued upward pressure on wages due to a tight labour market could also give rise to inflationary pressures. For a view on just how unusual the past decade has been in monetary policy terms, take a look at this graph from a speech by the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane (with its impressive range of sources included). Central bankers are desperate to push interest rates back up, but fears over the slowing global economy have for the most part stymied those efforts. Some more reactions on the slight-surprise inflation reading \u2013 first of all from a man who a week ago would not have been expected to be in the spotlight, and his opposition, who is likely to leave the spotlight in April. Conservative chancellor Rishi Sunak said: Families across the country are better off as a result of the strong wage growth and low inflation over the last 18 months. We want to go further to help with the cost of living \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve cut taxes for 31m people and given nearly 2.4m a pay rise through our record increase to the National Living Wage. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, focused on the jump in prices. He said: The Tories\u2019 poor economic management has contributed to an unstable economy, with prices rising sharply for people already suffering from ten years of vicious cuts. Successive Conservative governments have repeatedly blamed anyone but themselves for an under-performing economy. It\u2019s time for this chaotic government to take responsibility for these failings, and to reverse the decade of decline the Tories have brought to this economy. The inflation reading may have taken economists by surprise (1.8% against a 1.6% consensus), but it may not have a major effect on interest rate prospects, economists suggest. The figures were in line with the Bank\u2019s January monetary policy report forecast, according to Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy. She said: While CPI inflation rose for the first time in six months, the inflation figures were in line with the Bank of England\u2019s expectations, so they are unlikely to move the dial on the outlook for interest rates. CPI inflation still looks likely to slip back to 1.5% within the next few months and remain below 2% for the rest of the year. But for the MPC, the fact that inflation is evolving in line with its projections provides another reason not to cut interest rates in the near term. House prices rose across the UK in December \u2013 the first time that has happened since February 2018. Although the ONS did not give a specific reason for the increase, many economists have ascribed the rise in prices to the Conservative party\u2019s majority won in the general election of 12 December. Average house prices in the UK increased by 2.2% in the year to December 2019, up from 1.7% in the year to November 2019. The average price was \u00a3235,000 \u2013 up \u00a35,000 year-on-year. The ONS\u2019s head of inflation, Mike Hardie, said: Annual house prices grew across all regions of the UK, the first time this has happened in nearly two years, with London seeing its strongest growth since October 2017. The consumer price index (CPI) of inflation (still the measure used by the Bank of England, despite the ONS\u2019s best efforts) has faded over the past few years as the effects of the post-Brexit-vote devaluation of sterling have passed through. Some other notable data from the ONS: the input producer price index (PPI) rose at its fastest pace since April 2019, suggesting that some further price pressures could feed through to consumers. The 12-month growth rate of Input PPI was 2.1% in January 2020, up from 0.9% in December 2019. The ONS\u2019s head of inflation, Mike Hardie, said: The rise in inflation is largely the result of higher prices at the pump and airfares falling by less than a year ago. In addition, gas and electricity prices were unchanged this month, but fell this time last year due to the introduction of the energy price cap. The UK\u2019s consumer price index of inflation rose by 1.8% year-on-year in January, the fastest rate of growth in six months, according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected inflation of 1.6%. Prices rose by 1.3% year-on-year in December. The FTSE 100 has now gained more than 1% today, or 77 points, to reach 7,459 points. The mid-cap FTSE 250 has gained 0.5%. Stock indices have risen across the board in Europe, with the Stoxx 600 index up by 0.55%. Traders are ascribing the positivity to a slight dip in the number of new cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus. The World Health Organisation reported 73,332 cases worldwide on Tuesday, the vast majority of which are in China. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould credited a small fall in the number of new coronavirus cases and apparent hopes that central banks will intervene to prop up the global economy for the stock market gains. He said: It feels like markets are looking for any excuse to feel positive at the moment. Apple\u2019s coronavirus-linked iPhone sales warning earlier this week may have spooked investors briefly. However, markets have soon shifted their attention elsewhere. An interesting update on the trade relationship between the UK and the EU: German exports to the UK fell to their lowest level since 2013 last year. The UK is Germany\u2019s fifth-largest customer, but exports fell 4.2% to \u20ac78.7bn. At the same time Germany\u2019s total exports rose 0.8% year-on-year to reach a record high. Reuters reports: German exports to Britain fell for the fourth year running in 2019, according to Statistical Office data seen by Reuters, as the weak pound dampened demand and uncertainty over post-Brexit trade regulations disrupted existing supply chains. Exports of cars, aircraft and aircraft parts, electronic equipment and pharmaceutical products had fallen, the data showed Martin Braml, a trade expert at the Ifo research institute, said: The main cause is the continuing uncertainty over the trade relationship after 2020, when the transition phase is over. Here\u2019s the torrid tale of the 737 Max\u2019s almost three years since launching. Troubles first emerged on 29 October 2018, when 189 people aboard a Lion Air flight from Jakarta crashed. In March Boeing\u2019s fleet was grounded. And then, shockingly, emails revealed in US Congress this year showed that employees joked that the plane was \u201cdesigned by clowns\u201d. Referring to the Federal Aviation Authority, the US regulator that certified the plane as safe to fly, another message says: \u201cI\u2019ll be shocked if the FAA passes this turd.\u201d One employee said in 2018: \u201cI still haven\u2019t been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year.\u201d With the return of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max to the skies not expected until late spring at the earliest, those effects on the US economy will be significant, according to economists. Moody\u2019s Investor Service, the influential credit rating agency, said that US economic growth will decelerate during 2020, in part because of the crisis at Boeing. In a note published on Monday its analysts said: Boeing\u2019s decision to temporarily halt the production of the 737 Max will weigh on Q1 GDP, subtracting as much as 0.5 percentage points, because of the effect on manufacturers down the supply chain. (Note that US quarterly GDP numbers are reported on an annualised basis for obscure technical reasons that don\u2019t seem to apply to much of the rest of the world. US real GDP grew by 2.3% in 2019.) Here\u2019s Boeing\u2019s full statement on the debris discovery, from a spokesman: Safely returning the 737 Max to service is our top priority. While conducting maintenance we discovered foreign object debris [FOD] in undelivered 737 Max airplanes currently in storage. That finding led to a robust internal investigation and immediate corrective actions in our production system. We are also inspecting all stored 737 Max airplanes at Boeing to ensure there is no FOD. We have already recommended to our customers with airplanes in active storage for more than one year to inspect the fuel tank for FOD as part of their procedures. We continue to have conversations with our customers about the best approach for inspections of their stored airplanes prior to return to service. Some more on Boeing, a company so big that its travails have caused an appreciable dent in US manufacturing figures. Boeing lost its crown as the world\u2019s largest producer of planes in 2019 to fierce European rival Airbus \u2013 for the first time since 2011. Boeing produced only 380 planes last year, compared to Airbus\u2019s 863. The decision to ground the 737 Max planes was taken by regulators, but the follow-on effect of Boeing halting production of its most popular plane is hitting smaller suppliers around the US, according to this informative report in the FT (\u00a3). The drop has affected everyone from toilet parts suppliers to major listed companies such as Spirit Aerosystems, which laid off 2,800 people as demand for its fuselage dropped. The threat for Boeing is that the longer it idles its own machines and workers, the greater the risk of long-term damage to the supply chain. Metro Bank has appointed a new chief executive \u2013 or rather, it has removed the word \u201cinterim\u201d from his title. The struggling lender on Wednesday said that Dan Frumkin would be the man to lead the bank permanently, after an accounting scandal that has so far cost it the jobs of its colourful founding chairman and its chief executive. Frumkin joined the bank in September as chief transformation officer, taking charge of changing systems, and stepped into the breach as interim chief executive after Craig Donaldson quit. It\u2019s quite a change in a few months for Frumkin: the 55-year-old most recently spent eight years as global chief operating officer at the Bank of N.T. Butterfield &amp; Son, a community bank based in Bermuda. He has previously held roles at Royal Bank of Scotland and Northern Rock. Beyond the investigations into the accounting error, which saw loans misclassified, Frumkin will also have the task of turning around the bank\u2019s share price. It\u2019s worth less than a 20th of its price in March 2018. European markets have gained at the opening bell, with the FTSE 100 up by 0.5% to about 7,421 points. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40 indices also gained 0.5% apiece. London\u2019s mid-cap FTSE 250 gained 0.4%. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of the world of business, economics and markets. Boeing has ordered inspections of its entire fleet of grounded 737 Max planes after it found debris in the fuel tanks of some, in the latest setback for the US planemaker. It is still less than a year since the second fatal crash of a Boeing 737 Max that grounded the model\u2019s entire global fleet, and the company is racing to recertify with regulators that the planes can fly safely. The fuel tanks are unrelated to the flaws to sensors thought to have contributed towards the two crashes. Boeing built about 400 of the planes which it could not deliver to customers, and its orders have suffered after it was forced to cut back production at its factory near Seattle. Specialist aviation blog Leeham News, which first reported the discovery of the \u201cforeign object debris\u201d (FOD), said the inspections would likely not delay the recertification. However, it would take a up to three days to inspect each plane because fuel must be drained and vapours dissipated before the fuel tanks can be opened. Mark Jenks, the general manager of the 737 programme, said in a memo to employees that the debris was \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d. \u201cOne escape is one too many,\u201d he added. Via Reuters: A Boeing spokesman said that the issue would not change the company\u2019s belief that the Federal Aviation Administration will certify the plane to fly again this summer. An FAA spokesman said the agency knows that Boeing is conducting a voluntary inspection of undelivered Max planes. In stock markets, equities in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia have for the most part gained on Wednesday, with a lull in coronavirus fears as the number of new Chinese cases dropped slightly. The Nikkei in Tokyo rose by 0.89%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gained 0.45%. However, share indices in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell, with the CSI 300 index losing 0.15%.

      "body": "<p>Grimes has always had a tortured relationship with visibility. No sooner had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/31/claire-boucher-grimes-art-angels\">Claire Boucher</a> broken beyond the Montreal warehouse scene at the turn of the 2010s than she was telling journalists that she only fronted her music because she couldn\u2019t afford to hire someone to do it for her. She wanted to be Phil Spector \u2013 though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/11/britney-spears-making-baby-one-more-time\">maybe she also wanted to be Britney</a>. \u201cI really hate being in front of people,\u201d she told Pitchfork in 2012. \u201cBut I\u2019m also obsessed with being a pop star.\u201d</p> <p>That ambivalence colours Boucher\u2019s earliest press. She could make \u201cdumb fucking hits all day\u201d but didn\u2019t, because \u201cthat\u2019s obviously not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/06/grimes-review-miami-art-basel\">how I want Grimes to be perceived</a>\u201d. She once asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between Napoleon and everyone else? Napoleon had great image branding.\u201d Given that her style and hair colour changed in every photo, Boucher disrupted the possibility of ever solidifying into the kind of stable pop silhouette connoted by either bicorne hat or cone bra. She craved a new archetype: whether she resembled a space lieutenant or racoon-eyed wraith, the one consistent would be her iconoclastic skill as the sole producer of her music.</p> <p> What mattered to her was showing \u201cthat women can do technical work\u201d. Though that presented another paradox. Boucher wanted to set an example but resented a misogynist music culture that insisted women <em>prove</em> their technical ability. Nor did she want to be framed as a <em>female</em> producer, or in terms of the related challenges. She just wanted to drill the amateurism of her early releases for her 2012 breakthrough album, Visions. \u201cI would rather have respect among a small group of people and be considered important and innovative than be widely successful and make tons of money,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That is now ancient history. Today, Boucher is known globally as the girlfriend of billionaire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/31/elon-musk-edm-artist-first-track-dont-doubt-ur-vibe\">Tesla founder Elon Musk</a>, and mother to their unborn child. When she describes her pregnancy skincare routine to Vogue, her comments on rosacea are aggregated on websites that will never cover her music. The preview singles for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2019/mar/21/grimes-finds-a-whole-new-way-to-make-climate-change-fun\">frequently delayed fifth album \u2013 Miss Anthropocene</a>, released this Friday \u2013 have received the most underwhelming responses of her lauded career, while her headstrong nature has made her a regular online punchline. There is a sense that certain elements of the media and tired fans want the album to bomb as a tidy conclusion to a story that has apparently gone off the rails.</p> <p>But Boucher never stood a chance at setting the terms of her fandom. Like most highly visible young female innovators, she was fetishised, belittled and pushed to defend her work so often that defiance became baked into her work and persona. Seldom a stable motivation, it has steered the highs and lows of her career.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtH68PJIQLE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JtH68PJIQLE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Grimes: Oblivion \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>One of Grimes\u2019s</strong> earliest media sticking points was her description of her work as \u201cpost-internet\u201d. The term was known in art criticism, but not music, beyond Wire-reading circles. Born in 1988, Boucher pointed out that she came from the first generation that had web access as children. Older music fans were \u201craised with genres of music.

Unfortunately for Boucher, she did: in May 2018, she accompanied Elon Musk to the Met Ball. At first <a href=\"https://www.stereogum.com/1995549/grimes-elon-musk-memes/franchises/sounding-board/\">the memes about them dating were fun</a>, and the new couple joined in. But then fans noticed that Boucher had removed \u201canti-imperialist\u201d from her Twitter bio, blaming her affiliation with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/10/tesla-workers-union-elon-musk\">union-busting, Trump-advising Musk</a>. They demanded she dump him.</p> <p>Boucher explained that she had changed her bio months before, and defended Musk \u2013 explaining that donating to the Republican party was \u201cthe cost of doing business\u201d, advocating for his environmental philanthropy and claiming that she had <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/grimes-said-she-tried-to-encourage-union-vote-at-tesla-2018-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\">tried to get Tesla workers to unionise</a> but that they hadn\u2019t wanted to. This only hurt her reputation, suffering the sexist double standard of being refracted through Musk\u2019s actions.</p> <p>In possibly the second worst thing that could befall a medium-level celebrity with a conflicted relationship to the media, Boucher allegedly invited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/07/how-pop-cultures-obsession-with-receipts-led-to-2018s-weirdest-beef\">Azealia Banks</a> to Musk\u2019s house for a collaboration then stood her up, leaving Banks to witness Musk unsuccessfully scrambling to avoid legal action after tweeting about taking Tesla public, a situation that saw Banks and Boucher subpoenaed to preserve all relevant communications, an evidently bananas situation that drove the press wild.</p> <p>More mockery followed a smattering of interviews in early 2019 when Boucher explained: \u201cI thought people understood that I ultimately probably believe in an AI dictatorship.\u201d (Maybe it\u2019s understandable that someone who always says the wrong thing might find comfort in absolutism.) A new single, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/07/grimes-new-track-of-week\">We Appreciate Power</a>, was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2015/dec/13/moranbong-kim-jong-un-north-korea-girlband\">North Korea\u2019s all-female military band Moranbong</a> and \u201cwritten from the perspective of a pro-AI girl group propaganda machine who use song, dance, sex and fashion to spread goodwill towards artificial intelligence\u201d. Ignoring the clear (if risky) concept, critics accused her of glorifying fascism.</p> <p>Boucher is an acquired taste who is perfectly capable of stupidity. (Her first ever appearance in the press, pre-Grimes, was an ill-fated attempt <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/this-boat-don-t-float/49134952/?c=y&amp;page=all&amp;prepage=1#continue\">to sail a houseboat laden with chickens and potatoes down the Mississippi</a>.) But now she was adjacent to real power, her words and actions were received with bad-faith fervour that cast her as dangerous or ridiculous. She was derided for renaming herself <em>c</em> \u2013 italics included, as in the measurement of the speed of light \u2013 even though she said it was a sign of her deep self-loathing based on what Grimes and Boucher had come to represent. \u201cWithout me doing anything, just by random association with other people, I\u2019ve watched my career and my reputation get totally fucking smashed,\u201d she said (accurately, if forgoing some small share of personal responsibility).</p> <p>Boucher would blame the media for portraying Art Angels as her shot at the pop mainstream instead of a display of her talents as a producer. There is some gendered truth in that \u2013 her male peers tapping into bubblegum and K-pop songcraft are seldom interpreted that way. But while musicians have more control over their message today, a character-hungry media and fan culture means they may have less power over its interpretation. Yet one element of her reputation remained bulletproof. \u201cFor most artists, if you\u2019re not cool for 20 minutes then you can\u2019t get in a room with a good producer and your career is fucking over,\u201d she said. \u201cI never want to be in that situation. I want to be in a situation like I am now where my reputation is at an all-time low and I can still make sick-ass fucking music because I don\u2019t rely on anybody.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9SGYBHY0qs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M9SGYBHY0qs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Grimes and i_o: Violence \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Boucher has recently</strong> seemed at a loss to regain control over her career, and naive about her role in its dissolution.

No one wants to look at it, you know? I want to make a reason to look at it. I want to make it beautiful.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Against all odds, Miss Anthropocene is Boucher\u2019s continuing personal testament to creativity as resistance against destruction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/15/feminism-feminists-tyranny-niceness-complexity\">Lots of artists have found potential in the \u201cdifficult woman\u201d</a>. But Boucher goes a step further: drawing on a decade of conflict over her own visibility, she smartly taps the cultural power of the reviled woman \u2013 the fate of almost every female pop icon \u2013 and the can\u2019t-look-away spectacle of vilification: \u201cI\u2019ll just be a villain now, and that\u2019s cool,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to make that useful to society.\u201d</p> <p>Her goddess represents humanity\u2019s justification for its self-destruction, which goes beyond the death wish of the climate crisis to dwell uncomfortably in more intimate forms of self-annihilation: addiction, self-loathing and the internet. It is a profoundly bleak record. It shares some DNA with Soundcloud rap, the murky, malevolent sound of depression and dashed hopes, laced with sweet melodic hooks. Spiritually, too: in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvzC8MmC850\">Delete Forever</a>, a song about the opioid crisis written <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/17/lil-peep-remembered-by-sarah-stennett\">the night Lil Peep died</a>, Boucher seems to describe the reality of beating her own addictions and having to face life unmediated: \u201cAlways down when I\u2019m not up / Guess it\u2019s just my rotten luck.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not Boucher \u2013 or Grimes, or <em>c</em> \u2013 is in character as she sings about suicidal ideation and self-destruction, it\u2019s impossible not to think about how she has coped with the assault on her public persona over the past decade, to the degree that her recent \u2013 admittedly outr\u00e9 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B7E9gnJF0O9/?utm_source=ig_embed\">pregnancy announcement</a> was mined for gags. Love and art, by the sound of it, making Miss Anthropocene an unlikely sibling to Taylor Swift\u2019s Reputation. It\u2019s bookended by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH0kfH04U68\">So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth</a>, about her relationship, and Idoru, a flush of brightness and birdsong that follows the storm and cherishes how \u201cunrequited love has reassembled me\u201d. It might be sung to Musk, though it seems more likely aimed inwards \u2013 to herself, and to art. \u201cYou cannot be sad,\u201d she sings, \u201cbecause you made my all-time favourite music.\u201d</p> <p>Against all odds, Miss Anthropocene is a beautiful and emotionally complex album: Boucher\u2019s continuing personal testament to creativity as resistance against destruction, and an unlikely optimistic gesture that still believes art can be a powerful force for social good. It also finally finds Boucher reconciled to her relationship with the public. On Miss Anthropocene, she is a mirror, inviting us to examine the source of our bad faith.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Grimes has always had a tortured relationship with visibility. No sooner had Claire Boucher broken beyond the Montreal warehouse scene at the turn of the 2010s than she was telling journalists that she only fronted her music because she couldn\u2019t afford to hire someone to do it for her. She wanted to be Phil Spector \u2013 though maybe she also wanted to be Britney. \u201cI really hate being in front of people,\u201d she told Pitchfork in 2012. \u201cBut I\u2019m also obsessed with being a pop star.\u201d That ambivalence colours Boucher\u2019s earliest press. She could make \u201cdumb fucking hits all day\u201d but didn\u2019t, because \u201cthat\u2019s obviously not how I want Grimes to be perceived\u201d. She once asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between Napoleon and everyone else? Napoleon had great image branding.\u201d Given that her style and hair colour changed in every photo, Boucher disrupted the possibility of ever solidifying into the kind of stable pop silhouette connoted by either bicorne hat or cone bra. She craved a new archetype: whether she resembled a space lieutenant or racoon-eyed wraith, the one consistent would be her iconoclastic skill as the sole producer of her music. What mattered to her was showing \u201cthat women can do technical work\u201d. Though that presented another paradox. Boucher wanted to set an example but resented a misogynist music culture that insisted women prove their technical ability. Nor did she want to be framed as a female producer, or in terms of the related challenges. She just wanted to drill the amateurism of her early releases for her 2012 breakthrough album, Visions. \u201cI would rather have respect among a small group of people and be considered important and innovative than be widely successful and make tons of money,\u201d she said. That is now ancient history. Today, Boucher is known globally as the girlfriend of billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk, and mother to their unborn child. When she describes her pregnancy skincare routine to Vogue, her comments on rosacea are aggregated on websites that will never cover her music. The preview singles for her frequently delayed fifth album \u2013 Miss Anthropocene, released this Friday \u2013 have received the most underwhelming responses of her lauded career, while her headstrong nature has made her a regular online punchline. There is a sense that certain elements of the media and tired fans want the album to bomb as a tidy conclusion to a story that has apparently gone off the rails. But Boucher never stood a chance at setting the terms of her fandom. Like most highly visible young female innovators, she was fetishised, belittled and pushed to defend her work so often that defiance became baked into her work and persona. Seldom a stable motivation, it has steered the highs and lows of her career. One of Grimes\u2019s earliest media sticking points was her description of her work as \u201cpost-internet\u201d. The term was known in art criticism, but not music, beyond Wire-reading circles. Born in 1988, Boucher pointed out that she came from the first generation that had web access as children. Older music fans were \u201craised with genres of music. But people my age had everything all at once.\u201d Boucher loved Enya, Mariah Carey, Gangnam Style and Beyonc\u00e9; Al Green, Aphex Twin and Tool. She revered the medieval nun Hildegard of Bingen and once recounted a \u201cglorious life-changing experience\u201d in which she climbed a mountain while listening to Arvo P\u00e4rt and was so transported that she didn\u2019t notice she was frozen, soaking and bloodied. (She had a lot of stories like this.) She became so bored with explaining the post-internet idea that she tried to retract it on Twitter. It didn\u2019t work \u2013 not least because Boucher\u2019s philosophy radiated through her rushing, incantatory synth-pop, spliced with acid and bubblegum, club boldness and whispered intimacy. Its gleeful reception seemed to herald a new dawn of ambition in low-stakes indie music culture. (MIA was one obvious forebear, though she was more interested in smashing global boundaries than high/lowbrow binaries, and her breakthrough predated the social media wave that fuelled Grimes\u2019s rise.) While Boucher disregarded any distinction between mainstream and alternative, indie music media saw Grimes\u2019s pop-star potential as the genre\u2019s ultimate validation. So it started treating her like a pop star, reporting on her activity with the fervour of Perez Hilton trailing Britney Spears in 2007. There was no shortage of material. Boucher frequently posted Tumblr missives calling out music industry misogyny, discussing her environmentally friendly touring practices and sharing updates on work in progress. When every update was repurposed as news, these became concrete biography \u2013 against Boucher\u2019s insistence that her words should not be taken out of context. On 6 February 2013, after Pitchfork reported on Boucher\u2019s latest post, she deleted almost her entire Tumblr feed. Pitchfork updated the post with the news. The inescapable attention frustrated Boucher, though in a sense she was her own worst enemy. In a field defined by meekness, she was Starman. Grizzly Bear had not recorded their album on a three-week speed bender. Real Estate did not enrage Boiler Room nerds by playing Justin Bieber and Vengaboys at the self-regarding club. Disclosure never sold \u201cpussy rings\u201d as merch. While Kanye and Beyonc\u00e9 incarnated more outlandish forms of iconography, they ignored independent media, which had ignored them until doing so became bad for business. Where their fame insulated them from the clamour, Boucher\u2019s mid-level renown left her exposed and scrambling to get a grip on her narrative. In that regard, it\u2019s depressing to recall that Visions is a record about reclaiming control after a physical violation. Its lead single, the celestial, lurching Oblivion, detailed a violent street attack sustained by Boucher. Post-assault and in an increasingly digital world, she sang about reconnecting with physicality on the intimate Be a Body. Her obsessive work ethic offered transcendence: on Symphonia IX (My Wait Is U), she declared her \u201cneed to be the best before the need to rest\u201d. It was the last time Boucher would be able to make music unencumbered by the Grimes persona from which she felt increasingly alienated. For a while, she thought about embracing a behind-the-scenes role, and submitted a song, the EDM track Go, for Rihanna\u2019s consideration. It got turned down, so she released it herself. Fans accused her of \u201cpandering to the radio\u201d. Grimes was deified like a pop star, and there was a triumph-of-the-weird will to see her become one (even the New Yorker based a profile around the possibility), yet she was maligned for interfacing with the mainstream. Even after those cultural binaries supposedly lay in ruins and the concept of selling out was dead, there were still, apparently, unacceptable ways for an artist to pursue her ambition. These toxic conflicts between exposure and expectation seethed through Grimes\u2019s vivid 2015 album, Art Angels, filled with songs about betrayal, commodification, sacrifice and disconnection from her persona. It would have been a classic post-fame record \u2013 except that most post-fame records are terrible, and Art Angels was anything but. Standout track California united country and trance, and found Boucher surveying the gulf between her identity and her reputation: \u201cThe things they see in me, I cannot see myself,\u201d she sang bittersweetly. It was her rebuke to a media that she said had \u201cfucked my narrative\u201d. That wouldn\u2019t change: the stubbornly fantastic Art Angels made Grimes a bigger star, increasing the currency of her image. As much as she hated her press treatment, she never changed how she engaged online, beyond the occasional retreat from social media. She frequently discussed possible new directions, often to retract her remarks days later. Sometimes industry interference was to blame for such switches; or they were just fast-evolving creative whims documented generously in real time. In the absence of new music, Boucher\u2019s new persona \u2013 flaky, defensive, a victim \u2013 ballooned into the space. Roughly the worst thing that could happen to a medium-level celebrity with a conflicted relationship to the media is to fall in love with a notorious tech billionaire.

This only hurt her reputation, suffering the sexist double standard of being refracted through Musk\u2019s actions. In possibly the second worst thing that could befall a medium-level celebrity with a conflicted relationship to the media, Boucher allegedly invited Azealia Banks to Musk\u2019s house for a collaboration then stood her up, leaving Banks to witness Musk unsuccessfully scrambling to avoid legal action after tweeting about taking Tesla public, a situation that saw Banks and Boucher subpoenaed to preserve all relevant communications, an evidently bananas situation that drove the press wild. More mockery followed a smattering of interviews in early 2019 when Boucher explained: \u201cI thought people understood that I ultimately probably believe in an AI dictatorship.\u201d (Maybe it\u2019s understandable that someone who always says the wrong thing might find comfort in absolutism.)

I want to be in a situation like I am now where my reputation is at an all-time low and I can still make sick-ass fucking music because I don\u2019t rely on anybody.\u201d Boucher has recently seemed at a loss to regain control over her career, and naive about her role in its dissolution. But Miss Anthropocene reveals an astute understanding \u2013 evidently well honed \u2013 of humanity\u2019s worst impulses and how to appeal to them. She conceived the titular character \u2013 the name a play on misanthropy, Miss America and the current geological epoch, in which humankind has been the dominant global influence \u2013 as a vengeful goddess who revels in the climate crisis, which she hoped might alert fans to the urgency of the situation. \u201cPeople don\u2019t care about it because we\u2019re being guilted,\u201d she explained. \u201cI see the polar bear and want to kill myself. No one wants to look at it, you know? I want to make a reason to look at it. I want to make it beautiful.\u201d Lots of artists have found potential in the \u201cdifficult woman\u201d. But Boucher goes a step further: drawing on a decade of conflict over her own visibility, she smartly taps the cultural power of the reviled woman \u2013 the fate of almost every female pop icon \u2013 and the can\u2019t-look-away spectacle of vilification: \u201cI\u2019ll just be a villain now, and that\u2019s cool,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to make that useful to society.\u201d Her goddess represents humanity\u2019s justification for its self-destruction, which goes beyond the death wish of the climate crisis to dwell uncomfortably in more intimate forms of self-annihilation: addiction, self-loathing and the internet. It is a profoundly bleak record. It shares some DNA with Soundcloud rap, the murky, malevolent sound of depression and dashed hopes, laced with sweet melodic hooks. Spiritually, too: in Delete Forever, a song about the opioid crisis written the night Lil Peep died, Boucher seems to describe the reality of beating her own addictions and having to face life unmediated: \u201cAlways down when I\u2019m not up / Guess it\u2019s just my rotten luck.\u201d Whether or not Boucher \u2013 or Grimes, or c \u2013 is in character as she sings about suicidal ideation and self-destruction, it\u2019s impossible not to think about how she has coped with the assault on her public persona over the past decade, to the degree that her recent \u2013 admittedly outr\u00e9 \u2013 pregnancy announcement was mined for gags. Love and art, by the sound of it, making Miss Anthropocene an unlikely sibling to Taylor Swift\u2019s Reputation. It\u2019s bookended by So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth, about her relationship, and Idoru, a flush of brightness and birdsong that follows the storm and cherishes how \u201cunrequited love has reassembled me\u201d. It might be sung to Musk, though it seems more likely aimed inwards \u2013 to herself, and to art. \u201cYou cannot be sad,\u201d she sings, \u201cbecause you made my all-time favourite music.\u201d Against all odds, Miss Anthropocene is a beautiful and emotionally complex album: Boucher\u2019s continuing personal testament to creativity as resistance against destruction, and an unlikely optimistic gesture that still believes art can be a powerful force for social good. It also finally finds Boucher reconciled to her relationship with the public. On Miss Anthropocene, she is a mirror, inviting us to examine the source of our bad faith.",

Today, this Manchurian Candidate-riffing conspiracy thriller is regarded as one of Doctor Who\u2019s all-time greats, from the height of Tom Baker\u2019s stripy scarf imperial phase. But you\u2019d never have guessed that from Jan Vincent-Rudzki\u2019s hatchet job, which railed against its tautological title and the rewriting of Whovian lore.</p> <p>If this seems like a funny way of showing your \u201cappreciation\u201d for something, the DWAS, as it was known, wasn\u2019t alone. Over at the rival Doctor Who Fan Club, the story also came in for a kicking. So fed up was DWFC secretary Keith Miller with the way \u201cthe programme has degenerated\u201d, that in 1978 he shut up shop altogether, asking: \u201cHow can you be president of a fan club for a programme you\u2019ve lost faith in?\u201d</p> <p>Pretty easily, as it happens. Because since when has liking Doctor Who been a prerequisite of being a Doctor Who fan? If you don\u2019t believe me, try braving Twitter after any episode airs. This series, there has been hair-pulling over everything from whether the Doctor was right to betray Sacha Dhawan\u2019s Master to the Nazis to her frozen response to Graham\u2019s cancer fears (the latter prompting the BBC to issue a rare clarification on a character\u2019s motivations).</p> <p>Even an episode as lauded as last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/27/doctor-who-recap-series-38-episode-five-fugitive-of-the-judoon\">Fugitive of the Judoon</a>, in which Jo Martin was revealed as a hitherto unseen incarnation of the Doctor, infuriated a vocal minority, aghast at how it might impact the show\u2019s continuity.

In 1966, the BBC\u2019s own audience research department published a report on the negative response to Patrick Troughton\u2019s puckish Second Doctor, with complaints that he was \u201cidiotic\u201d and \u201ca pantomime character\u201d. A few years later, Baker \u2013 the great godhead of Doctor Who \u2013 was described in the same forum as \u201ctoo stupid for words\u201d.</p> <p>The 1980s were a particularly choleric period. The BBC even provided disgruntled followers with a platform to air their grievances, with \u201csuperfan\u201d Ian Levine condemning Doctor Who as a \u201cmockery\u201d of its former self on the review show Did You See ...? (Levine also posed for an infamous press photo in which he smashed his TV with a hammer.)</p> <p>When Sylvester McCoy debuted as the Doctor in 1987, the DWAS\u2019s top dog penned a damning op-ed for the Daily Mail in which he concluded that the show was \u201cslowly, but surely, being killed.\u201d Shortly afterwards, a rare peace broke out, with fans agreeing that McCoy\u2019s later adventures were the finest the show had produced in years. Obviously, that\u2019s when the BBC cancelled it.</p> <p>When Doctor Who did eventually return 16 years later, it proved a ratings smash, under the guidance of Russell T Davies, especially the three series with David Tennant as a rock star Time Lord.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb2086b5d0fb39efaa44ffb176aae149d717d69f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb2086b5d0fb39efaa44ffb176aae149d717d69f/0_132_1966_1282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The rock star years ...

There were complaints about burping bins and farting monsters. There was endless bellyaching about \u201cDavies ex machina\u201d \u2013 the term fans adopted to describe Davies\u2019s fondness for hand-waving plot resolutions. And the outrage at Catherine Tate\u2019s casting as companion Donna Noble was so vociferous Davies was forced to speak out against \u201cthose dark corners\u201d of fandom that \u201creact as if the world is ending\u201d.</p> <p>His successor, Steven Moffat, endured similar barbs from the so-called faithful. His watch was deemed \u201ctoo complicated\u201d, though it also coincided with the rise of Twitter, a forum that has done more than anything else to amplify bizarre grudges. Naturally, when current showrunner Chris Chibnall came in and dialled down Moffat\u2019s knotty plotting, fans protested that it had become too simplistic again. </p> <p>If Doctor Who seems like a show that has been disappointing its devotees for 56 years and counting, perhaps that is to be expected. After all, no other TV series in history has shown such a wilful disregard for anything approaching a house style, happily pressing the re-set button every week and leaping between planets and time zones, comedy and tragedy, psychodrama and space opera.</p> <p>Besides, it can be healthy to mock the things we love. Half the fun of being a Doctor Who fan is celebrating those moments where the show falls short of its vaulting overambition. Which, when you\u2019re trying to map an entire universe of wonders and terrors on a BBC budget, is often. (This is the show, lest we forget, that once staged a Concorde hijack in BBC Television Centre.) </p> <p>Case in point: in 1986, two of Doctor Who\u2019s writers were subjected to a handbagging from a group of \u201cdiehard fans\u201d on BBC feedback show Open Air. Among them was a teenager who offered a quietly devastating critique of the \u201ccliched\u201d scripts full of \u201crunning up and down corridors and silly monsters\u201d. His name? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dwpageofficial/status/962776385340264448?lang=en\">Chris Chibnall</a>.</p> <p>In 2018, Chibnall dismissed his younger self\u2019s words as \u201ca load of nonsense\u201d. Maybe they were, maybe they weren\u2019t. Either way, it\u2019s a comforting reminder that, whenever anyone lifts a rock to expose those darker, damper corners of fandom Davies warned about, chances are what emerges will be a load of nonsense as well.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE MAGIC OF DOCTOR WHO?\u201d This was the question posed \u2013 in full caps \u2013 by the president of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society in its magazine, TARDIS. The year was 1977, and the story under scrutiny was The Deadly Assassin. Today, this Manchurian Candidate-riffing conspiracy thriller is regarded as one of Doctor Who\u2019s all-time greats, from the height of Tom Baker\u2019s stripy scarf imperial phase. But you\u2019d never have guessed that from Jan Vincent-Rudzki\u2019s hatchet job, which railed against its tautological title and the rewriting of Whovian lore. If this seems like a funny way of showing your \u201cappreciation\u201d for something, the DWAS, as it was known, wasn\u2019t alone. Over at the rival Doctor Who Fan Club, the story also came in for a kicking. So fed up was DWFC secretary Keith Miller with the way \u201cthe programme has degenerated\u201d, that in 1978 he shut up shop altogether, asking: \u201cHow can you be president of a fan club for a programme you\u2019ve lost faith in?\u201d Pretty easily, as it happens. Because since when has liking Doctor Who been a prerequisite of being a Doctor Who fan? If you don\u2019t believe me, try braving Twitter after any episode airs. This series, there has been hair-pulling over everything from whether the Doctor was right to betray Sacha Dhawan\u2019s Master to the Nazis to her frozen response to Graham\u2019s cancer fears (the latter prompting the BBC to issue a rare clarification on a character\u2019s motivations). Even an episode as lauded as last month\u2019s Fugitive of the Judoon, in which Jo Martin was revealed as a hitherto unseen incarnation of the Doctor, infuriated a vocal minority, aghast at how it might impact the show\u2019s continuity. Similarly, The Haunting of Villa Diodati \u2013 which even the most stubborn Who refusenik must concede was a banger \u2013 has upset some by contradicting a previous hook-up between Mary Shelley and Paul McGann\u2019s Eighth Doctor in Big Finish\u2019s audio adventures. There also exists a small but noisy rump of fandom committed to broader wailing about how \u201cwoke\u201d Doctor Who is now DEAD TO THEM (some \u2013 though not all \u2013 are fully-fledged #NotMyDoctor misogynists). But it was ever thus. In 1966, the BBC\u2019s own audience research department published a report on the negative response to Patrick Troughton\u2019s puckish Second Doctor, with complaints that he was \u201cidiotic\u201d and \u201ca pantomime character\u201d. A few years later, Baker \u2013 the great godhead of Doctor Who \u2013 was described in the same forum as \u201ctoo stupid for words\u201d. The 1980s were a particularly choleric period. The BBC even provided disgruntled followers with a platform to air their grievances, with \u201csuperfan\u201d Ian Levine condemning Doctor Who as a \u201cmockery\u201d of its former self on the review show Did You See ...? (Levine also posed for an infamous press photo in which he smashed his TV with a hammer.) When Sylvester McCoy debuted as the Doctor in 1987, the DWAS\u2019s top dog penned a damning op-ed for the Daily Mail in which he concluded that the show was \u201cslowly, but surely, being killed.\u201d Shortly afterwards, a rare peace broke out, with fans agreeing that McCoy\u2019s later adventures were the finest the show had produced in years. Obviously, that\u2019s when the BBC cancelled it. When Doctor Who did eventually return 16 years later, it proved a ratings smash, under the guidance of Russell T Davies, especially the three series with David Tennant as a rock star Time Lord. But Doctor Who fans weren\u2019t put on this Earth to enjoy Doctor Who \u2013 or, god forbid, agree with mere viewers. There were complaints about burping bins and farting monsters. There was endless bellyaching about \u201cDavies ex machina\u201d \u2013 the term fans adopted to describe Davies\u2019s fondness for hand-waving plot resolutions. And the outrage at Catherine Tate\u2019s casting as companion Donna Noble was so vociferous Davies was forced to speak out against \u201cthose dark corners\u201d of fandom that \u201creact as if the world is ending\u201d. His successor, Steven Moffat, endured similar barbs from the so-called faithful. His watch was deemed \u201ctoo complicated\u201d, though it also coincided with the rise of Twitter, a forum that has done more than anything else to amplify bizarre grudges. Naturally, when current showrunner Chris Chibnall came in and dialled down Moffat\u2019s knotty plotting, fans protested that it had become too simplistic again. If Doctor Who seems like a show that has been disappointing its devotees for 56 years and counting, perhaps that is to be expected. After all, no other TV series in history has shown such a wilful disregard for anything approaching a house style, happily pressing the re-set button every week and leaping between planets and time zones, comedy and tragedy, psychodrama and space opera. Besides, it can be healthy to mock the things we love. Half the fun of being a Doctor Who fan is celebrating those moments where the show falls short of its vaulting overambition. Which, when you\u2019re trying to map an entire universe of wonders and terrors on a BBC budget, is often. (This is the show, lest we forget, that once staged a Concorde hijack in BBC Television Centre.) Case in point: in 1986, two of Doctor Who\u2019s writers were subjected to a handbagging from a group of \u201cdiehard fans\u201d on BBC feedback show Open Air. Among them was a teenager who offered a quietly devastating critique of the \u201ccliched\u201d scripts full of \u201crunning up and down corridors and silly monsters\u201d. His name? Chris Chibnall. In 2018, Chibnall dismissed his younger self\u2019s words as \u201ca load of nonsense\u201d. Maybe they were, maybe they weren\u2019t. Either way, it\u2019s a comforting reminder that, whenever anyone lifts a rock to expose those darker, damper corners of fandom Davies warned about, chances are what emerges will be a load of nonsense as well. Any show that continues to provoke such passionate debate is clearly doing something right. It\u2019s when the arguments stop he needs to worry.",

For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Flooding not only wrecks businesses, destroys homes and disrupts everyday life but also causes long-lasting and dangerous levels of stress, residents from flood-hit communities have said. Hundreds of homes have been flooded and six people are thought to have died across England and Wales after heavy downpours and successive storms further exposed the fragility of flood defences and the gravity of the climate emergency. More flooding is expected as river levels continue to threaten to breach barriers. People in flood-hit areas are grappling with a seemingly relentless onslaught of extreme weather conditions, and are making preparations for the future while having to deal with the present consequences. \u201cI am lucky, only one room of my house was flooded, but some people have had to leave everything,\u201d Amanda Gillender, a 71-year-old painter from Eardisland on the River Arrow in Herefordshire, told the Guardian. The scale of the flooding in Gillender\u2019s village has been unprecedented and there are record levels of water in rivers nearby. She fears life there may become untenable if the climate crisis is not taken seriously. But for now, her most immediate concern is dealing with her insurance claim as she assesses the damage to her 500-year old cottage. \u201cThe worst thing about flooding is the waiting and watching as the water rises foot after foot deep,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do. Once it has happened you\u2019re completely isolated because you can\u2019t go out and are left alone with the painful, disruptive aftermath.\u201d Elsewhere, the cumulative stress is having a grave impact on communities. \u201cThere are thousands of small human stories of stress, worry and disappointment,\u201d said Rachel Buchanan, from the Ludlow area in Shropshire. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking at river level websites now before going out. It just makes everyone a little less willing to leave their home.\u201d People are being prevented from getting to work and social events, caring for family members and attending to livestock, and are becoming ever more lonely, Buchanan believes. \u201cYou become slightly more isolated as the effects of the flooding encroach on everyday life,\u201d she said. \u201cA friend of mine who is a single mother simply won\u2019t go out now. Small businesses are losing a day or a week of work and the roads are crumbling \u2013 it\u2019s a mess.\u201d All across the UK, flooding has become more frequent and the impact can be felt years later. While insurance agents visit to assess how much compensation is to be paid out, houses in areas not previously classified as being at risk of flooding are revalued. \u201cOne of our neighbours lost \u00a370,000 in value,\u201d says Ian Young, a father of two who lives with his partner on the Isle of Man and who was affected by flooding last year. \u201cWe lost both our cars and did not receive market value for them. Our premiums went through the roof as they had to go down as at-fault claims even though the vehicles were parked on the driveway and we weren\u2019t in them.\u201d He and his family have been living in temporary accommodation since the beginning of October and work to repair his property, the ground floor of which was completely flooded, has only just begun. \u201cIt was absolutely horrific,\u201d he said. \u201cYou spend years trying to build up your life centred around your home and garden and then you\u2019re kicked out.

He outlined the government\u2019s red lines but gave none of the detail that would be expected from parties about to embark on trade talks.</p> \n<p>EU member states are due to confirm the bloc\u2019s negotiating objectives at a meeting next week but the UK\u2019s plans to publish a mirror document next week have reportedly been cancelled.</p> \n<p>De Rynck said: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly also looking forward to the UK document that was promised for next week.

It also increases quotas \u2013 the amount of a product that can be exported without extra charges \u2013 but does not remove them entirely.</p> \n<p>The UK is in a transition period, after leaving the EU on 31 January, and has until the end of the year to hammer out a trade deal with Brussels. Until then, the country still follows the majority of EU rules.</p> \n<p>Highlighting the potential difficulty of negotiating in a tight timeframe, De Rynck said: \u201cWe have a vast amount of work and we seem to have 10 months to do it, or less than 10 months if you calculate the time for ratification so that everybody can be ready on January 1, 2021 for the new regime.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would expect some of these negotiations to be rather difficult, perhaps more difficult that during withdrawal because the scope of issues is so much vaster.\u201d</p>",

He outlined the government\u2019s red lines but gave none of the detail that would be expected from parties about to embark on trade talks. EU member states are due to confirm the bloc\u2019s negotiating objectives at a meeting next week but the UK\u2019s plans to publish a mirror document next week have reportedly been cancelled. De Rynck said: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly also looking forward to the UK document that was promised for next week. We, of course, have read the speeches that were given over the last week, also by the prime minister in Greenwich on the 3rd of February and other statements \u2026 \u201cOne written document that came out on the 3rd of February was the ministerial statement, which I cannot hide from you is a source of some concern in terms of the level of ambition of the political declaration not perhaps being fully met always by what is said in that ministerial statement. \u201cNotably on issues such as level playing field, the court of justice and internal security cooperation, the overarching governance framework which we have agreed with the United Kingdom.\u201d Canada\u2019s deal with the EU, which took seven years to negotiate, eliminates most import tariffs on goods but not all. It also increases quotas \u2013 the amount of a product that can be exported without extra charges \u2013 but does not remove them entirely. The UK is in a transition period, after leaving the EU on 31 January, and has until the end of the year to hammer out a trade deal with Brussels. Until then, the country still follows the majority of EU rules. Highlighting the potential difficulty of negotiating in a tight timeframe, De Rynck said: \u201cWe have a vast amount of work and we seem to have 10 months to do it, or less than 10 months if you calculate the time for ratification so that everybody can be ready on January 1, 2021 for the new regime. \u201cI would expect some of these negotiations to be rather difficult, perhaps more difficult that during withdrawal because the scope of issues is so much vaster.\u201d",

You should have expected a negative outcome the way the system is designed.\u2019 But we didn\u2019t believe that.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe worked very hard.

It was hard because we did this in the context of information being leaked to the media in the context of feeling that every step of the way, every engagement we had, we felt that we were considered guilty before anything was even discussed.

We are a sustainable football club, we are profitable, we don\u2019t have debt, our accounts have been scrutinised many times, by auditors, by regulators, by investors and this is perfectly clear.\u201d</p> \n<p>Soriano tried to distance the investigatory chamber from the rest of Uefa. \u201cThe experience with this FFP IC has been negative for us, more than what I would have imagined. But this is not Uefa. We are not talking about the whole of Uefa, which is an association of associations. I personally know many people that work at Uefa, very hard for the benefit of Uefa, but also for the benefit of the clubs of Uefa like ours, but also for the benefit of football. If the negative experience that we had and the way this process went is negative, it is negative also for them. Uefa is much bigger than this FFP Chamber.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ferran Soriano has claimed Manchester City\u2019s two-year Champions League ban is \u201cless about justice and more about politics\u201d. The chief executive is the first club figure to speak since City were found to have seriously misled Uefa and broken financial fair play rules. The Premier League champions, who were also fined \u20ac30m (\u00a325m), say they are innocent and are to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport. \u201cBased on our experience and our perception this seems to be less about justice and more about politics,\u201d Sorriano told City\u2019s website, without explaining what politics he was referring to. He added: \u201cOf course a lot of people come now and say: \u2018Well what were you expecting? This is the way it works. You should have expected a negative outcome the way the system is designed.\u2019 But we didn\u2019t believe that. \u201cWe worked very hard. We provided the evidence but in the end this FFP investigatory chamber relied more on out-of-context stolen emails than all the other evidence we provided of what actually happened and I think it is normal that we feel like we feel.\u201d Emails were published by Der Speigel, a German media outlet. Soriano, who described the players as calm and focused, hopes the appeal to the Cas will be heard swiftly. He said: \u201cWe are looking for an early resolution obviously through a thorough process and a fair process, so my best hope is that this will be finished before the beginning of the summer and until then for us, it is business as usual.\u201d Soriano also dismissed the ruling by the adjudicatory chamber of Uefa\u2019s club financial control body (CFCB) that City failed to co-operate in the investigation. \u201cWe did co-operate with this process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe delivered a long list of documents and support that we believe is irrefutable evidence that the claims are not true. It was hard because we did this in the context of information being leaked to the media in the context of feeling that every step of the way, every engagement we had, we felt that we were considered guilty before anything was even discussed. But at the end, this is an internal process that has been initiated and then prosecuted and then judged by this FFP chamber at Uefa.\u201d The chair of the investigatory committee, Yves Leterme, has strongly denied leaks or \u201cunlawful activities\u201d by the CFBC. Soriano reiterated City\u2019s insistence that they have done nothing wrong. \u201cThese allegations are simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cThe owner has not put money in this club that has not been properly declared. We are a sustainable football club, we are profitable, we don\u2019t have debt, our accounts have been scrutinised many times, by auditors, by regulators, by investors and this is perfectly clear.\u201d Soriano tried to distance the investigatory chamber from the rest of Uefa. \u201cThe experience with this FFP IC has been negative for us, more than what I would have imagined. But this is not Uefa. We are not talking about the whole of Uefa, which is an association of associations. I personally know many people that work at Uefa, very hard for the benefit of Uefa, but also for the benefit of the clubs of Uefa like ours, but also for the benefit of football. If the negative experience that we had and the way this process went is negative, it is negative also for them. Uefa is much bigger than this FFP Chamber.\u201d",

And without a national donor base like Sanders or the ability to transfer unused money from a 2018 Senate account like Elizabeth Warren, Buttigieg managed to raise an <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/candidate?id=N00044183\">impressive $75m in 2019</a>.</p> <p>Butigieg has been in the upper ranks of the Democratic contenders for so long that we forget how unprecedented his ascent has been.</p> <p>Barack Obama had been in the US Senate for three years and had electrified the 2004 Democratic convention before he beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Iowa caucuses. When <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-dean-pulls-away-in-dem-race/\">Howard Dean</a> dominated the polls in late 2003 as an antiwar candidate, he had already served 11 years as Vermont\u2019s governor.

      "bodyText": "Three former mayors will stand behind dueling lecterns in Las Vegas during Wednesday night\u2019s Democratic debate. Had three-term Vermont senator Bernie Sanders remained the socialist mayor of tiny Burlington (population: 42,899), he almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be running for president. Debate newcomer Mike Bloomberg is, of course, the former three-term mayor of New York. And the political resume of Indiana\u2019s Pete Buttigieg \u2013 currently the delegate leader in the Democratic race \u2013 is built around two terms as mayor of South Bend (population: 101,860), which is about one-80th of Bloomberg\u2019s former domain. It has been more that 11 months since Buttigieg burst into the presidential conversation last March with a boffo performance in a CNN televised town hall. By mid-April, when Buttigieg formally declared his candidacy (\u201cI recognize the audacity of doing this as a midwestern millennial mayor\u201d), he was already the second most frequently discussed Democratic contender on cable TV news. While other high-altitude candidates such as Beto O\u2019Rourke and Kamala Harris followed an Icarus-like trajectory, Buttigieg kept flying above the tree line. And without a national donor base like Sanders or the ability to transfer unused money from a 2018 Senate account like Elizabeth Warren, Buttigieg managed to raise an impressive $75m in 2019. Butigieg has been in the upper ranks of the Democratic contenders for so long that we forget how unprecedented his ascent has been. Barack Obama had been in the US Senate for three years and had electrified the 2004 Democratic convention before he beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Iowa caucuses. When Howard Dean dominated the polls in late 2003 as an antiwar candidate, he had already served 11 years as Vermont\u2019s governor. And long shot Gary Hart (who finished second in Iowa and won the New Hampshire primary in 1984) was in his second Senate term, after having managed George McGovern\u2019s 1972 presidential campaign. In contrast, all Buttigieg could offer is a failed statewide race for Indiana state treasurer (not exactly a traditional launching pad to greatness) and a half-noticed 2017 bid for Democratic party chair, withdrawing with scant support before the votes were cast. It is easy to be dismissive about Buttigieg\u2019s flyweight prior record, especially since three candidates on the Las Vegas debate stage (Sanders, Bloomberg and Joe Biden) are more than twice his age of 38. If Buttigieg ends up bathed in confetti at the Democratic convention in Milwaukee \u2013 which remains a plausible outcome \u2013 he would have less big-time political experience than any Democratic nominee since Alton Parker in 1904, who was a New York state judge. I will confess to starting as a Buttigieg skeptic. When a Wall Street friend announced at a small dinner party late last spring that he would be raising money for Buttigieg, my initial reaction was: \u201cDon\u2019t be absurd.\u201d But after two 30-minute interviews with Buttigieg (plus an on-the-record bus trip across Iowa in September with about a dozen other reporters), I have gained an appreciation for his intellect and his thoughtful approach to contemplating the White House. Sure, I wish that Buttigieg were maybe a decade older \u2013 and he had spent that time mastering Washington. But to rewrite a line of Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s: \u201cYou go into the primaries with the candidates you have, not the candidates you might want.\u201d Many of the critiques of Buttigieg seem over-wrought. His choice as a Rhodes scholar to join the management consulting firm McKinsey always struck me as more about continuing to collect gold stars than any hidden belief in rapacious capitalism. Buttigieg\u2019s 2012 decision to fire South Bend\u2019s first black police chief appears to have been badly mishandled. But heading into the South Carolina primary, with its majority African American Democratic electorate, Buttigieg\u2019s missteps seem small compared to Bloomberg\u2019s zealous advocacy of stop-and-frisk until late in his final term as mayor. In the days ahead, Buttigieg will face a series of tests that approximate the pressures of the presidency. Can he come across as a compelling presence in two debates within six days (the other is in Charleston, South Carolina, next Tuesday)? Did he build a political organization from scratch that can stand the rigors of the 3 March Super Tuesday primaries in 14 states? And will he continue to keep a cool head as the campaign inevitably grows ugly? Buttigieg\u2019s first major test came when Rush Limbaugh \u2013 that Trumpian embodiment of America\u2019s greatness \u2013 made a typically homophobic remark on his radio show that \u201cAmerica\u2019s still not ready to elect a gay guy kissing his husband on the debate stage president\u201d. The response from Buttigieg \u2013 the nation\u2019s first openly gay major presidential candidate \u2013 was pitch perfect: \u201cI love my husband.

      "bodyText": "House prices have increased in every region in the UK for the first time in two years, as the Conservative party\u2019s election victory and a more settled economic outlook calmed buyers\u2019 nerves. House price data compiled by the Land Registry showed average annual house prices increased by 2.2% in December, up from 1.7% in November. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the pattern of falling house price growth since the 2016 EU referendum was reversed last summer in some regions in the north and east of England. December was the first month since February 2018 that prices increased in all regions and countries. The average UK house price hit \u00a3235,000, \u00a35,000 higher than in December 2018. David Westgate, the chief executive at Andrews Property Group, said: \u201cFor all regions to have delivered positive annual growth for the first time in nearly two years highlights just how resilient the UK property market has been against a backdrop of extreme political uncertainty.\u201d London prices rose 2.3% year on year in December, which was the strongest rise since October 2017 and a second successive annual increase. Figures last month revealed that prices increased after a surge in the sales of expensive homes in London\u2019s most sought-after districts. In the past year 185 \u00a35m-plus mortgages were taken out by purchasers, according to figures from the Financial Conduct Authority. The value of those mortgages was \u00a39.7m on average and the total was \u00a31.8bn, an increase of \u00a3200m on the previous year. The ONS said: \u201cIncreased London house price growth may reflect a larger shift in the type of properties being sold than usual, with more sales of very high value properties.\u201d Westgate said: \u201cWhile the London figure may have been skewed slightly by sales of extremely high value properties, the capital as a whole appears to have rediscovered its mojo. \u201cThere\u2019s every chance the rebound in sentiment in the capital will cause a ripple effect across the regions.\u201d Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the latest sales data from the Halifax and the Nationwide pointed to a further firming in house prices in January. \u201cRecent data and surveys suggest that the housing market is changing up a gear after a largely lacklustre 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is certainly a fair degree of evidence that the housing market has got an initial leg-up from increased optimism and reduced uncertainties following the decisive general election result as well as greater near-term clarity on Brexit, with the UK leaving the EU on 31 January with a deal.\u201d The latest Bank of England data showed mortgage approvals for house purchases rose markedly in December to 67,241, the highest monthly level since July 2017. Mortgage approvals in December were also most probably lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainty among buyers and sellers after the decisive general election result, said Archer. Average house prices increased over the year in England to \u00a3252,000, up 2.2%, and increased by the same amount in Wales to \u00a3166,000. Average prices in Scotland were up 2.2%, to \u00a3152,000, and 2.5% in Northern Ireland. In England, Yorkshire and the Humber registered the highest annual house price growth, increasing by 3.9% in the year to December. This was followed by the East Midlands, with a 2.8% increase.

      "body": "<p>Coleridge once described poetry as \u201cwild ducks <em>shaping </em>their rapid flight in forms always regular\u201d. That\u2019s one way of looking at literature, everything unusual being absorbed into the larger flight pattern of a given work. But another perspective might focus less on the regular forms than on the wild ducks. This way of looking at literature places the onus on the random encounter \u2013 the moment when one duck peels off.</p> <p>Some of the ducks in my poetry book go back around a decade. I can barely remember the person I was 10 years ago, except for the fact we share a lot of the same clothes. Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz\u2019s poem <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49457/encounter-56d22b901521b\">Encounter</a> makes me feel better about this. Here, the speaker recalls an old memory as though watching himself in a film adaptation of his life: \u201cWhere are they, where are they going.\u201d</p> <p>It reminds me that poems, even at their most personal, come from outside. They begin not with self-expression \u2013 or not just that \u2013 but with surprise. An encounter with the unknown.</p> <p>There was a point in the writing of my new poetry collection <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/rendang-9781783785599.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">RENDANG</a> when I let myself trust to random encounters. I stopped thinking about what I wanted to say and started reacting to what was being said around me. I wrote about the \u201choly man\u201d I met near Piccadilly Circus, and the sad divorcee in Wetherspoons. Like Mi\u0142osz, I tried to imagine encountering myself for the first time.</p> <p>The books and poems below all helped me to imagine the self as a collision point: less a regular flock of ducks than a space where ducks meet and disappear.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/great-expectations-9780007350872.html\">Great Expectations by Charles Dickens</a><br></strong>Victorian novels often have random encounters at their heart, but Pip\u2019s childhood meeting with Magwitch, in a graveyard on Christmas Eve, holds a special place. It\u2019s what changes Pip\u2019s fortunes without him realising and takes him away from his life among the \u201copen marshes\u201d. Dickens\u2019 novel<em> </em>is a parable of class and capitalism: Pip is magically lifted out of poverty and then left stranded when he\u2019s made aware of the illicit origins of his wealth.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v12/n21/marina-warner/that-which-is-spoken\">The Virago Book of Fairy Tales, edited by Angela Carter</a> (1990)<br></strong>In her introduction, Carter writes that \u201cfor most of human history, \u2018literature\u2019, both fiction and poetry, has been narrated, not written \u2013 heard, not read\u201d. This pathbreaking anthology casts its net beyond Europe and, in centring the voices of women, changes how we read fairytales. Instead of Snow White, there\u2019s Nourie Hadig, the princess of Adana, and a Chinese variant on Cinderella called Beauty and Pock Face. Life is wildly unpredictable, a random encounter with a witch or passing villager always about to change everything.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/an-area-of-darkness-9780330522830.html\">An Area of Darkness by VS Naipaul</a><br></strong>Growing up in Port of Spain, Trinidad, Naipaul first travelled to India in 1962 to track down any remaining family and spend a year in the country of his parents\u2019 birth. If his later travel writing could be cold and reactionary, here it burns with examined self-contempt. It\u2019s flawed as an essay about another country and culture, but as an encounter with the self \u2013 and what it means to have a mixed heritage \u2013 it brings the unknown and difficult to the surface.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53709/tan-tien\">Tan Tien by Mei-mei Berssenbrugge</a><br></strong>This is the kind of poem that creates a space inside of you, \u201cthe way a round arch can give onto a red wall\u201d. Berssenbrugge slips in and out of an eerie yet intimate third person. It could be the story of a Chinese-looking tourist visiting the Temple of Heaven in Beijing and feeling adrift. As in the work of Asian American avant-garde poet Myung Mi Kim, the ruptures in syntax become a way of exploring a differently textured self, familiar and foreign depending on the context.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c29a1b14a12787fe69400a1cdbb2d6215493ce49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c29a1b14a12787fe69400a1cdbb2d6215493ce49/999_0_2918_3648/800.jpg\" alt=\"statue of the Ancient Mariner at Watchet harbour\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strange power of speech \u2026 statue of the Ancient Mariner at Watchet harbour in Somerset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phoebe Taplin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43997/the-rime-of-the-ancient-mariner-text-of-1834\">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a></strong><em><strong><br></strong></em>In Coleridge\u2019s ballad, the mariner is a man consumed with guilt after shooting down an albatross \u2013 an act both pointedly cruel and random that leads to the deaths of his shipmates at sea. Bound to confess his sin again and again, he corners a wedding guest outside a church who\u2019s transfixed by his \u201cstrange power of speech\u201d. It\u2019s a story about why we tell stories and what little relief they bring.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/705-all-that-is-solid-melts-into-air\">All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity by Marshall Berman</a><br></strong>Berman writes about growing up in New York City, one of the wealthiest places on Earth, surrounded by ruins, with a feeling of \u201cemptiness in a place designed for over-fullness\u201d. He calls this systematic assault on a community \u201curbicide\u201d. But his writing also glows with optimism about what can happen when a community opposes itself to the forces of capital, when \u201cthe multitude of solitudes that make up the modern city come together in a new kind of encounter, to make a <em>people</em>\u201d. Random encounters are the basis of urban solidarity.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/andre-breton-807\">Manifesto of Surrealism by Andr\u00e9 Breton</a></strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>(1924)<br></strong>Surrealism is much more than lobster telephones. This is how Andr\u00e9 Breton puts it in the first sentence of his manifesto: \u201cSo strong is the belief in life, in what is most fragile in life \u2013 <em>real </em>life, I mean \u2013 that in the end this belief is lost.\u201d The really random encounter happens not between two wilfully disparate objects (say, a banana and a blow torch) but between those domains of thought usually separated by polite society. It\u2019s about making art open to an encounter with politics and desire, to \u201cwhat is most fragile in life\u201d.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ulysses-9780199535675.html\">Ulysses by James Joyce</a><br></strong>After some 370 pages charting the \u201cparallel courses\u201d of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom across Dublin, they meet by chance at a maternity hospital on Holles Street. Leopold has gone to check on Mina Purefoy, who is about to give birth. Stephen and his friends are drinking. Their meeting happens in the midst of a potted history of English prose style, with their encounter rendered in the \u201ceftsoons\u201d style of Malory\u2019s Morte d\u2019Arthur \u2013 a tale that itself deals with the Grail quest among other strange encounters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/25/top-10-books-about-escape-from-captivity-toby-litt-jane-austen\">Top 10 books about escape from captivity | Toby Litt</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/30/books/last-tango.html\">The Beauty of the Husband by Anne Carson</a><br></strong>The random encounter here is between two different kinds of text: there\u2019s the story of a marriage breaking down, and there are lots of quotations \u2013 presented as epigraphs \u2013 from Keats. How they relate is never made explicit, but there are moments when they touch. In trying to make sense of her heartbreak, the speaker tries to understand beauty \u2013 \u201cTerrible risks. / Ray would have said\u201d \u2013 before concluding on a Keats-y note: \u201cHold beauty.\u201d</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sir-gawain-and-the-green-knight-9781783525607.html\">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a><br></strong>To read an anonymous tale from the 14th century is to encounter something otherworldly. In this case, it just so happens that tale also involves a green-hued, big-bearded man who arrives at the court of King Arthur and challenges anyone to try hacking his head off \u2013 the only catch being that he\u2019ll return the favour next year. The rest of the story delves into the various forms of violence, politesse and desire that bind us. To read it involves opening yourself up to both the strangeness of the language and the story\u2019s final irresolution.</p> <p>\u2022 RENDANG by Will Harris is published by Granta Books (\u00a310.99).

Random encounters are the basis of urban solidarity. 7. Manifesto of Surrealism by Andr\u00e9 Breton (1924) Surrealism is much more than lobster telephones. This is how Andr\u00e9 Breton puts it in the first sentence of his manifesto: \u201cSo strong is the belief in life, in what is most fragile in life \u2013 real life, I mean \u2013 that in the end this belief is lost.\u201d The really random encounter happens not between two wilfully disparate objects (say, a banana and a blow torch) but between those domains of thought usually separated by polite society. It\u2019s about making art open to an encounter with politics and desire, to \u201cwhat is most fragile in life\u201d. 8. Ulysses by James Joyce After some 370 pages charting the \u201cparallel courses\u201d of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom across Dublin, they meet by chance at a maternity hospital on Holles Street. Leopold has gone to check on Mina Purefoy, who is about to give birth. Stephen and his friends are drinking. Their meeting happens in the midst of a potted history of English prose style, with their encounter rendered in the \u201ceftsoons\u201d style of Malory\u2019s Morte d\u2019Arthur \u2013 a tale that itself deals with the Grail quest among other strange encounters. 9. The Beauty of the Husband by Anne Carson The random encounter here is between two different kinds of text: there\u2019s the story of a marriage breaking down, and there are lots of quotations \u2013 presented as epigraphs \u2013 from Keats. How they relate is never made explicit, but there are moments when they touch. In trying to make sense of her heartbreak, the speaker tries to understand beauty \u2013 \u201cTerrible risks. / Ray would have said\u201d \u2013 before concluding on a Keats-y note: \u201cHold beauty.\u201d 10. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight To read an anonymous tale from the 14th century is to encounter something otherworldly. In this case, it just so happens that tale also involves a green-hued, big-bearded man who arrives at the court of King Arthur and challenges anyone to try hacking his head off \u2013 the only catch being that he\u2019ll return the favour next year. The rest of the story delves into the various forms of violence, politesse and desire that bind us. To read it involves opening yourself up to both the strangeness of the language and the story\u2019s final irresolution. \u2022 RENDANG by Will Harris is published by Granta Books (\u00a310.99).

Surely you wouldn\u2019t make them in the way the world is constituted today?\u201d</p> \n<p>We live in a world where your gender, race and class shape whether you can move and how you\u2019re treated if you do. While many of us strive to change that, too many of our politicians are entrenching that system and making things worse. This is precisely what the Conservatives\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/18/uk-to-close-door-to-non-english-speakers-and-unskilled-workers\" title=\"\">immigration proposals would do</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This is a hardening of an immigration system that\u2019s already built on elitism</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>While a lot of the plans themselves aren\u2019t new and are lacking in details, how they\u2019re packaged tells us a lot. One of the government\u2019s headline policies is that people coming into the country will \u201chave to speak English\u201d. This dog whistle is depressingly familiar: a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4241989.stm\" title=\"\">decade after New Labour</a> announced a \u201cpoints system\u201d that included English tests, in 2015 the Labour leader Ed Miliband used it when he said speaking English was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/18/new-immigrants-must-speak-english-says-miliband\" title=\"\">something we should expect from everyone who comes here</a>\u201d. For decades politicians have turned to the English language as a symbol to show they are willing to be tough on immigrants and say \u201chard things\u201d when they need to.</p> \n<p>It ceases to matter that most migrants already speak English, that language diversity is positive for all kinds of reasons, or that someone\u2019s ability to move shouldn\u2019t be contingent on their knowledge of a particular language (there\u2019s far less focus on this when it comes to English speakers not knowing other languages in countries all around the world).

Surely you wouldn\u2019t make them in the way the world is constituted today?\u201d We live in a world where your gender, race and class shape whether you can move and how you\u2019re treated if you do. While many of us strive to change that, too many of our politicians are entrenching that system and making things worse. This is precisely what the Conservatives\u2019 immigration proposals would do. While a lot of the plans themselves aren\u2019t new and are lacking in details, how they\u2019re packaged tells us a lot. One of the government\u2019s headline policies is that people coming into the country will \u201chave to speak English\u201d. This dog whistle is depressingly familiar: a decade after New Labour announced a \u201cpoints system\u201d that included English tests, in 2015 the Labour leader Ed Miliband used it when he said speaking English was \u201csomething we should expect from everyone who comes here\u201d. For decades politicians have turned to the English language as a symbol to show they are willing to be tough on immigrants and say \u201chard things\u201d when they need to. It ceases to matter that most migrants already speak English, that language diversity is positive for all kinds of reasons, or that someone\u2019s ability to move shouldn\u2019t be contingent on their knowledge of a particular language (there\u2019s far less focus on this when it comes to English speakers not knowing other languages in countries all around the world). Some of the same people who might encourage their children to live and work abroad for a year to improve their French or Mandarin boast about policies that\u2019ll decide who can and can\u2019t come into the country on the basis of their English skills. Learning other languages is something we should all have the time and opportunity to do \u2013 one survey suggested 62% of British people only speak English. But we all know these proposals are nothing to do with that at all because they don\u2019t even pretend to be. Instead, they\u2019re based on deeply xeno-racist grounds \u2013 that is a racism \u201cdirected at the displaced, the dispossessed and the uprooted\u201d. Politicians claim English language skills are necessary for \u201cintegration\u201d, a highly racialised term that swiftly becomes forgotten when the focus of these plans is on temporary visas. That is, the documents that put a time limit on how long people can be here, thus getting in the way of relationships they\u2019ve built, friends they\u2019ve made and people they\u2019ve fallen in love with. How are immigrants supposed to \u201cintegrate\u201d when they never know for sure how long they will be allowed to stay? The logic for one immigration policy is often the opposite of another. Yet, it\u2019s all presented as perfectly sensible. In a fit of supposed egalitarianism, Boris Johnson announced at the start of the year that he wanted to make an immigration system that was \u201cpeople over passports\u201d.

That\u2019s the big question hovering around Major League Baseball as commissioner Rob Manfred makes a futile attempt to move on from one of the biggest scandals in league history.

Furthermore, it\u2019s hard to know exactly what steps the league could possibly take when faced with a scandal quite this big. Maybe a bold, transformative commissioner could have used this crisis as a way to make a bold, transformative move, but Manfred chose the path that he hoped would cause the least resistance: release a report, pin the blame on a few bad actors, and try to quickly move on.</p> <h2>What will happen when the games begin?</h2> <p>Well, when Manfred was discussing how he wanted there to be more drama in baseball, it\u2019s pretty certain he wasn\u2019t thinking about this. Right now, the Astros are the number one topic at the start of Spring Training, for all the wrong reasons.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad for baseball,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/mike-trout-astros-scandal-sad-for-baseball/pgoii6tzm7jx1f4nxix6zctas\">said the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 Mike Trout</a>, nearly universally regarded as the best player in the game, \u201cIt\u2019s tough. They cheated. I don\u2019t agree with the punishments, the players not getting anything. It was a player-driven thing.\u201d</p> <p>The Atlanta Braves\u2019 Nick Markakis went even further, suggesting there may be violence in store. \u201cI feel like every single guy over there needs a beating. It\u2019s wrong. They\u2019re messing with people\u2019s careers,\u201d he said this week.</p> <h2>What could he be talking about?</h2> <p>It\u2019s clear that there are at least discussions of possible in-game retaliation against the Astros. The hottest Spring Training topic has been about whether or not opposing pitchers would throw at Astros batters who were implicated in the scheme. Dodgers pitcher Ross Stripling, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28708155/dusty-baker-urges-mlb-protect-astros-beanballs-retaliation\">explicitly discussed the possibility</a>. \u201cI would lean towards yes. In the right time and the right place.\u201d</p> <h2>Is there a precedent here?</h2> <p>Yes, it\u2019s called the entire history of professional baseball.</p> <p>There are <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2019/07/06/baseball-unwritten-rules-major-league/1634594001/\">the so-called unwritten rules</a> in the game about proper decorum on the field. Most commonly, perceived infractions will lead to pitchers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/12/mlb-beanballs-baseball-traditions-rules-change\">deliberately hitting</a> opposing batters. Runners have also been known to take out players with dirty takeout slides (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/68458/baseball-wises-up-finally-eliminates-the-dirty-takeout-slide\">Chase Utley, we\u2019re looking at you)</a>. These situations often escalate into on-field brawls. Pitchers are known for throwing at opponents for such supposed violations as \u201cadmiring a home run for a split-second too long\u201d or \u201cexpressing excitement about doing something good to help one\u2019s team win a baseball game.\u201d The Astros\u2019 violations seem to be of a somewhat higher order.</p> <h2>What has been the response to all this talk?</h2> <p>The Astros have spent these last few weeks hiding behind respected veteran manager Dusty Baker, who was brought in to replace the suspended and fired AJ Hinch. Baker, who had zero involvement with the Astros organization during the years in question, has understandably not been happy about talk of revenge against his players. \u201cI\u2019m depending on the league to try to put a stop to this seemingly premeditated retaliation that I\u2019m hearing about,\u201d he said last weekend.</p> <p>Manfred has put the hammer down. \u201cIt is simply not appropriate to express whatever frustration you may have growing out of the Astros situation by putting someone physically at risk by throwing at them,\u201d <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/02/16/rob-manfred-will-issue-warning-to-mlb-teams-about-plunking-astros-hitters/\">he said</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s just not acceptable.\u201d</p> <h2>Could players actually be hurt?</h2> <p>Maybe, maybe not. But nothing good is going to come out of this either way. Knowing what we know now about the lasting impacts of head trauma, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to justify retaliation by pitchers at opposing batters, regardless of the situation. Manfred is very correct to go on the record as saying that intentionally throwing at Astros players won\u2019t be tolerated.</p> <h2>But some would argue that the league is protecting cheats \u2026</h2> <p>Yes! Also this. There\u2019s a very good chance that the way Manfred has handled the entire scandal has all but guaranteed that there will be some sort of on-field violence coming. Heck, maybe it will be good for the ratings, I\u2019m sure he has number-crunchers working to figure out if that would be the case.</p> <h2>So what happens next?</h2> <p>We won\u2019t know until the games start but Dodgers pitcher Alex Wood has probably mapped out the end game <a href=\"https://dodgerblue.com/dodgers-news-alex-wood-prediction-ironic-situation-astros-thrown-at-retaliation/2020/02/15/\">for this scenario</a>: \u201cSomebody will take it into their own hands, and they\u2019ll get suspended more games than any of those guys got for the biggest cheating scandal in 100 years.\u201d</p>",

Maybe a bold, transformative commissioner could have used this crisis as a way to make a bold, transformative move, but Manfred chose the path that he hoped would cause the least resistance: release a report, pin the blame on a few bad actors, and try to quickly move on. What will happen when the games begin? Well, when Manfred was discussing how he wanted there to be more drama in baseball, it\u2019s pretty certain he wasn\u2019t thinking about this. Right now, the Astros are the number one topic at the start of Spring Training, for all the wrong reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s sad for baseball,\u201d said the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 Mike Trout, nearly universally regarded as the best player in the game, \u201cIt\u2019s tough. They cheated. I don\u2019t agree with the punishments, the players not getting anything. It was a player-driven thing.\u201d The Atlanta Braves\u2019 Nick Markakis went even further, suggesting there may be violence in store. \u201cI feel like every single guy over there needs a beating. It\u2019s wrong. They\u2019re messing with people\u2019s careers,\u201d he said this week. What could he be talking about? It\u2019s clear that there are at least discussions of possible in-game retaliation against the Astros. The hottest Spring Training topic has been about whether or not opposing pitchers would throw at Astros batters who were implicated in the scheme. Dodgers pitcher Ross Stripling, explicitly discussed the possibility. \u201cI would lean towards yes. In the right time and the right place.\u201d Is there a precedent here? Yes, it\u2019s called the entire history of professional baseball. There are the so-called unwritten rules in the game about proper decorum on the field. Most commonly, perceived infractions will lead to pitchers deliberately hitting opposing batters. Runners have also been known to take out players with dirty takeout slides (Chase Utley, we\u2019re looking at you). These situations often escalate into on-field brawls. Pitchers are known for throwing at opponents for such supposed violations as \u201cadmiring a home run for a split-second too long\u201d or \u201cexpressing excitement about doing something good to help one\u2019s team win a baseball game.\u201d The Astros\u2019 violations seem to be of a somewhat higher order. What has been the response to all this talk? The Astros have spent these last few weeks hiding behind respected veteran manager Dusty Baker, who was brought in to replace the suspended and fired AJ Hinch. Baker, who had zero involvement with the Astros organization during the years in question, has understandably not been happy about talk of revenge against his players. \u201cI\u2019m depending on the league to try to put a stop to this seemingly premeditated retaliation that I\u2019m hearing about,\u201d he said last weekend. Manfred has put the hammer down. \u201cIt is simply not appropriate to express whatever frustration you may have growing out of the Astros situation by putting someone physically at risk by throwing at them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not acceptable.\u201d Could players actually be hurt? Maybe, maybe not. But nothing good is going to come out of this either way. Knowing what we know now about the lasting impacts of head trauma, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to justify retaliation by pitchers at opposing batters, regardless of the situation. Manfred is very correct to go on the record as saying that intentionally throwing at Astros players won\u2019t be tolerated. But some would argue that the league is protecting cheats \u2026 Yes! Also this. There\u2019s a very good chance that the way Manfred has handled the entire scandal has all but guaranteed that there will be some sort of on-field violence coming. Heck, maybe it will be good for the ratings, I\u2019m sure he has number-crunchers working to figure out if that would be the case. So what happens next? We won\u2019t know until the games start but Dodgers pitcher Alex Wood has probably mapped out the end game for this scenario: \u201cSomebody will take it into their own hands, and they\u2019ll get suspended more games than any of those guys got for the biggest cheating scandal in 100 years.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Gene editing could be one of the most interesting and relevant scientific stories of our generation. This new technology could affect everything from food to healthcare to our attempts to tackle climate change.</p> <p>When big scientific breakthroughs like this happen, we, as journalists, tend to report on the big discoveries and the scientists who make them. With this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/ng-interactive/2020/feb/19/should-we-edit-our-dna-the-gene-gap-watch-and-listen\">multimedia project</a>, we wanted to experiment with a new model for how to do journalism on science. Is it possible to report on science, but without the scientists?</p> <p>It\u2019s not every day that you get to spend an afternoon in Cumbria with a group of local farmers chatting about gene editing. But on a cold and sunny February morning last year, that\u2019s exactly what a team from the Guardian did. It\u2019s fair to say that we assumed our Cumbria contingent would have their minds blown when we told them about the potential of this exciting new technology. But instead, they shrugged their shoulders and nodded. They were way ahead of us.</p> <p>We spent that morning hearing about all the agricultural techniques and technologies they use every day and, over lunch, they reminded us that selective breeding has been happening on farms for centuries. Turns out the father of modern genetics \u2013 an amateur botanist \u2013 founded the field after experimenting with pea plants.</p> <p>The Cumbria group was one of five that we visited over the course of the year. All of the people we met had personal stories and experiences to share that challenged the assumptions the media often make about science and society. And challenging the way we do our journalism was the purpose of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/ng-interactive/2020/feb/19/should-we-edit-our-dna-the-gene-gap-watch-and-listen\">the Gene Gap project</a>.

Scientists, who love analogies, liken it to a word processor which allows you to correct misspellings in documents written on a computer. Instead of dealing with words, gene editing rewrites DNA, the \u201clanguage\u201d of living organisms. There are many ways to edit genes, but the breakthrough behind the greatest achievements in recent years is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2019/mar/28/the-biggest-revolution-in-gene-editing-crispr-cas9-explained-video\">molecular tool called Crispr-Cas9</a>.</p> <p>Scientists already have enormous expectations for it: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/15/gene-editing-and-what-it-really-means-to-rewrite-the-code-of-life\">Crispr-Cas9</a> could one day treat or prevent human diseases that are currently beyond the reach of medical science.

      "bodyText": "Gene editing could be one of the most interesting and relevant scientific stories of our generation. This new technology could affect everything from food to healthcare to our attempts to tackle climate change. When big scientific breakthroughs like this happen, we, as journalists, tend to report on the big discoveries and the scientists who make them. With this multimedia project, we wanted to experiment with a new model for how to do journalism on science. Is it possible to report on science, but without the scientists? It\u2019s not every day that you get to spend an afternoon in Cumbria with a group of local farmers chatting about gene editing. But on a cold and sunny February morning last year, that\u2019s exactly what a team from the Guardian did. It\u2019s fair to say that we assumed our Cumbria contingent would have their minds blown when we told them about the potential of this exciting new technology. But instead, they shrugged their shoulders and nodded. They were way ahead of us. We spent that morning hearing about all the agricultural techniques and technologies they use every day and, over lunch, they reminded us that selective breeding has been happening on farms for centuries. Turns out the father of modern genetics \u2013 an amateur botanist \u2013 founded the field after experimenting with pea plants. The Cumbria group was one of five that we visited over the course of the year. All of the people we met had personal stories and experiences to share that challenged the assumptions the media often make about science and society. And challenging the way we do our journalism was the purpose of the Gene Gap project. For a complex topic like gene editing, which has the potential to reshape our society, shouldn\u2019t we try to democratise the dialogue? What is gene editing? Scientists, who love analogies, liken it to a word processor which allows you to correct misspellings in documents written on a computer. Instead of dealing with words, gene editing rewrites DNA, the \u201clanguage\u201d of living organisms. There are many ways to edit genes, but the breakthrough behind the greatest achievements in recent years is a molecular tool called Crispr-Cas9. Scientists already have enormous expectations for it: Crispr-Cas9 could one day treat or prevent human diseases that are currently beyond the reach of medical science. There are thousands of genetic disorders that can be passed on from one generation to the next; many are serious and debilitating. They are not rare: one in 25 children are born with a genetic disease. It could transform food and agriculture and even tackle climate change; it will supercharge our understanding of (and ability to manipulate) the most basic functions of life. But there are ethical concerns too. The Chinese scientist He Jiankui sparked global controversy last year when he claimed to have created the first \u201cgene-edited\u201d children. He was later sentenced to three years in prison for violating medical regulations. But many now worry that the genie is out of the bottle, and that the next step is \u201cdesigner babies\u201d \u2013 and growing inequality between those who can and those who cannot afford this new potential treatment. Thinking about the power of technology to take control of evolution, the film-maker Marc Silver started to investigate ideas for a documentary, speaking to scientists and biohackers who were experimenting with the technology in labs. Silver\u2019s line of inquiry began by following the usual model of science reporting \u2013 that is, we hear first from the scientists who make the big scientific discoveries, rather than the people who will be most affected by them. So, we wondered, what if we investigated this scientific story purely through the lives of the public? Our team set out to meet groups of people around the country who we wouldn\u2019t usually hear from in science or journalism \u2013 and we recorded all of it.

Their stories and insights opened up fascinating discussions about science and society, and ideas we had never considered. We recorded more than 15 hours of these conversations. We transcribed everything and listened. Our team, which included audio producers, filmmakers, writers and academics, found that shared themes began to emerge. Trust, power and identity were common concepts. There were fundamental questions about how democracy functions; should everyone \u2013 even those who know nothing about the science of gene editing \u2013 be involved in decision-making? People also questioned whether science and industry were correctly set up to be able to monitor and assess these complicated moral and ethical issues. Some considered how identity and DNA interacted, and whether gene editing might lead to changes in how we value certain members of society. With all of these perspectives, we produced a series of three powerful podcasts that weave together conversations that are taking place in a range of communities. Meanwhile, Silver was inspired to further explore some of these big questions through a more artistic approach. Are we well informed? Who holds the power to inform us? Who has the authority to speak for our species, to make decisions about our species? Will industry determine evolution? His creative response to these conversations was a short film.

      "body": "<p>When Ana Kokkinos found out her second film was going to be shown at Cannes in 1998, she was overjoyed. Charting 24 hedonistic hours in the life of a gay Greek-Australian teenager, Head On is a fierce and evocative depiction of queer identity and masculinity in crisis. Then she had her first interview. \u201cThe journalist told me there was a rumour that I must have been a man because a woman couldn\u2019t possibly make this film.\u201d</p> <p>The Australian film-maker was unsurprised. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many female directors and when women get the opportunity to make a film they tend to want to make them about women. But when women make films about men there is still a taboo around that. There\u2019s a cliched view that women can\u2019t explore masculinity or the male experience.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/17/masculinities-review-barbican-london-exhibition\">Masculinities review: men laid bare from boardroom to battlefield</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s this misconception that the Barbican\u2019s new season, Her Lens, His Story: Female Directors and Masculinities, seeks to upend. Kokkinos is one of seven female directors from around the world whose stories about men will be shown. The series of screenings is a celebration of women who have fought to show multifaceted and vulnerable men on screen.</p> <p>These are stories about men living on the margins, maverick outsiders for reasons other than bravado or bank robbery. In Edith Carlmar\u2019s stylish 1949 Norwegian noir Death Is a Caress, about a mechanic who falls for a rich, older woman, this is due to the rigid class system. In Destiny Ekaragha\u2019s Gone Too Far!, a witty 2013 British comedy about two estranged brothers meeting for the first time, it\u2019s down to the colour of their skin.</p> <p>Sexuality keeps its protagonists marginalised in both Anah\u00ed Berneri\u2019s 2005 Argentinian film A Year Without Love, about a lonely poet with HIV who looks for human connection in S&amp;M clubs, and Kokkinos\u2019s Head On. Meanwhile, a young Afghan boy in 1980s Kabul is forgotten by society in Shahrbanoo Sadat\u2019s sensitively told 2019 drama The Orphanage.</p> <p>There are antiheroes, too, as depicted in Soviet director Larisa Shepitko\u2019s harrowing 1977 film The Ascent, which shows the different fates of two soldiers captured during the second world war and their struggle to cope with the brutality of conflict. While 1953\u2019s Love Letter, a poignant melodrama from prolific film star Kinuyo Tanaka (the second woman ever to work as a director in Japan), reflects the postwar anxieties of the country in its story about an emotionally repressed man struggling to forgive his ex-girlfriend.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s liberating for women to explore men, because we\u2019re not shackled by the same assumptions about the male experience.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Portraying men in a non-traditional way, free from cliche, is a political act, says Kokkinos. Her own film was considered controversial when it was released for its gritty depiction of gay sex and drugs. But it also gives a voice to the immigrant experience. \u201cIt didn\u2019t idealise privileged men in positions of power. The minute you don\u2019t depict men as powerful drivers of their own destinies, people find that very difficult.\u201d</p> <p>The number of female directors in the film industry is slowly growing but is still dismally low. Last month, a <a href=\"http://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/aii-inclusion-directors-chair-20200102.pdf\">study</a> by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California found that of the 113 directors behind 2019\u2019s 100 top-grossing films, 12 of these were women \u2013 a historic high. In 2018, there were just five. And when women do direct, they are more likely to focus on stories about women. </p> <p>Yet when focused on men, the female gaze can offer radical new perspectives. Gone Too Far! director Ekaragha can still remember watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/16/patrick-swayze-joe-queenan\">Point Break</a> for the first time, not realising the adrenaline-fuelled action thriller was directed by a woman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/17/kathryn-bigelow-on-detroit-theres-a-radical-desire-not-to-face-the-reality-of-race\">Kathryn Bigelow</a>, until years later.

      "bodyText": "When Ana Kokkinos found out her second film was going to be shown at Cannes in 1998, she was overjoyed. Charting 24 hedonistic hours in the life of a gay Greek-Australian teenager, Head On is a fierce and evocative depiction of queer identity and masculinity in crisis. Then she had her first interview. \u201cThe journalist told me there was a rumour that I must have been a man because a woman couldn\u2019t possibly make this film.\u201d The Australian film-maker was unsurprised. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many female directors and when women get the opportunity to make a film they tend to want to make them about women. But when women make films about men there is still a taboo around that. There\u2019s a cliched view that women can\u2019t explore masculinity or the male experience.\u201d It\u2019s this misconception that the Barbican\u2019s new season, Her Lens, His Story: Female Directors and Masculinities, seeks to upend. Kokkinos is one of seven female directors from around the world whose stories about men will be shown. The series of screenings is a celebration of women who have fought to show multifaceted and vulnerable men on screen. These are stories about men living on the margins, maverick outsiders for reasons other than bravado or bank robbery. In Edith Carlmar\u2019s stylish 1949 Norwegian noir Death Is a Caress, about a mechanic who falls for a rich, older woman, this is due to the rigid class system. In Destiny Ekaragha\u2019s Gone Too Far!, a witty 2013 British comedy about two estranged brothers meeting for the first time, it\u2019s down to the colour of their skin. Sexuality keeps its protagonists marginalised in both Anah\u00ed Berneri\u2019s 2005 Argentinian film A Year Without Love, about a lonely poet with HIV who looks for human connection in S&amp;M clubs, and Kokkinos\u2019s Head On. Meanwhile, a young Afghan boy in 1980s Kabul is forgotten by society in Shahrbanoo Sadat\u2019s sensitively told 2019 drama The Orphanage. There are antiheroes, too, as depicted in Soviet director Larisa Shepitko\u2019s harrowing 1977 film The Ascent, which shows the different fates of two soldiers captured during the second world war and their struggle to cope with the brutality of conflict. While 1953\u2019s Love Letter, a poignant melodrama from prolific film star Kinuyo Tanaka (the second woman ever to work as a director in Japan), reflects the postwar anxieties of the country in its story about an emotionally repressed man struggling to forgive his ex-girlfriend. Portraying men in a non-traditional way, free from cliche, is a political act, says Kokkinos. Her own film was considered controversial when it was released for its gritty depiction of gay sex and drugs. But it also gives a voice to the immigrant experience. \u201cIt didn\u2019t idealise privileged men in positions of power. The minute you don\u2019t depict men as powerful drivers of their own destinies, people find that very difficult.\u201d The number of female directors in the film industry is slowly growing but is still dismally low. Last month, a study by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California found that of the 113 directors behind 2019\u2019s 100 top-grossing films, 12 of these were women \u2013 a historic high. In 2018, there were just five. And when women do direct, they are more likely to focus on stories about women. Yet when focused on men, the female gaze can offer radical new perspectives. Gone Too Far! director Ekaragha can still remember watching Point Break for the first time, not realising the adrenaline-fuelled action thriller was directed by a woman, Kathryn Bigelow, until years later. In her 20s, she was captivated by Mary Harron\u2019s gruesome psychological horror American Psycho \u2013 in particular, how the camera lingered on Christian Bale\u2019s sculpted body \u2013 in much the same way men have been filming women\u2019s bodies for years. \u201cThe moment I realised I wanted to be a director, I felt like a lot of the films expected of women were not necessarily the sort of films that I was into,\u201d she says. \u201cTo see a woman direct American Psycho with no fear was inspiring.\u201d The south London director, one of only four black British women to have had their feature films released in UK cinemas, actively avoided any stereotypes associated with black teens, such as drugs and stabbings, when making her film. \u201cI was conscious of how black boys and black men are portrayed on screen.\u201d For Afghan film-maker Sadat, the gender of the people on screen is of secondary importance. \u201cAfter #MeToo, people are showing more support for female film-makers and stories about women,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, it doesn\u2019t really matter if [the film is about] a man or a woman. It\u2019s important who\u2019s behind the camera and how the director is trying to show the world from a feminine point of view.\u201d Kokkinos followed Head On with The Book of Revelation, about a male dancer who is abducted by three women. \u201cIt\u2019s liberating for women to explore men because we\u2019re not shackled by the same assumptions about the male experience,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen have something to say about men. We can delve into their vulnerabilities or difficulties around their own maleness. We need more women to enter that space because it becomes really exciting. We can illuminate something different about men that we don\u2019t generally see from men themselves.\u201d Her Lens, His Story: Female Directors and Masculinities is at the Barbican, London, from 26 February to 10 March.",

It\u2019s a misconception anyway, says Gabriela Hearst, pioneer of pared-back looks that also consider the planet: \u201cIt\u2019s not the aesthetic point.

The idea, says designer Elliot Atkinson, is to \u201cbuild a perennial wardrobe\u2026 not so much like a seasonal fashion wardrobe as a wardrobe that we evolve seasonally.

This season, however, we are entering a second Steam Age, as the expert method of wrinkle removal goes mainstream.</p> <p>In large part this is down to Swedish steaming brand Steamery, who have capitalised on the vogue for Scandinavian design, as well as our increasingly on-the-go lifestyles, with a range of chic handheld steamers (the one pictured here costs \u00a3110) in ergonomic designs and muted colours that turn a chore into something social media friendly. After all, no one ever Instagrams a pile of ironing.</p> <p>At a time when both the industry and consumers are being urged to wash clothes less, steaming offers a gentle way of refreshing fabrics, as it also kills bacteria. Eco-conscious designer Stella McCartney has long been a fan of steaming her clothes \u2013 albeit by hanging them in a bathroom post-shower. <em>LH</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf74aa5dd14cb1891c963ad767bb6596a27375d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf74aa5dd14cb1891c963ad767bb6596a27375d2/0_531_4248_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steam your clothes rather than washing them to help them last longer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steam your clothes rather than washing them to help them last longer. <a href=\"https://steamery.co.uk/?\">Steamery </a>steamers available from <a href=\"https://www.libertylondon.com/uk/Cirrus-No.2-Clothing-Steamer-R331828006.html?\">Liberty</a> and other outlets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Newby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Environmental campaigner Natalie Fee can also see the advantages, in that steaming means \u201cminimising the release of plastic microfibres into our environment, which happens when we put synthetic clothes in washing machines\u201d \u2013 although she points out that, in terms of energy and water usage, steaming one garment at a time may have drawbacks.</p> <p>\u201cKeeping your clothes away from washing can help prolong their life, which is good for the environment,\u201d says Steamery co-founder Frej Lewenhaupt. \u201cIf you have a favourite shirt, but you iron it regularly and force it to become smooth, eventually it will wear out and break. With steaming, you do not see that kind of damage.\u201d</p> <p>Tony Chung, cleaning expert at the Steam Room dry cleaners in east London, says there are other benefits. \u201cThe process is much quicker and easier,\u201d he explains. \u201cSteaming clothes is a good stopgap before they really need a clean.\u201d No wonder so many fashion fans are going full steam ahead.</p> <h2>Sexy necklines are back</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba1979a0bb3e4d5be3bdcb941988b33b90f773d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba1979a0bb3e4d5be3bdcb941988b33b90f773d0/0_0_4032_5056/797.jpg\" alt=\"Dress, \u00a33,515, by Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello.\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dress, \u00a33,515, by Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello.<br><br>Styling: Melanie Wilkinson.

So it was notable to see a very different look emerge for SS20, a low-cut look with an architectural twist that would make Le Corbusier blush. Saint Laurent\u2019s bandeau necks went wide as well as low, corset-style Versace tops dipped to the navel and Christopher Kane fell for the teardrop detail.</p> <p>The simple explanation for this is the contrary nature of the industry. As Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell fashion historian and author of Worn on This Day, puts it, \u201cthe pendulum often swings from one extreme to the other: high-necked prairie dresses to plunging necklines.\u201d While these latest reveal plenty of skin, their structural quality means many sit rigidly away from the body, in contract to the \u201csofter\u201d designs that might adhere to conventional notions of sexiness.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re actually quite cerebral,\u201d says Chrisman-Campbell. At Saint Laurent, as well as New York-based label Khaite, plunging suits dominated the catwalk for a look that was very \u201cBianca Jagger\u2019s 1971 YSL wedding suit\u201d. Necklines, then, might be bringing sexy back, but not as we know it. <em>LH</em></p> <h2>Deadstock is fashion\u2019s buzzword</h2> <p>Fashion\u2019s latest big idea means unused fabric and unsold clothes being repurposed. For SS20, Marine Serre turned towels into a jumper, Givenchy remodelled denim and Ahluwalia Studio reformed jeans. It\u2019s a new way of working, and urgently needed. To keep it going, says Alexandra Hackett of Studio ALCH, where deadstock is turned into streetwear looks, \u201cdesigners and brands holding deadstock need to work together creatively\u201d. Long may it continue. <em>PE</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd045cb99b2d6e171972a2f1d8801853df4b0008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd045cb99b2d6e171972a2f1d8801853df4b0008/2_0_10663_6400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shamed by the scandal of unsold clothes being burnt, the cutting edge of the fashion world is taking steps to ensure that all unsold stock gets reused.

But if that was the wild, Instagram-friendly shade, the catwalk rendition was more varied and nuanced. Chipped jade and emerald added energy at the Christopher John Rogers show, while at Gucci tones veered from seaweed to parakeet. There was a silky avocado at Carolina Herrera and at Collina Strada green was rendered in Van Gogh-esque circles.</p> <p>Buy why green and why now?

Henry Holland brought pink leather to a workwear aesthetic, while at Roksanda, aluminium grey was worn over a white polo neck.</p> <p>The history of boilersuits is intertwined with flying and factories, Bauhaus and Bowie. Reporter April O\u2019Neil wore a yellow version in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, film director Derek Jarman gardened in a pink one and Booksmart\u2019s swotty teen heroines wear matching suits to embark on the night of their lives.</p> <p>It\u2019s a look that proclaims practicality. \u201cWe live such busy lives, the boilersuit feels like a great easy option for everyday wear,\u201d says Pyo, who lived in hers last summer.</p> <p>It is the second world war\u2019s Rosie the Riveter who perhaps left the biggest mark on our reading of the garment.

The idea, says designer Elliot Atkinson, is to \u201cbuild a perennial wardrobe\u2026 not so much like a seasonal fashion wardrobe as a wardrobe that we evolve seasonally. We want it to be, dare I say it, anti-fashion.\u201d EVB Jurassic Park is chic If the pie-crust collar whispers in hushed tones of its wearer\u2019s high-brow credentials, the dilophosaurus neck is altogether more loud and proud, as seen at Christopher John Rogers, Christian Siriano and Giambattista Valli.

According to Professor Carolyn Mair, author of The Psychology Of Fashion, there are many reasons why people choose to take up the space equivalent to that of a small car with their clothing. \u201cIt could be related to the desire to project a strong presence and attract attention, while simultaneously maintaining a greater personal space,\u201d she explains. \u201cMany animals do this when they want to keep predators at bay.\u201d These creations were not only big, they were also bright, with bold block-colouring and, at Christopher John Rogers, holographic materials \u2013 suggesting that, while many may follow the \u201cmodest\u201d fashion blueprint, they are far from conventionally demure. LH Wednesday Addams is your hairspo Double plaits, as seen on the arachnid-loving child, Dorothy in The Wizard Of Oz and even Greta Thunberg, starred on the SS20 catwalks. Max Mara\u2019s meant business, keeping hair out of suited models\u2019 eyes; at Bora Aksu they were inspired by Persian princess Taj Saltaneh, \u201ca trailblazer for women\u2019s rights\u201d. Guido Palau, who styled Dior\u2019s, says plaits are \u201cageless, genderless and work with any culture\u201d. EVB Steaming is the new ironing Steaming clothes has previously been the preserve of professionals, from dry cleaners to tailors and wardrobe assistants. This season, however, we are entering a second Steam Age, as the expert method of wrinkle removal goes mainstream. In large part this is down to Swedish steaming brand Steamery, who have capitalised on the vogue for Scandinavian design, as well as our increasingly on-the-go lifestyles, with a range of chic handheld steamers (the one pictured here costs \u00a3110) in ergonomic designs and muted colours that turn a chore into something social media friendly. After all, no one ever Instagrams a pile of ironing. At a time when both the industry and consumers are being urged to wash clothes less, steaming offers a gentle way of refreshing fabrics, as it also kills bacteria. Eco-conscious designer Stella McCartney has long been a fan of steaming her clothes \u2013 albeit by hanging them in a bathroom post-shower. LH Environmental campaigner Natalie Fee can also see the advantages, in that steaming means \u201cminimising the release of plastic microfibres into our environment, which happens when we put synthetic clothes in washing machines\u201d \u2013 although she points out that, in terms of energy and water usage, steaming one garment at a time may have drawbacks. \u201cKeeping your clothes away from washing can help prolong their life, which is good for the environment,\u201d says Steamery co-founder Frej Lewenhaupt. \u201cIf you have a favourite shirt, but you iron it regularly and force it to become smooth, eventually it will wear out and break. With steaming, you do not see that kind of damage.\u201d Tony Chung, cleaning expert at the Steam Room dry cleaners in east London, says there are other benefits. \u201cThe process is much quicker and easier,\u201d he explains. \u201cSteaming clothes is a good stopgap before they really need a clean.\u201d No wonder so many fashion fans are going full steam ahead. Sexy necklines are back Fashion has been pretty buttoned up recently, fond of ruffles and polo necks. So it was notable to see a very different look emerge for SS20, a low-cut look with an architectural twist that would make Le Corbusier blush. Saint Laurent\u2019s bandeau necks went wide as well as low, corset-style Versace tops dipped to the navel and Christopher Kane fell for the teardrop detail. The simple explanation for this is the contrary nature of the industry. As Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell fashion historian and author of Worn on This Day, puts it, \u201cthe pendulum often swings from one extreme to the other: high-necked prairie dresses to plunging necklines.\u201d While these latest reveal plenty of skin, their structural quality means many sit rigidly away from the body, in contract to the \u201csofter\u201d designs that might adhere to conventional notions of sexiness. \u201cThey\u2019re actually quite cerebral,\u201d says Chrisman-Campbell. At Saint Laurent, as well as New York-based label Khaite, plunging suits dominated the catwalk for a look that was very \u201cBianca Jagger\u2019s 1971 YSL wedding suit\u201d. Necklines, then, might be bringing sexy back, but not as we know it. LH Deadstock is fashion\u2019s buzzword Fashion\u2019s latest big idea means unused fabric and unsold clothes being repurposed. For SS20, Marine Serre turned towels into a jumper, Givenchy remodelled denim and Ahluwalia Studio reformed jeans. It\u2019s a new way of working, and urgently needed. To keep it going, says Alexandra Hackett of Studio ALCH, where deadstock is turned into streetwear looks, \u201cdesigners and brands holding deadstock need to work together creatively\u201d. Long may it continue. PE Flip-flops are now fashion \u201cI love a flip-flop!\u201d exclaimed Anna Wintour in an interview last year, and she\u2019s not alone. This season, the humble sandal has morphed into elegant footwear \u2013 see Bauhaus rectangles at A.W.A.K.E. Mode and silky straps at Staud. As with all unlikely trends, not everyone is sold. But with the AW OK given, it might be time to flip-flop. PE Green is the coolest colour \u201cIt\u2019s not easy being green,\u201d Kermit the Frog once sang, wisely. Well, frog, that was the 70s and now green is everywhere. First there was the trend of \u201cslime green\u201d, worn by Billie Eilish as well as the likes of Bella Hadid and Chanel Iman. But if that was the wild, Instagram-friendly shade, the catwalk rendition was more varied and nuanced. Chipped jade and emerald added energy at the Christopher John Rogers show, while at Gucci tones veered from seaweed to parakeet. There was a silky avocado at Carolina Herrera and at Collina Strada green was rendered in Van Gogh-esque circles. Buy why green and why now? According to Karen Haller, author of The Little Book Of Colour, it\u2019s a calm colour. \u201cGreen provides a sense of balance and harmony in our lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSpending time in nature surrounded by green helps us to regain this equilibrium. We\u2019re now bringing green into our clothes.\u201d PE Boilersuits are still hot We\u2019re not saying you should purposely stain your outfit with grease, but this season\u2019s boilersuits trend would be more forgiving than most of the odd bit of Castrol. A sibling to the jumpsuit, it may be a car mechanic\u2019s favourite, but the long lines and \u201cthrown on\u201d look make it more sophisticated than many give it credit for. At Rejina Pyo, the boilersuit came in relaxed cotton with contrasting linen print fabric; at Isabel Marant, Gigi Hadid wore one punctuated with practical poppers and tied with rope. Henry Holland brought pink leather to a workwear aesthetic, while at Roksanda, aluminium grey was worn over a white polo neck. The history of boilersuits is intertwined with flying and factories, Bauhaus and Bowie. Reporter April O\u2019Neil wore a yellow version in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, film director Derek Jarman gardened in a pink one and Booksmart\u2019s swotty teen heroines wear matching suits to embark on the night of their lives. It\u2019s a look that proclaims practicality. \u201cWe live such busy lives, the boilersuit feels like a great easy option for everyday wear,\u201d says Pyo, who lived in hers last summer. It is the second world war\u2019s Rosie the Riveter who perhaps left the biggest mark on our reading of the garment. So maybe it\u2019s time to roll your sleeves up and think \u201cready to tackle a crankshaft\u201d \u2013 but make it fashion. EVB Carmela is your gold chain icon SS20 sees the Return Of The Bling. Think Carmela Soprano, Bet Lynch, Run DMC. At Bottega Veneta, bold shapes were matched by fist-width necklaces; Ellery had zeros of gold clasped together; Sacai made chains the cherry on top of layered looks. An ideal piece to rummage for at vintage shops, should you want to cosplay Dynasty\u2019s Krystle Carrington. PE You\u2019re going to want a nettle dress Forget the sting and grasp the nettle. Sustainable fashion pioneers Vin + Omi showcased a collection that incorporated not just any old nettles, but royal nettles harvested from Prince Charles\u2019s Highgrove estate, while the stalks of Chinese nettles \u2013 better known as ramie \u2013 proved popular with labels including Etro, Zimmermann and D\u00f4en.

      "body": "<p>Kung pao, or gong bao chicken has an interesting, if <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/23/dining/kung-pao-no-gong-bao-and-nix-the-nuts.html\" title=\"\">hotly disputed</a> political back story. In one account at least, it is named after a 19th-century governor-general of Sichuan Province, who suffered with such bad teeth that he could eat only small, boneless pieces of meat. The dish was forcibly rechristened during the Cultural Revolution, when such imperial officials were very much out of fashion, as quick-fried chicken cubes, or chicken cubes with seared chillies \u2013 both accurate, if rather unromantic descriptions.</p> <p>Despite its somewhat fearsome, chilli-studded appearance, it\u2019s a spicy but not particularly hot dish. Instead, the main flavour is that of numbing Sichuan peppercorns and spring onions, all bound together with a subtly sweet-and-sour sauce. Like many stir-fried dishes, it\u2019s easiest made in small quantities \u2013 perfect for solo dining, in fact.</p> <h2>The chicken</h2> <p>Most recipes call for chicken breast, a cut I have little time for in general. But, having tried thighs in <a href=\"https://www.thestaffcanteen.com/chefs-recipes/Gong-Bao-Chicken#/\" title=\"\">Andrew Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/recipes/kung-pao-chicken\" title=\"\">Harry Eastwood</a>\u2019s recipes, I have to admit, reluctantly, they\u2019re not ideal for the amateur wok handler, because the darker meat takes longer to cook through. This means that, if you\u2019re not operating at professional temperatures \u2013 hot enough to take your eyebrows off \u2013 it can leave the outsides dry. Keep the cubes small for this reason.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f99283cb6a9c231df24d8fff8b0d50a8b2fcd06e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f99283cb6a9c231df24d8fff8b0d50a8b2fcd06e/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Eastwood\u2019s kung pao chicken \u2013 use plenty of spring onions or even some leeks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Eastwood\u2019s kung pao chicken \u2013 use plenty of spring onions or even some leeks. Thumbnail pics: Felicity Cloake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Interestingly, Chin and Choo\u2019s Chinese Takeaway Bible, the book based on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CghX784lPsE\" title=\"\">the popular YouTube channel devoted to divulging the secrets of takeaway classics</a>, starts with <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/04/how-to-marinate-meat-for-stir-fries.html\" title=\"\">\u201cpre-prepared chicken\u201d</a>. This seeks to mimic the pre-cooked meat apparently used by many restaurants (though it seems it will never be quite as soft as the 60%-80% meat in the products available in catering quantities. Don\u2019t worry: the rest is just water and salt, rather than anything sinister). This is boneless breast poached at 80C for 30 to 40 minutes, then cooled and sliced; ideal if you want to get ahead, though it lacks the juiciness of the stir-fried stuff.</p> <p>Most recipes marinate the raw meat briefly before cooking, usually in a mixture of starch and water seasoned with soy sauce and rice wine \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90206117\" title=\"\">the classic \u201cvelveting\u201d technique</a> that helps form a protective barrier between the chicken and the hot wok keeping it, well, soft as velvet.</p> <h2>The sauce</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ab773f315d565625b0809c42d314072ec40057a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab773f315d565625b0809c42d314072ec40057a7/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Tan\u2019s kung pao sauce is thickened with water or stock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Tan\u2019s kung pao sauce is thickened with water or stock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fuchsia Dunlop\u2019s masterwork, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/09/sichuan-recipes-fuchsia-dunlop-chicken-prawn-minced-pork\">The Food of Sichuan</a>, informs me that the sauce in this dish is known as <em>li zhi wei</em>, or \u201clychee-flavoured\u201d, a milder version of sweet-and-sour made with a mixture of sugar, soy sauces and rice vinegar, thickened with corn or potato flour and loosened with water (or chicken stock, as <a href=\"https://hk.asiatatler.com/dining/tony-tan-my-hong-kong\" title=\"\">Tony Tan</a> does in his book Hong Kong Food City). In such small quantities, however, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much point in using stock, unless you happen to have some to hand; the soy should give it enough savoury oomph on its own. The same goes for Tan\u2019s dash of sesame oil, which to my mind clashes with the actual nuts. Feel free to add a splash, if you disagree.</p> <p>Wong starts with a kung pao stock, flavoured with Sichuan peppercorns, dried chillies, ginger and garlic, as well as the usual sugar, vinegar and soy, which is then reduced, as opposed to thickened. While wonderfully fragrant and intense, outside a Michelin-starred kitchen, it\u2019s hard to justify 25 minutes of work, when most of the other sauces can be whisked together in 25 seconds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d7730278fefc86acb2ab8dd9c35d850981e21cd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7730278fefc86acb2ab8dd9c35d850981e21cd3/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Wong\u2019s kung pao chicken starts with a kung pao stock, flavoured with Sichuan peppercorns, dried chillies, ginger and garlic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Wong\u2019s kung pao chicken starts with a kung pao stock, flavoured with Sichuan peppercorns, dried chillies, ginger and garlic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another recipe designed for a professional kitchen is Chin and Choo\u2019s, which starts with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl72YusTGsY&amp;t=106s\" title=\"\">takeaway-style sweet-and-sour sauce</a> that\u2019s \u201cvery different from the traditional\u201d version, in that it\u2019s made with malt vinegar, vast amounts of white sugar and double-concentrated orange squash, boiled up with ginger, garlic, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, orange slices and tomato puree. The results, which bring back many happy memories, are then mixed with spicy bean paste and dark soy sauce in the wok, and thickened with starch, as usual. It is indeed much sweeter than the others I try but, balanced by the green pepper and roasted nuts, not unpleasantly so. (Plus I now have a vat of sweet-and-sour sauce in the fridge for all my late-night needs.)</p> <h2>The aromatics and vegetables</h2> <p>This dish requires only two spices, and, since they are its defining characteristic, do not accept substitutions. Dunlop explains that \u201csun-dried chillies are indispensable in Sichuan cooking [and] several varieties can be found in the region\u2019s markets\u201d. Look for \u201cred and lustrous, fragrant and not overpoweringly hot\u201d examples \u2013 as she says, thanks to the increased popularity of Sichuan food overseas, many Chinese supermarkets now stock bagfuls of suitable chillies, either \u201csmall, pointy\u201d ones or plump \u201cheaven-facing\u201d or \u201cbullet\u201d types. Just make sure they\u2019re not the ear-splitting Indian or Thai varieties (or reduce the quantity accordingly).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"522498a5d025debabb993ed3c32013da1f8b048e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/522498a5d025debabb993ed3c32013da1f8b048e/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chin and Choo\u2019s effort \u2013 with bamboo shoots, green pepper, water chestnuts and pineapple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chin and Choo\u2019s effort \u2013 with bamboo shoots, green pepper, water chestnuts and pineapple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sichuan peppercorns are more straightforward \u2013 use whole berries (try one first; if it\u2019s not tingly and sharp, you\u2019ll need to invest in a new packet) and, like Dunlop and Tan, use them to infuse the oil before you cook anything else. If you find the whole fruits too intense, then you could grind them to distribute the flavour more evenly, as Eastwood reports a \u201cvery patient Chinese friend\u201d doing in Beijing.</p> <p>Eastwood\u2019s book Carnevale is also helpful on the matter of vegetables: \u201cThe spring onions in Beijing were bigger than ours in Europe and they make up about half of the dish,\u201d she reports. \u201cIf you have tiddly little onions or you want to up the quantity of veg, then add in some finely sliced leeks.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"04b379ea0c9db0a2695f1ba494d0cadb41879672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04b379ea0c9db0a2695f1ba494d0cadb41879672/0_128_4032_2896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fuchsia Dunlop\u2019s kung pao chicken \u2013 sun-dried chillies are indispensable.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fuchsia Dunlop\u2019s kung pao chicken \u2013 sun-dried chillies are indispensable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though western versions are often quite meat-heavy, the onions should be no mere garnish, and the same goes for the nuts \u2013 whether you go for the traditional peanuts, or Dunlop and Chin and Choo\u2019s cashews (personally, I prefer the more savoury flavour of the first), be generous. Though I\u2019m generally lazy and buy them ready-roasted so I can eat the rest of the packet the next day, for the best, crunchiest results, fry whatever you use from raw, as both Eastwood and Chin and Choo recommend.</p> <p>If you want to up the vegetable quota further, then note that Wong adds celery and Chin and Choo bamboo shoots, green pepper, water chestnuts and pineapple in addition to the mandatory garlic and ginger. All give the dish textural interest, if not the stamp of authenticity from the Sichuan Higher Institute of Cuisine in Chengdu, where Dunlop trained.</p> <h2>To finish</h2> <p>Eastwood garnishes her dish with coriander, while Wong shows off his skills with air-dried chicken skin and a peanut foam made from satay sauce, milk and soy lecithin. All are very nice (well, I imagine the chicken skin is very nice, but his note that, \u201cfor the home cook, preparing this really is a massive waste of time and I would recommend you spend your time doing something a little more fun than drying out chicken skin\u201d, rather puts me off confirming it), but entirely optional. Serve hot from the wok with steamed rice, and perhaps some vegetables on the side.</p> <h2>Perfect kung pao chicken</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"04e6bb826f37bc8b3dadaf24e8e624d8a5f8285f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04e6bb826f37bc8b3dadaf24e8e624d8a5f8285f/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity\u2019s hybrid is the perfect kung pao chicken.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity\u2019s hybrid is the perfect kung pao chicken.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>5 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>1</strong></p> <p><strong>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast </strong>(about 150g)<br><strong>1 tsp cornflour or potato starch</strong><br><strong>1 tsp cold water</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp light soy sauce</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp Shaoxing rice wine</strong>, or dry sherry<br><strong>6 whole dried chillies</strong><br><strong>3 spring onions</strong><br><strong>2 garlic cloves</strong><br><strong>2cm piece fresh ginger</strong></p> <p><strong>1\u00bd tbsp neutral oil</strong><br><strong>1 tsp whole Sichuan peppercorns</strong><br><strong>30g roasted peanuts or cashews</strong><br>For the sauce<br><strong>1 tbsp sugar</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp dark soy sauce</strong><br><strong>\u00be tsp light soy sauce</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp Chiangking vinegar</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp cornflour or potato starch </strong>mixed with 1 tbsp cold water</p> <p>Cut the chicken into roughly 1cm dice.

      "bodyText": "Kung pao, or gong bao chicken has an interesting, if hotly disputed political back story. In one account at least, it is named after a 19th-century governor-general of Sichuan Province, who suffered with such bad teeth that he could eat only small, boneless pieces of meat. The dish was forcibly rechristened during the Cultural Revolution, when such imperial officials were very much out of fashion, as quick-fried chicken cubes, or chicken cubes with seared chillies \u2013 both accurate, if rather unromantic descriptions. Despite its somewhat fearsome, chilli-studded appearance, it\u2019s a spicy but not particularly hot dish. Instead, the main flavour is that of numbing Sichuan peppercorns and spring onions, all bound together with a subtly sweet-and-sour sauce. Like many stir-fried dishes, it\u2019s easiest made in small quantities \u2013 perfect for solo dining, in fact. The chicken Most recipes call for chicken breast, a cut I have little time for in general. But, having tried thighs in Andrew Wong and Harry Eastwood\u2019s recipes, I have to admit, reluctantly, they\u2019re not ideal for the amateur wok handler, because the darker meat takes longer to cook through. This means that, if you\u2019re not operating at professional temperatures \u2013 hot enough to take your eyebrows off \u2013 it can leave the outsides dry. Keep the cubes small for this reason. Interestingly, Chin and Choo\u2019s Chinese Takeaway Bible, the book based on the popular YouTube channel devoted to divulging the secrets of takeaway classics, starts with \u201cpre-prepared chicken\u201d. This seeks to mimic the pre-cooked meat apparently used by many restaurants (though it seems it will never be quite as soft as the 60%-80% meat in the products available in catering quantities. Don\u2019t worry: the rest is just water and salt, rather than anything sinister). This is boneless breast poached at 80C for 30 to 40 minutes, then cooled and sliced; ideal if you want to get ahead, though it lacks the juiciness of the stir-fried stuff. Most recipes marinate the raw meat briefly before cooking, usually in a mixture of starch and water seasoned with soy sauce and rice wine \u2013 the classic \u201cvelveting\u201d technique that helps form a protective barrier between the chicken and the hot wok keeping it, well, soft as velvet. The sauce Fuchsia Dunlop\u2019s masterwork, The Food of Sichuan, informs me that the sauce in this dish is known as li zhi wei, or \u201clychee-flavoured\u201d, a milder version of sweet-and-sour made with a mixture of sugar, soy sauces and rice vinegar, thickened with corn or potato flour and loosened with water (or chicken stock, as Tony Tan does in his book Hong Kong Food City). In such small quantities, however, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much point in using stock, unless you happen to have some to hand; the soy should give it enough savoury oomph on its own. The same goes for Tan\u2019s dash of sesame oil, which to my mind clashes with the actual nuts. Feel free to add a splash, if you disagree. Wong starts with a kung pao stock, flavoured with Sichuan peppercorns, dried chillies, ginger and garlic, as well as the usual sugar, vinegar and soy, which is then reduced, as opposed to thickened. While wonderfully fragrant and intense, outside a Michelin-starred kitchen, it\u2019s hard to justify 25 minutes of work, when most of the other sauces can be whisked together in 25 seconds. Another recipe designed for a professional kitchen is Chin and Choo\u2019s, which starts with a takeaway-style sweet-and-sour sauce that\u2019s \u201cvery different from the traditional\u201d version, in that it\u2019s made with malt vinegar, vast amounts of white sugar and double-concentrated orange squash, boiled up with ginger, garlic, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, orange slices and tomato puree. The results, which bring back many happy memories, are then mixed with spicy bean paste and dark soy sauce in the wok, and thickened with starch, as usual. It is indeed much sweeter than the others I try but, balanced by the green pepper and roasted nuts, not unpleasantly so. (Plus I now have a vat of sweet-and-sour sauce in the fridge for all my late-night needs.) The aromatics and vegetables This dish requires only two spices, and, since they are its defining characteristic, do not accept substitutions. Dunlop explains that \u201csun-dried chillies are indispensable in Sichuan cooking [and] several varieties can be found in the region\u2019s markets\u201d. Look for \u201cred and lustrous, fragrant and not overpoweringly hot\u201d examples \u2013 as she says, thanks to the increased popularity of Sichuan food overseas, many Chinese supermarkets now stock bagfuls of suitable chillies, either \u201csmall, pointy\u201d ones or plump \u201cheaven-facing\u201d or \u201cbullet\u201d types. Just make sure they\u2019re not the ear-splitting Indian or Thai varieties (or reduce the quantity accordingly). Sichuan peppercorns are more straightforward \u2013 use whole berries (try one first; if it\u2019s not tingly and sharp, you\u2019ll need to invest in a new packet) and, like Dunlop and Tan, use them to infuse the oil before you cook anything else. If you find the whole fruits too intense, then you could grind them to distribute the flavour more evenly, as Eastwood reports a \u201cvery patient Chinese friend\u201d doing in Beijing. Eastwood\u2019s book Carnevale is also helpful on the matter of vegetables: \u201cThe spring onions in Beijing were bigger than ours in Europe and they make up about half of the dish,\u201d she reports. \u201cIf you have tiddly little onions or you want to up the quantity of veg, then add in some finely sliced leeks.\u201d Though western versions are often quite meat-heavy, the onions should be no mere garnish, and the same goes for the nuts \u2013 whether you go for the traditional peanuts, or Dunlop and Chin and Choo\u2019s cashews (personally, I prefer the more savoury flavour of the first), be generous. Though I\u2019m generally lazy and buy them ready-roasted so I can eat the rest of the packet the next day, for the best, crunchiest results, fry whatever you use from raw, as both Eastwood and Chin and Choo recommend. If you want to up the vegetable quota further, then note that Wong adds celery and Chin and Choo bamboo shoots, green pepper, water chestnuts and pineapple in addition to the mandatory garlic and ginger. All give the dish textural interest, if not the stamp of authenticity from the Sichuan Higher Institute of Cuisine in Chengdu, where Dunlop trained. To finish Eastwood garnishes her dish with coriander, while Wong shows off his skills with air-dried chicken skin and a peanut foam made from satay sauce, milk and soy lecithin. All are very nice (well, I imagine the chicken skin is very nice, but his note that, \u201cfor the home cook, preparing this really is a massive waste of time and I would recommend you spend your time doing something a little more fun than drying out chicken skin\u201d, rather puts me off confirming it), but entirely optional. Serve hot from the wok with steamed rice, and perhaps some vegetables on the side. Perfect kung pao chicken Prep 10 min Cook 5 min Serves 1 1 skinless, boneless chicken breast (about 150g) 1 tsp cornflour or potato starch 1 tsp cold water \u00bd tsp light soy sauce \u00bd tsp Shaoxing rice wine, or dry sherry 6 whole dried chillies 3 spring onions 2 garlic cloves 2cm piece fresh ginger 1\u00bd tbsp neutral oil 1 tsp whole Sichuan peppercorns 30g roasted peanuts or cashews For the sauce 1 tbsp sugar \u00bd tsp dark soy sauce \u00be tsp light soy sauce 1 tbsp Chiangking vinegar \u00bd tsp cornflour or potato starch mixed with 1 tbsp cold water Cut the chicken into roughly 1cm dice. In a bowl, mix the teaspoon of cornflour with the teaspoon of water, to make a rough paste, then stir in the light soy sauce and rice wine. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cut the chillies in half lengthways, then shake out and discard the seeds (if they are very hot, you may wish to reduce the number of chillies.) Slice the spring onions into roughly 1cm chunks, and separate the white and green parts. Peel and thinly slice the garlic and ginger. Mix all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl, and set this near the stove, along with the chillies and peppercorns, the chicken, garlic, ginger, the whites of the spring onions, and the peanuts and spring onion greens. Heat a wok, then add the oil, peppercorns and chillies, and stir-fry until aromatic. Add the chicken to the wok and stir-fry until just coloured all over, then tip in the garlic, ginger and spring onion whites and continue to stir-fry until the chicken is just cooked through \u2013 take care to keep everything moving so the garlic doesn\u2019t burn. Give the sauce a whisk, then pour it into the wok and leave it to bubble away until it\u2019s thickened sufficiently to coat the chicken. Add the nuts and spring onion greens, toss everything together and eat immediately. \u2022 Kung pao or gong bao: is this chicken dish a favourite, and do you prefer it tingly and warm or fiery and feisty, as it tends to be cooked outside China?

      "body": "<p>What makes you cry? Recently I cried when my eldest daughter won a medal in a gymnastics competition; during a conversation with my wife; and while watching the films <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/15/marriage-story-review-noah-baumbach-adam-driver-scarlett-johansson\" title=\"\"><em>Marriage Story</em></a>; <em>Do the Right Thing</em>; and, less explicably, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/25/unstoppable-review\" title=\"\"><em>Unstoppable</em></a>, in which Denzel Washington pursues a runaway train. On the morning I began writing this review, I watched Green MEP Molly Scott Cato\u2019s farewell speech to the European parliament. She started crying and then so did I.</p> <p>These films, conversations and speeches were all things that were happening while I cried, but saying precisely which aspects of them triggered my tears, and why, is more difficult. This is one of the areas the poet Heather Christle explores in <em>The Crying Book</em>, her investigation into the physical, cultural and political aspects of crying. \u201cMaybe we cannot know the real reason why we are crying,\u201d she writes. \u201cMaybe we do not cry <em>about</em>, but rather <em>near</em> or <em>around</em>. Maybe all our explanations are stories constructed after the fact. Not just stories. I won\u2019t say <em>just</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Christle\u2019s quotation-heavy style awards art at least equal status to science in trying to map the world of tears. She engages with several scientific investigations of crying and \u201cthe human lacrimal system\u201d, but as far as she\u2019s concerned, a Frank O\u2019Hara poem about crying naked in the bath is as valid as a clinical study.</p> <p>She is good on the ugliness of crying, describing the way a proper cry makes people \u201chideous, as if they\u2019ve grown a spare and diseased face beneath the one you know\u201d. She considers crying\u2019s moral ugliness, too, writing that white women\u2019s tears can be \u201csubject to specific scrutiny, because their weaponisation has so often meant violence toward people of colour, and black people in particular \u2026 They set others falling to help her, to correct and punish those who would dare make her weep\u201d. She illustrates this with a powerful account of the murder of an innocent black man by white police in an Ohio Walmart.</p> <p>One of the most fascinating characters Christle describes is the Dutch conceptual artist Bas Jan Ader (not Danish-born, as the book claims). In his film, <em>I\u2019m Too Sad to Tell You</em>, Ader cries in front of the camera, but what he is crying for (or perhaps \u201cnear or around\u201d) remains mysterious. Christle, however, finds a statement Ader later made about the film. \u201cWhen I cried,\u201d he said, at once open and enigmatic, \u201cit was because of extreme grief.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Her inquiry can move from Donald Trump to Byzantine lycanthropy in the space of a sentence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ader\u2019s 1975 work, <em>In Search of the Miraculous</em>, began with the artist walking the night-time streets of Los Angeles with a torch, searching for some unknown person or object. \u201cFor the second instalment,\u201d Christle writes, \u201cAder planned to sail across the Atlantic Ocean in a small sailboat by himself, having been seen off by a group of his art students singing sea shanties. The third instalment was to be another series of night-wandering photographs, this time in Amsterdam, but Ader disappeared during his sea voyage, and so the final piece of the triptych remains potential, conceptual, unexecuted.\u201d</p> <p>This work of Ader\u2019s \u2013 a mysterious search and a journey that doesn\u2019t reach its destination \u2013 is something like the experience of reading <em>The Crying Book</em>. The broad range of her inquiry, which can move from Donald Trump (\u201c\u2018I\u2019m not a big crier\u2019\u201d) to Byzantine lycanthropy in the space of a sentence, is one of the book\u2019s primary pleasures. But its scattershot nature disrupts the through-line it also wants to develop. Interspersing its impersonal elements (facts, trivia, anecdotes involving famous actors and thinkers) are episodes from Christle\u2019s own life: being dumped in college, an abortion, a friend\u2019s suicide, getting pregnant and the experience of motherhood. Accompanying her throughout all this is the waxing and waning moon that Christle calls her \u201cdespair\u201d. She favours that word, she explains, because \u201cdepression and suicidal ideation and anxiety all cast a staged or laboratory light\u201d, which seems to be both a confession and a withholding. This doubleness is problematic; a fault line at the heart of her book.</p> <p>Her episodes of despair seem significant. They leave her \u201csobbing on the bathroom floor\u201d, render her incapable of performing basic tasks, and have, two asides suggest, brought her close to suicide. The fragmentary approach she favours \u2013 which allows her inquiry to dart this way and that, like Ader\u2019s torch beam on a dark LA street \u2013 means she can alight on the personal and then quickly retreat into cultural history, science, or poetry.</p> <p>Anyone who has read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review\" title=\"\">Maggie Nelson\u2019s <em>The Argonauts</em>,</a> which <em>The Crying Book</em> resembles in both its structure (each paragraph is set apart from its neighbours, in what Nelson has called a \u201cfaux-Wittgenstenian form\u201d) and in certain of its interests (pregnancy, lactation, exhaustion, Judith Butler), will know how powerful this approach can be, with fragments cohering as the book progresses, like iron filings unified by a magnet. In <em>The Crying Book</em>, the fragments mostly stay scattered. In its closing pages she quotes, a little defensively, from Anne Carson\u2019s poem \u201cUncle Falling\u201d \u2013 \u201cHow light, how loose, how unprepared is the web of connections between any thought and any thought\u201d \u2013 and expresses her doubts about the book: \u201cI have been afraid all the connections are wrong. And I also have not known how to stop.\u201d <em>The Crying Book</em> is interesting enough that Christle needn\u2019t feel anxious about its fragmentation. But the one serious cost of its diffuseness is that its autobiographical elements \u2013 particularly those concerning Christle\u2019s \u201cdespair\u201d \u2013 occupy an emotional no man\u2019s land.</p> <p>In the preface to his 1985 book <em>Crying: The Mystery of Tears</em>, William Frey, with whom Christle corresponds in <em>The Crying Book</em>, wrote that: \u201cI hope this book will help place crying in its proper perspective as a normal human response to emotional stress.\u201d Christie offers no such \u201cproper perspective\u201d, but as a selector of unusual, arresting details, she is exceptional. Everyone who reads her book will find something that stays with them, which for me turns out to be a line from the Argentinian writer Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s <em>Instructions for Crying</em>, which I haven\u2019t been able, or particularly wanted, to get out of my head: picture, he suggests, a patch of water \u201cinto which no one sails ever\u201d.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Crying Books is published by Corsair (RRP \u00a314.99).

Interspersing its impersonal elements (facts, trivia, anecdotes involving famous actors and thinkers) are episodes from Christle\u2019s own life: being dumped in college, an abortion, a friend\u2019s suicide, getting pregnant and the experience of motherhood. Accompanying her throughout all this is the waxing and waning moon that Christle calls her \u201cdespair\u201d. She favours that word, she explains, because \u201cdepression and suicidal ideation and anxiety all cast a staged or laboratory light\u201d, which seems to be both a confession and a withholding. This doubleness is problematic; a fault line at the heart of her book. Her episodes of despair seem significant. They leave her \u201csobbing on the bathroom floor\u201d, render her incapable of performing basic tasks, and have, two asides suggest, brought her close to suicide. The fragmentary approach she favours \u2013 which allows her inquiry to dart this way and that, like Ader\u2019s torch beam on a dark LA street \u2013 means she can alight on the personal and then quickly retreat into cultural history, science, or poetry. Anyone who has read Maggie Nelson\u2019s The Argonauts, which The Crying Book resembles in both its structure (each paragraph is set apart from its neighbours, in what Nelson has called a \u201cfaux-Wittgenstenian form\u201d) and in certain of its interests (pregnancy, lactation, exhaustion, Judith Butler), will know how powerful this approach can be, with fragments cohering as the book progresses, like iron filings unified by a magnet. In The Crying Book, the fragments mostly stay scattered. In its closing pages she quotes, a little defensively, from Anne Carson\u2019s poem \u201cUncle Falling\u201d \u2013 \u201cHow light, how loose, how unprepared is the web of connections between any thought and any thought\u201d \u2013 and expresses her doubts about the book: \u201cI have been afraid all the connections are wrong. And I also have not known how to stop.\u201d The Crying Book is interesting enough that Christle needn\u2019t feel anxious about its fragmentation. But the one serious cost of its diffuseness is that its autobiographical elements \u2013 particularly those concerning Christle\u2019s \u201cdespair\u201d \u2013 occupy an emotional no man\u2019s land. In the preface to his 1985 book Crying: The Mystery of Tears, William Frey, with whom Christle corresponds in The Crying Book, wrote that: \u201cI hope this book will help place crying in its proper perspective as a normal human response to emotional stress.\u201d Christie offers no such \u201cproper perspective\u201d, but as a selector of unusual, arresting details, she is exceptional. Everyone who reads her book will find something that stays with them, which for me turns out to be a line from the Argentinian writer Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s Instructions for Crying, which I haven\u2019t been able, or particularly wanted, to get out of my head: picture, he suggests, a patch of water \u201cinto which no one sails ever\u201d. \u2022 The Crying Books is published by Corsair (RRP \u00a314.99).

So I\u2019d probably say that about all the young black lads \u2026 that, you know, it\u2019s about, when you are struggling for form, you are going through a sticky patch, it\u2019s about going back to basics, working hard, and doing the right things.\u201d</p> <p>Well there you go.

I am also disappointed that a public service broadcaster did not step in to ask the analyst to explain his reasoning or to distance themselves from these archaic thoughts.\u201d Quite. And we\u2019ll come shortly to the depressing regularity with which pushback against racism ends up having to be player-led.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/16/bbc-pundits-derby-young-black-lads-sparks-call-for-action-craig-ramage-max-lowe-kick-it-out\">BBC pundit taken off air after criticism of Derby's 'young black lads'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For now, Ramage has issued a statement explaining that this is not who he is, and his views don\u2019t reflect his views. Or something. However, it\u2019s hard not to suspect they reflect the views of many pundits, supporters, and some of the newspapers and media outlets, subconsciously or otherwise.</p> <p>\u201cCertain players\u201d, to use Ramage\u2019s euphemism, will never be able to do right for doing wrong, and almost all players have to live with the reality that entirely normal activities will be parsed as somehow detrimental to their game. The most anodyne aspects of the outside life of footballers are ruthlessly policed. Have they been on social media in a manner entirely in keeping with the fact that their side just lost 2-1? Have they been pictured in an expensive car within 48 hours of their side having lost 2-1? Have they got the wrong sort of home, the wrong sort of tattoo, the wrong sort of gait? Are they \u2013 whenever they so much as leave the house \u2013 showing either extreme contrition or extreme gratitude, the only two acceptable off-pitch emotions? If not, some genius analyst or other will soon be making a distinctly moral judgment about \u201cfocus\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ramage's comments are useful insofar as they show how impossible it sometimes is to be young, acceptable and black</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Without wishing to slaughter a sacred cow, then, does any of this really matter? Does it really have any effect on performance, or simply on the feelings of some supporters or commentators? When asked why it matters quite so much as they seem to think it does, pundits given to falling back on this type of critique only ever seem to offer vast woollinesses. It is \u201cindicative of a mindset\u201d, it \u201csends a message\u201d, it \u201csays his head\u2019s somewhere else\u201d. Does it? It\u2019s certainly convenient to think so. But I often feel the mindset it is all rather more indicative of is that of the pundit in question.</p> <p>In fact, Ramage\u2019s comments are useful insofar as they show how absolutely impossible it sometimes is to be young, acceptable and black.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s worth reading the comments made by local BBC pundit \u2013 now former BBC pundit \u2013 Craig Ramage in the wake of Derby\u2019s 1-1 draw with Huddersfield on Saturday. \u201cWhen I look at certain players,\u201d Ramage judged, \u201ctheir body language, their stance, the way they act, you just feel, hold on a minute, he needs pulling down a peg or two. So I\u2019d probably say that about all the young black lads \u2026 that, you know, it\u2019s about, when you are struggling for form, you are going through a sticky patch, it\u2019s about going back to basics, working hard, and doing the right things.\u201d Well there you go. Ramage has now been relieved of his duties by the BBC, though it was notably left to a 22-year-old Derby player to publicly challenge the comments. On Sunday, defender Max Lowe spoke out on Instagram \u201con behalf of black footballers at Derby Country \u2026 Racial ignorance, stereotyping and intolerance negatively affects the image of impressionable young footballers and creates an unnecessary divide in society. I am also disappointed that a public service broadcaster did not step in to ask the analyst to explain his reasoning or to distance themselves from these archaic thoughts.\u201d Quite. And we\u2019ll come shortly to the depressing regularity with which pushback against racism ends up having to be player-led. For now, Ramage has issued a statement explaining that this is not who he is, and his views don\u2019t reflect his views. Or something. However, it\u2019s hard not to suspect they reflect the views of many pundits, supporters, and some of the newspapers and media outlets, subconsciously or otherwise. \u201cCertain players\u201d, to use Ramage\u2019s euphemism, will never be able to do right for doing wrong, and almost all players have to live with the reality that entirely normal activities will be parsed as somehow detrimental to their game. The most anodyne aspects of the outside life of footballers are ruthlessly policed. Have they been on social media in a manner entirely in keeping with the fact that their side just lost 2-1? Have they been pictured in an expensive car within 48 hours of their side having lost 2-1? Have they got the wrong sort of home, the wrong sort of tattoo, the wrong sort of gait? Are they \u2013 whenever they so much as leave the house \u2013 showing either extreme contrition or extreme gratitude, the only two acceptable off-pitch emotions? If not, some genius analyst or other will soon be making a distinctly moral judgment about \u201cfocus\u201d. Without wishing to slaughter a sacred cow, then, does any of this really matter? Does it really have any effect on performance, or simply on the feelings of some supporters or commentators? When asked why it matters quite so much as they seem to think it does, pundits given to falling back on this type of critique only ever seem to offer vast woollinesses. It is \u201cindicative of a mindset\u201d, it \u201csends a message\u201d, it \u201csays his head\u2019s somewhere else\u201d. Does it? It\u2019s certainly convenient to think so. But I often feel the mindset it is all rather more indicative of is that of the pundit in question. In fact, Ramage\u2019s comments are useful insofar as they show how absolutely impossible it sometimes is to be young, acceptable and black. His primary issues with the young black players are ludicrous things \u2013 things like their stance, their body language. And yet it continues to fall to players like them to lead the charge against their own treatment. A fortnight after a 50%rise in football-related racist incidents over the past year was revealed, Raheem Sterling has mooted a players\u2019 taskforce to combat a problem most now acknowledge is rising. It is said he will consult with the Premier League and Uefa \u2013 but is that the right way round? When Kobe Bryant died, the reflection of the Uefa president was striking. \u201cI did not know Bryant personally,\u201d said Aleksander Ceferin, \u201cbut I was always struck by the way he never shied from taking a firm stance against racism. It made him a true role model for other high-profile sports stars.\u201d What about for high-profile sports bodies? It doesn\u2019t take several years of forensic accountants, lawyers, former Belgian prime ministers, hackers and whistleblowers to uncover when some racism is happening in a location Uefa is technically supposed to govern. Quite often, you can do it off your telly. Despite this, calling it out in a way that produces meaningful results seems to have been officially designated a job for the players, who must do it at the same time as having to try to win a football match. I guess if you want something done, ask a busy person. Even so, many find this allocation of duties unsatisfactory, as suggested by Bayern Munich and Austria defender David Alaba in a Sunday Times interview last weekend. Of the triggering of Uefa\u2019s three-step protocol during England\u2019s game against Bulgaria in Sofia last October, Alaba said: \u201cIt\u2019s very sad that the players have to say something because everybody sees it and everybody hears it so why should the players do something? Because it\u2019s not always for the player. They have to do their job. They\u2019re playing a game \u2026 We have to find a solution that gets through that.\u201d Unfortunately, at this stage in the governing body\u2019s glacial journey towards getting a clue about racism, it still can\u2019t be left to Uefa, who don\u2019t seem to truly want to win on this front at all.

Trump claims to be America\u2019s \u2018chief law enforcement officer\u2019 Donald Trump\u2019s attack on the US judicial system continued on Tuesday, as he called for his former aide Roger Stone\u2019s conviction to be \u201cthrown out\u201d, mused that he might sue those involved in Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia inquiry, and declaring himself, falsely, \u201cthe chief law enforcement officer of the United States\u201d.

Lightning rods. Wednesday\u2019s debate in Las Vegas is a make-or-break moment for some of the remaining candidates, and both Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders, the leftwing frontrunner, are likely to face sustained attacks from their rivals. Governments failing to provide \u2018liveable planet\u2019 for children Globally, children face a future of ecological degradation, devastating climate change and exploitative marketing that governments in every nation are failing to protect them from, according to a new report commissioned by Unicef and the World Health Organization from 40 international child and adolescent health experts. \u201cClimate change, ecological degradation, migrating populations, conflict, pervasive inequalities, and predatory commercial practices threaten the health and future of children in every country,\u201d the report states. A climate change. Utah, one of the reddest states in the US, has unexpectedly embraced a long-term plan to reduce carbon emissions in a bid to protect its ski slopes and economy. Bottled water. A new bill in the Washington senate could see the north-western state become the first in the US to restrict companies from bottling and selling its local water supplies. Coronavirus cruise ship passengers released from quarantine Passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who were kept in quarantine in Japan for two weeks after an outbreak of Covid-19 onboard, have begun leaving the ship after testing negative for the coronavirus. As the toll in mainland China passes 2,000, a second death has been recorded in Hong Kong. In Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, the film director Chang Kai and three of his family all died from the disease during self-quarantine. \u2018Sick man of Asia\u2019. Beijing has revoked the credentials and ordered the expulsion of three Wall Street Journal reporters after the paper published a column on China\u2019s response to the coronavirus, which described the country as \u201cthe real sick man of Asia\u201d.

Must-reads Saffron Burrows: \u2018Teenagers today are fantastically unafraid\u2019 Saffron Burrows was an activist before she was an actor. Now starring in the second season of Netflix\u2019s You, she tells Martha Hayes about her years as an anti-racist campaigner, the \u201crevolutionary\u201d #MeToo movement and the many \u201csexist\u201d films she turned down.

Why gender-free is the future of fragrance The unisex fragrance was first popularised with the 1994 launch of CK One. A quarter-century later, as brands and retailers de-gender their fragrance offerings, the very idea of separate women\u2019s and men\u2019s perfumes looks to be on its way out, writes Funmi Fetto. Opinion If we believe something is right, we should be prepared to do it ourselves, says George Monbiot. Which is why he found himself in the Scottish Highlands, stalking and shooting a deer. As a result of prior human intervention (exterminating their predators), refraining from killing deer means killing other wildlife.

      "body": "<p>The sport of dog agility is easy to grasp for a first-time spectator. The object is simple: Unleashed dogs negotiate a serpentine obstacle course \u2013 clearing a series of jumps, weaving their way around poles, darting through tunnels, hurdling through tires, sprinting up and down ramps and a seesaw \u2013 as quickly as possible under the guidance of their handler, who can rely only on voice cues and body language.</p> \n<p>At the highest form it\u2019s dressage on uppers, marrying the human-animal bond and precision of equestrian sports with the frenetic pace and inherent volatility of alpine skiing, where the margins that separate first place and disaster are often down to hair-trigger decisions imperceptible to the untrained eye. To the unfamiliar, it can seem like magic.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not hard to see why this fast-paced and eminently televisable spectacle of barely controlled chaos has fast become one of the most popular events of the Westminster Kennel Club dog show in the seven years since it was first added to the program \u2013 and a welcome alternative for those who believe traditional conformation shows, where dogs are judged almost entirely on their appearance, are archaic and outmoded.</p> \n<p>The introduction of an agility competition to Westminster marked a step forward for this emerging sport and few trainers have since made a bigger impact on the US scene than Perry DeWitt and Jessica Ajoux, who live together in the Philadelphia suburb of Wyncote alongside two of America\u2019s most famous canine athletes: the border collies Verb and Fame.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44f1809101ac3c31ae84d6cf4365c2af1dff3e7d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44f1809101ac3c31ae84d6cf4365c2af1dff3e7d/0_0_3553_2132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pink the border collie competes next to handler Jennifer Crank at the Westminster Kennel Club\u2019s agility title (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pink the border collie competes next to handler Jennifer Crank at the Westminster Kennel Club\u2019s agility title (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><br>The six-year-old Verb, owned and handled by DeWitt, captured last year\u2019s Westminster masters agility title <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhKmykc02Bw\">with a sensational final run</a> that <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/KNTV_20190214_073400_The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Jimmy_Fallon/start/440/end/520\">went viral</a> and enters this year\u2019s competition as the defending champion. Fame, aged nine and in the winter of her career, <a href=\"https://www.foxsports.com/westminster-kennel-club/video/1159135299747\">won it the year before</a> and remains a formidable threat to regain the crown. In a couple days\u2019 time, they will make the two-hour drive north to New York City and attempt to make it three in a row for what\u2019s fast becoming the winningest household in the sport.</p> \n<p>\u201cI do feel a little bit of pressure of being the reigning champion, because I think everyone\u2019s watching and everyone\u2019s expecting you to do something,\u201d DeWitt says in the days before the trial. \u201cAgility is funny because I\u2019ve had so many good runs with Verb and every time I wonder if I will ever have another, because it always feels like it\u2019s just lucky that it happens. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so addicting, because you can\u2019t guarantee it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ajoux, who plans to retire Fame shortly after this year\u2019s Westminster after a decorated career, strikes a more confident pose as the competition looms.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s two people that can beat us,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s us.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Need for speed</strong></h2> \n<p>The conformation portion of Westminster is one of America\u2019s longest-running sporting events and what most people envision when they think of dog shows (or, indeed, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94y9n9lNy2Y\">Best in Show</a>), but vocal critics have claimed it enables the breeding of dogs for beauty over health and function to the detriment of the animal.</p> \n<p>The essential purpose of the more than 20,000 conformation shows held annually in the United States is to assess dogs for breeding stock or, more specifically, in a way that promotes selection of parents in order to produce the \u201cbest\u201d puppies. But the judging at these shows almost exclusively places an emphasis on physical appearance, effectively ignoring the genetic factors like health, temperament and function that enable a dog to live a successful life as a working or companion animal.</p> \n<p>Agility exists on the opposite end of the spectrum from the conformation world, offering a far more dog-positive arena free of controversy. Unlike conformation shows which only allow intact purebreds, it is open to mixed breeds. Handlers don\u2019t care what their border collies look like as they careen through the course and fly toward the finish line: they just want them to win and have fun doing it (and not vitally in that order).

Today, DeWitt and Ajoux live together with eight dogs while owning and operating an agility training center in the nearby village of Huntington Valley, about 25 miles outside Philadelphia. One reason behind their success is they devote themselves to it full time, while many of their competitors are hobbyists with day jobs. This is what they do. Even equestrians who live and breathe their animal every day have to put their horse in a stall at the end of the day. Verb and Fame are in the bed with them. It is their work life, it is their romantic life, it is their hobby and it\u2019s their family.</p> \n<p>The competitive benefits to the partnership are many.

Then if I\u2019ve not done well and I want to be a little bit sad and I want her to comfort me, why should I be taking away from her excitement? Balancing it is super hard, but at the same time, I think we\u2019ve gotten really good at agility because wherever I go, my biggest competition drove there in the car with me.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018At the edge of our training\u2019</h2> \n<p>The origins of dog agility can be traced to the 1978 Crufts dog show in Birmingham, where a former committee member named John Varley was tasked with coming up with intermission entertainment for the audience between the conformation and obedience competitions. His solution was a variation on show jumping designed to demonstrate a dog\u2019s willingness to work with their handler in a variety of situations.</p> \n<p>The Kennel Club, Britain\u2019s counterpart to the AKC, established an official set of rules in 1980 and the sport quickly took hold, spreading across Europe and across the pond over the following decade. It was already popular in the United States long before Westminster added it in 2014, but the sport\u2019s inclusion in America\u2019s most publicized and heavily marketed dog show has given it unprecedented mainstream exposure in a few short years.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s led to increased participation \u2013 the AKC claims more than one million entries to the registry\u2019s agility program each year \u2013 and higher-caliber opposition than ever before, especially at high-profile competitions like Westminster. The fields on the older United States Dog Agility Association (USDAA) circuit are even stronger.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"deaecf33e4891946a99b228bacabda53de4afe6d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/deaecf33e4891946a99b228bacabda53de4afe6d/0_0_4240_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Ajoux and Perry DeWitt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Ajoux, left, and Perry DeWitt spot their names on the Westminster masters agility championship trophy which they won in 2018 and 2019, respectively,</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe competition is getting fiercer and fiercer each year,\u201d says Ajoux, who has been handling agility dogs competitively since 1999. \u201cIt used to be more local people because it\u2019s not like it\u2019s easy to get to New York City, but more and more people are coming in from across the country and you\u2019re seeing more competitive teams. The prestige of winning Westminster is definitely taking hold in the agility community, because of the fact that it\u2019s televised and you get so much recognition, more so than any other thing that happens in agility.\u201d</p> \n<p>She adds: \u201cDogs are getting so much faster. They\u2019re running faster and the courses are becoming more intricate, more technical. And as a result, it\u2019s also becoming more athletically demanding for the handler to negotiate some of the courses as well, because I can\u2019t outrun Fame, and so the only way I can actually tell her where to go is to have skills trained to a higher level. The level of course is right now, it\u2019s at the edge of our training and it\u2019s only getting harder and faster.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>The final hurdle</strong></h2> \n<p>Pier 94, the decommissioned passenger ship terminal on the Hudson River where the agility competition takes place, is already a flurry of activity at 7.30am on a Saturday morning as the Westminster dog show opens for the 144th year. It\u2019s roughly a half hour before the first qualifying runs of this year\u2019s contest and the handlers are walking about the 100-by-40-foot competition space, carefully examining a course they\u2019re only seeing for the first time.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s only so many types of obstacles, and there\u2019s usually between 18 and 22 obstacles on the course, but the combinations are infinite and it\u2019s different every time,\u201d DeWitt says. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll see some similarities or patterns, but it\u2019s never the same course twice. And so you don\u2019t get to practice the exact sequences before the competition, so you have to have a lot of tools in the toolbox in order to negotiate whatever the judge has put forth that day.\u201d</p> \n<p>Verb and Fame will be competing in a field of some 325 dogs today. Both will need to complete a pair of clean qualifying runs to reach the evening finals, which have been sold out for weeks and will be broadcast nationally in prime time.</p> \n<p>Ajoux and Fame compete the first run flawlessly and pace their class entering the second. But Fame takes a bar early in her second run, knocking it to the ground for a five-second deduction, then commits a second fault when she misses a jump near the end. A single fault, which counts against a dog\u2019s overall time, might not have spelled elimination given Fame\u2019s raw speed. But two faults is too deep a hole for the fastest dog to overcome.</p> \n<p>That leaves it to Verb and the defending champion lives up to advance billing, zipping through a pair of flawless qualifying runs and earning the top seed for the final.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9f014831ec1a757e24bc815cfb89b361c98060c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9f014831ec1a757e24bc815cfb89b361c98060c/0_287_4240_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"2020 Westminster Masters Agility championship, New York, NY\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perry DeWitt awaits a run during the 2020 Westminster masters agility championship at Pier 94 in New York City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After carefully examining the freshly redesigned course before the final run and mentally devising a handling plan, DeWitt retreats beneath the grandstand with Verb, closes her eyes and goes through the creative visualization routine \u2013 seeing the perfect run in her mind\u2019s eye. The course is tricky at the finish, but she\u2019s confident in her dog \u2013 even if the spiking heart rate on her smart watch betrays her nerves.</p> \n<p>Then it begins and one by one the dogs in Verb\u2019s class either botch their runs or fail to post extraordinary times. And with Verb running last due to his afternoon performance, DeWitt knows the time they need to beat \u2013 and safe in the knowledge that she doesn\u2019t need to push him.</p> \n<p>A hush falls over the sold-out crowd as Verb takes his position at the start line. Then he\u2019s off like a bullet from a barrel, clearing every jump and obstacle, barreling through tunnels and drawing <em>ooh</em>s and <em>aah</em>s from the gallery as he whips through the weaving poles at impossible speed. He\u2019s well ahead of the clubhouse leader and it seems a second straight Westminster title is in the bag when \u2013 in a stroke of breathtaking drama \u2013 he takes the wrong jump at the final obstacle before turning back and going through the right one. As the crowd deflates like a balloon, DeWitt throws her arms up in a mix of surprise and disappointment. The refusal is a five-second deduction, ensuring their elimination. He didn\u2019t go where she told him to go. Just a moment of an animal being an animal.</p> \n<p>The overall winner is a border collie named Pink handled by the Ohio trainer Jennifer Crank, the same team who finished second to Fame in 2018 and to Verb in 2019. Behind the winner\u2019s circle are tears and there are smiles as DeWitt embraces Ajoux in the corridor where their photos hang as former champions. Verb\u2019s contagious grin as he looks up from the carpet seems to communicate what they all know: They\u2019ll be back.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe just both care probably too much for what it really is,\u201d DeWitt says. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a dog sport, dogs jumping over PVC pipes. But we care about it a lot, which makes us better because we\u2019re always working hard. We\u2019re both very, very competitive and always have been in everything we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The sport of dog agility is easy to grasp for a first-time spectator. The object is simple: Unleashed dogs negotiate a serpentine obstacle course \u2013 clearing a series of jumps, weaving their way around poles, darting through tunnels, hurdling through tires, sprinting up and down ramps and a seesaw \u2013 as quickly as possible under the guidance of their handler, who can rely only on voice cues and body language. At the highest form it\u2019s dressage on uppers, marrying the human-animal bond and precision of equestrian sports with the frenetic pace and inherent volatility of alpine skiing, where the margins that separate first place and disaster are often down to hair-trigger decisions imperceptible to the untrained eye. To the unfamiliar, it can seem like magic. It\u2019s not hard to see why this fast-paced and eminently televisable spectacle of barely controlled chaos has fast become one of the most popular events of the Westminster Kennel Club dog show in the seven years since it was first added to the program \u2013 and a welcome alternative for those who believe traditional conformation shows, where dogs are judged almost entirely on their appearance, are archaic and outmoded. The introduction of an agility competition to Westminster marked a step forward for this emerging sport and few trainers have since made a bigger impact on the US scene than Perry DeWitt and Jessica Ajoux, who live together in the Philadelphia suburb of Wyncote alongside two of America\u2019s most famous canine athletes: the border collies Verb and Fame. The six-year-old Verb, owned and handled by DeWitt, captured last year\u2019s Westminster masters agility title with a sensational final run that went viral and enters this year\u2019s competition as the defending champion. Fame, aged nine and in the winter of her career, won it the year before and remains a formidable threat to regain the crown. In a couple days\u2019 time, they will make the two-hour drive north to New York City and attempt to make it three in a row for what\u2019s fast becoming the winningest household in the sport. \u201cI do feel a little bit of pressure of being the reigning champion, because I think everyone\u2019s watching and everyone\u2019s expecting you to do something,\u201d DeWitt says in the days before the trial. \u201cAgility is funny because I\u2019ve had so many good runs with Verb and every time I wonder if I will ever have another, because it always feels like it\u2019s just lucky that it happens. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so addicting, because you can\u2019t guarantee it.\u201d Ajoux, who plans to retire Fame shortly after this year\u2019s Westminster after a decorated career, strikes a more confident pose as the competition looms. \u201cThere\u2019s two people that can beat us,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s us.\u201d Need for speed The conformation portion of Westminster is one of America\u2019s longest-running sporting events and what most people envision when they think of dog shows (or, indeed, Best in Show), but vocal critics have claimed it enables the breeding of dogs for beauty over health and function to the detriment of the animal. The essential purpose of the more than 20,000 conformation shows held annually in the United States is to assess dogs for breeding stock or, more specifically, in a way that promotes selection of parents in order to produce the \u201cbest\u201d puppies. But the judging at these shows almost exclusively places an emphasis on physical appearance, effectively ignoring the genetic factors like health, temperament and function that enable a dog to live a successful life as a working or companion animal. Agility exists on the opposite end of the spectrum from the conformation world, offering a far more dog-positive arena free of controversy. Unlike conformation shows which only allow intact purebreds, it is open to mixed breeds. Handlers don\u2019t care what their border collies look like as they careen through the course and fly toward the finish line: they just want them to win and have fun doing it (and not vitally in that order). As competitions they are similar in the sense they determine a best from a field of dogs and thus exist to celebrate an ideal. But as a spectator sport, agility trials are to conformation shows, more or less, as Miss America is to the Olympics. Any able-bodied dog is eligible to compete in agility under American Kennel Club rules, but border collies like Verb and Fame have won the overall title in all but one of the seven years since Westminster introduced it. That\u2019s no accident. The herding dog is widely regarded as the most intelligent of domestic breeds, underpinned by a sheer athleticism seemingly tailor-made for the sport\u2019s demands. The difference in watching a top border collie churn through a course after watching a dachshund or a mastiff feels something like watching LeBron James take the court on the heels of a mid-major college game. \u201cI would say they\u2019re one of the one of the most, if not the most biddable dog breed out there, which means that they want to do what you want them to do,\u201d says DeWitt, a full-time certified professional dog trainer with an in-depth background in dog behavior. \u201cThey were bred to be working in conjunction with humans doing tasks and responding very quickly to cues and commands at a distance. Not to mention, they\u2019re very, very athletic. They can turn on a dime, they can accelerate, they can decelerate, they can sprint, they have endurance. They\u2019re just an overall very athletic breed.\u201d DeWitt had initially been eying a different puppy in the litter of a breeder from outside Las Vegas when she first spotted Verb at five weeks old and knew \u201cwithin 30 seconds\u201d she needed to have him. She gave him a name that connoted action, auguring the exploits in his future. But innate athleticism is only half of the game. DeWitt\u2019s almost extrasensory communion with Verb as he bounds around the ring in lockstep with her cues, 42lbs of fast-twitch muscle in a blur, is a demonstrable testament to her command of the underlying emotional factors that drive canine behavior. She\u2019s found her other half in Ajoux, a Princeton-educated agility instructor who has less of a formal background in dog training but has competed in the sport since she was a teenager and made it into her full-time profession. She believes athleticism is the most non-negotiable trait in a top dog, but character cannot be overlooked. \u201cThese are dogs that live with us all the time, so you have to find a dog that you get along with,\u201d says Ajoux, who wasn\u2019t in the market for a new puppy when an enthusiastic breeder insisted (correctly) that Fame was her type of dog. \u201cTheir personality, if it matches well with yours, that\u2019s the winning team.

She was nine when her parents bought the family a border collie and took it on herself to start training him in agility on a makeshift course in her backyard after seeing a competition on television. She put agility on the back burner for a few years when her own lacrosse career took off, but can vividly recall her sudden compulsion to get back into it again while riding the bus home from her final college game. One week after graduation, she was in California buying her first own border collie and the rest is history. \u201cWhat matters the most in this sport is how a dog and a team responds to pressure,\u201d DeWitt says, a nod to the competitive itch that agility manages to scratch for her. \u201cYou can be the best in the world in your backyard or even in class, but you have to be able to take the crowd, you have to be able to take the pressure of being in a final run and manage your emotions and the dog has to be able to manage theirs, too. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing that makes Verb such an amazing competitor: he is not fazed by anything. If I took him in the backyard and did agility with him, it would be no different than doing it at Westminster with a huge crowd and the speakers and the people cheering. He does not notice, he does not care. I do, but I think having a history of competing in sports at a pretty high level taught me to be able to deal with that type of emotion.\u201d Ajoux, who was raised in southern California and France, was also a born animal-lover and spent many of her early years horseback riding and show jumping. But from the moment she first saw an agility trial on television, she knew she had to be involved. She researched agility clubs obsessively as a teenager and started training the family\u2019s house dog, Mocha, for competitions that she couldn\u2019t yet drive to. Her parents thought it was a fad, but two decades later it remains her passion and livelihood. They met several years ago through the agility community and describe their early impressions of one another in terms of mutual respect as competitors.

The fields on the older United States Dog Agility Association (USDAA) circuit are even stronger. \u201cThe competition is getting fiercer and fiercer each year,\u201d says Ajoux, who has been handling agility dogs competitively since 1999. \u201cIt used to be more local people because it\u2019s not like it\u2019s easy to get to New York City, but more and more people are coming in from across the country and you\u2019re seeing more competitive teams. The prestige of winning Westminster is definitely taking hold in the agility community, because of the fact that it\u2019s televised and you get so much recognition, more so than any other thing that happens in agility.\u201d She adds: \u201cDogs are getting so much faster. They\u2019re running faster and the courses are becoming more intricate, more technical. And as a result, it\u2019s also becoming more athletically demanding for the handler to negotiate some of the courses as well, because I can\u2019t outrun Fame, and so the only way I can actually tell her where to go is to have skills trained to a higher level. The level of course is right now, it\u2019s at the edge of our training and it\u2019s only getting harder and faster.\u201d The final hurdle Pier 94, the decommissioned passenger ship terminal on the Hudson River where the agility competition takes place, is already a flurry of activity at 7.30am on a Saturday morning as the Westminster dog show opens for the 144th year. It\u2019s roughly a half hour before the first qualifying runs of this year\u2019s contest and the handlers are walking about the 100-by-40-foot competition space, carefully examining a course they\u2019re only seeing for the first time. \u201cThere\u2019s only so many types of obstacles, and there\u2019s usually between 18 and 22 obstacles on the course, but the combinations are infinite and it\u2019s different every time,\u201d DeWitt says. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll see some similarities or patterns, but it\u2019s never the same course twice. And so you don\u2019t get to practice the exact sequences before the competition, so you have to have a lot of tools in the toolbox in order to negotiate whatever the judge has put forth that day.\u201d Verb and Fame will be competing in a field of some 325 dogs today. Both will need to complete a pair of clean qualifying runs to reach the evening finals, which have been sold out for weeks and will be broadcast nationally in prime time. Ajoux and Fame compete the first run flawlessly and pace their class entering the second. But Fame takes a bar early in her second run, knocking it to the ground for a five-second deduction, then commits a second fault when she misses a jump near the end. A single fault, which counts against a dog\u2019s overall time, might not have spelled elimination given Fame\u2019s raw speed. But two faults is too deep a hole for the fastest dog to overcome. That leaves it to Verb and the defending champion lives up to advance billing, zipping through a pair of flawless qualifying runs and earning the top seed for the final. After carefully examining the freshly redesigned course before the final run and mentally devising a handling plan, DeWitt retreats beneath the grandstand with Verb, closes her eyes and goes through the creative visualization routine \u2013 seeing the perfect run in her mind\u2019s eye. The course is tricky at the finish, but she\u2019s confident in her dog \u2013 even if the spiking heart rate on her smart watch betrays her nerves. Then it begins and one by one the dogs in Verb\u2019s class either botch their runs or fail to post extraordinary times. And with Verb running last due to his afternoon performance, DeWitt knows the time they need to beat \u2013 and safe in the knowledge that she doesn\u2019t need to push him. A hush falls over the sold-out crowd as Verb takes his position at the start line. Then he\u2019s off like a bullet from a barrel, clearing every jump and obstacle, barreling through tunnels and drawing oohs and aahs from the gallery as he whips through the weaving poles at impossible speed. He\u2019s well ahead of the clubhouse leader and it seems a second straight Westminster title is in the bag when \u2013 in a stroke of breathtaking drama \u2013 he takes the wrong jump at the final obstacle before turning back and going through the right one. As the crowd deflates like a balloon, DeWitt throws her arms up in a mix of surprise and disappointment. The refusal is a five-second deduction, ensuring their elimination. He didn\u2019t go where she told him to go. Just a moment of an animal being an animal. The overall winner is a border collie named Pink handled by the Ohio trainer Jennifer Crank, the same team who finished second to Fame in 2018 and to Verb in 2019. Behind the winner\u2019s circle are tears and there are smiles as DeWitt embraces Ajoux in the corridor where their photos hang as former champions. Verb\u2019s contagious grin as he looks up from the carpet seems to communicate what they all know: They\u2019ll be back. \u201cWe just both care probably too much for what it really is,\u201d DeWitt says. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a dog sport, dogs jumping over PVC pipes. But we care about it a lot, which makes us better because we\u2019re always working hard. We\u2019re both very, very competitive and always have been in everything we\u2019ve done.\u201d",

A few years ago, the Utah legislature passed a resolution urging the EPA to \u201ccease its carbon dioxide reduction policies, programs, and regulations until climate data and global warming science are substantiated\u201d.</p> <p>But now the perspectives of some state lawmakers \u2013 and of Holst, who spent most of his career in the oil and gas industry \u2013 have shifted.</p> <p>\u201cThe economist Adam Smith talked about an invisible hand that guides the economy, and in this particular case, the cost of renewable energy, whether it\u2019s wind or solar, has gone down so rapidly and made itself so market efficient versus fossil fuels, that there is a change, and the change can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d Holst said. \u201cSo now is the opportunity for a state like Utah which is rich in both renewables as well as fossil fuels to embrace that change and get out ahead of it.\u201d</p> <p>Other red states and municipalities are slowly starting to address global heating. After banning the words \u201cclimate change\u201d from state environmental agencies, Florida now has a chief resilience officer tasked with preparing for sea level rise. After a year of disastrous flooding, Nebraska lawmakers <a href=\"https://journalstar.com/legislature/call-for-nebraska-climate-change-plan-advances-to-full-legislative/article_ab0fa9f9-ad13-539d-95a4-56d715267015.html\">advanced a bill</a> to develop a climate change plan for a full legislative debate. </p> <p>Utah prides itself on being business friendly \u2013 and it has a rapidly growing tech sector concerned about environmental issues, as well as booming tourist economy that revolves around the ski industry and public lands.</p> <p>The Utah plan, known as the Utah Roadmap, began, like a number of recent environmental initiatives, with young people clamoring for action.

      "bodyText": "In a move to protect its ski slopes and growing economy, Utah \u2013 one of the reddest states in the nation \u2013 has just created a long-term plan to address the climate crisis. And in a surprising turnaround, some of the state\u2019s conservative leaders are welcoming it. \u201cIf we don\u2019t think about Utah\u2019s long-term future, who will?\u201d Republican state house speaker Brad Wilson said at a recent focus group to discuss the proposals. At the request of the Republican-dominated state legislature, a University of Utah economic thinktank produced the plan to reduce emissions affecting both the local air quality and the global climate. Project lead Thomas Holst, an energy analyst, never expected to be at the helm of an effort like this. A few years ago, the Utah legislature passed a resolution urging the EPA to \u201ccease its carbon dioxide reduction policies, programs, and regulations until climate data and global warming science are substantiated\u201d. But now the perspectives of some state lawmakers \u2013 and of Holst, who spent most of his career in the oil and gas industry \u2013 have shifted. \u201cThe economist Adam Smith talked about an invisible hand that guides the economy, and in this particular case, the cost of renewable energy, whether it\u2019s wind or solar, has gone down so rapidly and made itself so market efficient versus fossil fuels, that there is a change, and the change can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d Holst said. \u201cSo now is the opportunity for a state like Utah which is rich in both renewables as well as fossil fuels to embrace that change and get out ahead of it.\u201d Other red states and municipalities are slowly starting to address global heating. After banning the words \u201cclimate change\u201d from state environmental agencies, Florida now has a chief resilience officer tasked with preparing for sea level rise. After a year of disastrous flooding, Nebraska lawmakers advanced a bill to develop a climate change plan for a full legislative debate. Utah prides itself on being business friendly \u2013 and it has a rapidly growing tech sector concerned about environmental issues, as well as booming tourist economy that revolves around the ski industry and public lands. The Utah plan, known as the Utah Roadmap, began, like a number of recent environmental initiatives, with young people clamoring for action. High school students drafted a resolution that recognized the impacts of the climate crisis and encouraged emissions reductions, and persuaded two Republican lawmakers to sponsor it. Environmental advocates say it was the first measure of its kind to pass in a red state. The legislature followed up with state money for experts to provide policy recommendations. Another factor that has primed Utah leaders to address the climate crisis is the state\u2019s unique air quality issues. The majority of the population lives in mountain valleys where in winter, temperature inversions can trap air pollutants, often reaching levels that impact health, particularly among children and the elderly. \u201cIt cuts across political lines. [Clean air] is not a partisan issue in our state,\u201d said Utah speaker Wilson. He said there is not the same kind of consensus on climate change in the legislature, but \u201cthere is absolutely overlap between air quality concerns we have and reducing greenhouse gas emissions\u201d.

Research suggests that framing policy around economic benefits and sustainability allows local leaders to respond to climate change without getting caught up in political divisions. \u201cThat tends to pull some of the politics out of it \u2013 not for everybody \u2013 but for many.

Clean air concerns are also the reason officials are pushing Utah gas refineries to produce cleaner gasoline, and when the Trump administration announced plans to roll back clean car standards, Utah\u2019s bipartisan clean air caucus held a press conference urging Congress to resist the move.

Facing off in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening are Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar; the former vice-president Joe Biden; the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, Pete Buttigieg; and the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. The debate comes one week after Sanders won the New Hampshire primary, setting the stage for a primary battle between the Vermont senator and the more moderate candidates fighting his momentum. On the heels of a strong performance in the messy Iowa caucuses, Buttigieg came in a close second in New Hampshire, where Klobuchar\u2019s unexpected surge won her third place, and Warren and Biden both experienced disappointing results. The February results make Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucus a high-stakes race for many of the candidates, and the debate is providing the final opportunity for them to make their pitch on national TV. \u201cThe pressure is building here and the gloves are going to be off,\u201d said Fred Lokken, a political science professor at Truckee Meadows community college in Reno. Sanders is likely to become a target of many of the candidates given his frontrunner status, similar to the way Biden was a magnet for criticism in the early debates last year, Lokken predicted. Centrist candidates such as Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Biden are expected to make the pitch to Nevada voters that they are the best \u201cmainstream alternative\u201d, said Eric Herzik, political science professor at the University of Nevada, Reno. \u201cStyle points are really going to start counting, because this is how the media is covering it.\u201d Klobuchar had several breakout moments at the last debate in New Hampshire, including a fierce argument that Buttigieg, as a 38-year-old former mayor, lacks the experience to be president. The strong performance may have played a role in her surprise third-place win days later, and some are looking to see whether she can break through again on the stage in Vegas. Both centrist candidates from the midwest will need to broaden their coalitions as they head to states like Nevada that are significantly more diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire. Nevada is nearly 30% Latino and 10% black and has become increasingly Democratic in recent years. The state also has a strong record of supporting women in office, which could factor into the dynamics of the debate and caucuses. Both US senators in Nevada are women, and the state was the first in the country to have a majority-female legislature. With the longshot candidate Andrew Yang out of the race, the debate will once again feature an all-white lineup. For Warren, the debate is a critical opportunity to rebuild the momentum she has lost after surging in polls last year. And the gaffe-prone Biden, who is hoping for a rebound in Nevada and South Carolina, is in a particularly precarious position. The wild card on stage will be Bloomberg, the New York billionaire who entered the race late last year and has been climbing in polls after spending more on TV and online ads than any candidate in US political history. He will probably also be a target at the debate, especially following escalating scrutiny of his \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing strategy that disproportionately targeted black and Latinos for years. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign also recently attacked Sanders with a new ad, while the senator has increasingly criticized the former mayor on the campaign trail, telling supporters: \u201cWe are a democracy, not an oligarchy.\u201d This is the first time Bloomberg has qualified for the debate, made possible by the Democratic National Committee\u2019s controversial decision to remove the requirement that candidates have a certain number of individual donors.

The release of the post came as an inquest into Flack\u2019s death opened on Wednesday, with tributes pouring in for the presenter and the Crown Prosecution Service facing criticism for its decision to charge her.

      "bodyText": "\u201cNew York City FC will host a match in the Concacaf Champions League at Red Bull Arena, the home ground of the New York Red Bulls,\u201d writes Rashaad Jorden. \u201cExcluding groundshares, have there been scenarios in which a club has to play home matches at the ground of an arch-rival?\u201d There sure have, Rashaad. Jo Bannon takes us back a century or so: \u201cAs league games were postponed during the first world war, Tottenham played some home games at Highbury from 1916-19. White Hart Lane was requisitioned by the War Office to be used for munitions work \u2013 so it could be said Spurs were at Arsenal because an arsenal was at Spurs.\u201d \u201cManchester United relocated to Maine Road due to the second world war,\u201d writes Mukhtar Khan. \u201cA match played there between United and Arsenal in 1948 attracted a crowd of 83,260.\u201d Stuart Bateman expands: \u201cIn 1956, Old Trafford had no floodlights, so European fixtures against Anderlecht and Athletic Bilbao were moved to Maine Road.\u201d And then, of course, there was their spell at Anfield. \u201cDundee made the shortest journey in world football, from Dens Park to Tannadice \u2013 home of Dundee United \u2013 in April 1999 to draw 1-1 with Rangers,\u201d notes Stuart McLagan. \u201cDens was being renovated at the time.\u201d More Scottish japes from Dougie Ford: \u201cIn 1971-72 Celtic were drawn against Rangers in the League Cup. Celtic Park was being redeveloped, so Celtic\u2019s home game against Rangers was played at Ibrox. They won at Ibrox three times in four weeks.\u201d Michael Haughey moves us along. \u201cIn summer 2000, Aston Villa entered the Intertoto Cup just as they were demolishing the Trinity Road stand at Villa Park,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe two home games, against Marila Pribram and Celta Vigo, were switched to the Hawthorns. In the 1985 FA Cup, Burton Albion played \u2018at\u2019 Leicester City in a tie switched to Derby\u2019s Baseball Ground. After Burton\u2019s goalie was knocked unconscious in a 6-1 Foxes win, the FA ordered the game to be replayed behind closed doors \u2013 at Coventry\u2019s Highfield Road.\u201d Paul Nash chips in: \u201cBristol Rovers played a very unhappy stretch of home games at City\u2019s Ashton Gate in 1980 following a fire at Eastville Stadium. They also played a home game v Swindon (another local rival) at the Gate in their first season as tenants at Twerton Park.\u201d From Bath to the Basque country: \u201cAthletic Bilbao played a home game at Real Sociedad a few years back when the new San Mam\u00e9s wasn\u2019t quite ready,\u201d writes Jack Tanner. Over to Denmark, and Emil Reventlow: \u201cBr\u00f8ndby have played several European matches \u2013 including against Liverpool and Manchester United \u2013 at Parken, the ground of arch-rivals FC Copenhagen.\u201d And Sean DeLoughry brings the subject to a close: \u201cThis happens all the time in smaller leagues, especially for continental competitions. In Ireland, Dundalk recently hosted European games at bitter rivals Shamrock Rovers (Tallaght Stadium), local rivals Drogheda (United Park) as well as Bohemians (Dalymount) and Shelbourne (Tolka Park).\u201d Oscar voters at the helm of clubs With Portsmouth\u2019s Michael Eisner eligible to vote on this year\u2019s Academy Awards, Charlie Leddy-Owen wonders: \u201cAre there, or have there ever been, any other owners of an English club who get an Oscar vote?\u201d Dara O\u2019Reilly steps up quickly before the music plays him off: \u201cThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences does not disclose its membership, and in theory it is open to everyone who has a film credit, provided they can be sponsored by two academy members,\u201d he writes. \u201cHowever, automatic membership is conferred on every person nominated for an Academy Award, and they are entitled to vote for those categories for which they have been nominated as well as for best film. Everton chairman Bill Kenwright produced My Pure Land, a female-centric Pakistani western which was nominated for best foreign picture in the 2017 Oscars, so he is automatically an academy member. Similarly, Watford life-president and former chairman Elton John has been nominated four times, winning twice (including this year) for best original song.\u201d Busy days \u201cMy brother spent last Tuesday morning at the Manor, once Oxford United\u2019s ground and now a hospital, and the evening at the Kassam watching United v Newcastle,\u201d tweets Dale Morgan. \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to spend a day at multiple grounds of a single team?\u201d Alun Thomas sketches an itinerary: \u201cOn a bank holiday, with a favourable fixture list and open roads, it should be possible to cover four Brighton &amp; Hove Albion grounds,\u201d he begins. \u201cAn 11am kick-off for AFC Varndeanians at the Withdean Stadium, a 3pm kick-off for Gillingham at the Priestfield Stadium, and an 8pm kick-off for Brighton at the Amex. You\u2019ll probably want to eat something afterwards \u2013 so where better that the retail park on the site of the old Goldstone Ground.\u201d Alec Cochrane has another possibility: Further afield? \u201cYou could have a fine day sampling Bayern\u2019s grounds,\u201d offers Sean DeLoughry. \u201cStart with a stroll round the Theresienwiese park, where they started life. Then on to the still-operational Gr\u00fcnwalder Stadion, to take in a Bayern reserve or youth-team game. The Olympiastadion, which hosted the 1974 World Cup final, is still open \u2013 you could take a tour \u2013 then on to the Allianz Arena for a match.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cIs it true that Falkirk (or another Scottish side) were once shipwrecked on the way to a game?\u201d wondered Dan Palmer in 2012. The side who took a dip in the briny deep came from further down the Firth of Forth.

There is talk of linking up the Simplon and St Gotthard railways, on the Italian side of the Alps, by making a new line along the north-west shore of Lake Maggiore, from Locarno, on a branch of the St. Gotthard line, to Fondo-Toce on the Simplon. It is a very good plan, and will save tourists a good deal of time in many little expeditions near Lake Maggiore, and enable more good <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Meredith\">Meredithians</a> with Vittoria in their pockets to go to Montterone for the famous view of the \u201cburnished realm of mountain and plain beneath the royal sun of Italy.\u201d But this Geneva correspondent goes further, and says that \u201ca circular tour around Switzerland by the Simplon and St Gotthard lines could be conveniently undertaken.\u201d <br><em><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/02/18/20_Aug_1910.jpg\">Continue reading.</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94880de3cde7364f00bf90de38e32416796f6248\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94880de3cde7364f00bf90de38e32416796f6248/0_333_3495_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers during the construction of the Simplon Tunnel, Italy 1902.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers during the construction of the Simplon Tunnel, Italy 1902.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: De Agostini via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Editorial: tunnels for peace</h2> <p>19 May 1956</p> <p>Half a century ago to-day the great Simplon Tunnel, Milan\u2019s way beneath the Alps to Lausanne, Paris, Calais, London, was inaugurated for railway travel. On the anniversary the Italian and Swiss Presidents are engaged in toasting each other\u2019s Republics and inaugurating commemorative exhibitions. According to the first edition (1914) of the Italian Touring Club\u2019s admirable series of guides: \u201cThe conception and direction of this great work were foreign, but the exceedingly arduous execution was the glory of Italian workmen.\u201d So the exhibitions on the Italian side at Milan and Domodossola are being matched by a Swiss exhibition at Lausanne.</p> <p>The Simplon rail route opened up for traffic thirty-five years later than the Mont Cenis or Frejus route, linking Turin to Chambery and Paris and providing still the classic British way to Rome. The Simplon Tunnel seas nearly twice as long as the other, and very deep and difficult; but improved techniques allowed it to be built in about half the time. (The St Gothard Tunnel through Switzerland to Germany was an intermediate achievement in each respect while the Brenner railroad, well away from the Italian frontiers of those times, could be carried over the Alps by sheer climbing.) In their turn these victories over Europe\u2019s major mountains relegated Hannibal\u2019s, and even Napoleon\u2019s, methods of getting in or out of Italy to the history books. That would not have been true for war-time, had not Italy steadily enjoyed the conviction that Switzerland would and could defend its own neutrality. Even so, in the Mussolinian tyranny and the Second World War the old pilgrims\u2019 routes reacquired importance as paths of escape. No railborn comfort for those tormented men seeking freedom! Mass-motoring has now opened a new phase in trans-alpine travel, with the railways called upon to give a lift to ever-swelling numbers of motor-cars far beneath the impassable winter roads. Meanwhile the anniversary celebration reminds us \u2013 and is this not salutary? \u2013 how confidently our grandfathers then saved and planned and worked to produce common sense improvements in human comfort and commerce.</p> <h2>Editorial: under the mountain</h2> <p>15 August 1962</p> <p>The first thing that happened yesterday after the French and Italian engineers had met and toasted each other under Mont Blanc was that the two governments opened a Customs and frontier post at the Italian end of the tunnel. But this seems to be a gesture aimed at complying with all the bureaucratic forms rather than an earnest of interference to come. Customs and immigration checks between members of the European Economic Community are already slight compared with the kind of thing you find at Dover. There seems no reason to doubt that when the tunnel opens to traffic some eighteen months hence it will do a great deal to let cars and lorries travel between the two countries freely and in all weathers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/from-the-archive-blog/2019/may/01/channel-tunnel-opens-eurostar-may-1994\">No longer an island: when the Channel Tunnel opened \u2013 May 1994</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tunnel will not only cut 124 miles off the road journey from Paris to Rome, it will make the journey possible during the months when the Alpine passes are snowed up and motorists must now take the circuitous and crowded road along the Mediterranean coast. It is remarkable how recently the Alps made a near-impassable barrier in winter \u2013 almost within living memory.

      "bodyText": "The Simplon pierced: completion of the great tunnel 25 February 1905 The Simplon Tunnel was completed at 7\u201920 yesterday morning, and \u201cthrough the rocks of the Alps Switzerland and Italy join hands.\u201d The words are from a telegram of congratulation sent by the municipality of Lausanne, to the Syndic of Milan \u2013 a telegram which voices the joy of the Swiss nation at an event so long and so impatiently awaited. M Ruchet, President of the Swiss Confederation, in a telegram of congratulation to King Victor Emmanuel and Signor Giolitti, the Italian Premier, likewise expresses the wish that the great work will contribute to draw still closer the bonds of friendship uniting the two countries, which have both contributed to the expense of the undertaking. The contractors have telegraphed the news of the meeting of the two galleries to the King of Italy and the Swiss President, and the Italian and Swiss flags float over the entrance to the tunnel. The town of Iselle (on the Italian side) is en f\u00eate. The actual opening ceremony will take place about March 28. Meanwhile the water which has accumulated in places has to be drawn off and the permanent way built. But the piercing of the tunnel means a triumph over all difficulties and the completion of an engineering work the result of which is the longest tunnel in the world. The story of the work Oliver Wendell Holmes\u2019s metaphor that the last drop of water in a bottle was the hardest to pour out might be held to apply with peculiar fitness to the completion of the Simplon Tunnel. Of the tunnel, which is more than twelve miles long and the piercing of which began six years ago, only 200 yards remained to be drilled last October, only sixty yards at the beginning of the third week in February, and only five yards on Thursday. But the last sixty yards of the work were accompanied with the gravest difficulties and were attended by a problem of great uncertainty. Continue reading. The Simplon Tunnel opened 26 January 1906 Ordinary passenger service through the Simplon Tunnel was started yesterday, the first train entering the tunnel at 8 56 am from the north and leaving it at 9 53 am. The best of conditions prevailed as far as temperature and other matters were concerned. On the train emerging from the tunnel cheers were raised by the spectators and salutes were fired. The train consisted of an engine and four passenger coaches, containing a number of eminent passengers and journalists. Editorial: under or over the Alps 20 August 1910 A new kind of travel is suggested by the Geneva correspondent of a London newspaper. There is talk of linking up the Simplon and St Gotthard railways, on the Italian side of the Alps, by making a new line along the north-west shore of Lake Maggiore, from Locarno, on a branch of the St. Gotthard line, to Fondo-Toce on the Simplon. It is a very good plan, and will save tourists a good deal of time in many little expeditions near Lake Maggiore, and enable more good Meredithians with Vittoria in their pockets to go to Montterone for the famous view of the \u201cburnished realm of mountain and plain beneath the royal sun of Italy.\u201d But this Geneva correspondent goes further, and says that \u201ca circular tour around Switzerland by the Simplon and St Gotthard lines could be conveniently undertaken.\u201d Continue reading. Editorial: tunnels for peace 19 May 1956 Half a century ago to-day the great Simplon Tunnel, Milan\u2019s way beneath the Alps to Lausanne, Paris, Calais, London, was inaugurated for railway travel. On the anniversary the Italian and Swiss Presidents are engaged in toasting each other\u2019s Republics and inaugurating commemorative exhibitions. According to the first edition (1914) of the Italian Touring Club\u2019s admirable series of guides: \u201cThe conception and direction of this great work were foreign, but the exceedingly arduous execution was the glory of Italian workmen.\u201d So the exhibitions on the Italian side at Milan and Domodossola are being matched by a Swiss exhibition at Lausanne. The Simplon rail route opened up for traffic thirty-five years later than the Mont Cenis or Frejus route, linking Turin to Chambery and Paris and providing still the classic British way to Rome. The Simplon Tunnel seas nearly twice as long as the other, and very deep and difficult; but improved techniques allowed it to be built in about half the time. (The St Gothard Tunnel through Switzerland to Germany was an intermediate achievement in each respect while the Brenner railroad, well away from the Italian frontiers of those times, could be carried over the Alps by sheer climbing.) In their turn these victories over Europe\u2019s major mountains relegated Hannibal\u2019s, and even Napoleon\u2019s, methods of getting in or out of Italy to the history books. That would not have been true for war-time, had not Italy steadily enjoyed the conviction that Switzerland would and could defend its own neutrality. Even so, in the Mussolinian tyranny and the Second World War the old pilgrims\u2019 routes reacquired importance as paths of escape. No railborn comfort for those tormented men seeking freedom! Mass-motoring has now opened a new phase in trans-alpine travel, with the railways called upon to give a lift to ever-swelling numbers of motor-cars far beneath the impassable winter roads. Meanwhile the anniversary celebration reminds us \u2013 and is this not salutary? \u2013 how confidently our grandfathers then saved and planned and worked to produce common sense improvements in human comfort and commerce. Editorial: under the mountain 15 August 1962 The first thing that happened yesterday after the French and Italian engineers had met and toasted each other under Mont Blanc was that the two governments opened a Customs and frontier post at the Italian end of the tunnel. But this seems to be a gesture aimed at complying with all the bureaucratic forms rather than an earnest of interference to come. Customs and immigration checks between members of the European Economic Community are already slight compared with the kind of thing you find at Dover. There seems no reason to doubt that when the tunnel opens to traffic some eighteen months hence it will do a great deal to let cars and lorries travel between the two countries freely and in all weathers. The tunnel will not only cut 124 miles off the road journey from Paris to Rome, it will make the journey possible during the months when the Alpine passes are snowed up and motorists must now take the circuitous and crowded road along the Mediterranean coast. It is remarkable how recently the Alps made a near-impassable barrier in winter \u2013 almost within living memory. Less than ninety years ago the poet Rimbaud had to take refuge in one of the famous mountain hospices whose fame survives in countless jokes about St Bernard dogs rescuing travellers in the snow. The St Gotthard railway tunnel was then being built. If we have any sense it ought not to be long before a Channel tunnel makes the present arrangements at Dover look as antediluvian as the hospices on the Alpine passes.",

      "bodyText": "The spectre of death hovers over the coal mines of Balochistan. Under scorching skies, this turbulent south-west region of Pakistan is home to one of the world\u2019s harshest work environments, where tens of thousands of men and children descend below the surface each day to dig up thousands of tonnes of coal. The threats of underground explosions, methane gas poisoning, suffocation, or mine walls collapsing are omnipresent and there is barely a single worker across the state\u2019s five massive commercial coal mines who has not been touched by the fatalities that are common here. \u201cTwenty people that I know of have died underground,\u201d says Luqman Shakir, a 24-year-old from Swat, in Pakistan\u2019s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Nine years ago, aged 15, Shakir travelled to Balochistan looking for work; he has been a miner ever since. \u201cPeople often die because of a mine collapse and it takes us 18, sometimes 24, hours to take them out because there is no machinery to remove the collapse; we are on our own.\u201d Luqman Shakir is a 24-year-old from Swat. He has been a miner for nine years. Wiping his dust-blackened face, Shakir sighs. \u201cWhen we pull them out, often their bodies are so mangled they cannot even be recognised. Every time I go down the mine, in the back of my mind I always know there is a possibility that I might not come back up.\u201d Shakir hasn\u2019t seen a sunset for almost a decade. He goes underground before dawn and emerges after dark six days a week, and sleeps for most of his single day off. \u201cSummers are suffocating,\u201d he says, explaining that his impoverished background and lack of education make the mines his only option for work. \u201cThis is my life now.\u201d \u2018Coal workers in Balochistan are orphans\u2019 Coal was first extracted in the mineral-rich Balochistan in the 1850s by the British, who built the railway line still used today to transport the coal through the treacherous mountains of the Bolan Pass. It has grown into a massive modern industry. With five major coalfields \u2013 Mach, Shahrag, Dukki, Chamalang and Quetta \u2013 Balochistan still has approximately 2.2bn tonnes of coal reserves. As a result, the mining operation across the state is huge; at least 15,000 tonnes of coal are produced daily, selling for an of average 14,000 PKR (\u00a370) per tonne. It is big business for the country\u2019s coffers, too. The provincial government takes a cut of 130 PKR (\u00a30.65) per tonne and the federal government 500 PKR (\u00a32.50). An operation on this scale requires a massive workforce; at the Mach coal mines alone it is estimated that there are between 10,000 and 20,000 workers. Child labour is rife: at all the coal mines visited by the Guardian in January, child labourers were seen working above ground sorting coal, collecting iron and picking up pieces of coal spilled across the fields. \u201cCoal workers in Balochistan are orphans,\u201d says Asif Qambrani, a research scholar whose work focuses on the mining industry in the region. Child labourers sorting coal. At the mine in Shahrag, sitting on the floor working to remove impurities from freshly mined coal, are Noor Mohammed Marri, 15, and nine-year-old Gul Zaman Marri, who earn between 300 and 400 PKR (\u00a31.50-\u00a32) a day. \u201cMy father had died due to an accident so I am an orphan and I have no one except a few family elders and one of them is working here,\u201d says Noor. \u201cWe come here to do some work under his supervision. We can\u2019t survive if we don\u2019t work.\u201d There have been multiple recent reports of child sexual abuse at the mines in Shahrag, and while Noor is adamant he has not been harassed, he says he fears for other young orphans who have no family working in the mines to look out for them. \u2018We can\u2019t survive if we don\u2019t work,\u2019 says 15-year-old orphan Noor Mohammed Marri The story of the coal miners of Balochistan is one of debt bondage and human rights abuses, an absence of basic health and safety measures, and brutal working and living conditions. Many of the conditions of modern slavery are evident across these mines, which have not modernised in decades. Adult miners earn around \u00a35 a day. Pakistan\u2019s first Mines Act was passed in 1923 to enshrine workers\u2019 rights. It stipulates that canteens, shelters, medical equipment and first aid rooms should be provided at every mine where more than 100 people are employed. Yet there was no obvious sign of these facilities when the Guardian visited the Mach and Shahrag mines. At Mach, the workers\u2019 quarters were a mud building in which more than 10 people shared each tiny room. There was no electricity, running water or a proper bathroom, and drinking water was not provided. Accommodation for workers at Mach is basic in the extreme with no electricity or running water The issues are compounded by the fact that that many of the workers have either migrated from Swat or neighbouring Afghanistan, and are not legally registered, meaning their very existence \u2013 and therefore their rights \u2013 can be easily dismissed.

In that time he has lost three family members in coal mines \u2013 including his son \u2013 due to the unsafe conditions. \u201cWe work with no facilities, no training and no safety measures,\u201d says Nazar. \u201cBut the dilemma for us is that we don\u2019t get paid when we don\u2019t work. The company doesn\u2019t care about our health.\u201d Bakth Nazar has worked in the coalfields for 30 years. He has lost three family members to unsafe mining conditions. According to the law, the families of workers who died in the mines are entitled to 200,000 PKR (\u00a31,000) compensation from the mine owners and 500,000 PKR (\u00a32,500) from the government. But only workers from Pakistan are entitled to a government payout, leaving the Afghan miners, who make up around 50% of the workforce, unprotected by the state. Many families claim compensation has never been paid at all. \u201cThe government did not pay a penny for my brother Azam Khan and cousin who got trapped in coal mines and died last year,\u201d says Nazar. Speaking on condition of anonymity, one mine inspector candidly depicts the horrors he has seen workers endure. Necessary breathing equipment is deemed \u201ctoo expensive\u201d and therefore not provided, he says. He also describes how a lack of training for workers can have dire consequences. He recounts one incident at a mine in Dagari in August 2019, where a cable caught fire underground and ignited gas within the mine, causing workers to fall unconscious and become trapped. Due to a lack of training for such scenarios, other workers and management turned on the fans, which only served to fuel the fire. In that incident two people died and eight suffered life-changing burns. \u201cThere are no emergency ambulances in the majority of coalfields and their surrounding areas. There is a lack of basic health units and hospitals. And even if by luck there is a hospital, you won\u2019t find a doctor or equipment there. There is nothing inspectors can do,\u201d he says. Khaliqdad Bugti, in charge of a mine in Shahrag, describes how during rainy season the roads often become blocked, leaving workers stranded without food for days and with only their mud huts to shelter in. \u201cThere are no health facilitiesor ambulance and it takes hours for an ambulance to reach us from [regional capital] Quetta,\u201d Bugti says, his voice rising in anger. \u201cThe government has established one hospital but there was no medicine. The government does not listen to us.\u201d A coalfield and mine shaft in Mach Debt bondage is also a huge issue. Mohammed Ibrahim, a frail 40-year-old with one hand, explains that this is the situation in which he has found himself. Hundreds of miles away from his home and seven children in Afghanistan, Ibrahim works as a haulage driver to pay off the 50,000 PKR (\u00a3250) he borrowed from the manager of the coal mine to get this job in the first place. \u201cI chose this work because I couldn\u2019t find any other work,\u201d says Ibrahim, \u201cIt is very difficult but I have no other way of paying off the debt. I have to work here until I pay the debt.\u201d Jawad Ali, his manager, chuckles. \u201cI can\u2019t allow Ibrahim to leave without paying my debt. He has to work until he pays [it].\u201d As well as being a mine manager, Ali works as a jori-sir, whose task is to find and provide mine workers for the contractor \u2013 mainly from poverty-stricken villages. He earns at least 10 PKR for each labourer he provides. Jawad Ali, a coalfield supervisor and jori-sir \u2013 someone who finds mine workers for the contractor \u201cI find labourers and jobless people and provide them advance money if they need it, and in return bring them to work here in coal mines,\u201d says Ali. \u201cThey will keep working until they pay the debts. I know who owes money and they are not allowed to leave. This business is being run on debt between labourers to petty managers. Labourers owe me money and I owe money to the contractor. In short, we both can\u2019t leave until we pay our money.\u201d The fatalities keep coming. When the Guardian visited the Shahrag mine in January, an incident had occurred just 10 days earlier. Two workers, Faiz Mohammed and Samiullah, who had travelled from Afghanistan in desperate search of work and ended up in the mines, died after a mining trolley broke, throwing their bodies 1,000ft into the pit. Ghulam Raza, another worker at Mach who is originally from Ghazni in Afghanistan, describes the daily fear that has haunted him since he witnessed a portion of a mine wall collapse, killing a co-worker. The death was never investigated. \u201cI got really scared,\u201d says Raza. \u201cWhen the incident happened, no one came from the government, not even an ambulance. The Frontier Corps just came to inquire about what happened and then told us to take the body to the bazar.\u201d \u201cDue to my debt, I cannot go back to my wife and son,\u201d says Raza. \u201cBut if I had a choice, I wouldn\u2019t stay an hour longer here.\u201d",

The company has not disclosed how many planes were affected. The company has had recent issues with debris \u2013 including tools and rags \u2013 found in its 787 Dreamliners and KC-46A military refueling tankers. Those issues have led to two suspensions of deliveries of KC-46As to the US air force. It is less than a year since the second fatal crash of a Boeing 737 Max resulted in the grounding of the model\u2019s entire global fleet and the company is racing to recertify with regulators that the planes can fly safely. The fuel tank problem is unrelated to the flaws to sensors thought to have contributed towards the two crashes. Boeing built about 400 of the planes, which it could not deliver to customers, and its orders have suffered after it was forced to cut back production at its factory near Seattle. Foreign object debris, an industrial term for rags, tools, metal shavings and other materials left behind by workers during the production process, can raise the risk of electrical short-circuiting and fires. At a Congressional hearing about the Max crashes last December former Boeing executive Ed Pierson described conditions at the company\u2019s Renton, Washington facility as \u201cchaotic\u201d and said he had reported \u201cserious concerns about production quality\u201d to management, warnings that were ignored. Last year a New York Times investigation found debris problems at another Boeing factory in North Carolina including piles of titanium shavings close to electrical equipment and, in one instance, a ladder and a string of lights left inside the tail of a plane.

In Julian Nagelsmann, the coach of RB Leipzig, he will see a driven man who desperately wanted to be a footballer whose career ended prematurely, somebody who quit a university business course to focus on sport, somebody who from a remarkably early age has been marked out as one of the brightest coaches of their generation.</p> \n<p>He will see, in other words, a version of his younger self. Tim Wiese, the wrestler and former goalkeeper, even nicknamed Nagelsmann \u201cMini-Mourinho\u201d during his time as assistant coach at Hoffenheim. And perhaps in that, Mourinho will feel a pang of mortality. At 32, Nagelsmann is 25 years younger: he is the future while Mourinho is repeatedly battling suggestions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/17/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-defensive-dogma\" title=\"\">he may be the past</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/18/son-heung-min-out-for-weeks-after-fracturing-arm-in-aston-villa-clash-football\">Mourinho fears Son will miss rest of Spurs' season with arm fracture</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Football at its highest level is now dominated by the German school of hard pressing and rapid transitions, of which J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/01/pioneering-reds-the-reds-jurgen-klopp-liverpool-pressing-unlikely-origin\" title=\"\">is the supreme example</a>. One of the pioneers of that style was Ralf Rangnick, who \u2013 after spells at Stuttgart, Schalke and Hoffenheim and two stints as Leipzig manager \u2013 is now the head of sport and development at Red Bull. In an <a href=\"https://www.theblizzard.co.uk/article/fishing-small-pond\" title=\"\">interview with the Blizzard</a> he identified four principles to guide how Red Bull sides should play:</p> \n<p>\u201cOne, add maximum possibility to the team and act, don\u2019t react. So you need to dictate the game with and without the ball, not through individuals.</p> \n<p>\u201cTwo, use numerical superiority and let the ball run directly whenever possible, with no unnecessary individual action and with no fouls.</p> \n<p>\u201cThree, use transitions, switch quickly. Try to win back the ball within five seconds with aggressive pressing. After winning the ball back, play quickly straight away, play direct and vertically towards the opponent\u2019s goal, surprise the disorganised opponent to get into the penalty area and shoot within 10 seconds of winning the ball back.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt Hoffenheim, we did research and showed that the likelihood of scoring is within eight seconds of winning back the ball. In training we have a countdown clock and the target is to score within 10 seconds. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said that the best playmaker is \u2018perfect counterpressing\u2019. So four, the more a team sprints faster to win back the ball the greater the likelihood they will score a goal once they have won it back quickly.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"62312ee90bb97b1e017b7c10bbd1acee0d7b860a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62312ee90bb97b1e017b7c10bbd1acee0d7b860a/0_0_4970_3313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jose Mourinho is repeatedly battling suggestions that his style belongs in the past\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jose Mourinho is repeatedly battling suggestions that his style belongs in the past.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Offside via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Before appointing Nagelsmann, who to an extent was building on the foundations he had left at Hoffenheim, Rangnick described him as \u201cthe greatest managerial talent in Germany\u201d. Certainly he is one of the most forward-thinking, benefiting from the work done by the likes of Rangnick, Wolfgang Frank and Volker Finke to normalise pressing. That battle is won and Germany has moved from being a country that believed football was all about individual battles to be at the forefront of developing pressing.</p> \n<p>That in itself would distance Nagelsmann from Mourinho who, despite being formed as a coach amid the post-Cruyffian pressing game of late 90s Barcelona, seemed to decide around the time he was overlooked for the Bar\u00e7a job in 2008 that his future would be a low block and reactivity \u2013 as though to emphasise his difference from the club that, as he saw it, had rejected him. But it is more than that.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba7911d6-771d-4f34-a9ca-67a79716069f\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In his first two European campaigns Nagelsmann\u2019s Hoffenheim looked a little naive, winning just one of 14 games. He has admitted he made too many changes between Bundesliga and Europe, leading to confusion, and also that he had been too offensive. As he looks to balance his thinking, Nagelsmann has acknowledged the importance of Klopp at Liverpool as a model, explaining how he wants his side also to become less reliant on counterattacking and to learn how to control games.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s just the broadbrush strategy. There are also precise adjustments for individual games which, as the winger Ademola Lookman, who joined Leipzig from Everton on a permanent basis last summer, has said, means that a lot of playing for Nagelsmann involves memory. Everything is done with a specific purpose in mind.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/17/jurgen-klinsmann-dives-for-cover-hertha-berlin-alexander-nouri-bundesliga-football\">As Klinsmann dives for cover, Hertha and Nouri are left to find feet | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cHe always has a thought about everything,\u201d the winger Emil Forsberg explained. \u201cWhat you have to do with the ball, if I take the ball here what can I do then, and how you have to move when he has the ball \u2013 you just have to do it. It will appear and you\u2019ll kind of get a light bulb in your head like: \u2018Ah OK, so if I do that and that, that will open up and I can play that pass or I can play that pass.\u2019 That\u2019s what I like about the drills, that you always have something behind it.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the holistic approach sounds a lot like Mourinho\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/18/jose-mourinho-method-charisma-instability-manchester-united\" title=\"\">theories of periodisation</a>, the big difference is that Mourinho, believing football to be essentially random, considers programmed moves too unreliable to be worthwhile and prefers to try to generate in his players a mindset that ensures they make the \u201cright\u201d \u2013 as he would see it \u2013 decision in any given circumstance.</p> \n<p>And that, as much as his insistence on the low block, is what separates Mourinho from those who have come after. The old tricks performed well can still prevail, and nobody, least of all Nagelsmann, would pretend he is the finished product. But this seems like a battle of two eras, one thrusting and innovative, the other familiar and possibly moribund.</p>",

He will see, in other words, a version of his younger self. Tim Wiese, the wrestler and former goalkeeper, even nicknamed Nagelsmann \u201cMini-Mourinho\u201d during his time as assistant coach at Hoffenheim. And perhaps in that, Mourinho will feel a pang of mortality. At 32, Nagelsmann is 25 years younger: he is the future while Mourinho is repeatedly battling suggestions he may be the past. Football at its highest level is now dominated by the German school of hard pressing and rapid transitions, of which J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool is the supreme example. One of the pioneers of that style was Ralf Rangnick, who \u2013 after spells at Stuttgart, Schalke and Hoffenheim and two stints as Leipzig manager \u2013 is now the head of sport and development at Red Bull. In an interview with the Blizzard he identified four principles to guide how Red Bull sides should play: \u201cOne, add maximum possibility to the team and act, don\u2019t react. So you need to dictate the game with and without the ball, not through individuals. \u201cTwo, use numerical superiority and let the ball run directly whenever possible, with no unnecessary individual action and with no fouls. \u201cThree, use transitions, switch quickly. Try to win back the ball within five seconds with aggressive pressing. After winning the ball back, play quickly straight away, play direct and vertically towards the opponent\u2019s goal, surprise the disorganised opponent to get into the penalty area and shoot within 10 seconds of winning the ball back. \u201cAt Hoffenheim, we did research and showed that the likelihood of scoring is within eight seconds of winning back the ball. In training we have a countdown clock and the target is to score within 10 seconds. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said that the best playmaker is \u2018perfect counterpressing\u2019. So four, the more a team sprints faster to win back the ball the greater the likelihood they will score a goal once they have won it back quickly.\u201d Before appointing Nagelsmann, who to an extent was building on the foundations he had left at Hoffenheim, Rangnick described him as \u201cthe greatest managerial talent in Germany\u201d. Certainly he is one of the most forward-thinking, benefiting from the work done by the likes of Rangnick, Wolfgang Frank and Volker Finke to normalise pressing. That battle is won and Germany has moved from being a country that believed football was all about individual battles to be at the forefront of developing pressing. That in itself would distance Nagelsmann from Mourinho who, despite being formed as a coach amid the post-Cruyffian pressing game of late 90s Barcelona, seemed to decide around the time he was overlooked for the Bar\u00e7a job in 2008 that his future would be a low block and reactivity \u2013 as though to emphasise his difference from the club that, as he saw it, had rejected him. But it is more than that. In his first two European campaigns Nagelsmann\u2019s Hoffenheim looked a little naive, winning just one of 14 games. He has admitted he made too many changes between Bundesliga and Europe, leading to confusion, and also that he had been too offensive. As he looks to balance his thinking, Nagelsmann has acknowledged the importance of Klopp at Liverpool as a model, explaining how he wants his side also to become less reliant on counterattacking and to learn how to control games. But that\u2019s just the broadbrush strategy. There are also precise adjustments for individual games which, as the winger Ademola Lookman, who joined Leipzig from Everton on a permanent basis last summer, has said, means that a lot of playing for Nagelsmann involves memory. Everything is done with a specific purpose in mind. \u201cHe always has a thought about everything,\u201d the winger Emil Forsberg explained. \u201cWhat you have to do with the ball, if I take the ball here what can I do then, and how you have to move when he has the ball \u2013 you just have to do it. It will appear and you\u2019ll kind of get a light bulb in your head like: \u2018Ah OK, so if I do that and that, that will open up and I can play that pass or I can play that pass.\u2019 That\u2019s what I like about the drills, that you always have something behind it.\u201d While the holistic approach sounds a lot like Mourinho\u2019s theories of periodisation, the big difference is that Mourinho, believing football to be essentially random, considers programmed moves too unreliable to be worthwhile and prefers to try to generate in his players a mindset that ensures they make the \u201cright\u201d \u2013 as he would see it \u2013 decision in any given circumstance. And that, as much as his insistence on the low block, is what separates Mourinho from those who have come after. The old tricks performed well can still prevail, and nobody, least of all Nagelsmann, would pretend he is the finished product. But this seems like a battle of two eras, one thrusting and innovative, the other familiar and possibly moribund.",

      "bodyText": "Companies will need to train more British workers to fill vacancies when the new immigration system kicks in requiring foreign workers to have qualifications and the ability to speak English, Priti Patel, the home secretary, has said. In a round of television and radio interviews, she said 8 million people between the ages of 16 and 64 were \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d and could be given the skills to do jobs in sectors where there were shortages as a result of the new points-based system. Business groups from the CBI to the bodies representing the farming, hospitality and care work sectors have all raised the alarm about the new system, saying it will cause labour shortages. But Patel insisted it would be necessary for businesses to look more to potential British workers, helping them to \u201cup their skills and make their skills relevant\u201d to the job market. She was pressed by BBC Radio 5 live about the feasibility of training the 8 million people she cited when that is made up mostly of students, the long-term unemployed, the retired and those with caring responsibilities, with Britain almost at full employment. But Patel insisted that 20% of available working age people were inactive and could be encouraged into work. She said the government was \u201cno longer going to have a route for low-skilled workers to come to the UK\u201d but denied this would be the end of Polish builders arriving in Britain as they could get jobs with construction companies rather than being self-employed. Patel also denied that she was closing the door behind her on immigrants after her parents came to the UK from east Africa to run a shop, saying they would have qualified under refugee route because of their persecution. Following the publication, industry leaders immediately accused the government of an assault on the economy warning of \u201cdisastrous\u201d consequences with job losses and closures in factories and the high street. A 10-page briefing document outlining the new immigration policy states: \u2022 UK borders will be closed to non-skilled workers \u2013 and all migrants will have to speak English. \u2022 Anyone wanting to come to the UK to work must have a job offer with a salary threshold of \u00a325,600 \u2013 though a salary \u201cfloor\u201d of \u00a320,480 will be acceptable in special cases where there might be a shortage, such as in nursing. \u2022 There will be no route for self-employed people coming into the UK, spelling the end of, for example, Polish plumbers or Romanian builders arriving without a job. \u2022 Border control will no longer accept ID cards from countries such as France and Italy. This, it is understood, is an attempt to clamp down on non-EU workers beating the system with forged or stolen ID cards. \u2022 The skills threshold for foreign nationals wanting to work in the UK will be lowered from degree level to A-levels or their equivalent. The cap on the numbers of skilled workers is being scrapped \u2013 and a small number of highly skilled workers will be allowed to come in without a job. Industry leaders warned the changes would have a huge impact on food processing factories that rely heavily on EU workers to keep the supermarket shelves full with pre-packed chicken, beef and pork cuts. Tom Hadley, director of policy at the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said: \u201cJobs the government considers \u2018low-skilled\u2019 are vital to wellbeing and business growth. The announcement threatens to shut out the people we need to provide services the public rely on. \u201cWe need access to workers that can help us look after the elderly, build homes and keep the economy strong.\u201d The UKHospitality chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said \u201cruling out a temporary, low-skilled route for migration in just 10 months\u2019 time would be disastrous for the hospitality sector and the British people\u201d and deter investment in the high street. The Confederation of British Industry director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, said the removal of the cap on the number of skilled workers was welcome, but she warned that in \u201csome sectors, firms would be left wondering how they would recruit the people needed to run their businesses. \u201cWith already low unemployment, firms in care, construction, hospitality, food and drink could be most affected,\u201d she said. The hospitality sector will also be hit with no \u201cbarista visa\u201d for coffee shops, despite warnings from Pret A Manger two years ago that only one in 50 job applicants were British. The government said it was removing waiters, waitresses, and \u201celementary\u201d jobs in agriculture and fishing from the skilled list and added them to the unskilled list in line with the Migration Advisory Committee\u2019s recommendations.",

      "bodyText": "Just a few months after going head-to-head with an Amazon-backed rival to claim her third term on the Seattle city council, Kshama Sawant has proposed a new tax on the trillion dollar giant and other large Seattle businesses, which she says will \u201cstop at nothing\u201d to try to defeat progressive proposals like this one. The proposal, which was unveiled last week, would involve a 1.7% payroll tax on the top 3% of companies (based on their payroll) operating out of the city. Sawant estimates the tax will impact about 825 companies, each with about $7m or more in annual payroll. All non-profit organizations, public employers and grocery stores would be exempt. \u201cOn the whole what we have achieved is exactly what we want to achieve, which is that it\u2019s a truly progressive tax, meaning it falls only on the very very largest corporations,\u201d Sawant told the Guardian. Amazon has a long-history of tax management. It paid just 1.2% in federal income tax last year \u2013 a three-year high for the company \u2013 and has angered some critics with its tax policies. In Seattle the new tax is expected to raise $300m each year. In a city that has the fourth highest rate of unsheltered homeless in the US, according to a 2019 federal report, 75% of the money from the tax would go toward building thousands of affordable, publicly owned homes. The rest of the funds would go toward converting homes that use oil or gas to clean electric energy. Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative party and former tech worker, introduced a similar tax on big businesses in 2018. The Head Tax proposal would have implemented a per-employee tax on corporations making more than $20m each year. Although the nine-member council initially unanimously approved it, after Amazon, Starbucks and other locally based companies contributed financially to a campaign to kill it, called No Tax on Jobs, all but two council members voted for repeal (Sawant and Democratic council member Teresa Mosqueda voted for the tax). Now Sawant has reignited that fight at a much larger scale. The new proposal would likely impact at least 200 more businesses than the previous tax and potentially raise more than six times the funds. And with a better sense of what can befall a proposal like this one at the 11th hour, the council member is also working to build up more momentum at the grassroots level. \u201cWe need an even more powerful movement to withstand not just the pressures, but the bullying and threats of big business,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will stop at nothing.\u201d Sawant was elected six years ago as the first socialist on the Seattle council in almost 100 years.

      "bodyText": "If Manchester City are to sell Leroy San\u00e9 to Bayern Munich, they will ask for Serge Gnabry to be part of the deal. The former Arsenal winger never did much during his time in England, famously being deemed not good enough for Tony Pulis\u2019s West Brom during a forgettable loan spell, but the Germany international could be the man to liven up Pep Guardiola\u2019s squad. We will be all hanging our hats on the summer transfer saga of Paul Pogba battling to leave Manchester United. Soon Mino Raiola will run out of things to say, having already had a go at Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and then tried to make up. Paul\u2019s other man in the media is brother Mathias, who previously played for Crewe and Wrexham. The striker says his sibling definitely wants out of Old Trafford, to no one\u2019s surprise. Mathias has played for nine clubs in his time so knows a thing or two about transfers. Arsenal are hopeful of tying down versatile left-sided player Bukayo Saka, who only has 18 months left on his current contract, to a five-year deal. The 18-year-old has been linked with moves to Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Liverpool, which has forced the Gunners to act. Manchester United are back on the hunt for a director of football following another miserable January transfer window. Antero Henrique, formerly of Paris Saint-Germain and Red Bull\u2019s head of sport Ralf Rangnick are the current names being considered by Ed Woodward and his merry band of men. The list of suitors for Birmingham City\u2019s 16-year-old star Jude Bellingham is growing by the week. At the moment, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid and now Chelsea all want to dip their hands into their pockets to splash out on the talented midfielder. Former Middlesbrough forward Martin Braithwaite is inching closer to his inexplicable \u20ac20m move from Legan\u00e9s and Barcelona due to the Catalans having run out of fit strikers. Meanwhile Giorgio Chiellini, 35, is set to extend his contract with Juventus for another year and Stoke City\u2019s record signing Gianni Imbula is in talks with Lokomotiv Moscow over ending his underwhelming spell in England.",

During the segregation era, white America wanted to consume black entertainment, often without recognising black humanity. In fact, despite endemic anti-black violence, African-American artists were expected to perform on stage for white audiences \u2013 with a smile.

The problem is at the Baftas, or the Oscars, or the football terraces, not in the room you\u2019re currently working in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/justin-welby-tells-synod-he-is-sorry-and-ashamed-over-churchs-racism\">Justin Welby says he is 'sorry and ashamed' over church's racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But last week, a traditional British institution did exactly that. Members of the Church of England synod backed a motion to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/justin-welby-tells-synod-he-is-sorry-and-ashamed-over-churchs-racism\" title=\"\">apologise for racism</a>, and to \u201cstamp out conscious or unconscious\u201d racism \u2013 with the archbishop of Canterbury conceding that the church is \u201cstill deeply institutionally racist\u201d.</p> <p>The admission stands in contrast to wider discussions of racism within our society, especially in the broadcast media \u2013 typically with bullish white presenters grilling a black or brown expert on racism on the veracity of their statements. This is a power play intended to portray the very existence of racial discrimination as something to be \u201cdebated\u201d, rather than believing the experiences of people of colour. </p> <p>Modern Europe was forged by an ideology of white supremacy that \u2013 regardless of our politics \u2013 is the mood music of our culture. Historically, it informed the direction of science, assumptions in philosophy \u2013 and, crucially, what constitutes valuable or noteworthy art. The Church of England has begun to recognise that. And it\u2019s not alone. A growing number of white voices are vocalising the problem of whiteness.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/02/joaquin-phoenixs-attack-on-baftas-for-systemic-racism-meets-industry-wide-praise\" title=\"\">Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s speech</a> at the Bafta awards this month was heralded as a landmark moment for the British film industry. \u201cI think that it is the obligation of the people that have created and perpetuate and benefit from a system of oppression to be the ones that dismantle it,\u201d he said. Indeed, the motor behind the study of \u201cwhiteness\u201d has been, from the start, to encourage those in positions of power to be active participants in not only recognising those structures but ending them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This struggle is not just an academic debate \u2013 it is about whose stories and histories get told, whose ideas are recognised, who gets to speak with authority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/joaquin-phoenixs-oscars-speech-in-full\" title=\"\">Oscar win last week</a>, Phoenix continued on a similar theme: \u201cThe greatest gift that [the film industry] has given me \u2026 is the opportunity to use our voice for the voiceless.\u201d Yet the truth is, there is no such thing as the voiceless, only the \u201cdeliberately silenced or the preferably unheard\u201d, as Arundhati Roy reminds us. People can be silenced by many things \u2013 missing invitations, closed meetings and of course the social and economic implications of denouncing racism in the industry that represents your bread and butter. It took powerful white men to denounce whiteness at the Baftas, largely because if you\u2019re Joaquin Phoenix, or even Prince William, there\u2019s little to lose by speaking out. You might actually stand to gain. Power-endowed white men are the group most able to commit to diversity pledges, investing in educating staff and monitoring biases and their impact. But there is a very real risk, as society becomes increasingly aware of the social pitfalls of explicit racism, that instead of making space at the table, or of making real change, we hear little more than a white lament.</p> <p>These \u201cconfessions\u201d (as opposed to pledges to take real meaningful action) provide a cathartic, yet largely illusionary, sense that change is happening. And we risk acknowledging the existence of a problem, yet always pointing elsewhere to locate it. Such as Morgan denouncing the Baftas\u2019 lack of diversity in the studio he shares with Peters.</p> <p>Challenging whiteness involves talking about it \u2013 and a little introspection, for sure \u2013 but, more than that, it involves concrete, remedial action.</p> <p>Beyond the grandstanding is a battle for survival for minorities no longer content with the crumbs. Struggling artists churning out epic work, only to be overlooked \u2013 by those seemingly so keen to perpetuate cultural inertia \u2013 or, at best, relegated to the \u201curban\u201d category.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/03/joaquin-phoenix-baftas-speech-racism-boycott-suzanne-moore\">Great speech, Joaquin \u2013 but you should have just boycotted the Baftas | Suzanne Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Will this be the year we see ethnic-minority bishops in senior positions? Will Phoenix\u2019s next choice of a director to work with be one currently unrecognised in the awards lists?

This informs the stories that create our national sense of self, the ideas shaping our culture, and the debates over whose history becomes our common mythology.

Members of the Church of England synod backed a motion to apologise for racism, and to \u201cstamp out conscious or unconscious\u201d racism \u2013 with the archbishop of Canterbury conceding that the church is \u201cstill deeply institutionally racist\u201d. The admission stands in contrast to wider discussions of racism within our society, especially in the broadcast media \u2013 typically with bullish white presenters grilling a black or brown expert on racism on the veracity of their statements. This is a power play intended to portray the very existence of racial discrimination as something to be \u201cdebated\u201d, rather than believing the experiences of people of colour. Modern Europe was forged by an ideology of white supremacy that \u2013 regardless of our politics \u2013 is the mood music of our culture. Historically, it informed the direction of science, assumptions in philosophy \u2013 and, crucially, what constitutes valuable or noteworthy art. The Church of England has begun to recognise that. And it\u2019s not alone. A growing number of white voices are vocalising the problem of whiteness. Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s speech at the Bafta awards this month was heralded as a landmark moment for the British film industry. \u201cI think that it is the obligation of the people that have created and perpetuate and benefit from a system of oppression to be the ones that dismantle it,\u201d he said. Indeed, the motor behind the study of \u201cwhiteness\u201d has been, from the start, to encourage those in positions of power to be active participants in not only recognising those structures but ending them. After his Oscar win last week, Phoenix continued on a similar theme: \u201cThe greatest gift that [the film industry] has given me \u2026 is the opportunity to use our voice for the voiceless.\u201d Yet the truth is, there is no such thing as the voiceless, only the \u201cdeliberately silenced or the preferably unheard\u201d, as Arundhati Roy reminds us. People can be silenced by many things \u2013 missing invitations, closed meetings and of course the social and economic implications of denouncing racism in the industry that represents your bread and butter. It took powerful white men to denounce whiteness at the Baftas, largely because if you\u2019re Joaquin Phoenix, or even Prince William, there\u2019s little to lose by speaking out. You might actually stand to gain. Power-endowed white men are the group most able to commit to diversity pledges, investing in educating staff and monitoring biases and their impact. But there is a very real risk, as society becomes increasingly aware of the social pitfalls of explicit racism, that instead of making space at the table, or of making real change, we hear little more than a white lament. These \u201cconfessions\u201d (as opposed to pledges to take real meaningful action) provide a cathartic, yet largely illusionary, sense that change is happening. And we risk acknowledging the existence of a problem, yet always pointing elsewhere to locate it. Such as Morgan denouncing the Baftas\u2019 lack of diversity in the studio he shares with Peters. Challenging whiteness involves talking about it \u2013 and a little introspection, for sure \u2013 but, more than that, it involves concrete, remedial action. Beyond the grandstanding is a battle for survival for minorities no longer content with the crumbs. Struggling artists churning out epic work, only to be overlooked \u2013 by those seemingly so keen to perpetuate cultural inertia \u2013 or, at best, relegated to the \u201curban\u201d category. Will this be the year we see ethnic-minority bishops in senior positions? Will Phoenix\u2019s next choice of a director to work with be one currently unrecognised in the awards lists? And, as the president of Bafta, does Prince William intend to remedy the judging selection process? This struggle is not just an academic debate \u2013 it is about whose stories and histories get told, whose ideas are recognised, who gets to speak with authority and who takes real action. This informs the stories that create our national sense of self, the ideas shaping our culture, and the debates over whose history becomes our common mythology. The conversation about whiteness may be under way, but earnest words shouldn\u2019t become a convenient distraction from concrete action. \u2022 Myriam Fran\u00e7ois is a journalist and research associate at the Centre of Islamic Studies, Soas University of London",

      "body": "<p>On a snowy evening last week, I found myself in the dining room of the Morosani Posthotel in Davos, and when I had finished my meal the waiter started a conversation, probably because most of the tables were already empty. A middle-aged man with a charming smile, he told me that he was from Italy; during the summer he worked in a hotel on the island of Ischia in the Gulf of Naples, but the winter season he spent in Davos. \u201cWhen we have the World Economic Forum here,\u201d he said, \u201cwe work day and night. It doesn\u2019t stop. And the tips these people leave, it\u2019s incredible, they have a bill for 2,400 francs and then they tell me, \u2018add a tip of 40%\u2019, I should be happy, but I\u2019m not happy, it\u2019s insane, it\u2019s unhealthy.\u201d</p> <p>I left him a tip of 10% \u2013 who wants to be unhealthy? Besides, my bill was a long way off 2,400 Swiss francs. That night I couldn\u2019t get the word \u201cunhealthy\u201d out of my head, nor the gusto and certitude with which the waiter had uttered it.</p> <p>Once, Davos was synonymous with Thomas Mann\u2019s famous novel The Magic Mountain, a sanatorium novel if ever there was one, in which visitors tried \u2013 not always successfully \u2013 to make the transformation from unhealthy to healthy, while the rest of Europe was getting sicker and sicker, slowly sliding into the disasters of two world wars. For most of the characters in the book the Swiss Alpine village felt like a place where time had stopped. A month or seven years; in Davos it was all the same.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A significant minority appears to view a dying democracy not as a catastrophe but as something to cherish</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nowadays, when musing about Davos, it is more likely that one thinks of the corporate billionaires, politicians and economists who gather here every January. If I understood the waiter correctly, and his view is by no means an exception, Davos is not a place where anyone comes to get better, it\u2019s a village where the illness is a matter of fact, a reason for decadence even, at least to spend as if there\u2019s no tomorrow. For the waiter there was no doubt about it, the hand that fed him was a sick hand.</p> <p>But there is still a hiking route here called the Thomas-Mann-Weg. And when you leave the village and walk up this trail, you get the feeling that Davos is still a refuge, a place where time has stopped \u2013 and whereas in Mann\u2019s novel tuberculosis is the only threat, the real maladies of the world are noticed only by the people reading newspapers. Until reality hits, hard.</p> <p>Would the waiter have responded the same way if a famous footballer or celebrity had tipped him 40%? I doubt it. <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/03/12/specials/sontag-illness.html\" title=\"\">Susan Sontag made us aware</a> that illness as metaphor, and seeing the sick as different from us, always as others, is a dangerous trap. But we should also realise that acting as if the system and the powerful are always others is equally dangerous.</p> <p>Still, one could argue that despite the fact that many people coming to Davos may not have read The Magic Mountain, I would say that many coming here might not even have heard of Thomas Mann \u2013 I\u2019m not a snob, this is not necessarily a judgment \u2013 the ghost of the novel still hangs over the place, over our world. The sensation of a looming catastrophe that is part of the charm and the suspense of the book is present, indeed it can be felt whenever you tune into the news now. Though you feel it more urgently in Davos, precisely because there is something of a paradise about the place. Isn\u2019t it the distinctive feature of paradises that they are doomed?</p> <p>The German author and journalist, Dirk Kurbjuweit, recently wrote about dying democracies in <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-german-conservatives-faustian-pact-with-the-far-right-a-00a554e1-1089-45dd-9d77-5b6324d4c5b7\" title=\"\">Der Spiegel</a>. He made clear his view that if the mainstream parties in Germany refuse to rule out cooperation with the extreme-right AfD, it could be a step towards the death of German democracy. After the debacle in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/angela-merkel-says-voting-with-far-right-to-oust-state-chief-was-unforgivable-germany-afd\">German state of Thuringia</a>, where a politician from the centre-right FDP was elected premier with the help of the AfD (something which was until then taboo), quite a few commentators are pointing to the past. Hadn\u2019t Hitler had one of his first successes in Thuringia? Are we living in Weimar again?</p> <p>It\u2019s understandable that Germans are more aware of the fragility of democracies than other people in Europe, and they are indeed right to be concerned. As we all should be. It\u2019s far too convenient a belief that certain catastrophes can only come from Germany.</p> <p>But too often historical comparisons are made frivolously. I remember a couple celebrating New Year\u2019s Eve in a hotel in Davos telling me: \u201cIt feels like the Titanic here.\u201d The couple didn\u2019t really mean that we were all condemned, they were referring to something more erotic. Death was just another game because dying is what other people do; in Davos you can feel invincible, or at least you can cherish the illusion of being invincible.</p> <p>If the apocalypse is just another erotic tool, a device to provide us with a feeling of being alive (travel too is often a way of looking for controlled danger \u2013 isn\u2019t that the essence of skiing and snowboarding?), there is a risk of our metaphors and warnings becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. Comparison with the past should be used to shed new light on what\u2019s happening today. The moment it becomes a kneejerk response, it loses all its power and turns into a way of showing which side you are on, while you have the pleasure of disengaging at the same time. The looming catastrophe is simply the most dangerous ski slope, the black diamond, reserved for the most capable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/billionaires-davos-climate-crisis-world-economic-forum\">We can\u2019t trust the billionaires of Davos to solve a climate crisis they created | Payal Parekh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m not accusing Kurbjuweit of frivolity, but it\u2019s good to realise that a significant minority in Europe, east and west, as well as in the United States, appears to view a dying democracy not as a catastrophe but as something to cherish. \u201cFinally, we got rid of the bastards, the swamp got drained.\u201d</p> <p>The weaknesses of our liberal democracies are there for all to see. But there is little to gain from constantly stressing these frailties. We are dreaming if we believe that the other side will conclude: \u201cIf liberal democracy is that weak, we should be more careful.\u201d On the contrary, they might think: \u201cIf liberal democracy is almost falling off the cliff, we will give it a last push.\u201d Human beings too often take pleasure in giving a push to things that are close to the edge.</p> <p>\u2022 Arnon Grunberg is a Dutch author; his most recent novel is Occupied Territories</p>",

Besides, my bill was a long way off 2,400 Swiss francs. That night I couldn\u2019t get the word \u201cunhealthy\u201d out of my head, nor the gusto and certitude with which the waiter had uttered it. Once, Davos was synonymous with Thomas Mann\u2019s famous novel The Magic Mountain, a sanatorium novel if ever there was one, in which visitors tried \u2013 not always successfully \u2013 to make the transformation from unhealthy to healthy, while the rest of Europe was getting sicker and sicker, slowly sliding into the disasters of two world wars. For most of the characters in the book the Swiss Alpine village felt like a place where time had stopped. A month or seven years; in Davos it was all the same. Nowadays, when musing about Davos, it is more likely that one thinks of the corporate billionaires, politicians and economists who gather here every January. If I understood the waiter correctly, and his view is by no means an exception, Davos is not a place where anyone comes to get better, it\u2019s a village where the illness is a matter of fact, a reason for decadence even, at least to spend as if there\u2019s no tomorrow. For the waiter there was no doubt about it, the hand that fed him was a sick hand. But there is still a hiking route here called the Thomas-Mann-Weg. And when you leave the village and walk up this trail, you get the feeling that Davos is still a refuge, a place where time has stopped \u2013 and whereas in Mann\u2019s novel tuberculosis is the only threat, the real maladies of the world are noticed only by the people reading newspapers. Until reality hits, hard. Would the waiter have responded the same way if a famous footballer or celebrity had tipped him 40%? I doubt it. Susan Sontag made us aware that illness as metaphor, and seeing the sick as different from us, always as others, is a dangerous trap. But we should also realise that acting as if the system and the powerful are always others is equally dangerous. Still, one could argue that despite the fact that many people coming to Davos may not have read The Magic Mountain, I would say that many coming here might not even have heard of Thomas Mann \u2013 I\u2019m not a snob, this is not necessarily a judgment \u2013 the ghost of the novel still hangs over the place, over our world. The sensation of a looming catastrophe that is part of the charm and the suspense of the book is present, indeed it can be felt whenever you tune into the news now. Though you feel it more urgently in Davos, precisely because there is something of a paradise about the place. Isn\u2019t it the distinctive feature of paradises that they are doomed? The German author and journalist, Dirk Kurbjuweit, recently wrote about dying democracies in Der Spiegel. He made clear his view that if the mainstream parties in Germany refuse to rule out cooperation with the extreme-right AfD, it could be a step towards the death of German democracy. After the debacle in the German state of Thuringia, where a politician from the centre-right FDP was elected premier with the help of the AfD (something which was until then taboo), quite a few commentators are pointing to the past. Hadn\u2019t Hitler had one of his first successes in Thuringia? Are we living in Weimar again? It\u2019s understandable that Germans are more aware of the fragility of democracies than other people in Europe, and they are indeed right to be concerned. As we all should be. It\u2019s far too convenient a belief that certain catastrophes can only come from Germany. But too often historical comparisons are made frivolously. I remember a couple celebrating New Year\u2019s Eve in a hotel in Davos telling me: \u201cIt feels like the Titanic here.\u201d The couple didn\u2019t really mean that we were all condemned, they were referring to something more erotic. Death was just another game because dying is what other people do; in Davos you can feel invincible, or at least you can cherish the illusion of being invincible. If the apocalypse is just another erotic tool, a device to provide us with a feeling of being alive (travel too is often a way of looking for controlled danger \u2013 isn\u2019t that the essence of skiing and snowboarding?), there is a risk of our metaphors and warnings becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. Comparison with the past should be used to shed new light on what\u2019s happening today. The moment it becomes a kneejerk response, it loses all its power and turns into a way of showing which side you are on, while you have the pleasure of disengaging at the same time. The looming catastrophe is simply the most dangerous ski slope, the black diamond, reserved for the most capable. I\u2019m not accusing Kurbjuweit of frivolity, but it\u2019s good to realise that a significant minority in Europe, east and west, as well as in the United States, appears to view a dying democracy not as a catastrophe but as something to cherish. \u201cFinally, we got rid of the bastards, the swamp got drained.\u201d The weaknesses of our liberal democracies are there for all to see. But there is little to gain from constantly stressing these frailties. We are dreaming if we believe that the other side will conclude: \u201cIf liberal democracy is that weak, we should be more careful.\u201d On the contrary, they might think: \u201cIf liberal democracy is almost falling off the cliff, we will give it a last push.\u201d Human beings too often take pleasure in giving a push to things that are close to the edge. \u2022 Arnon Grunberg is a Dutch author; his most recent novel is Occupied Territories",

      "bodyText": "As Mike Bloomberg continues to surge in the race for the Democratic nomination, his past comments are increasingly coming back to haunt him. From his defense of stop-and-frisk policing, to archaic, offensive statements about women, the former New York City mayor\u2019s own words often serve to puncture the idea of him as the anti-Trump billionaire and have handed plenty of ammunition to his 2020 opponents. Bloomberg\u2019s rivals are likely to remind him \u2013 and those watching at home \u2013 of his past beliefs at the Democratic debate tonight. Here are some that might get a mention: \u201cNinety-five per cent of your murders \u2013 murderers and murder victims \u2013 fit one MO [\u2026] You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16 to 25. That\u2019s true in New York, that\u2019s true in virtually every city.\u201d Bloomberg was speaking at the Aspen Institute in 2015 when he offered this defense of stop-and-frisk, a policing practice he expanded as mayor which disproportionately affected black people. \u201cWe put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes. That\u2019s true. Why do we do it? Because that\u2019s where all the crime is.\u201d This is from the same Bloomberg speech. He continued: \u201cThe way you get the guns out of the kids\u2019 hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them.\u201d \u201cI think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little. It\u2019s exactly the reverse of what they say.\u201d That was Bloomberg speaking on his weekly radio show in 2013. The then mayor was responding to criticism of stop-and-frisk \u2013 a year earlier 87% of all people stopped and frisked were African Americans or Latino. Under Bloomberg the number of stops increased from 97,276 in 2002 to a high of 685,724 in 2011. \u201cThere\u2019s this enormous cohort of black and Latino males, age, let\u2019s say, 16 to 25, that don\u2019t have jobs, don\u2019t have any prospects, don\u2019t know how to find jobs, don\u2019t know what their skillsets are, don\u2019t know how to behave in the workplace where they have to work collaboratively and collectively.\u201d Bloomberg on job prospects for minorities in 2011. \u201cClass warfare and racist.\u201d This was Bloomberg\u2019s assessment of Bill de Blasio\u2019s campaign for mayor in 2013. \u201cHe\u2019s making an appeal using his family to gain support,\u201d Bloomberg said of De Blasio, whose wife and children are African American. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious to anyone watching what he\u2019s been doing. I do not think he himself is racist. It\u2019s comparable to me pointing out I\u2019m Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote.\u201d \u201cKill it!\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s reaction on learning an employee was pregnant, according to a 1997 sexual harassment lawsuit. The lawsuit alleged Bloomberg had made a series of sexist comments to female employees. \u201cIf your conversation during a presidential election is about some guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter, that\u2019s not a winning formula for most people.\u201d Bloomberg on transgender rights in 2019. \u201cThey would make it harder and more costly for businesses to stay, harder and more costly for businesses to stay, and harder and more costly for businesses to thrive.\u201d That\u2019s Bloomberg stating his opposition to a minimum wage in 2012, when New York city council hoped to introduce the measure. \u201cI, for example, am not in favor, have never been in favor, of raising the minimum wage.\u201d Bloomberg reiterated his distaste for the measure in 2015. \u201cAs president, Mike will raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour to ensure that all employees are fairly compensated for the time they spend working.\u201d That\u2019s according to a press release from Bloomberg released on Sunday. \u201cCongress got involved \u2013 local elected officials, as well \u2013 and said: \u2018Oh that\u2019s not fair, these people should be able to get credit.\u2019 [\u2026] And once you started pushing in that direction, banks started making more and more loans where the credit of the person buying the house wasn\u2019t as good as you would like.\u201d In 2008 Bloomberg claimed the end of \u201credlining\u201d \u2013 a practice where banks would refuse to lend to people in certain neighborhoods \u2013 was a key factor in the 2008 financial crisis. The redlined neighborhoods were frequently made up of African American people, disproportionately preventing them from owning homes. Although the practice was technically made illegal in 1968, people of color are still more likely to be denied a mortgage than white people. Experts say African Americans and Latinos were deliberately sold predatory loans in the lead up to the 2008 crash. \u201cThe royal family \u2013 what a bunch of misfits \u2013 a gay, an architect, that horsey-faced lesbian, and a kid who gave up Koo Stark for some fat broad.\u201d This is from The Portable Bloomberg, a book made by employees to celebrate Bloomberg\u2019s 48th birthday in 1990. \u201cYes, these are all actual quotes,\u201d wrote Elisabeth DeMarse, Bloomberg LP\u2019s former chief marketing officer and the book\u2019s publisher. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has disputed, sort of, some of the quotes. \u201cMike simply did not say the things somebody wrote in this gag gift,\u201d a campaign spokesman told the Washington Post. The spokesman added, however: \u201cMike openly admits that his words have not always aligned with his values and the way he has led his life and some of what he has said is disrespectful and wrong.\u201d \u201cI could teach anybody \u2013 even people in this room, no offense intended \u2013 to be a farmer. It\u2019s a [process]. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn.\u201d Bloomberg on agriculture, back in 2016. He was comparing farming to information technology, which he said is: \u201cFundamentally different because it\u2019s built around replacing people with technology, and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze.\u201d \u201cWhenever my wife catches me eyeing some broad, she\u2019s very careful to turn to me and say: \u2018That\u2019s the most expensive piece of ass in the world!\u2019\u201d From The Portable Bloomberg. \u201cI know for a fact that any self-respecting woman who walks past a construction site [and] doesn\u2019t get a whistle will turn around and walk past again and again until she does get one.\u201d The Portable Bloomberg again. \u201cI like theater, dining and chasing women. Let me put it this way: I am a single, straight billionaire in Manhattan. What do you think? It\u2019s a wet dream.\u201d Bloomberg offered this insight in an interview with the Guardian in 1996.",

      "body": "<p>It is a journalistic convention that any author who writes a doorstopper of a book with the word \u201ccapital\u201d in the title must be the heir to Karl Marx, while any economist whose books sell in the hundreds of thousands is a \u201crock star\u201d. Thomas Piketty\u2019s 600-page, multi-million selling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/capital-twenty-first-century-thomas-piketty-review\" title=\"\"><em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em></a> won him both accolades, but both were wide of the mark. There is nothing Marxist about Piketty\u2019s politics, which are those of a liberal reformer, while his concept of capital is closer to an accounting category (a proxy for \u201cwealth\u201d) than the exploitative force that Marx saw it as.</p> <p>And despite his unexpected celebrity, Piketty makes for an implausible rock star. In contrast to the suave rebellion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/feb/18/yanis-varoufakis-how-i-became-an-erratic-marxist\" title=\"\">Yanis Varoufakis</a> or the frat-boy know-alls of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/15/freakonomics-10-years-on-stephen-dubner-steven-levitt-interview\" title=\"\">Freakonomics franchise</a>, Piketty comes across both on stage and in print as cautious and nerdish. He is fixated on statistics, in particular on percentiles. Not only does he mine them from unlikely sources, such as 18th-century tax records and <em>Burke\u2019s Peerage</em>, he is clearly fascinated by the mechanics of how data came to be collected in the first place. Piketty is a brilliant and relentless anorak.</p> <p>With the arrival of the 1,000-page <em>Capital and Ideology</em>, the hype has returned. Already, the rightwing press has got in a lather about the book\u2019s suggestion of a 90% rate of inheritance tax. \u201cThomas Piketty is back \u2013 and more dangerous than ever,\u201d declared Matthew Lynn in the Telegraph in September, when <em>Capital and Ideology</em> appeared in France. Perhaps it\u2019s Piketty\u2019s mild manner that disconcerts; or perhaps it\u2019s the matter-of-fact way that he points out that the most prosperous period in US history \u2013 1950-70 \u2013 coincided with a top marginal rate of inheritance tax of 80% and of income tax that was even higher.</p> <p><em>Capital and Ideology</em> is an even more ambitious book than <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em>. Where the latter focused on inequality trends in western capitalism over the past 200 years, the new book offers a history of almost everything. The chronology begins with a sweeping overview of feudal and other pre-modern economies, and ends with the dilemmas posed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/09/who-really-are-the-gilets-jaunes\" title=\"\"><em>gilets jaunes</em></a>. The geographic range is global, adding Brazil, Russia, India and China (the \u201cBrics\u201d) to his previous analyses of Europe and the US. Slavery and colonialism are covered at length.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e384f1deb0090b02ca70d64ae03bd6bb8f2d8396\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e384f1deb0090b02ca70d64ae03bd6bb8f2d8396/0_0_5660_3398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"His book provides a sweeping overview of feudal and other pre-modern economies, and ends with the gilets jaunes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">His book provides a sweeping overview of feudal and other pre-modern economies, and ends with the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/09/who-really-are-the-gilets-jaunes\">gilets jaunes</a>.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kiran Ridley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is certainly the case that most authors who have taken on a historical task of this scale have been either Marxists or shysters. There\u2019s a good reason for this. Marxists have the benefit of a clear theory of historical change, which helps knit copious quantities of evidence together: \u201cThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\u201d, runs the famous opening line of <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>. The Annales School of French Marxism (which must surely count as an inspiration for Piketty, if only in scholarly ambition) seeks historical patterns that are several centuries in the making. As for the shysters, if there isn\u2019t already a TED talk on \u201cwhat your brain tells us about 1,000 years of inequality\u201d, then someone\u2019s missed a trick.</p> <p>The point is that in order to find a thread through so much history, it helps to have a theory. But Piketty\u2019s theoretical innocence has always been part of his charm, and no doubt contributes to his mass-market appeal. The closest he\u2019s ever come to an overarching historical mechanism is the formula R&gt;G (return is greater than growth), presented in <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> as a distillation of how wealth grows faster than income, and why inequality therefore increases over time. Yet even this, he was keen to point out, was simply an observation of available data, and not to be interpreted as a \u201claw\u201d of any kind. Piketty gives us history without a motor, a series of variations in income and wealth that happen because people at the time wanted and allowed them to.</p> <p>His premise in <em>Capital and Ideology</em> is a moral one: inequality is illegitimate, and therefore requires ideologies in order to be justified and moderated. \u201cAll history shows that the search for a distribution of wealth acceptable to the majority of people is a recurrent theme in all periods and all cultures,\u201d he reports boldly. As societies distribute income, wealth and education more widely, so they become more prosperous.

But Europe, and France in particular, remain his centre of gravity. Being Piketty, this is less because of some Hegelian belief in Europe\u2019s unique status in world history, and more \u2013 like the drunk man searching for his keys under the street-light \u2013 because that\u2019s where the data is. That said, <em>Capital and Ideology</em> also serves as an intervention in policy debates that are unmistakably European. It is also a reminder to the current occupant of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace that the French Revolution wasn\u2019t fought for <em>libert\u00e9</em> and <em>fraternit\u00e9</em> alone.</p> <p>The book\u2019s story of shifting \u201cinequality regimes\u201d within the liberal west partly repeats the account given in <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em>. Despite the avowed egalitarianism of the French Revolution, wealth and income inequality remained high throughout the 19th century, until the first world war. A combination of war and progressive taxation led to dramatic falls in inequality over the first half of the 20th century, setting the stage for the social democratic regimes of the second half.</p> <p>Evidence on these postwar regimes confirms that very high marginal tax rates are both reasonable and effective. But they had a lurking weakness, which Piketty views as fatal: they accommodated highly unequal access to education. Not only is educational equality the biggest factor in economic development (more so than property rights, he argues), the sharp division between graduates and non-graduates produced political schisms that, by the 1990s, had left the working class electorally homeless.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He might be right: given the climate crisis and other factors, current levels of inequality cannot long be maintained</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Piketty\u2019s account of the past 40 years is less a story of capital being unleashed (as most histories of neoliberalism have it) than of progressive ideologies running out of steam. The failure of communism played a crucial role in this, producing a new fatalism about the capacity of politics to deliver equality. Globalisation eroded national borders, while \u201chypercapitalism\u201d delivered concentrations of wealth not witnessed since 1914. In the context of post-socialist ideological cynicism, the rich have barely mustered any justification for this, beyond tepid appeals to a \u201cmeritocracy\u201d. The opacity of their financial machinations (something Piketty finds especially egregious) means they have little need of a public defence anyway.</p> <p>The result of these postwar trends is that western democracies are now dominated by two rival elites, reflected in many two-party electoral systems: a financial elite (or \u201cmerchant right\u201d) that favours open markets, and an educational elite (or \u201cBrahmin left\u201d) that stands for cultural diversity, but has lost faith in progressive taxation as a basis for social justice. With these as the principal democratic options, nativist parties prosper, opposing educational and economic inequality, but only on the basis of tighter national borders. There is a vacancy for parties willing to defend internationalism and redistribution simultaneously.</p> <p>Piketty concludes with a tentative policy programme aimed at meeting the nativist challenge along such lines. This includes some bold ideas (such as an equal education budget for every citizen, to be invested as they choose), but mostly rests on ideas of participatory governance, progressive taxation, democratisation of the EU and income guarantees that have been circulating on the radical liberal left for decades. Suffice to say that naming such policies is considerably easier than executing them. He might be right that, given the climate crisis among other factors, current levels of inequality cannot long be maintained and new policies will be introduced: he prefers to take an optimistic position, based on the assumption that \u201cinequality regimes\u201d never last for ever. But despite the pearl-clutching of the Telegraph, his \u201celements for a participatory socialism\u201d are not the most arresting features of the book.</p> <p><em>Capital and Ideology</em> is an astonishing experiment in social science, one that defies easy comparison. In its ambition, obsessive testimony and sheer oddness, it is closer to the spirit of Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd than of Karl Marx. It alternates between sweeping generalities about the nature of justice and the kind of wonkery that one might expect from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, often in the same paragraph. It is occasionally naive (it will bug the hell out of historians and anthropologists) but in a provocative fashion, as if to say: if inequality isn\u2019t justified, why not change it?</p> <p>What would drive someone to write a book like this? If Piketty has one core political and methodological belief it is in the emancipatory power of public data: that when people are given sufficient evidence about the structures of society, they will insist on greater equality until they are granted it.

      "bodyText": "It is a journalistic convention that any author who writes a doorstopper of a book with the word \u201ccapital\u201d in the title must be the heir to Karl Marx, while any economist whose books sell in the hundreds of thousands is a \u201crock star\u201d. Thomas Piketty\u2019s 600-page, multi-million selling Capital in the Twenty-First Century won him both accolades, but both were wide of the mark. There is nothing Marxist about Piketty\u2019s politics, which are those of a liberal reformer, while his concept of capital is closer to an accounting category (a proxy for \u201cwealth\u201d) than the exploitative force that Marx saw it as. And despite his unexpected celebrity, Piketty makes for an implausible rock star. In contrast to the suave rebellion of Yanis Varoufakis or the frat-boy know-alls of the Freakonomics franchise, Piketty comes across both on stage and in print as cautious and nerdish. He is fixated on statistics, in particular on percentiles. Not only does he mine them from unlikely sources, such as 18th-century tax records and Burke\u2019s Peerage, he is clearly fascinated by the mechanics of how data came to be collected in the first place. Piketty is a brilliant and relentless anorak. With the arrival of the 1,000-page Capital and Ideology, the hype has returned. Already, the rightwing press has got in a lather about the book\u2019s suggestion of a 90% rate of inheritance tax. \u201cThomas Piketty is back \u2013 and more dangerous than ever,\u201d declared Matthew Lynn in the Telegraph in September, when Capital and Ideology appeared in France. Perhaps it\u2019s Piketty\u2019s mild manner that disconcerts; or perhaps it\u2019s the matter-of-fact way that he points out that the most prosperous period in US history \u2013 1950-70 \u2013 coincided with a top marginal rate of inheritance tax of 80% and of income tax that was even higher. Capital and Ideology is an even more ambitious book than Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Where the latter focused on inequality trends in western capitalism over the past 200 years, the new book offers a history of almost everything. The chronology begins with a sweeping overview of feudal and other pre-modern economies, and ends with the dilemmas posed by the gilets jaunes. The geographic range is global, adding Brazil, Russia, India and China (the \u201cBrics\u201d) to his previous analyses of Europe and the US. Slavery and colonialism are covered at length. It is certainly the case that most authors who have taken on a historical task of this scale have been either Marxists or shysters. There\u2019s a good reason for this. Marxists have the benefit of a clear theory of historical change, which helps knit copious quantities of evidence together: \u201cThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\u201d, runs the famous opening line of The Communist Manifesto. The Annales School of French Marxism (which must surely count as an inspiration for Piketty, if only in scholarly ambition) seeks historical patterns that are several centuries in the making. As for the shysters, if there isn\u2019t already a TED talk on \u201cwhat your brain tells us about 1,000 years of inequality\u201d, then someone\u2019s missed a trick. The point is that in order to find a thread through so much history, it helps to have a theory. But Piketty\u2019s theoretical innocence has always been part of his charm, and no doubt contributes to his mass-market appeal. The closest he\u2019s ever come to an overarching historical mechanism is the formula R&gt;G (return is greater than growth), presented in Capital in the Twenty-First Century as a distillation of how wealth grows faster than income, and why inequality therefore increases over time. Yet even this, he was keen to point out, was simply an observation of available data, and not to be interpreted as a \u201claw\u201d of any kind. Piketty gives us history without a motor, a series of variations in income and wealth that happen because people at the time wanted and allowed them to. His premise in Capital and Ideology is a moral one: inequality is illegitimate, and therefore requires ideologies in order to be justified and moderated. \u201cAll history shows that the search for a distribution of wealth acceptable to the majority of people is a recurrent theme in all periods and all cultures,\u201d he reports boldly. As societies distribute income, wealth and education more widely, so they become more prosperous. The overturning of regressive ideologies is therefore the main condition of economic progress. There is a risk here in projecting a liberal democratic sensibility back over time, as if every age has been fuelled by a benign Pikettian spirit. It seems to assume the existence of a well-functioning public sphere to determine allocations of property on the basis of reasoned argument and evidence, rather than via domination or opportunism. Economic historians may balk at this, but it pays certain rhetorical and philosophical dividends in forcing us to confront the justice (and lack of it) of various economic models, including our own. For the bulk of this vast book Piketty maps the dominant \u201cinequality regimes\u201d of the past millennium. \u201cTernary societies\u201d (such as feudalism) were divided into clerical, military and working classes. \u201cOwnership societies\u201d developed over the 18th century, becoming dominant by the end of the 19th, concentrating income and wealth in the hands of landowning families and the new bourgeoisie. \u201cSlave societies\u201d offered the most extreme model of inequality (Haiti circa 1780 is revealed as the most unequal society on record). \u201cColonial societies\u201d had various combinations of military power, bourgeois ownership and slavery.

He said those funds had been allocated without a tender, and ran counter to previous statements from Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton that they did not support taxpayer subsidies. \u201cI see that, frankly, as hush money for the climate sceptics in the Coalition government.\u201d Both the Coalition and Labor are battling divisions over climate policy and the future of coal. The feasibility study examining Collinsville is proceeding because of strenuous lobbying by Queensland Nationals, but a number of Liberals have argued taxpayers should not be subsidising new coal plants. While a majority of Labor MPs believe the opposition needs to stay the course on climate action, some in the party\u2019s right argue the party needs to be more positive about the coal industry. New South Wales rightwinger Joel Fitzgibbon earlier this year wondered how many more elections Labor was prepared to lose by arguing for ambitious climate action. Fitzgibbon represents an electorate in the Hunter Valley with a significant proportion of coal workers, and suffered a negative swing of more than 9% in two-party-preferred terms last May. Albanese said on Wednesday Labor needed to improve its performance in Queensland, which yielded similar negative results to the Hunter last May. The foundation of that was the party being clear that it respected workers, he said. \u201cThere is a range of things we need to do better in Queensland,\u201d the Labor leader said. \u201cOur priority is jobs and jobs here in Queensland, and we make no apologies for that.\u201d",

In a segment on his Sky News show on Tuesday, Bolt attacked the accuracy of a Four Corners report on St Kevin\u2019s college that revealed the headmaster had written a character reference for the school\u2019s athletics coach after he was convicted of grooming the student. The headmaster, Stephen Russell, resigned on Wednesday. Bolt invited Sydney Institute director Gerard Henderson on the Bolt Report on Tuesday night and the two were highly critical of Four Corners\u2019 characterisation of the offending and the response of the school. Bolt repeatedly said the boy was \u201chit on\u201d by the coach and there was \u201cno sex\u201d. \u201cThat headmaster that [reporter Louise Milligan] mentioned, who gave a character reference for a man who was an ex-teacher, who hit on a boy at that school \u2013 no sex occurred \u2013 hit on the boy, later jailed for grooming,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cThe headmaster gave a character reference, and he\u2019s since been absolutely pilloried on the ABC radio today.\u201d The president of the Blue Knot Foundation, Dr Cathy Kezelman, said it was dangerous to minimise the crime of grooming. \u201cSadly some commentators irresponsibly perpetuate ignorant and dangerous myths minimising the crime of grooming and the impact on child victims of predatory behaviour,\u201d Kezelman told Guardian Australia. The executive director of services for Act for Kids, Dr Katrina Lines, said Bolt\u2019s language was inappropriate and could not be condoned. \u201cChildren can\u2019t be hit on!\u201d Lines said. \u201cAdults are in a position of authority and trust with a child, and they betray that trust by acting inappropriately, that is the very definition of sexual grooming. \u201cThere is no consensual social situation in which it would be OK for an adult to \u2018hit on\u2019 a child.

According to the ABC, when Kehoe was coaching Street he sent him messages via Facebook, which eventually escalated to the coach taking Street to his house and inviting him into his bed. Kehoe told Street about having an erection and asked him if he knew what pre-cum was, Street told Four Corners. \u201c\u2018Then he asked me if I know what pre-cum is, and then I said, \u2018no\u2019. Then he said, \u2018it\u2019s the premature stages of ejaculation\u2019. Then he said, \u2018you can lick it off whenever you like\u2019,\u201d Street said.

Bolt asked Henderson: \u201cHow terrible was [the school\u2019s handling of the case] really?\u201d Henderson replied: \u201cNot at all.\u201d Henderson said the program was \u201cwithin the ABC tradition of attacking mainly Catholic institutions sometimes Christian institutions\u201d, and the story was a \u201ca gross exaggeration\u201d.

But for a long time, that individuality worked against her.</p> <p>Before joining Complexions Contemporary Ballet, Davis said she attended close to a hundred company auditions.

Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, the company\u2019s co-founders and artistic directors, identified something in her that was apparently lost on other creatives.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the only occasion in which they\u2019ve made an artistic choice that goes against the grain. Complexions is something of a black sheep in American ballet. One of its recent commissions is described by the company as a \u201cphysical reaction to the daily news\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.joyce.org/performances/complexions-contemporary-ballet-0\">Its programs</a> include music from Kendrick Lamar, David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz \u2013 a far cry from the kind of lyric-less instrumentals usually associated with the art form.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8eaa2ab0f8da923aab22c771a480eda882ad94f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eaa2ab0f8da923aab22c771a480eda882ad94f4/0_0_3596_2668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jillian Davis and Brandon Gray\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jillian Davis and Brandon Gray.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Complexions Contemporary Ballet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But perhaps the most radical part of Complexions is the people in it. \u201cWe want to celebrate diversity on every level: body types, looks, training, qualities of movement,\u201d Rhoden said.</p> <p>He said he and Richardson are attracted to an \u201cX-factor\u201d in their dancers that\u2019s part of what they bring to the table. Richardson echoed that sentiment; he looks for artists who blur lines and boundaries and exude an innate passion. He calls this \u201cotherness,\u201d but without the negative connotation that term sometimes implies.</p> <p>\u201cI always say it\u2019s like a stew,\u201d Rhoden said. \u201cWe\u2019re about toasting the idea of unity \u2013 you know, contrasting qualities working harmoniously.\u201d</p> <p>Complexions\u2019 members are a snapshot of modern America, if more virtuosic and physically fit than an average Joe. Rhoden affectionately calls them his band of misfits; demographically, they\u2019re far more diverse than your typical ballet ensemble.</p> <p>\u201cI do think that we have to open up our mind,\u201d Rhoden said. \u201cThis is 2020. Dance is evolving. And in order for it to continue to be a vital art form, we have to look at everything.\u201d</p> <p>A number of pitfalls often sabotage ballet\u2019s potential to fully connect with today\u2019s audience. It\u2019s a European craft <a href=\"https://www.pbt.org/learn-and-engage/resources-audience-members/ballet-101/brief-history-ballet/\">that </a>sprang from the Italian Renaissance, blossomed in French aristocratic circles, and was canonized centuries ago.

      "bodyText": "When Jillian Davis is on stage, it\u2019s hard to watch anyone else. In a blink of the eye, her body swings from long diagonals into swooping parabolas, from the fullest extension of a line to the most cavernous curve. For a moment, she suspends time, like her body is a gasp and the air hasn\u2019t escaped just yet. Then, she\u2019s a hiccup in gravity, light but grounded. \u201cI definitely try to portray, like, that tall, Amazonian type because that\u2019s not something that you see onstage a lot, and it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Davis told the Guardian. At 6ft 2in, she towers over most of her fellow dancers, one of a myriad of qualities that make her an original. But for a long time, that individuality worked against her. Before joining Complexions Contemporary Ballet, Davis said she attended close to a hundred company auditions. She always got rejected, and nine out of 10 times it was because of her height. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t figure out why I wasn\u2019t even being looked at,\u201d she said. Complexions was the first time she made it through an entire audition without being cut. Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, the company\u2019s co-founders and artistic directors, identified something in her that was apparently lost on other creatives. It\u2019s not the only occasion in which they\u2019ve made an artistic choice that goes against the grain. Complexions is something of a black sheep in American ballet. One of its recent commissions is described by the company as a \u201cphysical reaction to the daily news\u201d. Its programs include music from Kendrick Lamar, David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz \u2013 a far cry from the kind of lyric-less instrumentals usually associated with the art form. But perhaps the most radical part of Complexions is the people in it. \u201cWe want to celebrate diversity on every level: body types, looks, training, qualities of movement,\u201d Rhoden said. He said he and Richardson are attracted to an \u201cX-factor\u201d in their dancers that\u2019s part of what they bring to the table. Richardson echoed that sentiment; he looks for artists who blur lines and boundaries and exude an innate passion. He calls this \u201cotherness,\u201d but without the negative connotation that term sometimes implies. \u201cI always say it\u2019s like a stew,\u201d Rhoden said. \u201cWe\u2019re about toasting the idea of unity \u2013 you know, contrasting qualities working harmoniously.\u201d Complexions\u2019 members are a snapshot of modern America, if more virtuosic and physically fit than an average Joe. Rhoden affectionately calls them his band of misfits; demographically, they\u2019re far more diverse than your typical ballet ensemble. \u201cI do think that we have to open up our mind,\u201d Rhoden said. \u201cThis is 2020. Dance is evolving. And in order for it to continue to be a vital art form, we have to look at everything.\u201d A number of pitfalls often sabotage ballet\u2019s potential to fully connect with today\u2019s audience. It\u2019s a European craft that sprang from the Italian Renaissance, blossomed in French aristocratic circles, and was canonized centuries ago. But ballet has been slow to evolve and promote inclusivity beyond the confines of a Eurocentric ideal, and even its supporters have taken notice. Former New York Times dance critic Alastair Macaulay called the art form a \u201csexist view of the world\u201d, and in contrast to other dance styles, ballet has faced scrutiny for its lack of female choreographers shaping the narrative. Often times, programs stumble into tired gender roles that pigeonhole performers as princes and princesses, boys and girls. It\u2019s these cemented stereotypes that some people blame for misogyny in ballet, a hot topic in the #MeToo era. Beyond outdated gender politics, ballet has a legacy of privileging white bodies. Misty Copeland\u2019s unparalleled popularity as American Ballet Theatre\u2019s first female African American principal dancer suggests how much of an anomaly she is, and just how few people of color actually make it in the profession, especially at mainstream ballet companies that perform classical repertoire.

      "body": "<p>The old stereotype of video game players as spotty, socially isolated boys in basements is finally disappearing after decades, but the popular image of game developers is enduring. They are imagined to be white and beardy, with glasses and a probable fondness for sci-fi and fantasy, and this is hardly unjustified.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s not often something comes along to genuinely change the game, but the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip does just that, bringing foldable displays closer to the mainstream and reinventing the flip phone for 2020 in the process.</p> <p>Screens that fold in half finally arrived last year with the Galaxy Fold, which was originally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/18/galaxy-fold-samsung-investigates-as-screens-break-in-first-days\">plagued by durability issues</a> causing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/22/samsung-galaxy-fold-release-delayed-screens-break\">a delay</a> and a reworking of the device.</p> <p>The \u00a31,300 Galaxy Z Flip is therefore Samsung\u2019s crucial second bite at the cherry. And it\u2019s a very impressive one at that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"gif showing the galaxy z flip being opened and closed\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:100%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/kHmFVa8rZiPeMLU3mr&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/kHmFVa8rZiPeMLU3mr&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Opening and closing the Galaxy Z Flip is a smooth and addictive experience.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead of a tall smartphone opening out into a square tablet, the Galaxy Z Flip is a tall smartphone that folds in half like mid-2000s flip-phones. I won\u2019t beat about the bush: folding and unfolding the Galaxy Z Flip is a tremendous experience.</p> <p>The hinge opens and will hold the screen at any angle, similar to a laptop. It\u2019s smooth and reassuringly solid. What you can\u2019t easily do is flip it open with one finger, but you probably shouldn\u2019t even if you could because the screen is fairly fragile \u2013 more on that later.</p> <p>Closed, the phone is a compact wedge shape with little rubber feet and magnets holding the two ends together. You\u2019ll be able to fit it in most pockets, including the often useless-for-phones tiny pockets women are burdened with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2501802a2efd56b571f97fb75b28833c456ea55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2501802a2efd56b571f97fb75b28833c456ea55/434_527_3882_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy z flip review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover screen shows the time and other useful bits when tapped.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a small 1.1in oblong screen on the lid of the device adjacent to the main camera. It shows the time, the battery charge and a little notification dot if there\u2019s something waiting for you. Double tap to light it up, swipe left for music controls and right for notification icons, which you can tap and see a little bit with scrolling text. It\u2019s useful when you want it, but also easy to ignore, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/shortcuts/2020/feb/17/return-of-the-flip-phone-should-you-pay-1300-for-samsung-galaxy-flip-z\">freeing you somewhat</a> from the burden of notifications.</p> <p>Open it out and the 6.7in screen is remarkable. It looks and feels just like one of Samsung\u2019s regular super-sized smartphones, which is a very good thing, apart from one caveat: there\u2019s a crease in the middle. You can feel it, and get a reflection on the screen and you can see it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97579bc25e1c3e229a1870cf436c711fa6e8d8e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97579bc25e1c3e229a1870cf436c711fa6e8d8e8/163_331_4646_2788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy z flip review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You can see the crease in light reflections on the screen, but is generally invisible when viewing bright content and videos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What feels weird at first under your thumb immediately becomes normal. It\u2019s more visible when the screen is black, which makes the Galaxy Z Flip the first phone that looks worse in dark mode. You can\u2019t see it while browsing a white web page or similar.</p> <p>The crease is one of the compromises of having a massive screen that rivals the very biggest smartphones available today, but that folds down into a small, pocketable package. I think it\u2019s a worthy trade-off for now.</p> <p>The power button doubles as a fast and accurate fingerprint scanner, mounted below the volume buttons on the upper half of the phone.</p> <h2>Durability concerns</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b044b8db4ffee0dc490c693dca8707370aaecb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b044b8db4ffee0dc490c693dca8707370aaecb6/775_0_3542_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy z flip review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The screen has T-shaped caps at the sides of the fold that help stop dirt getting in behind the display.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The screen works, looks great and the hinge feels sturdy. It\u2019s rated for more than 200,000 folds, which is 100 openings a day for 5.5 years. It has nylon fibres in the hinge to literally sweep dust and dirt away as you open and close it, while the edges of the folding part have plastic T-shaped caps to try to block dirt from getting in that way.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a massive question mark over the screen\u2019s durability. It comes with care instructions wrapped around it in the box, including advice not to press hard on the screen with hard objects, such as your fingernail; don\u2019t fold something else in when closing the phone; the phone isn\u2019t dust or water resistant; don\u2019t put stickers or screen protectors on it; and keep the phone away from credit cards as it has magnets in it. You can\u2019t say you haven\u2019t been warned.</p> <p>I was only given three working days to test the device and in that time it worked perfectly. <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/samsung/151119-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-display-deeper-problem\">Others haven\u2019t been so lucky</a>. Realistically you need at least several months of daily use to truly know if it will stand the test of time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d3d70387058bf8a4d44a2178d057200c819be3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d3d70387058bf8a4d44a2178d057200c819be3b/784_538_3295_1977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy z flip review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hidden in the hinge is a set of nylon fibres that help stop dust getting into the back of the device.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there\u2019s the scratch resistance of the glass screen: basically <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbAkY-Www40\">there isn\u2019t any</a>. It uses ultra-thin glass that can fold, which is remarkable, but it\u2019s covered in a plastic layer and is so thin it\u2019s easy to poke holes in. The screen is fairly well protected when closed, but it\u2019s possible to get grit in between the two halves, while pushing hard with your fingernail could damage it.</p> <p>Samsung is offering a <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/galaxy-premier-service/\">one-time \u00a399</a>/<a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/support/galaxy-z-premier-service/\">$119</a> display repair service, but after that you\u2019re looking at a hefty cost in the region of \u00a3400.</p> <p>All in you have to treat it with the respect deserving of a \u00a31,300 device, and even then you might run into trouble.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not often something comes along to genuinely change the game, but the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip does just that, bringing foldable displays closer to the mainstream and reinventing the flip phone for 2020 in the process. Screens that fold in half finally arrived last year with the Galaxy Fold, which was originally plagued by durability issues causing a delay and a reworking of the device. The \u00a31,300 Galaxy Z Flip is therefore Samsung\u2019s crucial second bite at the cherry. And it\u2019s a very impressive one at that. Instead of a tall smartphone opening out into a square tablet, the Galaxy Z Flip is a tall smartphone that folds in half like mid-2000s flip-phones. I won\u2019t beat about the bush: folding and unfolding the Galaxy Z Flip is a tremendous experience. The hinge opens and will hold the screen at any angle, similar to a laptop. It\u2019s smooth and reassuringly solid. What you can\u2019t easily do is flip it open with one finger, but you probably shouldn\u2019t even if you could because the screen is fairly fragile \u2013 more on that later. Closed, the phone is a compact wedge shape with little rubber feet and magnets holding the two ends together. You\u2019ll be able to fit it in most pockets, including the often useless-for-phones tiny pockets women are burdened with. There\u2019s a small 1.1in oblong screen on the lid of the device adjacent to the main camera. It shows the time, the battery charge and a little notification dot if there\u2019s something waiting for you. Double tap to light it up, swipe left for music controls and right for notification icons, which you can tap and see a little bit with scrolling text. It\u2019s useful when you want it, but also easy to ignore, freeing you somewhat from the burden of notifications. Open it out and the 6.7in screen is remarkable. It looks and feels just like one of Samsung\u2019s regular super-sized smartphones, which is a very good thing, apart from one caveat: there\u2019s a crease in the middle. You can feel it, and get a reflection on the screen and you can see it. What feels weird at first under your thumb immediately becomes normal. It\u2019s more visible when the screen is black, which makes the Galaxy Z Flip the first phone that looks worse in dark mode. You can\u2019t see it while browsing a white web page or similar. The crease is one of the compromises of having a massive screen that rivals the very biggest smartphones available today, but that folds down into a small, pocketable package. I think it\u2019s a worthy trade-off for now. The power button doubles as a fast and accurate fingerprint scanner, mounted below the volume buttons on the upper half of the phone. Durability concerns The screen works, looks great and the hinge feels sturdy. It\u2019s rated for more than 200,000 folds, which is 100 openings a day for 5.5 years. It has nylon fibres in the hinge to literally sweep dust and dirt away as you open and close it, while the edges of the folding part have plastic T-shaped caps to try to block dirt from getting in that way. But there\u2019s a massive question mark over the screen\u2019s durability. It comes with care instructions wrapped around it in the box, including advice not to press hard on the screen with hard objects, such as your fingernail; don\u2019t fold something else in when closing the phone; the phone isn\u2019t dust or water resistant; don\u2019t put stickers or screen protectors on it; and keep the phone away from credit cards as it has magnets in it. You can\u2019t say you haven\u2019t been warned. I was only given three working days to test the device and in that time it worked perfectly. Others haven\u2019t been so lucky. Realistically you need at least several months of daily use to truly know if it will stand the test of time. Then there\u2019s the scratch resistance of the glass screen: basically there isn\u2019t any. It uses ultra-thin glass that can fold, which is remarkable, but it\u2019s covered in a plastic layer and is so thin it\u2019s easy to poke holes in. The screen is fairly well protected when closed, but it\u2019s possible to get grit in between the two halves, while pushing hard with your fingernail could damage it. Samsung is offering a one-time \u00a399/$119 display repair service, but after that you\u2019re looking at a hefty cost in the region of \u00a3400. All in you have to treat it with the respect deserving of a \u00a31,300 device, and even then you might run into trouble. If you\u2019re at all blas\u00e9 with the way you treat your smartphone, this isn\u2019t for you. Specifications Main screen: 6.7in FHD+ AMOLED Infinity Flex Display (425ppi) Cover screen: 1.1in AMOLED (303ppi) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ RAM: 8GB of RAM Storage: 256GB (UFS 3.0) Operating system: One UI 2.1 based on Android 10 Camera: dual rear camera: 12MP wide angle, 12MP ultra-wide angle, 10MP front-facing camera Connectivity: 4G, nano sim + esim, Wi-Fiac, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS Folded dimensions: 87.4 x 73.6 x 17.3-15.4mm Unfolded dimensions: 167.3 x 73.6 x 7.2-6.9mm Weight: 183g Solid performance, about a day\u2019s battery The Galaxy Z Flip has Qualcomm\u2019s top-of-the-range chip from late 2019, the Snapdragon 855+, not this year\u2019s top chip, the Snapdragon 865. It also has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which isn\u2019t expandable with microSD. Performance all-round was good. Snappy, fast and smooth, similar to the Galaxy Note 10+, but not as rapid as the best, the OnePlus 7T Pro despite having the same chipset. If you\u2019re into hardcore mobile gaming this isn\u2019t the phone for you. Battery life was solid but not quite up to the standards set by the very best last year. The Galaxy Z Flip lasted about 27 hours between charges of medium to heavy usage. That was while using the phone as my primary device, lots of email, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours browsing, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 45 minutes of Netflix and about 10 photos. The Galaxy Z Flip has relatively slow 15W charging, taking close to two hours for a full charge, but has wireless charging and wireless powersharing to wirelessly charge something else from the phone\u2019s back, such as a set of earbuds or a smartwatch. One UI 2 Samsung\u2019s version of Android 10 is called One UI 2, which itself is an evolution of One UI launched on the Galaxy S10 last year. One UI 2 treats the phone\u2019s screen differently to most other versions of Android. Broadly speaking the top half is for displaying information, while the bottom half is used for bits you have to touch and interact with. It\u2019s a clever use of space helping you reach the bits you have to tap (with the exception of the notification bar), which is useful for a screen as long as the Galaxy Z Flip\u2019s.

It\u2019s simple, fast and easy to use on big-screen phones. Samsung has also made great strides in the speed of Android updates over recent years, bringing One UI 2 based on Android 10 as an update to the Galaxy S10 line in around three months from its release by Google. Overall, One UI 2 is a pleasing form of Android to use, with useful additions and, importantly, the full Google suite of apps and services, from which competitor Huawei is barred from using due to US trade sanctions. Camera The Galaxy Z Flip has two 12-megapixel cameras on the back, one normal and one ultra-wide, and one 10-megapixel selfie camera peeking through a small hole in the top of the screen. The rear cameras are good but not class leading. The main camera shoots excellent pictures in good lighting, deals relatively well with high-contrast scenes with the addition of an HDR mode, but starts to struggle in middling light conditions.

I got better results closing the phone, double-pressing the power button to bring up the main camera, which shows a small preview in the cover display. Samsung\u2019s camera app has a load of tricks.

Observations The Galaxy Z Flip is not water or dust resistant at all, in contrast to most modern smartphones There\u2019s no headphone socket You can feel a dip in the screen where the selfie camera pokes through There\u2019s just one speaker in the bottom of the phone The glass backs have small gaps between them and the frame of the phone that trap dust and hairs Call quality was excellent on both ends of the call on EE\u2019s 4G network Price The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip costs \u00a31,300 and is available in either black or purple. A special colour version is available as part of the Thom Browne Edition, which includes Galaxy Buds+, a Galaxy Watch Active2 and other parts for \u00a32,280. For comparison, the Galaxy Fold costs \u00a31,900 and the Motorola Razr is available exclusively through EE on plans starting at \u00a394 a month. Samsung\u2019s non-folding Galaxy Note 10+ costs \u00a3999. Verdict The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is a tantalising, desirable look at one possible future of the smartphone. A big phone that folds into a compact square is surprisingly pleasing to use, much easier to pocket and has the side benefit of adding a bit of distance between you and your phone. Unfolding it and unlocking it is much more of a deliberate act than it is to glance at a traditional flat phone, potentially helping you avoid notification overload. It looks great, makes you stand out and feels solid, like the premium, cutting-edge product that it is. It\u2019s exciting, different and delightfully tactile. But only having had three working days with it, I just can\u2019t tell you whether it\u2019ll go the distance.

The UK Foreign Office, however, has yet to say exactly when, and under what conditions, British passengers will be evacuated. \u201cWe are planning an evacuation flight from Tokyo to the UK as soon as possible for Britons who are on the Diamond Princess,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities.\u201d The statement said that despite the disembarkation now under way, \u201cthere is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight. We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight\u201d. More than 300 Americans were flown home on Monday, although 14 of the passengers tested positive during the evacuation. The US Centres for Disease Control has told more than 100 Americans who chose to remain on the ship that they will not be allowed back into the country for at least two weeks after they disembark. Other countries will require repatriated people to undergo another two weeks of quarantine after they return home. Japan\u2019s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, defended the country\u2019s handling of the quarantine. \u201cIn the beginning the United States expressed gratitude for the Japanese side. And there are many Americans who chose to stay on the ship,\u201d Suga said. Japanese officials said there was little evidence that Covid-19 tests could produce false negatives and noted that their quarantine policy had been endorsed by the WHO. They pointed to the hundreds of Japanese citizens evacuated from China, most of whom tested negative at the start of a quarantine and remained negative. \u201cAs far as we know, once the test is negative they remain negative,\u201d said Takaji Wakita, director general of Japan\u2019s National Institute of Infectious Diseases.",

South London rapper Dave accused Boris Johnson of racism as he performed the freestyle track Black, with a newly written final verse that began: \u201cIt is racist, whether or not it feels racist, the truth is our prime minister\u2019s a real racist / They say \u2013 \u2018you should be grateful, we\u2019re the least racist\u2019 / I say the least racist is still racist.\u201d Alexis Petridis writes: \u201cThere\u2019s a sense in which the actual winners of the 2020 Brits represented an attempt to convince the public it was all very much business as usual: nothing to get upset about here, kindly move along.\u201d Ben Beaumont-Thomas reviews the night\u2019s performances \u2013 Mabel, Capaldi, Lizzo, Rod Stewart and more. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Passengers have begun leaving the Diamond Princess in Japan but questions are being asked about whether quarantine measures around the ship have been strict enough, amid fears coronavirus cases could flare later among those permitted to leave. A second death has been reported in Hong Kong \u2013 more at our live blog. &gt; 10 Downing Street is being questioned over whether it vetted the now-sacked adviser Andrew Sabisky. Kirsty Blackman of the SNP said: \u201cIt is beyond shameful that a man with a well-documented history of unapologetically offensive, misogynistic, and racist remarks was considered by No 10 to be an appropriate hire.\u201d &gt; Jurors deliberating in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape trial have asked to see emails in which the movie mogul highlighted the names of potential accusers and handed them to the investigators he employed to try and silence the women. &gt; Boris Johnson and his estranged wife, Marina Wheeler, are preparing to end their marriage after a family court judge approved a financial settlement and gave Wheeler permission to apply for a divorce decree. Johnson is believed to be the first prime minister divorced in office in modern times. He has been dating Carrie Symonds since 2019 and they live together in Downing Street. &gt; In the largest study of its kind, researchers have found that whether a family has more boys or girls, or an equal mix, is simply down to chance. Meanwhile a woman in France left infertile by cancer treatment is the first to give birth via a new procedure whereby her immature eggs were collected, matured in a lab, frozen and then used five years later. * * * Children\u2019s future at stake \u2013 All countries are failing to shield their children\u2019s health and future from ecological degradation, climate change and bad diet, according to a global panel of child and adolescent health experts commissioned by the WHO. They say that despite dramatic improvements in survival, nutrition, and education over the past 20 years, today\u2019s children face \u201cexistential threats\u201d. Apart from the environment, predatory marketing of fast food and sugary drinks is blamed for an increase in childhood obesity from 11 million cases in 1975 to 124 million in 2016. The experts\u2019 report rates Norway, South Korea, the Netherlands, France and Ireland as countries where a child can best flourish. The UK is ranked 10th on child flourishing but 133rd when it comes to delivering on emissions targets. * * * Drug expert blocked over tweets \u2013 The chief pharmacist at an addiction service was barred from rejoining the government\u2019s drug advisory panel after Home Office social media checks revealed he had publicly criticised Jeremy Hunt. Graham Parsons has rejected the idea that his disapproval of Hunt\u2019s policies as health secretary would have compromised his advice. Parsons\u2019s \u201cexcellent expertise\u201d had been noted by an assessment panel that recommended his appointment. But Home Office emails and memos seen by the Guardian reveal it was noted that Parsons, a previous member of the panel, had posted tweets critical of Hunt. The government\u2019s relationship with drug policy experts has become increasingly fraught at a time of record drug-related deaths, budget cuts and criticism of Conservative drugs policy. * * * Bones of a theory \u2013 A cave in Iraq has given up the skeleton of a Neanderthal from 70,000 years ago, adding to evidence that modern humans\u2019 cousins buried their dead and might even have brought flowers to their funerals. The female who died in her 40s or 50s is dubbed Shanidar Z after the cave where her remains were found and those of others were discovered 60 years ago. \u201cIt seems clear that Shanidar was a special place, with bodies being placed just in one part of a large cave,\u201d said Graeme Barker, a University of Cambridge archaeologist. Today in Focus podcast: Inside Trump\u2019s Facebook campaign Guardian US tech reporter Julia Carrie Wong spent a year analysing Trump\u2019s Facebook campaign. She discusses how the sophisticated social media machine is targeting voters \u2013 and explains the database the Guardian built to investigate the contents of Trump\u2019s 218,000 different Facebook ads. Also, Leah Green reflects on the death of the former Love Island presenter Caroline Flack. Lunchtime read: \u2018Mum talked to me about justice, racism \u2026\u2019 The actor and activist Saffron Burrows, who stars in the Netflix hit You, discusses her teenage years as an anti-racist campaigner, modelling in Paris, #MeToo and the \u201csexist\u201d films she turned down. Sport J\u00fcrgen Klopp accused Atl\u00e9tico Madrid of targeting Sadio Man\u00e9 after Liverpool suffered a frustrating 1-0 defeat in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. Erling Haaland\u2019s extraordinary scoring streak for Borussia Dortmund continued as his two goals gave them a 2-1 first-leg victory over PSG. Manchester City could face further investigations by Uefa\u2019s financial fair play compliance body into the level of Abu Dhabi sponsorships they declared for the years since 2016. Phil Neville has told his England squad for the SheBelieves Cup to put out of their minds the idea that the mini-tournament is an audition for TeamGB at the Tokyo Olympics. England\u2019s Lewis Ludlam is learning how to control his intense passion and targeting a Six Nations-defining win over Ireland at Twickenham this weekend. Brian O\u2019Driscoll has accused Eddie Jones of \u201cscaremongering\u201d and admitted he relished the sight of the England head coach\u2019s comments backfiring so spectacularly in France this month. Dan Biggar and Josh Adams will be available for Wales to face France in Cardiff on Saturday, but they may be peripheral figures in the backline after the prop Wyn Jones accused the Six Nations leaders of cheating in the scrums. And Tyson Fury has never been one to underestimate his own ability, but the Mancunian giant is brimming with confidence before Saturday night\u2019s hotly anticipated rematch with Deontay Wilder. Business Asian shares have mostly risen despite overnight losses on Wall Street and the coronavirus crisis. Data for January showed Japan\u2019s exports fell less than expected in January, its third straight month of deficit. Adding to optimism, new virus cases reported by China have been falling. Collapse in demand due to Covid-19 remains the key worry for the markets across the globe as the disease continues its spread, said Prakash Sakpal, economist for Asia at ING. The pound is trading at $1.299 and \u20ac1.203 while the FTSE is tracking 55 points higher at time of writing. The papers The Guardian leads with the PM\u2019s immigration plan: \u201cFears for UK economy as Johnson closes border to unskilled workers\u201d. The PM\u2019s flood response also comes in for criticism. The Mail heralds the \u201cImmigration revolution\u201d and what the Express describes as \u201cHistoric new border controls\u201d. Metro puts it more plainly: \u201cBan on cheap EU workers\u201d and the i takes a similar line: \u201cUK closes the door to \u2018low-skilled\u2019 migrant workers\u201d. The FT says Britain\u2019s biggest car maker is having to fly some components over from China in suitcases to keep production going: \u201cJaguar Land Rover faces closure as coronavirus limits parts supply\u201d. The Sun carries the mugging of a former One Direction member: \u201cHarry knife terror\u201d. The Mirror has \u201cGet out\u201d as people in flood-hit areas are urged to evacuate. The Telegraph says \u201cLib Dems to throw out [Lord] Steel over Cyril Smith sex abuse\u201d while the Times reports on \u201cFears over jihadist attacks in jail\u201d, saying an attempt was made to stab prison staff at Winchester jail.

      "body": "<p>When my dad moved from Birmingham into residential care near my home in Liverpool last autumn, my first consideration \u2013 as a non-driver and not-very-good cyclist \u2013 was how often I\u2019d be able to visit him. The best home we found for him was a 45-minute walk or a \u00a35 cab ride away, with no direct bus since the hourly council-subsidised service was cut in 2017.</p> <p>There was a solution at hand: <a href=\"https://www.arrivabus.co.uk/arrivaclick/\" title=\"\">ArrivaClick</a>, a form of \u201cdemand-responsive\u201d public transport that I describe to perplexed friends as a cross between an Uber and a bus, and has been running across south Liverpool since mid-2018. You download an app, enter your card details, location and destination, and a few seconds later you\u2019re informed whether there\u2019s a minibus within a five- to 15-minute timescale that can pick you up a few yards from where you\u2019re standing.</p> <p>The driver follows a route, shown on a GPS-connected tablet, which can deviate slightly to make extra pick-ups of people who are going the same way. Depending on the time of day, I usually find myself travelling with three or four others who have summoned the app at the same time, paying an average of \u00a32 or less per journey. It has enabled me to see my dad every other day and to take him on day trips and to GP appointments at a surgery where the nearest bus stop is a good 10-minute walk away.</p> <p>ArrivaClick currently runs 25 minibuses around south Liverpool, with plans to add more as the service gains in popularity: downloads of the app are running at 1,000 a week. Yet although it\u2019s been a lifeline for me and my dad, are demand-responsive buses really an alternative to a decent, cheap, regular bus network?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/johnson-plans-5bn-boost-for-bus-services-and-cycle-routes\">HS2 poised to get go-ahead as \u00a35bn pledged for bus funding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since 2010, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/02/bus-services-in-crisis-as-councils-cut-funding-campaigners-warn\" title=\"\">an estimated 3,000 bus routes have been cut in England and Wales</a>, yet buses are suddenly all the rage. When Jeremy Corbyn used his entire allocation of prime minister\u2019s questions to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/06/jeremy-corbyn-buses-labour\" title=\"\">grill Theresa May about bus cuts in 2018</a> he was laughed out of town, yet 18 months later the government has stolen a host of bus policies from Labour\u2019s 2019 election manifesto. Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/johnson-plans-5bn-boost-for-bus-services-and-cycle-routes\" title=\"\">it announced \u00a35bn</a> over five years for restoring cancelled routes, electric fleets, \u201cturn-up-and-go\u201d services as well as creating cycle links for every region outside London, and funding local authorities to pilot their own demand-responsive services.</p> <p>I spent a week on my usual itinerary of ArrivaClick trips \u2013 to my dad\u2019s, the city centre, late trips back from the station and the usual household retinue of checkups, children\u2019s parties and afterschool playdates \u2013 finding out how other people use the service. There are regulars like myself who use the service daily \u2013 a blind woman with a guide dog who can usually be picked up outside her front door, and a disabled traveller who uses the bus to get to college after another subsidised route was cut.</p> <p>On the way to my dad\u2019s I meet Jane, on maternity leave and travelling with her baby son to a playgroup in the city centre. She first used ArrivaClick a month ago \u201cfor a hen do, which was brilliant, because 10 of us piled on and after the first passenger it only costs a pound per person. I think they expected a limo but we got a minibus!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I usually use it for work. This has been absolutely great, as I\u2019d be paying for a taxi otherwise</p> <footer> <cite>Kim, ArrivaClick bus user</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Encouragingly, she now uses the service in preference to her car, \u201cno contest\u201d \u2013 as does Dan Feather, a lecturer in history at Liverpool John Moores University. He had been commuting by train, \u201cbut the [Northern] train I was using got cancelled so many times\u201d he felt he couldn\u2019t rely on it. \u201cThe [Click] fares are so much cheaper.\u201d His colleague, researcher Isaac Scarborough, is a non-driver who lives a decent walk away from a regular bus route. \u201cIt\u2019s led us away from using Uber,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s consolidated a lot of things that were less convenient, for instance, we live near a rail station but there are only two trains an hour.\u201d</p> <p>Kim, on her way to visit a friend near Wavertree Technology Park, explains that a Merseytravel-subsidised bus route that ran through the park was cut in 2018. \u201cI usually use it for work. It takes half an hour to walk, but I don\u2019t finish till half nine or 10 at night and it\u2019s awkward, because I have to change buses \u2013 two stops each trip, which is stupid. This has been absolutely great, as I\u2019d be paying for a taxi otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Arriva describes the Click service as complementary to existing transport options. But what if you don\u2019t have a smartphone or tablet? Only one of its services, which recently replaced a subsidised circular bus service around the huge south Liverpool estate of Speke, is bookable by phone.</p> <p> Similar app-based bus services have been trialled in Oxford and Bristol. But do they risk creating \u201cdigital exclusion\u201d? Darren Shirley, CEO of the Campaign for Better Transport, thinks not. \u201cI don\u2019t see that much exclusion can occur as smartphones are now so prevalent, even among those in their 80s.

      "bodyText": "When my dad moved from Birmingham into residential care near my home in Liverpool last autumn, my first consideration \u2013 as a non-driver and not-very-good cyclist \u2013 was how often I\u2019d be able to visit him. The best home we found for him was a 45-minute walk or a \u00a35 cab ride away, with no direct bus since the hourly council-subsidised service was cut in 2017. There was a solution at hand: ArrivaClick, a form of \u201cdemand-responsive\u201d public transport that I describe to perplexed friends as a cross between an Uber and a bus, and has been running across south Liverpool since mid-2018. You download an app, enter your card details, location and destination, and a few seconds later you\u2019re informed whether there\u2019s a minibus within a five- to 15-minute timescale that can pick you up a few yards from where you\u2019re standing. The driver follows a route, shown on a GPS-connected tablet, which can deviate slightly to make extra pick-ups of people who are going the same way. Depending on the time of day, I usually find myself travelling with three or four others who have summoned the app at the same time, paying an average of \u00a32 or less per journey. It has enabled me to see my dad every other day and to take him on day trips and to GP appointments at a surgery where the nearest bus stop is a good 10-minute walk away. ArrivaClick currently runs 25 minibuses around south Liverpool, with plans to add more as the service gains in popularity: downloads of the app are running at 1,000 a week. Yet although it\u2019s been a lifeline for me and my dad, are demand-responsive buses really an alternative to a decent, cheap, regular bus network? Since 2010, an estimated 3,000 bus routes have been cut in England and Wales, yet buses are suddenly all the rage. When Jeremy Corbyn used his entire allocation of prime minister\u2019s questions to grill Theresa May about bus cuts in 2018 he was laughed out of town, yet 18 months later the government has stolen a host of bus policies from Labour\u2019s 2019 election manifesto. Last week it announced \u00a35bn over five years for restoring cancelled routes, electric fleets, \u201cturn-up-and-go\u201d services as well as creating cycle links for every region outside London, and funding local authorities to pilot their own demand-responsive services. I spent a week on my usual itinerary of ArrivaClick trips \u2013 to my dad\u2019s, the city centre, late trips back from the station and the usual household retinue of checkups, children\u2019s parties and afterschool playdates \u2013 finding out how other people use the service. There are regulars like myself who use the service daily \u2013 a blind woman with a guide dog who can usually be picked up outside her front door, and a disabled traveller who uses the bus to get to college after another subsidised route was cut. On the way to my dad\u2019s I meet Jane, on maternity leave and travelling with her baby son to a playgroup in the city centre. She first used ArrivaClick a month ago \u201cfor a hen do, which was brilliant, because 10 of us piled on and after the first passenger it only costs a pound per person. I think they expected a limo but we got a minibus!\u201d Encouragingly, she now uses the service in preference to her car, \u201cno contest\u201d \u2013 as does Dan Feather, a lecturer in history at Liverpool John Moores University. He had been commuting by train, \u201cbut the [Northern] train I was using got cancelled so many times\u201d he felt he couldn\u2019t rely on it. \u201cThe [Click] fares are so much cheaper.\u201d His colleague, researcher Isaac Scarborough, is a non-driver who lives a decent walk away from a regular bus route. \u201cIt\u2019s led us away from using Uber,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s consolidated a lot of things that were less convenient, for instance, we live near a rail station but there are only two trains an hour.\u201d Kim, on her way to visit a friend near Wavertree Technology Park, explains that a Merseytravel-subsidised bus route that ran through the park was cut in 2018. \u201cI usually use it for work. It takes half an hour to walk, but I don\u2019t finish till half nine or 10 at night and it\u2019s awkward, because I have to change buses \u2013 two stops each trip, which is stupid. This has been absolutely great, as I\u2019d be paying for a taxi otherwise.\u201d Arriva describes the Click service as complementary to existing transport options. But what if you don\u2019t have a smartphone or tablet? Only one of its services, which recently replaced a subsidised circular bus service around the huge south Liverpool estate of Speke, is bookable by phone. Similar app-based bus services have been trialled in Oxford and Bristol. But do they risk creating \u201cdigital exclusion\u201d? Darren Shirley, CEO of the Campaign for Better Transport, thinks not. \u201cI don\u2019t see that much exclusion can occur as smartphones are now so prevalent, even among those in their 80s. If it\u2019s going to work, we shouldn\u2019t organise the service around that group, it has to serve the entire community.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe way we look at demand-responsive transport and where it should be used is where a fixed bus route isn\u2019t going to be commercially viable. If a fixed route wends its way through several villages on the way into town, you have to ask: Would DRT better serve those communities?\u201d The County Councils Network points out that its members \u2013 non-metropolitan local authorities \u2013 lost almost half of their funding for bus services in the last decade. This compares with a 19% drop in funding for city regions. \u201cAs a result, buses are almost nonexistent in some of the most rural and coastal areas, while county towns suffer from less frequent and more expensive services compared to cities,\u201d said CCN chairman, David Williams. Unless the funding gap is reversed, DRT will indeed seem attractive to councils without the means to restore lost services. The question is whether demand-responsive buses can truly compensate for the declining patchwork of expensive, privately run services that have existed outside London since the bus network was deregulated in 1986. Since then, bus use outside the capital has declined by 32.5%, compared with a 99% rise in London, where buses remained regulated. In Hartlepool, a similar service to ArrivaClick, the Stagecoach-run Tees Flex service was launched last week. Jessie Joe Jacobs, the Labour candidate for the Tees Valley mayoral election, in May, is quoted in the Northern Echo as saying that bus provision outside London needs \u201ca fundamental change, not just a sticking-plaster approach that this glorified taxi service Ben Houchen [the current Tory mayor of Tees Valley] is introducing\u201d. Even though I live in a big city with a decent bus network, I\u2019ve quickly found I can\u2019t do without what my children call \u201cthe clicky bus\u201d. If this forms part of the future of bus travel, bring it on \u2013 but don\u2019t let it replace the lot. As with the Beeching rail cuts and the demise of trams, once they are gone you\u2019ll have a hard time getting them back.",

The report says that despite dramatic improvements in survival, nutrition, and education over the past 20 years, \u201ctoday\u2019s children face an uncertain future\u201d, with every child facing \u201cexistential threats\u201d. \u201cIn 2015, the world\u2019s countries agreed on the sustainable development goals (SDGs), yet nearly five years later, few countries have recorded much progress towards achieving them,\u201d says the report by a commission of 40 child and adolescent health experts from around the world. \u201cClimate change, ecological degradation, migrating populations, conflict, pervasive inequalities, and predatory commercial practices threaten the health and future of children in every country,\u201d it says. The commission, convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations children\u2019s agency, Unicef, and medical journal the Lancet, calls for radical changes to protect children\u2019s health and futures from the intensifying climate emergency. It also highlights the threat of predatory commercial practices, linking children\u2019s exposure to marketing of fast food and sugary drinks to an 11-fold increase in childhood obesity, from 11 million in 1975 to 124 million in 2016. The report includes an index of 180 countries that compares data on survival, wellbeing, health, education and nutrition; as well as sustainability, with a proxy for greenhouse gas emissions, and equity, or income gaps. Norway, South Korea, the Netherlands, France and Ireland are found to be the best countries for a child to flourish in his or her early years. The Central African Republic, Chad, Somalia, Niger, and Mali are the bottom five in the list, based on the same ranking. But when performance is compared taking per capita carbon emissions into account, Burundi, Chad and Somalia are best performers, while the US, Australia and Saudi Arabia are among the bottom 10 countries. \u201cWhen authors took per capita CO2 emissions into account, the top countries [on the child flourishing ranking] trail behind: Norway ranked 156, the Republic of Korea 166, and the Netherlands 160,\u201d the report says. \u201cEach of the three emits 210% more CO2 per capita than their 2030 target.\u201d \u201cThe only countries on track to beat CO2 emission per capita targets by 2030, while also performing fairly (within the top 70) on child flourishing measures are: Albania, Armenia, Grenada, Jordan, Moldova, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Uruguay and Vietnam,\u201d the report says. The UK is ranked among the top 10 countries when it comes to child flourishing, but placed 133rd on \u201cdelivering on emissions targets\u201d; it is \u201ccurrently on track to emit 115% more CO2 than its 2030 emissions target\u201d. Experts behind the report agree that \u201cwhile the poorest countries need to do more to support their children\u2019s ability to live healthy lives, excessive carbon emissions \u2013 disproportionately from wealthier countries \u2013 threaten the future of all children\u201d. Stefan Peterson, Unicef\u2019s chief of health, said children living in the poorest countries are facing the brunt of a changing climate, despite having a tiny carbon footprint. \u201cThese children face enormous challenges to their health and wellbeing, and are also now at the greatest disadvantage due to the climate crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need sustainable gains in child health and development, which means that big carbon emitters need to reduce their emissions for all children to thrive, poor and rich.\u201d The report says: \u201cIf global warming exceeds 4C by the year 2100 in line with current projections, this would lead to devastating health consequences for children, due to rising ocean levels, heatwaves, proliferation of diseases like malaria and dengue, and malnutrition.\u201d Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London, said the commission was calling for a radical rethink on global child health. \u201cClimate change threatens our children\u2019s future so we must stop carbon emissions as soon as possible,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cOur new index shows that not a single country performed well on both child development and emissions indicators. \u201cWe also call for greater regulation of marketing of tobacco, alcohol, formula milk, sugar-sweetened beverages and gambling to children, and of social media companies which target children through secret algorithms and the inappropriate use of their personal data.\u201d The report says children are at risk from harmful marketing. \u201cEvidence suggests that children in some countries see as many as 30,000 advertisements on television alone in a single year, while youth exposure to vaping (e-cigarettes) advertisements increased by more than 250% in the US over two years, reaching more than 24 million young people.\u201d Industry self-regulation has failed, said Costello, adding that in Australia, for instance, \u201cchildren and adolescent viewers were still exposed to 51 million alcohol ads during just one year of televised football, cricket and rugby\u201d. \u201cThe reality could be much worse still,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have few facts and figures about the huge expansion of social media advertising and algorithms aimed at our children.\u201d The commission calls on governments to put measures in place \u201cto ensure children receive their rights and entitlements now and a liveable planet in the years to come\u201d. \u201cWe live in an era like no other.

      "body": "<p>A<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/23/sopranos-actor-annabella-sciorra-re-enacts-alleged-rape-weinstein-trial\">nnabella Sciorra</a> is in court testifying about the night Harvey Weinstein knocked on her door. She alleges he raped her as she tried to fight him off. \u201c\u2018No! No! But I mean, there was not much I could do at that point \u2013 my body shut down.\u201d Over the years, the court hears, she has experienced what she now recognises as \u201cdissociative states\u201d, drinking too much and cutting herself.</p> <p>What shocks me is how none of this shocks me. It is a familiar story. Weinstein\u2019s team attempt to destroy her in court. Why didn\u2019t she go to the police? Why did she take so long to speak out? Why didn\u2019t she ask a co-star such as Sylvester Stallone to protect her? Yes, she was really asked this. Weinstein denies the charges. The jury started their deliberations on Tuesday.</p> <p>I am taking in Sciorra\u2019s recent testimony on the way to Paris to meet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/20/ive-seen-horrible-things-photographer-laia-abril-on-her-history-of-misogyny\">Laia Abril</a>, a young Spanish artist with a new exhibition \u2013 A History of Misogyny, Chapter Two: On Rape. Abril uses photographs, testimonies, framed facts and quotes, archive material and various relevant objects in a way that makes her journalistic training apparent. The boundary between art and activism dissolves as Abril digests stories and then delivers them in ways \u201cthat people would be able to relate to\u201d \u2013 even if they\u2019d rather not go where they lead.</p> <p>Given the subject matter, I expect Abril to be sombre. She is the opposite: charming and full of energy and easy to talk to, and I begin to see how so many people have trusted her with their stories and pain. The exhibition is still being installed when I arrive. Downstairs are huge black and white photographs of clothes belonging to rape victims. Above the pictures are their testimonies.</p> <p>This is not what I was expecting. I have seen shows featuring such clothing before, but there is something about how they are presented here, as objects in their own right, that dislocates you, makes you look anew. Their owners\u2019 testimonies then provide the gut punch. Take the beautiful wedding dress from Kyrgyzstan. It was worn by Alina, who was a victim of <em>ala kachuu</em>, a form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/27/kyrgyzstan-kidnapped-brides-photo-essay\">bride kidnapping</a> that is still practised in the country. She was captured and then made to marry the man who \u201cravished\u201d her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f96727e425d9989861e308a1141751498b5b17e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f96727e425d9989861e308a1141751498b5b17e/0_96_2953_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chastity Belt, 2019, from the series On Rape.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chastity Belt, 2019, from the series On Rape.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laia Abril/courtesy Galerie Les Filles du Calvaire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was a 21-year-old student in my fourth year at Arabaev University,\u201d her testimony relates. \u201cI wanted to be a fashion designer.\u201d After the attack, she feared being a cause of shame: \u201cMy grandmother asked me not to disgrace the family.\u201d So Alina put on the dress and married her kidnapper.</p> <p>A photo of a US military uniform brings me up short. Meredith says being in the army means everything is \u201cmission first\u201d. In such a world, a woman does not want to be seen as \u201cweak and emotional\u201d. Meredith knew she had to downplay any injuries \u2013 and spent a year being raped by her commander, not wanting to think of it as rape, nor of herself as a victim. I walk past a nun\u2019s habit belonging to a mother superior who abused novices, then a burqa belonging to a woman who was raped continually in a forced marriage in Afghanistan. \u201cIt was not sex,\u201d she says, \u201cit was marital rape.\u201d</p> <p>It took two years for Abril to develop enough trust with these women for them to send her their clothing. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative process,\u201d she says. Sometimes she talks to them through such intermediaries as psychiatrists. She does not want to subject anyone to yet more trauma.</p> <p>As we chat, she tells me about the things that motivate her, in particular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/23/wolf-pack-case-spain-feminism-far-right-vox\">the infamous \u201cwolf pack\u201d case in her native Spain</a>. In 2016, an 18-year-old woman was gang-raped by five men who were later tried and found guilty only on lesser charges of sexual abuse, as the prosecution could not prove they used violence. One judge said they should all have been acquitted and their only crime was the theft of the teenager\u2019s phone. Last year, after a public outcry, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/spanish-supreme-court-finds-wolf-pack-men-guilty-of-rape\">Spanish </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/spanish-supreme-court-finds-wolf-pack-men-guilty-of-rape\">supreme </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/spanish-supreme-court-finds-wolf-pack-men-guilty-of-rape\">court found the men guilty of rape</a>.</p> <p>In 2018, Amnesty International looked at rape legislation in 31 countries across Europe. <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/11/women-across-europe-failed-by-outdated-rape-legislation/\">Only eight have consent-based definitions</a>. In the remainng 23 countries, if the offence does not include physical violence, it is not classified as rape. What Abril pushes us to confront, then, is rape as an institution, one that is both historicised and normalised. She gives the individual stories context, detailing all the methods that are deployed to blame rape on the woman, from lawyers pointing out that a victim may have been wearing a thong (one is photographed) to \u201cthe two-finger test\u201d still used in India, Pakistan and Morocco. This procedure is to determine if a raped woman\u2019s vagina is \u201chabituated to intercourse\u201d. If two fingers can be inserted, the argument goes, it indicates that the sex was consensual.</p> <p>Then there is the thriving new industry of repairing hymens \u2013 or \u201crebuilding honour\u201d as it\u2019s called in some of the images, adverts, texts and pictures collated by Abril. Not to mention the chastity belts and the strange machines invented to cure frigidity. A vagina can be brought to erotic life by, you guessed it, rape. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9e8373d963a06f01df2eca4b9696c0270bbe07dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e8373d963a06f01df2eca4b9696c0270bbe07dd/0_160_2394_2992/800.jpg\" alt=\"Zo\u00eb Tamerlis in Ms 45 by Abel Ferrara.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signs of resistance \u2026 Zo\u00eb Tamerlis in Ms .45 by Abel Ferrara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Navaron Films/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are signs of resistance, though. Abril pays tribute to the wonderful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/feb/15/women.india\">Gulabi vigilante women of India</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/06/pink-sari-revolution-review-sampat-pal-curve-leicester\">their pink saris and huge sticks to beat rapists</a>. There, encased in glass, is one of their wooden weapons. There are also projections from various revenge movies, including I Spit on Your Grave and Ms 45, about a mute woman who goes on a killing spree after she is raped twice.</p> <p>A triptych of hundreds of blurred faces stops me dead. All of these men, found guilty of abuse, were priests in the Catholic church \u2013 not all of the victims in this show are female. How does Abril cope with these stories? \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says. \u201cI have two therapists now. When I was working on abortion, for Chapter One, the issue seemed fixable by law, by decriminalisation. But this \u2013 rape \u2013 is global.\u201d She gestures around the room at all the evidence of horrific acts. \u201cThis is an epidemic.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/23/warcrimes\">It is also a war crime</a>, something Abril is well aware of, having visited Bosnia and heard how rape was used as <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2016/03/22/the-international-criminal-court-recognises-rape-as-a-war-crime\">a weapon of war</a> during the 1992-95 conflict. Under the title Rape Camps, she has placed the words: \u201cSerb troops violated between 12,000 to 30,000 Bosnian women.\u201d She also heard stories about Serbs forcing brothers to rape their sisters in front of their parents. \u201cThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,\u201d she records, \u201cdeclared that \u2018systemic rape\u2019 during wartime was a crime against humanity.\u201d</p> <p>What Abril sees \u2013 and makes us see so clearly \u2013 is the institutionalisation of rape through such things as marriage, the military and the church. I am not sure I like the phrase \u201crape culture\u201d but she does. Rape <em>is</em> the culture, it seems. There are quotes on the wall from Donald Trump (\u201cGrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/14/steve-king-iowa-republican-rape-incest-abortion\">US congressman Steve King</a>, who last year asked if there would be any population of the world left if it wasn\u2019t for rape and incest.</p> <p>All of this arouses emotion \u2013 and it\u2019s meant to. I return to a picture I had avoided earlier. It\u2019s a tiny dress belonging to a five-year-old who was sexually abused by a teacher at her school in Colombia. The other parents turned against the girl\u2019s mother when she complained.

      "bodyText": "Annabella Sciorra is in court testifying about the night Harvey Weinstein knocked on her door. She alleges he raped her as she tried to fight him off. \u201c\u2018No! No! But I mean, there was not much I could do at that point \u2013 my body shut down.\u201d Over the years, the court hears, she has experienced what she now recognises as \u201cdissociative states\u201d, drinking too much and cutting herself. What shocks me is how none of this shocks me. It is a familiar story. Weinstein\u2019s team attempt to destroy her in court. Why didn\u2019t she go to the police? Why did she take so long to speak out? Why didn\u2019t she ask a co-star such as Sylvester Stallone to protect her? Yes, she was really asked this. Weinstein denies the charges. The jury started their deliberations on Tuesday. I am taking in Sciorra\u2019s recent testimony on the way to Paris to meet Laia Abril, a young Spanish artist with a new exhibition \u2013 A History of Misogyny, Chapter Two: On Rape. Abril uses photographs, testimonies, framed facts and quotes, archive material and various relevant objects in a way that makes her journalistic training apparent. The boundary between art and activism dissolves as Abril digests stories and then delivers them in ways \u201cthat people would be able to relate to\u201d \u2013 even if they\u2019d rather not go where they lead. Given the subject matter, I expect Abril to be sombre. She is the opposite: charming and full of energy and easy to talk to, and I begin to see how so many people have trusted her with their stories and pain. The exhibition is still being installed when I arrive. Downstairs are huge black and white photographs of clothes belonging to rape victims. Above the pictures are their testimonies. This is not what I was expecting. I have seen shows featuring such clothing before, but there is something about how they are presented here, as objects in their own right, that dislocates you, makes you look anew. Their owners\u2019 testimonies then provide the gut punch. Take the beautiful wedding dress from Kyrgyzstan. It was worn by Alina, who was a victim of ala kachuu, a form of bride kidnapping that is still practised in the country. She was captured and then made to marry the man who \u201cravished\u201d her. \u201cI was a 21-year-old student in my fourth year at Arabaev University,\u201d her testimony relates. \u201cI wanted to be a fashion designer.\u201d After the attack, she feared being a cause of shame: \u201cMy grandmother asked me not to disgrace the family.\u201d So Alina put on the dress and married her kidnapper. A photo of a US military uniform brings me up short. Meredith says being in the army means everything is \u201cmission first\u201d. In such a world, a woman does not want to be seen as \u201cweak and emotional\u201d. Meredith knew she had to downplay any injuries \u2013 and spent a year being raped by her commander, not wanting to think of it as rape, nor of herself as a victim. I walk past a nun\u2019s habit belonging to a mother superior who abused novices, then a burqa belonging to a woman who was raped continually in a forced marriage in Afghanistan. \u201cIt was not sex,\u201d she says, \u201cit was marital rape.\u201d It took two years for Abril to develop enough trust with these women for them to send her their clothing. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative process,\u201d she says. Sometimes she talks to them through such intermediaries as psychiatrists. She does not want to subject anyone to yet more trauma. As we chat, she tells me about the things that motivate her, in particular the infamous \u201cwolf pack\u201d case in her native Spain. In 2016, an 18-year-old woman was gang-raped by five men who were later tried and found guilty only on lesser charges of sexual abuse, as the prosecution could not prove they used violence. One judge said they should all have been acquitted and their only crime was the theft of the teenager\u2019s phone. Last year, after a public outcry, the Spanish supreme court found the men guilty of rape. In 2018, Amnesty International looked at rape legislation in 31 countries across Europe. Only eight have consent-based definitions. In the remainng 23 countries, if the offence does not include physical violence, it is not classified as rape. What Abril pushes us to confront, then, is rape as an institution, one that is both historicised and normalised. She gives the individual stories context, detailing all the methods that are deployed to blame rape on the woman, from lawyers pointing out that a victim may have been wearing a thong (one is photographed) to \u201cthe two-finger test\u201d still used in India, Pakistan and Morocco. This procedure is to determine if a raped woman\u2019s vagina is \u201chabituated to intercourse\u201d. If two fingers can be inserted, the argument goes, it indicates that the sex was consensual. Then there is the thriving new industry of repairing hymens \u2013 or \u201crebuilding honour\u201d as it\u2019s called in some of the images, adverts, texts and pictures collated by Abril. Not to mention the chastity belts and the strange machines invented to cure frigidity. A vagina can be brought to erotic life by, you guessed it, rape. There are signs of resistance, though. Abril pays tribute to the wonderful Gulabi vigilante women of India, with their pink saris and huge sticks to beat rapists. There, encased in glass, is one of their wooden weapons. There are also projections from various revenge movies, including I Spit on Your Grave and Ms 45, about a mute woman who goes on a killing spree after she is raped twice. A triptych of hundreds of blurred faces stops me dead. All of these men, found guilty of abuse, were priests in the Catholic church \u2013 not all of the victims in this show are female. How does Abril cope with these stories? \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says. \u201cI have two therapists now. When I was working on abortion, for Chapter One, the issue seemed fixable by law, by decriminalisation. But this \u2013 rape \u2013 is global.\u201d She gestures around the room at all the evidence of horrific acts. \u201cThis is an epidemic.\u201d It is also a war crime, something Abril is well aware of, having visited Bosnia and heard how rape was used as a weapon of war during the 1992-95 conflict. Under the title Rape Camps, she has placed the words: \u201cSerb troops violated between 12,000 to 30,000 Bosnian women.\u201d She also heard stories about Serbs forcing brothers to rape their sisters in front of their parents. \u201cThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,\u201d she records, \u201cdeclared that \u2018systemic rape\u2019 during wartime was a crime against humanity.\u201d What Abril sees \u2013 and makes us see so clearly \u2013 is the institutionalisation of rape through such things as marriage, the military and the church. I am not sure I like the phrase \u201crape culture\u201d but she does. Rape is the culture, it seems. There are quotes on the wall from Donald Trump (\u201cGrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d) and US congressman Steve King, who last year asked if there would be any population of the world left if it wasn\u2019t for rape and incest. All of this arouses emotion \u2013 and it\u2019s meant to. I return to a picture I had avoided earlier. It\u2019s a tiny dress belonging to a five-year-old who was sexually abused by a teacher at her school in Colombia. The other parents turned against the girl\u2019s mother when she complained. Abril describes opening the parcel when it arrived. \u201cThe dress was so small,\u201d she says. \u201cI went into meltdown.\u201d It was a while before she could photograph it. Yet, she says, something happens as the work goes up on the walls. All of these stories, all of this information changes her. \u201c I begin to feel lighter,\u201d she says, and I can sense that. Education is part of the answer, we agree, but the focus on individuals is not enough: rape happens because it is embedded in the culture.

If he had evinced any understanding of ecology, or of the scale and consequences of the intervention he suggests, or had recognised that wild animals feel pleasure as well as pain, his argument might merit a response. Nevertheless, we seem determined to implement this ridiculous idea, if not for the reasons he proposes. Between these poles \u2013 kill nothing and kill almost everything \u2013 lies the pragmatic aim of maximising the diversity and abundance of non-human life on Earth, while securing our own survival. But this doesn\u2019t answer the activist\u2019s central and important point. If it\u2019s acceptable to kill wild animals to alleviate environmental damage, why is it not acceptable to kill humans? In other words, why might we see another animal\u2019s right to life as negotiable, but the human right to life as absolute? Because if we did otherwise, society would fall apart. The powerful would decide that the powerless must die for the greater good, as they have done many times before. Our relations would be characterised by extreme distrust and perpetual violence. We could not work together for any purpose, including environmental protection. Yes, I am a speciesist. Not because I believe human beings are innately superior to other animals, but because I believe we cannot live together (or even alone) without privileging our own existence. We don\u2019t have to see ourselves as the divinely appointed stewards of creation to recognise that we bear responsibility for restoring the magnificent living systems we have harmed. And we don\u2019t have to deny our bias towards ourselves to defend the lives of other beings. \u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>When Saffron Burrows became an actor, there were scripts she had to throw straight out. Her prospective characters \u201cwere always running for their life in high heels\u201d, she says. \u201cIf I read that on page five, I would stop reading. I\u2019d get to a sentence or character description and just think: \u2018Who are these people?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She made her name in the classic 1990s films Circle of Friends and In the Name of the Father, going on to blockbusters such as Deep Blue Sea and Troy, before starring more recently in the TV shows Mozart in the Jungle and You. She is proud of the roles that define her career. But even prouder of those she turned down. \u201cOh my God, yes!\u201d she shudders. \u201cSome very successful sexist films they\u2019re now making the third sequel of.\u201d</p> <p>We meet at her favourite theatre in Los Angeles, the Wallis Annenberg Centre for Performing Arts. Burrows is 6ft tall and softly spoken, waving enthusiastically when she spots me walk in. Her latest project is the Lorien Haines play Everything I Ever Wanted to Tell My Daughter About Men, which traces one woman\u2019s relationship history, exploring the impact of sexual assault, addiction and teenage pregnancy. She is starring in a one-night-only staged reading of the play in London on 20 February to raise money for survivors of sexual violence.</p> <p>Harvey Weinstein\u2019s trial is under way when we meet. The only time Burrows crossed paths with him was when she was already an established name \u2013 his company distributed the 2002 film Frida, in which she starred alongside Salma Hayek. The situation in the industry now, she says, is \u201cpretty dark. A lot of people I know are still questioning what they knew and what they could have done sooner. And the few people I know who did try to do something sooner feel like their careers were destroyed because of it, so it\u2019s still a very live subject. It\u2019s certainly not resolved.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s just one person \u2013 I mean, there was a culture,\u201d she says. \u201cIf someone was very powerful, most of their actions weren\u2019t questioned. The fact that some companies are now having transparency in their pay structures is revolutionary. It shouldn\u2019t be, but it feels revolutionary if you\u2019ve come from an era where it wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7698e99c1c6acc07406244025501f2d3aa2b5c0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7698e99c1c6acc07406244025501f2d3aa2b5c0f/6_0_1732_2848/608.jpg\" alt=\"Burrows in Deep Blue Sea.\" width=\"608\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burrows in Deep Blue Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros/Village Roadshow/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did she ever fear, early in her career, being manoeuvred into a casting couch situation?</p> <p>\u201cThere were people you knew that, if you\u2019re going to sit with that person and read a script, don\u2019t go late in the day. You\u2019d try to get an appointment early in the morning. It was so pervasive. Those people were in charge and that\u2019s how they ran things.\u201d</p> <p>In an industry full of actors turned activists, Burrows is unusual for having been an activist first. Now 47, she says she became a feminist aged 10, and fell in love with community activism at that age, too, which made her \u201cmore strident about who I was as a person and how I felt about things; what I would and wouldn\u2019t do\u201d.</p> <p>Her parents separated when she was young, raising Burrows between them in north London. They were active members of the Socialist Workers party, which formed the Anti-Nazi League in 1977. When the league disbanded in 1981, the family\u2019s attention turned to local anti-racist groups. Burrows\u2019 mother was a teacher, who worked at \u201cpretty much every primary school in Hackney\u201d over the course of 45 years, giving her a \u201ccertain degree of authority in the community\u201d, she says.</p> <p>\u201cKids would trust my mum, so they\u2019d come into school and tell her about their houses being attacked and she\u2019d try to do something to make the situation better. At the time, with the institutionalised racism in the police force, nothing was ever done, so it really was down to the local people.\u201d</p> <p>Burrows spent much of her early teens rounding up fellow school pupils for anti-racist, anti-fascist meetings that she sometimes chaired herself. Children from local Bengali families were being attacked on their way home from school, so one of their initiatives was to provide them with a safe place to play. At night, she and her boyfriend would go out spray-painting over fascist graffiti.</p> <p>She also began organising for disability rights. Her stepfather Richard Rieser used crutches after contracting polio as a baby; he set up Disability History Month 10 years ago, and campaigns for the inclusion of disabled children in mainstream schools. \u201cAs a seven-year-old, I remember people were appalling \u2013 they would just comment on his physicality,\u201d says Burrows. \u201cWe\u2019d walk down the street together and people would shout out insults. I remember feeling incredibly angry.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m surprised Burrows opted to become an actor. Wouldn\u2019t she have been more suited to politics? \u201cI wanted to be an MP very much,\u201d she says. \u201cI do have a penchant for the bureaucracy of union conferences, motions and speeches. Certainly there\u2019s a huge amount of nitty-gritty that some people would find tedious but I might enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of going into politics, Burrows began her career at 15, working as a model. She went to Paris, living with other young girls, who \u201cwere not earning a fortune\u201d, she says. \u201cThey were earning, sometimes, very little, and sending the money home to their families. Or they\u2019d been abused and they were fleeing violence. I must have lived with 75 girls. Some people would come for a year, some for three days, then you\u2019d never see them again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"af41f3c524e257cef1a37864c166470382b576ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af41f3c524e257cef1a37864c166470382b576ec/0_0_5471_3680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brooklyn Decker and Burrows take part in the Fire Drill Friday protest in LA earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brooklyn Decker and Burrows take part in the Fire Drill Friday protest in LA earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronen Tivony/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She has been writing a script based on that experience, \u201cabout what took place in the Paris fashion industry, and the oppression of mostly working-class girls from all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>She says writing \u201cjust started to pour out\u201d of her when working for six months at a time on films such as Troy. \u201cWriting was a brilliant discovery. It gave me an outlet that was not about other people\u2019s schedules or time. I found it the most wonderful way of not feeling impotent at work and stuck.\u201d</p> <p>Burrows has been supporting the One Fair Wage campaign, run by Saru Jayaraman; women who have been oppressed by customers or their bosses are encouraged to share stories of working for tips in restaurants. The way Jayaraman explains it, says Burrows, is: \u201cIf one of your first jobs as a young woman is in the tipping industry and you\u2019re told by your boss to pull your zip down and pull your skirt up to survive, then you start at such a low bar of expectation that, thereafter, nothing fazes you.\u201d</p> <p>And that, says Burrows, is exactly what has happened in the film and fashion industries, where women typically start out very young. \u201cIf you\u2019re told that\u2019s how you behave in order to survive and flourish, then you actually question far less in your 20s and 30s because you think: \u2018Oh, nothing\u2019s as bad as that.\u2019 So it\u2019s a real issue. No one wants their teenage daughter thinking that\u2019s what you should expect from your life.\u201d</p> <p>Burrows has two children with her wife, the TV writer Alison Balian, from whom she recently separated: a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter. Given the title of the play she\u2019s appearing in, what would she want to tell her children about men? The play\u2019s title, she says, is not to be taken so literally.</p> <p>\u201cI was concerned it could be perceived as something anti-men, and that\u2019s absolutely not the point. Lorien is very funny and wrote it with some irony in the title.\u201d</p> <p>Does she think it\u2019s possible for us to prepare our children for what lies ahead in such serious times \u2013 were her own parents able to prepare her? \u201cMy mum talked to me about justice, racism, homophobia, sexism and misogyny. She would never just say: \u2018Don\u2019t say that word because it\u2019s racist.\u2019 She\u2019d explain why the word led to not just verbal but physical violence.</p> <p>\u201cNow I have young children I think: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s the way to talk to them.\u2019 You don\u2019t just give them a pat answer to things, because it doesn\u2019t make sense to them. They have to know why something\u2019s not OK. I try to speak to my kids how my mum did, which is respecting them as human beings and giving them as full an answer as you can, that still allows them to have a childhood and feel safe. So they\u2019re aware of Greenpeace and they know what the civil rights movement is. Well, my seven-year-old does \u2013 my three-year-old not so much, yet.\u201d</p> <p>The play has inspired a feature film \u2013 an amalgamation of 24 short films, all directed by women, including Burrows and fellow actors Tara Fitzgerald and Sienna Guillory.</p> <p>\u201cI audaciously asked Lorien: \u2018Have you got any left or have you shot them all?\u2019 And she said: \u2018There\u2019s a few left, would you like to do one?\u2019 I\u2019ve been wanting to direct for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Burrows\u2019 career has shifted from film into TV in recent years, most notably with a starring role in four seasons of the Amazon comedy drama Mozart in the Jungle (2014-18). Was it a conscious decision to move into TV roles? \u201cI\u2019d like to say that yes, I had a plan, but it was much more the things that were interesting that came along,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want to tell certain stories and the size of screen is less relevant.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57e53e70c0719606270359c8e6712656f9ff7e55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57e53e70c0719606270359c8e6712656f9ff7e55/0_52_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burrows in season 2 of You.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burrows in season 2 of You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beth Dubber/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This spring, Burrows will begin filming another season of You for Netflix. The thriller goes inside the mind of Joe Goldman, a seductive serial killer and stalker played by Gossip Girl\u2019s Penn Badgley. Burrows portrays the bohemian mother of Joe\u2019s latest obsession, Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti). \u201cIt\u2019s clever,\u201d she says. \u201cIt reminds me of The Talented Mr Ripley. His intelligence and softness and gentle frame: \u2018Why am I liking this person?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Some have questioned its perspective and politics; Badgley himself has spoken about his concern that female viewers have been lusting after his character. When I ask Burrows about this, she points out that she only worked with female writers and directors on the episodes she has made, and found the filming interesting. \u201cYou\u2019re telling this rather twisted story with these kids \u2013 these actors \u2013 who have feminist mothers. The cast are incredibly politically awake.\u201d But with the still-rising popularity of true-crime dramas and podcasts, isn\u2019t it time we gave stories about female victims a rest?</p> <p>\u201cThere was a period where every time you turned on the telly there was a corpse at the beginning of anything. I find that very offensive,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes. \u201cI think it\u2019s got a little better now. They\u2019re trying to look like they\u2019re not just putting women in bikinis.\u201d</p> <p>Her writing has been a fantastic antidote to the ageism in the acting industry, she says, to the feeling that \u201cyou\u2019re getting stuck at a certain age or categorisation, or feeling disempowered because, ultimately, as an actor, you are being chosen by others, unless you create your own work\u201d. She is also glad to have left behind the days when her relationships with men (including Alan Cumming) and women (including Fiona Shaw) sometimes overshadowed her work. \u201cI remember doing interviews in my 30s and there was a lascivious element to the questioning that was incredibly categorising and reductive. I stopped doing interviews for a while because of that.\u201d</p> <p>She was moved by Phillip Schofield\u2019s recent announcement, aged 57, that he was gay. \u201cI was sad he\u2019d had to hold on to that for so many years, but it was beautiful how people embraced him,\u201d she says. \u201cTeenagers today are so fluid and non-binary; they\u2019re fantastically unafraid. My house [growing up] was a bit like that. I\u2019ve loved men and I\u2019ve loved women and I was raised to feel like I could love who I wanted. We could talk about everything in the world.\u201d</p> <p><em>Everything I Ever Wanted to Tell My Daughter About Men is at The Sam Wanamaker Playhouse on Thursday 20 February at 8pm</em></p>",

Lorien is very funny and wrote it with some irony in the title.\u201d Does she think it\u2019s possible for us to prepare our children for what lies ahead in such serious times \u2013 were her own parents able to prepare her? \u201cMy mum talked to me about justice, racism, homophobia, sexism and misogyny. She would never just say: \u2018Don\u2019t say that word because it\u2019s racist.\u2019 She\u2019d explain why the word led to not just verbal but physical violence. \u201cNow I have young children I think: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s the way to talk to them.\u2019 You don\u2019t just give them a pat answer to things, because it doesn\u2019t make sense to them. They have to know why something\u2019s not OK. I try to speak to my kids how my mum did, which is respecting them as human beings and giving them as full an answer as you can, that still allows them to have a childhood and feel safe. So they\u2019re aware of Greenpeace and they know what the civil rights movement is. Well, my seven-year-old does \u2013 my three-year-old not so much, yet.\u201d The play has inspired a feature film \u2013 an amalgamation of 24 short films, all directed by women, including Burrows and fellow actors Tara Fitzgerald and Sienna Guillory. \u201cI audaciously asked Lorien: \u2018Have you got any left or have you shot them all?\u2019 And she said: \u2018There\u2019s a few left, would you like to do one?\u2019 I\u2019ve been wanting to direct for a long time.\u201d Burrows\u2019 career has shifted from film into TV in recent years, most notably with a starring role in four seasons of the Amazon comedy drama Mozart in the Jungle (2014-18). Was it a conscious decision to move into TV roles? \u201cI\u2019d like to say that yes, I had a plan, but it was much more the things that were interesting that came along,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want to tell certain stories and the size of screen is less relevant.\u201d This spring, Burrows will begin filming another season of You for Netflix. The thriller goes inside the mind of Joe Goldman, a seductive serial killer and stalker played by Gossip Girl\u2019s Penn Badgley. Burrows portrays the bohemian mother of Joe\u2019s latest obsession, Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti). \u201cIt\u2019s clever,\u201d she says. \u201cIt reminds me of The Talented Mr Ripley. His intelligence and softness and gentle frame: \u2018Why am I liking this person?\u2019\u201d Some have questioned its perspective and politics; Badgley himself has spoken about his concern that female viewers have been lusting after his character. When I ask Burrows about this, she points out that she only worked with female writers and directors on the episodes she has made, and found the filming interesting. \u201cYou\u2019re telling this rather twisted story with these kids \u2013 these actors \u2013 who have feminist mothers. The cast are incredibly politically awake.\u201d But with the still-rising popularity of true-crime dramas and podcasts, isn\u2019t it time we gave stories about female victims a rest? \u201cThere was a period where every time you turned on the telly there was a corpse at the beginning of anything. I find that very offensive,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes. \u201cI think it\u2019s got a little better now. They\u2019re trying to look like they\u2019re not just putting women in bikinis.\u201d Her writing has been a fantastic antidote to the ageism in the acting industry, she says, to the feeling that \u201cyou\u2019re getting stuck at a certain age or categorisation, or feeling disempowered because, ultimately, as an actor, you are being chosen by others, unless you create your own work\u201d. She is also glad to have left behind the days when her relationships with men (including Alan Cumming) and women (including Fiona Shaw) sometimes overshadowed her work. \u201cI remember doing interviews in my 30s and there was a lascivious element to the questioning that was incredibly categorising and reductive. I stopped doing interviews for a while because of that.\u201d She was moved by Phillip Schofield\u2019s recent announcement, aged 57, that he was gay. \u201cI was sad he\u2019d had to hold on to that for so many years, but it was beautiful how people embraced him,\u201d she says. \u201cTeenagers today are so fluid and non-binary; they\u2019re fantastically unafraid. My house [growing up] was a bit like that. I\u2019ve loved men and I\u2019ve loved women and I was raised to feel like I could love who I wanted. We could talk about everything in the world.\u201d Everything I Ever Wanted to Tell My Daughter About Men is at The Sam Wanamaker Playhouse on Thursday 20 February at 8pm",

      "body": "<p>Casual staff at Australian universities are \u201cpanicking\u201d as the coronavirus travel ban continues into a third week, a University of Sydney lecturer has said.</p> <p> The lecturer, who spoke to Guardian Australia on condition of anonymity, said sessional teaching staff had been experiencing significant strain as a consequence of the Australian government refusing entry to people who have recently travelled through mainland China since the outbreak of coronavirus.</p> <p>The travel restrictions have hit the higher education sector particularly hard, with universities heavily reliant on income from full-fee paying international students. Universities have estimated they face $1.2bn in lost fees from an estimated 65,800 international students at risk of cancelling their first semester enrolment due to being stranded outside Australia, <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/top-universities-face-12bn-coronavirus-hit/news-story/424ba001f0228f9733dd5f7b6c396209\">the Australian reported</a>.</p> <p>The uncertainty around enrolments has had a direct effect on the teaching staff at the university, the lecturer said. \u201cThe casual workforce gets hired based on enrolments.

The government\u2019s travel ban, initially 14 days, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/coronavirus-australia-extends-travel-ban-on-people-entering-from-china\">extended for another week</a>, and is due to expire again on Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you manage teaching contracts when a third of your students are overseas?\u201d the lecturer said. \u201cThe university has a huge and unhealthy dependence on the international student market. The casualisation of the workforce leaves the university incredibly vulnerable to crises like this, and they\u2019re going to happen more and more often.\u201d</p> <p>The lecturer was concerned that a rapid shift to online teaching to accommodate students stuck overseas would put staff in a very difficult position.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of teachers here aren\u2019t bilingual, and they aren\u2019t being paid to work outside their time zone to help students with their studies as the semester starts.\u201d</p> <p>Many sessional staff also did not have access to private office space in which to conduct lectures or tutorials by Skype, or to have the conversations with their international students that long-distance teaching might require.</p> <p>\u201cTeachers have told me that they have resorted to emailing every student individually and that\u2019s not sustainable. All this suggests that the institution can\u2019t provide or effectively manage the experience that students are paying a lot of money for,\u201d the lecturer said.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been goodwill from the university, but to me that goodwill has skewed towards presentation and representation and away from the actual experience of students and staff.\u201d </p> <p>The University of Sydney said in response it was \u201cworking hard to minimise disruptions as much as possible given the ongoing uncertainty of the situation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe appreciate this is a challenging time for many of our students and staff \u2013 including our highly skilled and valued casual workforce,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>The university said it expected to be able to provide further clarity for semester one plans once the government had confirmed whether the travel ban would be lifted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/17/exempt-chinese-students-from-coronavirus-travel-ban-new-zealand-universities-urge\">Exempt Chinese students from coronavirus travel ban, New Zealand universities urge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The university has 14,000 students who have been affected by the travel ban. It said for all other students it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, and the semester would start as scheduled on 24 February.</p> <p>The National Union of Students has called for the travel ban to be lifted immediately, saying it was a \u201cheavy handed, inconsistent and discriminatory decision\u201d that had \u201cdisproportionately affected\u201d international students.</p> <p>The president of the NUS, Molly Willmott, said assistance from universities for affected students had been \u201chit and miss\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe travel ban has created a situation of uncertainty, which has heightened stress and anxiety with students,\u201d Willmott said.</p> <p>\u201cThings like their education, visa, housing and work are all affected by this travel ban and the longer it is in place the more this uncertainty grows. There are obviously already issues with international student mental health and isolation, so this situation is just exacerbating these issues.\u201d</p> <p>Universities have been implementing a variety of access strategies for students affected by the ban, including providing course materials online, extending due dates for fees and offering deferment of studies.</p> <p>\u201cSome universities are making an active effort to overcome the issues now facing international students with this ban, and putting some services online, while others have gone business as usual and have failed to make accommodations,\u201d Willmott said.</p> <p>The Chinese government agreed last week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/china-to-open-up-its-internet-for-100000-students-hit-by-australias-coronavirus-travel-ban\">relax its severe internet restrictions</a> after lobbying from the higher education sector, a move that would allow international students to access course materials online.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Casual staff at Australian universities are \u201cpanicking\u201d as the coronavirus travel ban continues into a third week, a University of Sydney lecturer has said. The lecturer, who spoke to Guardian Australia on condition of anonymity, said sessional teaching staff had been experiencing significant strain as a consequence of the Australian government refusing entry to people who have recently travelled through mainland China since the outbreak of coronavirus. The travel restrictions have hit the higher education sector particularly hard, with universities heavily reliant on income from full-fee paying international students. Universities have estimated they face $1.2bn in lost fees from an estimated 65,800 international students at risk of cancelling their first semester enrolment due to being stranded outside Australia, the Australian reported. The uncertainty around enrolments has had a direct effect on the teaching staff at the university, the lecturer said. \u201cThe casual workforce gets hired based on enrolments. Casual teaching contracts require student numbers to be confirmed. People were panicking.\u201d The lecturer said they were aware of a course at the university for which one third of enrolled students were stuck in China. The government\u2019s travel ban, initially 14 days, was extended for another week, and is due to expire again on Saturday. \u201cHow do you manage teaching contracts when a third of your students are overseas?\u201d the lecturer said. \u201cThe university has a huge and unhealthy dependence on the international student market. The casualisation of the workforce leaves the university incredibly vulnerable to crises like this, and they\u2019re going to happen more and more often.\u201d The lecturer was concerned that a rapid shift to online teaching to accommodate students stuck overseas would put staff in a very difficult position. \u201cA lot of teachers here aren\u2019t bilingual, and they aren\u2019t being paid to work outside their time zone to help students with their studies as the semester starts.\u201d Many sessional staff also did not have access to private office space in which to conduct lectures or tutorials by Skype, or to have the conversations with their international students that long-distance teaching might require. \u201cTeachers have told me that they have resorted to emailing every student individually and that\u2019s not sustainable. All this suggests that the institution can\u2019t provide or effectively manage the experience that students are paying a lot of money for,\u201d the lecturer said. \u201cThere has been goodwill from the university, but to me that goodwill has skewed towards presentation and representation and away from the actual experience of students and staff.\u201d The University of Sydney said in response it was \u201cworking hard to minimise disruptions as much as possible given the ongoing uncertainty of the situation\u201d. \u201cWe appreciate this is a challenging time for many of our students and staff \u2013 including our highly skilled and valued casual workforce,\u201d the statement said. The university said it expected to be able to provide further clarity for semester one plans once the government had confirmed whether the travel ban would be lifted. The university has 14,000 students who have been affected by the travel ban. It said for all other students it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, and the semester would start as scheduled on 24 February. The National Union of Students has called for the travel ban to be lifted immediately, saying it was a \u201cheavy handed, inconsistent and discriminatory decision\u201d that had \u201cdisproportionately affected\u201d international students. The president of the NUS, Molly Willmott, said assistance from universities for affected students had been \u201chit and miss\u201d. \u201cThe travel ban has created a situation of uncertainty, which has heightened stress and anxiety with students,\u201d Willmott said. \u201cThings like their education, visa, housing and work are all affected by this travel ban and the longer it is in place the more this uncertainty grows. There are obviously already issues with international student mental health and isolation, so this situation is just exacerbating these issues.\u201d Universities have been implementing a variety of access strategies for students affected by the ban, including providing course materials online, extending due dates for fees and offering deferment of studies. \u201cSome universities are making an active effort to overcome the issues now facing international students with this ban, and putting some services online, while others have gone business as usual and have failed to make accommodations,\u201d Willmott said. The Chinese government agreed last week to relax its severe internet restrictions after lobbying from the higher education sector, a move that would allow international students to access course materials online.",

The AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, told reporters at the National Press Club on Wednesday he was \u201cnot aware\u201d that the minister was interviewed before the investigation was concluded earlier in February. The comments were made after speeches from Kershaw, the Criminal Intelligence Commission chief executive, Michael Phelan, and the AusTrac chief executive, Nicole Rose, spruiking for new powers to combat child exploitation material and warning social media companies they could be named and shamed for obstructing investigations. In October, Labor referred the letter with inflated travel figures used to politically attack the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, and her record on climate change to the New South Wales police. It questioned whether the document containing inflated figures \u2013 quoted in Taylor\u2019s letter \u2013 constituted a forgery used to influence an official in the conduct of their duty, and whether Taylor could have committed an offence by failing to report it. On 20 December, the NSW police referred the matter to the AFP, reportedly because if any crime was committed, it would have occurred in Canberra, not Sydney. On Wednesday, Kershaw was asked if the AFP had questioned Taylor or his staff. Kershaw replied he was \u201cnot aware that the minister was interviewed, or even offered an interview\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty clear in the decision-making process that we came to, not being able to substantiate any offences being committed,\u201d he said. Kershaw said the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, did not express a view about whether an offence under the NSW criminal code had been committed. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the referral from NSW police, but I did receive a call from the commissioner as a courtesy, to let me know he was referring that through to us, I think around \u2013 I want to say around Christmas Eve \u2026 And the referral was made to us and then we assessed that material and made that decision.\u201d Morrison personally contacted Fuller by phone, leading to allegations, which were strongly denied, he had influenced the investigation.

Earlier, Kershaw, Rose and Phelan all warned of the increasing difficulty in investigating child abuse material as perpetrators rely on encryption and the dark web to hide their crimes. Phelan proposed an \u201cattribute-based approach\u201d, suggesting that law enforcement agencies would like \u201cto make it a lot easier to get in, to have a look\u201d at suspects\u2019 communications, subject to safeguards, rather than obtaining warrants to intercept a particular device, investigating a particular person for a particular offence. \u201cAs the communications go very much into the dark zone, sometimes it\u2019s very difficult to identify who the offender is,\u201d he said. Asked what more powers law enforcement needed to combat the problem, Kershaw said the Australian intelligence community was \u201cpretty happy with what [the AFP] have, but there are some challenges there in some additional legislation [that is required]\u201d. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right for me to ventilate that here,\u201d he said. Kershaw and Phelan both downplayed the suggestion the powers would include expanding the Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s domestic powers \u2013 the subject of Annika Smethurst\u2019s reporting which resulted in two police raids. In June, Dutton called for a \u201csensible discussion\u201d about whether the ASD should gain powers to spy on and disrupt Australians\u2019 criminal activities, which he argued could help disrupt paedophile networks and stop cyber-attacks. Phelan said the ASD can already help law enforcement with \u201clawful authority\u201d. \u201cSo when we\u2019re talking about modernising the interception regime, it would be law enforcement that would get those powers, which would make no extra burden or requirement for ASD other than that which they already have, which is to be able to help law enforcement if they have the ability to do so,\u201d he said. Kershaw said the ASD \u201chelp us under the frameworks, offshore, internationally\u201d. The AFP did not use the ASD \u201cdomestically\u201d, he said, except for cyber security work, such as when companies were hacked. Kershaw reiterated the AFP\u2019s opposition to Facebook moving all its users\u2019 messaging into an encrypted service and confirmed Australia was working with the US through its CLOUD Act regime to speed up requests to break encryption. He said that \u201call bets are off\u201d when it comes to naming and shaming social media companies for obstructing police investigations. \u201cIf I feel like certain companies are not cooperating, we\u2019ll end up outing them and probably damaging their reputation.\u201d",

From anyone I knew. I took a deep breath: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>It took me 15 minutes to find the surgeon\u2019s office in the large hospital.

The prognosis was bad \u2013 she had only a few months to live.</p> <p>I had flown in two days before, prepared to help for a couple of weeks of post-operative care.

It was just a few weeks before my husband, daughters and I made a similarly bold move, from Manchester, England, to Phoenix, Arizona. It was a terrifying and exciting time, a huge risk and a huge adventure.</p> <p>My mum didn\u2019t want to upset us. She waited a whole month to give us the news.</p> <h2>She wasn\u2019t coming back</h2> <p>Living 13,000 miles away from my mum for most of my adult life meant our relationship had been feast or famine.

She was so unhappy in her marriage, so devoid of hope for a different future in England. But it was devastating. I felt bereft, abandoned, like I had lost her. The person I always turned to for guidance was gone.</p> <p>She would fly in for major life events \u2013 weddings, births, funerals \u2013 but the day-to-day chitchat that is the glue for most relationships was nearly impossible when phone conversations cost a small fortune, and often the connection was poor. But we did our best.</p> <p>Now I was standing in a corridor, waiting to tell her the news that the cancer wasn\u2019t gone.

I made lots of food, plumped pillows around her chair, doled out painkillers, bathed the wound where they had taken out her drain.</p> <p>We were told the oncologist would be in touch to discuss palliative care, possibly chemotherapy. We waited. We watched some of her favourite films: Crazy Rich Asians, John Wick. I drank more whiskey.</p> <p>On day three it hit me: we were in limbo.</p> <p>Here we were, waiting for the phone to ring, waiting for a doctor to tell us how long she had left to live.

We were two headstrong women with a complicated back story, in an emotionally charged situation, living cheek by jowl in a small camper van. Mum was also only a week out of surgery, still very tired and often in discomfort. One night I lay awake for hours wondering if I had made a massive mistake taking the trip at all. \u201cI suppose that all this is a bit pointless,\u201d my mum mused one day. \u201cI mean, once I\u2019m dead, what use are memories?\u201d</p> <p>But then we arrived at a bubblegum pink lake called Hutt Lagoon, and I\u2019ll never forget her gasp as she first saw it. \u201cThis is just amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone should see this.\u201d In Kalbarri, dramatic sandstone cliffs rose up out of turquoise seas. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"16732bfbaf3f5a70848a4dce815cae7be54dc3af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16732bfbaf3f5a70848a4dce815cae7be54dc3af/0_482_2640_2239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baby emus after crossing the highway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"848\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baby emus after crossing the highway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Walker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was so much magic, from the big red kangaroo we saw out the window of the van one morning while brushing our teeth, to the four baby emus we slowed down to let cross on a deserted highway.

He abused Waks for about two years, until 1990.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/feb/16/manny-waks-i-was-the-yeshivah-troublemaker-i-hope-now-everyone-can-see-why\">Manny Waks: I'm the 'troublemaker' who blew the whistle on Jewish abuse scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1992 Cyprys pleaded guilty to an indecent assault perpetrated against another child and was placed on a good behaviour bond for a period of three years, with no conviction recorded against him.</p> <p>In 2013 a Melbourne jury found Cyprys guilty of five charges of rape against the same child. Following the jury\u2019s decision, Cyprys pleaded guilty to a further 12 offences of child sexual abuse against other children.</p> <p>While victims of Cyprys have sued the Yeshivah centre, Waks is the first victim to sue Cyprys directly. The damages awarded to Waks by Melbourne supreme court justice Jacinta Forbes include $200,000 in general damages, $37,348 in medical and other expenses, and $541,822 in loss of past and future earning capacity.</p> <p>\u201cThe occurrence of offending is such that by its occurrence it has led to hurt and humiliation and to psychiatric injury,\u201d Forbes said in her judgment. \u201cHe [Waks] describes days where he has a sense of paralysis and is unable to function at any level \u2026 Presently he contrasts times of being able to be productive giving him a sense of empowerment with other times of feeling futility and turmoil.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016 Waks, who now lives in Israel, established Kol v\u2019Oz, an advocacy and support group for survivors of childhood sexual abuse in the global Jewish community. He described the judgment as a \u201cmilestone in my personal journey\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was determined to pursue justice against Cyprys in every way that I could \u2013 this serial paedophile has never expressed remorse or taken responsibility for his destructive abuse against so many children,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWorse, he has forced some of his victims to endure further trauma, myself included, by contesting matters in court and in other ways. The two primary reasons for pursuing this case were justice and accountability.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fully aware that most victims and survivors of child sexual abuse never achieve any justice. I feel blessed and empowered to have managed to hold Cyprys to account \u2013 both criminally and civilly \u2013 and to hold to account Yeshivah civilly for facilitating my abuse, then covering it up and trying to intimidate me and my family due to my pursuit of justice.\u201d</p> <p>Waks also alleges he was abused by the son of a senior rabbi, who he is separately pursuing in a civil case. He has also been an active spokesman as the CEO of Kol v\u2019Oz for victims in the case against Malka Leifer, a former principal at the ultra orthodox Adass Israel girls school in Melbourne who left Australia for Israel in 2008 after child abuse allegations against her were first raised. Her alleged victims have been fighting for her return to Victoria ever since, and she is facing 74 charges relating to allegations of indecent assault and rape.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/former-melbourne-principal-wanted-over-abuse-allegations-to-remain-free-in-israel\">Former Melbourne principal wanted over abuse allegations to remain free in Israel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday the extradition fight was further delayed when judge Chana Lomp from the Jerusalem district court accepted a request by Leifer\u2019s legal team to allow them to bring two psychiatrists previously brought in testify on Leifer\u2019s behalf. Those psychiatrists will challenge the findings of a recent psychiatric panel that Leifer is faking illnesses and that she is fit to face justice.

      "bodyText": "A child abuse victim who blew the whistle on abuse within the Orthodox Chabad sect of Judaism in Australia has been awarded $804,170 in damages in a civil case brought against his perpetrator and serial abuser, David Cyprys, in Melbourne. Manny Waks was about 13 years old when he was first abused by Cyprys at the Elwood synagogue, and he was also abused at the Chabad Yeshivah centre in Melbourne. Cyprys held many roles within Yeshivah including caretaker, security guard, locksmith and martial arts instructor, and he also ran youth camps. He abused Waks for about two years, until 1990. In 1992 Cyprys pleaded guilty to an indecent assault perpetrated against another child and was placed on a good behaviour bond for a period of three years, with no conviction recorded against him. In 2013 a Melbourne jury found Cyprys guilty of five charges of rape against the same child. Following the jury\u2019s decision, Cyprys pleaded guilty to a further 12 offences of child sexual abuse against other children. While victims of Cyprys have sued the Yeshivah centre, Waks is the first victim to sue Cyprys directly. The damages awarded to Waks by Melbourne supreme court justice Jacinta Forbes include $200,000 in general damages, $37,348 in medical and other expenses, and $541,822 in loss of past and future earning capacity. \u201cThe occurrence of offending is such that by its occurrence it has led to hurt and humiliation and to psychiatric injury,\u201d Forbes said in her judgment. \u201cHe [Waks] describes days where he has a sense of paralysis and is unable to function at any level \u2026 Presently he contrasts times of being able to be productive giving him a sense of empowerment with other times of feeling futility and turmoil.\u201d In 2016 Waks, who now lives in Israel, established Kol v\u2019Oz, an advocacy and support group for survivors of childhood sexual abuse in the global Jewish community. He described the judgment as a \u201cmilestone in my personal journey\u201d. \u201cI was determined to pursue justice against Cyprys in every way that I could \u2013 this serial paedophile has never expressed remorse or taken responsibility for his destructive abuse against so many children,\u201d he said. \u201cWorse, he has forced some of his victims to endure further trauma, myself included, by contesting matters in court and in other ways. The two primary reasons for pursuing this case were justice and accountability. \u201cI\u2019m fully aware that most victims and survivors of child sexual abuse never achieve any justice. I feel blessed and empowered to have managed to hold Cyprys to account \u2013 both criminally and civilly \u2013 and to hold to account Yeshivah civilly for facilitating my abuse, then covering it up and trying to intimidate me and my family due to my pursuit of justice.\u201d Waks also alleges he was abused by the son of a senior rabbi, who he is separately pursuing in a civil case. He has also been an active spokesman as the CEO of Kol v\u2019Oz for victims in the case against Malka Leifer, a former principal at the ultra orthodox Adass Israel girls school in Melbourne who left Australia for Israel in 2008 after child abuse allegations against her were first raised. Her alleged victims have been fighting for her return to Victoria ever since, and she is facing 74 charges relating to allegations of indecent assault and rape. On Tuesday the extradition fight was further delayed when judge Chana Lomp from the Jerusalem district court accepted a request by Leifer\u2019s legal team to allow them to bring two psychiatrists previously brought in testify on Leifer\u2019s behalf. Those psychiatrists will challenge the findings of a recent psychiatric panel that Leifer is faking illnesses and that she is fit to face justice. These additional psychiatric cross-examinations will begin on 12 March. Waks described the decision as one that \u201cmakes a mockery of the Israeli legal system\u201d. \u201cJudge Lomp herself appointed this latest psychiatric panel, which has made a unanimous, unequivocal decision; that Leifer is faking her illness and that she is in fact fit to face justice,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy on earth does Judge Lomp need to hear from these psychiatrists again? Why is there a need to continue to delay this prolonged farcical case? We continue to stand with the courageous victims and will do everything we can to ensure justice ultimately prevails.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Wednesday\u2019s blog: Mike Bloomberg has plunged into another controversy over his past comments \u2014 this time after newly uncovered video from last year showed him using dehumanizing language to describe trans people. The billionaire former mayor of New York will face his competitors on the debate stage for the first time tomorrow in Las Vegas. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Joe Biden have all singled out Bloomberg today, critiquing his record on race and policing, as well as his self-funded campaign. Ahead of the Nevada caucuses this week, Sanders held a double-digit lead over his competitors, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Another poll, from NBC and the Wall Street Journal also found Sanders in the lead, but has been criticized for appearing to leave Warren off a question that gauged candidates\u2019 chances of winning a general election against Donald Trump. The president falsely claimed he was \u201cthe chief law enforcement officer\u201d of the US. Earlier today he commuted the sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who has served seven years in prison on corruption charges after being caught on tape trying to sell a US Senate seat. Trump also pardoned former New York police commissioner Bernard Kerik and financier Michael Milken. Trump condemned what he called a \u201cfraudulent investigation\u201d into Roger Stone though he did not indicate whether he would pardon the longtime ally who was convicted of lying to Congress and obstructing Trump-Russia inquiry Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign will ask for a partial recount of the Iowa caucus results, following state Democratic Party\u2019s recanvass. The recanvass updates reported results, but it doesn\u2019t correct math errors. It appeared to narrow the gap between Sanders and Pete Buttigieg even further. \u201cWhile it is clear that Sen. Sanders won the popular vote in Iowa by 6,000 votes, the recanvass process reduced the State Delegate Equivalent deficit by 97 percent,\u201d said Sanders\u2019 adviser Jeff Weaver. \u201cWe now believe a recount will give Sen. Sanders enough State Delegate Equivalents to put him over the top by that metric as well. We want to thank the people of Iowa, our supporters, our volunteers and everyone who made this possible.\u201d The Iowa Democrats began a recanvass at the request of Sanders and Buttigieg\u2019s campaigns. Although the party awarded Buttigieg the most delegates, the AP has still not declared a winner. The rollout of the results has been delayed due to issues with reporting and collecting data on election night, and errors in the complex math required to calculate the outcomes. Warren isn\u2019t the only candidate to single out Bloomberg. In response to news that the billionaire former mayor would sell his company if elected president, Joe Biden\u2019s campaign pointed out that Bloomberg once said he\u2019d sell his company if he ran for president. Elizabeth Warren has been on the offensive against Mike Bloomberg, with her account tweeting critiques of the former New York mayor throughout the day in what could be a preview of tomorrow\u2019s debate in Las Vegas. The Massachusetts senator had hit Bloomberg on his policing policies, and the fact that he is using his vast wealth to fund his own campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame Mike Bloomberg can buy his way into the debate,\u201d Warren said in one of her targeted tweets. Bloomberg is surging in polls, even as Warren\u2019s support has lagged. In Nevada, where Warren had one of the earliest and strongest campaigns, she\u2019s banking on a strong showing of support at the caucuses to boost her back up. Tomorrow, she\u2019ll and the other Democratic contenders face off for the first time against Bloomberg who qualified to participate in the Las Vegas debate after the Democratic National Committee relaxed its qualification requirements. Andrew Yang has dropped out of the Democratic primaries, but some of his supporters are continuing to carry the torch for him in Nevada. Over the weekend, #StillVotingYang trended on Twitter, as thousands of supporters said the entrepreneur remained their top choice even though he suspended his campaign. The mayor of Chicago said Donald Trump\u2019s decision to commute the sentence of the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, \u201csends the wrong message\u201d. Blagojevich has served seven years in prison on corruption charges. He was caught on tape trying to sell a US Senate seat. Lori Lightfoot, the mayor of Chicago said that commuting Blagojevich\u2019s sentence \u201cwould be controversial under any president, but President Trump embodies the worst in public leadership through his brazen disrespect for the rule of law and good governance\u201d. Oddly, though the NBC/WSJ poll asked voters to weigh in on a theoretical race between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar, it didn\u2019t test a matchup between the president and Elizabeth Warren. Warren ranked fourth among voters who participated in the same poll, above Buttigieg and Klobuchar. Mike Bloomberg said he would sell Bloomberg LP if he were elected president, according to his advisor. Bloomberg would put the company into a bling trust, and the trustee would sell it, adviser Tim O\u2019Brien told the AP. Proceeds from the sale would go to Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable arm of the former New York mayor\u2019s business. \u201cWe want to be 180 degrees apart from Donald Trump around financial conflicts of interest,\u201d O\u2019Brien told the AP. \u201cWe think it\u2019s one of the biggest stains on the presidency, and Trump\u2019s record is his refusal to disengage himself in his own financial interests. And we want to be very transparent and clean and clear with voters about where Mike is on these things.\u201d Bloomberg retained ownership of his company while serving as New York mayor. A new poll finds Bernie Sanders would win against Mike Bloomberg in a two-way race. When asked how they\u2019d vote if they had to choose between Sanders and Bloomberg, 57% of Democratic primary voters polled chose the former. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has cast the primaries has a \u201ctwo-man\u201d race between the former New York mayor and the Vermont senator. According to the poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, Sanders also did best in matchups between the Democratic candidates and Donald Trump. A newly uncovered video from a forum in March 2019 shows Bloomberg saying that trans rights were about \u201csome guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter, that\u2019s not a winning formula for most people\u201d, according to a report by Buzzfeed News. The revelation comes on the same day that Bloomberg\u2019s campaign released a video touting the former New York mayor\u2019s record on LGBTQ+ issues, Buzzfeed notes. Bloomberg\u2019s sensitivity was far less apparent at a forum hosted by the Bermuda Business Development Agency on March 21, 2019, in Manhattan, where Bloomberg derided Democratic candidates for talking about transgender protections. \u201cIf your conversation during a presidential election is about some guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter, that\u2019s not a winning formula for most people,\u201d he said. Bloomberg made a similar remark about a \u201cman wearing a dress\u201d in 2016, but his comments uncovered Tuesday \u2014 remarks he made less than a year ago \u2014 came amid the early stages of the 2020 Democratic primary. The video was posted to YouTube shortly after the March event, but has received few views. Bloomberg was not a candidate for president at the time, but announced his campaign just eight months after he made the remarks. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands: Trump falsely claimed he was \u201cthe chief law enforcement officer\u201d of the US, a title that actually belongs to attorney general William Barr. Trump commuted the sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who has served seven years in prison on corruption charges after being caught on tape trying to sell a US Senate seat. The Blagojevich commutation was one in a series of acts of clemency from Trump, who also pardoned former New York police commissioner Bernard Kerik and financier Michael Milken. The sentencing of former Trump associate Roger Stone will take place on Thursday, as scheduled, while Stone\u2019s legal team continues to push for a new trial. Trump appeared to indicate his support for granting Stone a new trial in a series of tweets quoting a Fox News analyst. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign has responded to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s earlier comment that he has concerns about Sanders\u2019 ability to win in a general election against Trump. The Sanders campaign pointed to the candidate\u2019s formidable fundraising operation and popularity with people of color, particularly Latinx voters, as evidence of the Vermont senator\u2019s broad appeal. But some of Sanders\u2019 critics fear he will see his polling numbers dangerously slide once the Trump campaign starts focusing on the self-described democratic socialist. Trump himself appears to relish the idea of facing Sanders and has repeatedly accused the Democratic party of trying to prevent Sanders from winning the nomination, although he has offered no evidence for that claim. A new poll from Maine shows Republican senator Susan Collins locked in a close race with her expected Democratic opponent, state House speaker Sara Gideon. The Colby College poll found that 42% of Maine voters support Collins, compared to 43% who support Gideon. In comparison, Collins won reelection in 2014 with more than 68% of the vote. The poll also found that Collins\u2019 vote to acquit Trump in the Senate impeachment trial is hurting her with the state\u2019s many independent voters. Of the independents polled, 39% said Collins\u2019 acquittal vote made them less likely to support her, compared to 13% who said it made them more likely to support her. Democrats consider Collins\u2019 seat to be one of their top pick-up opportunities as they attempt to take control of the Senate, which would require flipping four Republican seats (or three if they can also win the White House). In a pair of tweets, Trump accused Mike Bloomberg of \u201cillegally buying\u201d the Democratic presidential nomination as the billionaire candidate spends hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising. Some of Bloomberg\u2019s critics have raised concerns about the former New York mayor receiving endorsements from lawmakers who have benefitted from his political donations, but those endorsements do not run afoul of campaign finance laws. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign has released its first television ad in South Carolina ahead of the state\u2019s primary next week. The ad features Richland county council vice-chair Dalhi Myers, who swung to Sanders after initially supporting Joe Biden. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more important than defeating Donald Trump,\u201d Myers says in the ad. \u201cInitially I was a Joe Biden supporter. I switched from the Biden campaign to the Sanders campaign because I want to see the kind of lines around the building that we saw in 2008.\u201d South Carolina polls have shown Biden in the lead, but Sanders has been on the rise after his strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire. In a new statement, five House Republicans from Illinois criticized Trump\u2019s decision to commute the sentence of the state\u2019s former governor, Rod Blagojevich. The Republican lawmakers said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Trump\u2019s commutation of Blagojevich, who was described as \u201cthe face of public corruption in Illinois.\u201d \u201cHistory will not judge Rod Blagojevich well,\u201d the statement concludes. At least two of the lawmakers reportedly appealed directly to Trump not to commute the sentence of the former Democratic governor, who was caught on tape trying to sell a US Senate seat. Attending a campaign event in Nevada, Pete Buttigieg echoed a voter\u2019s concern that Bernie Sanders would lose in a general election to Trump. Sanders\u2019 campaign has pushed back against such \u201celectability\u201d complaints by pointing to head-to-head polling showing the Vermont senator is ahead of Trump. But some of Sanders\u2019 critics have predicted he will see his numbers decrease once Trump\u2019s campaign starts turning its fire on the self-described democratic socialist. Three senior congressional Republicans -- Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate judiciary committee chairman Lindsey Graham -- have issued a statement in support of attorney general William Barr. The statement describes Barr as \u201ca man of the highest character and unquestionable integrity\u201d and dismisses calls for the attorney general to resign. \u201cSuggestions from outside groups that the Attorney General has fallen short of the responsibilities of his office are unfounded,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThe Attorney General has shown that he is committed without qualification to securing equal justice under law for all Americans.\u201d More than 1,100 former Justice Department employees have signed a letter calling on Barr to resign over his handling of the case of former Trump associate Roger Stone. The Republicans\u2019 statement concludes, \u201cWe expect that, as always, efforts to intimidate the Attorney General will fall woefully short.\u201d In the White House\u2019s statement on the pardons of Bernard Kerik and Michael Milken, a number of prominent figures from conservative media and the Trump administration are mentioned as supporters of the pardons. In addition to the commutation of Rod Blagojevich, Trump has also offered a pardon to former New York police commissioner Bernard Kerik, who pleaded guilty to eight felony charges in 2009. Kerik confessed to tax fraud and lying to White House officials and served more than three years in prison. In a statement, Kerik, who appeared on Fox News last night, thanked Trump for the pardon. Trump has also approved a pardon for Michael Milken, the well-known financier who became the face of financial scandals in the 1980\u2019s and was convicted for racketeering and fraud. In his comments to reporters at Joint Base Andrews, Trump said he had not considered pardoning Roger Stone, but he complained that his former associate was being treated \u201cvery unfairly.\u201d The president then made the eye-popping (and false) claim that he is \u201cthe chief law enforcement officer of the United States.\u201d That is, of course, not true: Trump also did not rule out the possibility of weighing in on Stone\u2019s case in the future. \u201cThe attorney general is a man with great integrity,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI chose not to be involved. I\u2019m allowed to be involved. I could be involved if I want to be.\u201d Barr complained in an interview last week that Trump\u2019s tweets about the Stone case \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job.\u201d On that point, Trump actually did not disagree. \u201cI do make his job harder,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s working against a lot of people who don\u2019t want to see good things happen in my opinion.\u201d Speaking to reporters on the tarmac before boarding Air Force One, Trump confirmed that he has commuted the sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. \u201cHe served eight years in jail. That\u2019s a long time,\u201d Trump said of Blagojevich, who was originally sentenced to 14 years on corruption charges. The president said he didn\u2019t know Blagojevich \u201cvery well,\u201d even though the former governor was briefly a contestant on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d while Trump was its host. But Trump said he had seen Blagojevich\u2019s wife on television, and he expressed sympathy for their children not being able to see their imprisoned father. \u201cIt was a prosecution by the same people -- Comey, Fitzpatrick -- the same group,\u201d Trump said, referring to former FBI director James Comey, who was fired by the president. Comey\u2019s close friend Patrick Fitzgerald, the former US attorney, led the prosecution against Blagojevich. But again, Blagojevich was caught on tape trying to sell the US Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama when he became president. Mike Bloomberg released a raft of proposals to strengthen Wall Street regulation on Tuesday as he shapes up for his first Democratic presidential debate. Bloomberg is expected to face a hostile reception from his rival candidates, and his new proposals will head off some attacks - though probably not many - by bringing his policies closer to those of the rest of the field. Among his proposals: Bloomberg would toughen tests intended to determine whether banks can withstand an economic downturn; impose a tax on financial transactions; restore consumer protections and strengthen the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), established under Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s leadership. \u201cThe stock market is at an all-time high, but almost all of the gains are going to a small number of people,\u201d said Bloomberg. No doubt Warren et al will be keen to point that he is one of those people. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump sent a series of tweets indicating support for a new trial in the case of his former associate Roger Stone, whose sentencing is scheduled to take place on Thursday. Mike Bloomberg has qualified for tomorrow\u2019s debate, with a national poll showing the billionaire former New York mayor climbing to second place behind Bernie Sanders. Trump reportedly plans to commute the sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of trying to sell the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. ABC News has more on Trump\u2019s expected commutation of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich: Blagojevich, a Democrat, has been a resident of the Federal Correctional Institution, in Englewood -- near Littleton, Colorado -- since March 15, 2012, where he is known as Inmate No. 40892-424. His date for expected release remains 2024, factoring in two years of credit for good behavior. ... In 2009, he appeared on NBC\u2019s \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 a reality TV show then hosted by Trump, alongside tenured reality show performers like Sharon Osborne and Bret Michaels. ... A federal jury in Chicago previously convicted the former Illinois governor of attempting to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated when President Obama was elected in 2008, among the 17 guilty counts against him. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Trump reportedly intends to commute the sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who has been in prison since 2012 on corruption charges. The president has previously toyed with the idea of a commutation for Blagojevich, who was caught on tape trying to sell the Senate seat left open by Barack Obama. Trump tweeted this back in August: The White House announced earlier today that Trump would grant clemency to Eddie DeBartolo Jr, the former owners of the San Francisco 49ers who pleaded guilty in 1998 to failing to report a bribe from an elected official. According to a new poll, about two-thirds of American voters have seen a television ad from Mike Bloomberg. In comparison, about half of voters have seen a television ad from Trump, and 40% have seen one of Bernie Sanders\u2019 ads. Bloomberg has spent more than $300 million on campaign advertising, surpassing Barack Obama\u2019s ad spending during the entire 2012 race. CNN dug up a 2016 clip of Mike Bloomberg denouncing the democratic socialism supported by Bernie Sanders by claiming young Americans are simply confused about the meaning of the term. \u201cYoung people listened to ... Bernie Sanders, and they said, \u2018Yeah, democratic, that\u2019s good. Socialism, yeah, that\u2019s that social media stuff.\u2019 Because our kids no longer learn civics in school. They no longer study western history. They no longer read western literature. \u201cWe are trying to change and dumb down the system, and if you don\u2019t know what happened in the past, you\u2019re going to have to relive it.\u201d Sanders and Bloomberg have intensified their attacks on each other in recent days, as national polls show Sanders leading the presidential field while Bloomberg is on the rise. In a new Medium post, Democratic senator Chris Murphy described meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy over the weekend. Murphy said he and Republican senator Ron Johnson met with Zelenskiy in Kyiv before attending the Munich security conference. During the meeting, Murphy expressed his displeasure about Rudy Giulaini\u2019s efforts in Ukraine to get dirt on Joe Biden, which reportedly continued as Trump\u2019s impeachment trial unfolded. Murphy writes: Zelensky clearly doesn\u2019t really want to talk about this, and I don\u2019t blame him. But he tells us that, though Giuliani has long wanted a meeting with him, he has always stayed clear of Giuliani and intends to keep it that way. He has no intention of getting involved in American politics any more than he already has, unintentionally. \u2018As an actor, I always dreamed of becoming famous in America,\u2019 he tells us, breaking away from Ukrainian and speaking to us in English. \u2018And now I\u2019m famous in America. But not the way I wanted!\u2019 Zelenskiy\u2019s conversations with Trump were at the center of the president\u2019s impeachment, and the controversy has caused issues for the Ukrainian leader back home. US district judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is overseeing the trial of former Trump associate Roger Stone, said his sentencing would take place on Thursday, as planned. There had been questions raised about a potential delay in sentencing, as Stone\u2019s lawyers push for a new trial due to the alleged anti-Trump bias of one of the jurors. However, Jackson said the sentencing should occur as scheduled, while noting that its execution may be delayed because of the concerns raised by Stone\u2019s team. The White House has just announced Trump is granting clemency to Eddie DeBartolo Jr, the former owners of the San Francisco 49ers. In 1998, DeBartolo pleaded guilty to not reporting a bribe from Edwin Edwards, the former governor of Louisiana. The Pentagon is pushing back against a report that senator Lindsey Graham told defense secretary Mark Esper he would \u201cmake your life hell\u201d if the US withdrew troops from the Sahel region in Africa. NBC News reports: Senators and members of the House met with Esper on the margins of the Munich Security Conference. Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who are members of the Foreign Relations Committee, led the charge, said the four people, telling Esper that Congress would not support a U.S. troop withdrawal from the Sahel region in Africa and laying out the reasons to keep the troop presence there. At one point, Graham warned Esper that there would be consequences if the Pentagon withdrew all troops from the region. Graham told Esper that he could \u2018make your life hell,\u2019 according to the four people. One member present said Graham, Coons and several other lawmakers laid out their case \u2018forcefully.\u2019 But the press secretary of the Pentagon pushed back against the report, claiming Graham never made the comment. Hours after qualifying for the next debate, Michael Bloomberg released a set of proposals aimed at reforming the criminal justice system. The billionaire former mayor of New York is calling for a $22.5 billion investment to cut the US prison population in half by 2030. Bloomberg is also proposing spending $1 billion on programs for young men of color. The release of the plan comes as Bloomberg has faced renewed scrutiny over his \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policy as mayor of New York. Criminal justice reform advocates have said the policy unfairly targeted men of color. Bloomberg began his presidential campaign by apologizing for stop and frisk, but many of his critics have said that he has not done enough to reckon with the damage the policy caused. Addressing supporters in Washington state yesterday, Bernie Sanders called stop and frisk a \u201cracist\u201d policy that caused communities of color to \u201clive in fear and humiliation.\u201d With Michael Bloomberg climbing in the polls, the billionaire candidate\u2019s campaign is going on the offensive against frontrunner Bernie Sanders. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign manager suggested the opposition research on Sanders would be \u201cdisqualifying\u201d: One of Sanders\u2019 advisers replied by criticizing Bloomberg for his past support for the Iraq war and his record on criminal justice: The good polling news for Michael Bloomberg just keeps on coming this morning. A new poll from Oklahoma, which will also hold its primary on Super Tuesday, shows Bloomberg leading the field with 20%. The billionaire candidate is trailed by Bernie Sanders at 14% and Joe Biden at 12%. Elizabeth Warren, who grew up in Oklahoma, hit 8%. In addition to qualifying for the next Democratic debate, Michael Bloomberg also got some good news from a Virginia poll out this morning. According to the Monmouth University survey, Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders are tied among likely voters in Virginia, which will hold its primary on Super Tuesday. Bloomberg and Sanders both hit 22% in the poll, trailed by Joe Biden at 18% and Pete Buttigieg at 11%. No other candidate registered in the double digits. Bloomberg\u2019s stategy of skipping the early voting states to focus on the 14 states that will hold contests on March 3 appears to be paying dividends. The billionaire candidate was campaigning in Virginia this weekend, and he has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising across the country. But there\u2019s still plenty of time for things to change before March 3. Only 25% of Virginia\u2019s likely primary voters said they were firmly set on their chosen candidate. Trump\u2019s comments come as a conference call on the status of the Stone case is expected to take place today. US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued the unusual order for the call after the entire four-person prosecution team quit following following attorney general William Barr\u2019s intervention to rescind their recommendation of a seven-to-nine year sentence for Stone. Trump goes on to recap some of his grievances against the Mueller investigation, concluding: \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t President, I\u2019d be suing everyone all over the place ... BUT MAYBE I STILL WILL. WITCH HUNT!\u201d Donald Trump is obviously keeping a keen eye on any developments in Roger Stone\u2019s sentencing \u2013 for which there is a hearing by telephone scheduled today (see earlier). This morning the president is focusing on calls for a new trial 0f Stone based on allegations that the foreperson of the original trial had anti-Trump views. The president has been widely criticised for interfering in the sentencing. More than 1,000 former US justice department officials, including some of the top government lawyers in the country, have called on attorney general William Barr to resign over his handling of the case. The justice department reduced its sentencing recommendation for Stone, a Trump ally, after the president tweeted calling it \u201chorrible and very unfair\u201d. Quoting Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano, Trump tweeted today: Stone will be sentenced for obstruction, false statements and witness tampering on 20 February. The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will waive federal contracting laws to speed construction of his signature border wall at the US-Mexico border, the Associated Press reports. The Department of Homeland Security said waiving procurement regulations will allow 177 miles (283 kilometers) of wall to be built more quickly in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The 10 waived laws include requirements for having open competition, justifying selections and receiving all bonding from a contractor before any work can begin. The acting homeland security secretary, Chad Wolf, is exercising authority under a 2005 law that gives him sweeping powers to waive laws for building border barriers. \u201cWe hope that will accelerate some of the construction that\u2019s going along the Southwest border,\u201d Wolf told Fox News Channel\u2019s Fox &amp; Friends on Tuesday. Secretaries under President Donald Trump have issued 16 waivers, and President George W Bush issued five, but Tuesday\u2019s announcement marks the first time that waivers have applied to federal procurement rules. Previously they were used to waive environmental impact reviews. The Trump administration said it expects the waivers will allow 94 miles (150 kilometers) of wall to be built this year, bringing the Republican president closer to his pledge of about 450 miles (720 kilometers) since taking office and making it one of his top domestic priorities. It said the other 83 miles (133 kilometers) covered by the waivers may get built this year. Politico has more on Bloomberg\u2019s preparations to join the debate stage for the first time. He is not known as a brilliant orator, and many of his fellow Democrats may relish the chance to play up his wealth, his past as a Republican, and the controversies about racism and sexism that have blown up in the past couple of weeks. His rivalry with Sanders is becoming increasingly bitter, and the Vermont senator is unlikely to pull his punches, telling a crowd earlier this week: \u201cNow, Mike Bloomberg is struggling \u2014 he\u2019s down to his last $60bn. Hey, life is hard, you know \u2014 food prices going up, housing going up. How are you going to make it on $60bn? Mike is trying.\u201d As Politico reports: Top Bloomberg lieutenants and policy experts have been preparing him for what would be the most unscripted event yet of his three-month-old campaign. As the prep sessions have ramped up, increasing in frequency, his team is working to get him to project comfort and composure in the line of fire, while portraying him as the toughest Democrat to take on Donald Trump. Howard Wolfson, the veteran Democratic strategist who joined Bloomberg\u2019s orbit in 2009 after working on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential race, is playing the role of Sanders; Julie Wood, Bloomberg\u2019s national press secretary, is depicting Elizabeth Warren; and senior advisers Marc La Vorgna and Marcia Hale are stand-ins for Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, respectively \u2026 \u201cHe\u2019s been super underwhelming on the stump so far. [I] think people seeing him up close; he could suffer from a little \u2018Biden syndrome.\u2019 Namely, he\u2019s not as impressive when he\u2019s not produced and he\u2019s also pushing 80, which nobody seems to be talking about,\u201d said New York-based political consultant Neal Kwatra, who is unaffiliated in the Democratic presidential primary. Bloomberg just turned 78. The poll that has opened the door for Bloomberg also has good news for Sanders, however. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey shows the Vermont socialist senator well at the head of the field, with 31% \u2013 up nine points since the last poll by this company in early December. Bloomberg comes in second with 19% (up 15). Biden is on 15% (down nine), Warren on 12% (down five), Klobuchar on 9% (up five) and Buttigieg on 8% (down five). The poll also asked which Democrats would beat Donald Trump in the popular vote in November, finding that all the main contenders would. Their leads ranged from Biden\u2019s six points, to Bloomberg\u2019s four points, Sanders\u2019 three points, Buttigieg\u2019s and Klobuchar\u2019s two points, and Warren\u2019s one point. The election is decided based on the electoral college, however, not the popular vote. In 2016 Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3m votes, but still won the election, thanks to his strength at picking up delegates in key states. Bloomberg\u2019s appearance on the debate stage is highly controversial. The Democrats changed their qualification rules just weeks ago, scrapping the need for participants to reach a threshold of donations. The billionaire Bloomberg is funding his own campaign, and the rule change was widely seen as a move by the Democratic establishment to allow the centrist former mayor to take part. Bernie Sanders has been particularly scathing about the change, noting: \u201cSuddenly a guy comes in who has not campaigned one bit in Iowa or New Hampshire \u2026 but he\u2019s worth $55bn and I guess if you\u2019re worth $55bn you can get the rules changed for a debate.\u201d Michael Bloomberg has qualified for tomorrow\u2019s Democratic debate in Las Vegas \u2013 the first time he will face his opponents on the debate stage. The former New York mayor needed four poll ratings of 10% or above to qualify. A poll from NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist released on Tuesday showed Bloomberg with 19% support. Good morning. The presidential candidates are back on the campaign trail today, with Democrats Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg in Nevada ahead of Saturday\u2019s caucuses there. Sanders, Buttigieg and Klobuchar will all appear on CNN tonight for town hall-style interviews. It\u2019s also the deadline at midnight ET tonight for candidates to qualify for the next Democratic debate, which takes place in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Sanders and Warren have all qualified \u2013 but a change in the rules means Michael Bloomberg may qualify to appear for the first time. He needs to reach 10% in one more poll to make it. The Democrats controversially scrapped a rule that meant participants had to reach a donor threshold, allegedly to allow the self-funding billionaire former New York mayor to take part. Bloomberg \u2013 who joins the race in earnest on Super Tuesday, 3 March \u2013 has come under fire over the past week for allegedly racist policing policies as New York mayor and for alleged sexist and misogynistic comments as a businessman. His fellow Democrats stuck the knife in further yesterday, with Biden saying: \u201c$60bn can buy you a lot of advertising, but it can\u2019t erase your record.\u201d Sanders, the leftwing Vermont senator who is now the frontrunner in the race, seems to be pulling ahead in polling in Nevada, with the ailing centrist Biden now nine points behind him in polling averages. The former vice-president has also plunged in national Democratic polling following his poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire this month, leaving Sanders in the lead but with centrists Bloomberg and Buttigieg gradually climbing. Warren, Sanders\u2019 rival on the left, seems to be on the slide too. Like Iowa, Nevada holds caucuses rather than primaries \u2013 complicated, hours-long public meetings with multiple rounds of balloting. (Here\u2019s more on how they work.) But after the shambles in Iowa where an app malfunctioned, the Nevada Democratic party has said it won\u2019t use the same technology. But it\u2019s not clear what they will use instead. \u201cReports suggest the party has decided to abandon the app for a combination of Google forms and scannable paper ballots as a backup,\u201d writes Kari Paul. Donald Trump is heading west too, meeting the LA 2028 Olympic Organizing Committee and supporters in Beverley Hills and then heading to Las Vegas. Trump waded into controversy last week when his attorney general, William Barr, criticised him for interfering in criminal cases such as that of his friend Roger Stone, who is due to be sentenced for obstruction, false statements and witness tampering on 20 February. There is a pre-sentence hearing on that case today. Here\u2019s some of the US politics news you may have missed from yesterday:",

Singer, best known as a proponent of the \u201ceffective altruism movement\u201d, has previously written that parents should be allowed to euthanise disabled babies if they wish to. In his 1979 book Practical Ethics, Singer included conditions like Down syndrome, spina bifida and haemophilia among disabilities that make \u201cthe child\u2019s life prospects significantly less promising than those of a normal child\u201d. He has argued that parents of children with these conditions should be allowed to end their child\u2019s life. \u201cThe position taken here does not imply that it would be better that no people born with severe disabilities should survive; it implies only that the parents of such infants should be able to make this decision,\u201d he wrote. Singer has argued his views do not apply to adults living with disabilities, but only to newborn infants, who lack \u201crationality, autonomy and self-consciousness\u201d. On Wednesday, the venue for his upcoming Auckland event announced they had cancelled their venue hire agreement after \u201cconcerns raised by the public and local media\u201d. The 73-year-old had been due to speak on 14 June at Auckland\u2019s SkyCity. \u201cWhilst SkyCity supports the right of free speech, some of the themes promoted by this speaker do not reflect our values of diversity and inclusivity,\u201d the venue told The Guardian. The promoter of the event, Suzi Jamil, said the philosopher would be immediately looking for a new venue for the event. Dr Huhana Hickey, a legal academic and advocate for Multiple Sclerosis New Zealand, told NewsHub that Singer was \u201cnot an expert\u201d when it came to disability. The academic said she would protest his event but did not want it cancelled. \u201cHe has every right to freedom of speech, they have every right to host him,\u201d she said. \u201cI have every right to protest and to counter his speech around disability. \u201cHe\u2019s one of a kind when it comes to his expertise in animal rights, however he\u2019s not an expert in the area of disability\u201d.

But I\u2019ve chosen not to be involved.\u201d Trump said he was not considering pardoning Stone but complained that his former associate was being treated \u201cvery unfairly\u201d. Stone was convicted in November of a seven-count indictment that accused him of lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election. Prosecutors had recommended a tough sentence of between seven to nine years in federal prison, but Barr reversed that decision and recommended a less harsh punishment, prompting the entire prosecution team to resign from the case. Eric Holder, US attorney general under Barack Obama, said in a statement at the time that the conduct over Stone had \u201cput at risk the perceived \u2013 and real \u2013 neutral enforcement of our laws and, ultimately, endanger the fabric of our democracy\u201d. Barr later denied that Trump\u2019s Twitter denunciation of the sentencing recommendation had influenced his decision; in an interview with ABC News, Barr said he had not been asked by Trump to look into the case. But the highly unusual intervention has prompted widespread outrage. More than 2,000 former justice department employees have signed an open letter calling for Barr\u2019s resignation and expressing support of the four prosecutors. Jackson said Stone\u2019s sentencing would take place on Thursday, as planned. There had been questions raised about a potential delay in sentencing, as Stone\u2019s lawyers push for a new trial due to the allegations of anti-Trump bias of one of the jurors. However, Jackson said the sentencing should occur as scheduled, while noting that its implementation may be delayed because of concerns raised by Stone\u2019s team. Stone, 67, is the sixth former Trump aide to be convicted in cases prompted by Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. In their court filing last Monday, the prosecutors had argued that Stone \u2013 who was found guilty in November of seven crimes including obstruction of justice, witness tampering and lying to Congress \u2013 has shown \u201ccontempt for this court and the rule of law\u201d. But the following day Trump claimed in a tweet: \u201cThe real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them.

      "bodyText": "Mike Bloomberg has been plunged into fresh controversy over his comments on race and transgender people, as scrutiny intensifies over the presidential candidate\u2019s past remarks ahead of his Democratic debate debut. On Tuesday, a 2011 PBS interview resurfaced in which Bloomberg stated that there was an \u201cenormous cohort of black and Latino males\u201d who \u201cdon\u2019t know how to behave in the workplace\u201d. And separately, a newly uncovered video from March 2019 showed Bloomberg describing trans rights as being about \u201csome guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter\u201d. The comments re-emerged as the multibillionaire media mogul faces questions over his other past remarks on race and women, and as he secured a presence in the televised Democratic debates for the first time. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published on Tuesday shows Bloomberg with 19% support among Democrats for the presidential nomination, enough to join the debate stage alongside other leading contenders in Las Vegas on Wednesday. In the PBS interview, Bloomberg, who was then mayor of New York City, said he supported a program to boost employment prospects for minorities and lamented that \u201cblacks and Latinos score terribly in school testing compared to whites and Asians. If you look at our jails, it\u2019s predominantly minorities.\u201d Bloomberg said some progress had been made but \u201cnevertheless, there\u2019s this enormous cohort of black and Latino males, age, let\u2019s say, 16 to 25, that don\u2019t have jobs, don\u2019t have any prospects, don\u2019t know how to find jobs, don\u2019t know what their skillsets are, don\u2019t know how to behave in the workplace where they have to work collaboratively and collectively\u201d. The former mayor added that crime in New York City takes place in \u201cminority neighborhoods\u201d, with victims and perpetrators of crime \u201cvirtually all minorities\u201d. In a March 2019 video, first reported by BuzzFeed News, Bloomberg criticized Democrats for focusing on transgender rights, saying it was \u201cnot a winning formula for most people\u201d. \u201cIf your conversation during a presidential election is about some guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter, that\u2019s not a winning formula for most people. They care about healthcare, they care about education, they care about safety, and all of those kinds of things.\u201d The revelation comes on the same day Bloomberg\u2019s campaign released a video touting the former New York mayor\u2019s record on LGBTQ issues, BuzzFeed notes. Bloomberg has achieved solid polling numbers despite several previous interviews and comments coming to light that have been viewed as highly problematic. An audio clip of Bloomberg defending his \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d approach to policing in New York from 2015 featured the former mayor attributing 95% of murders to \u201cmale minorities, 16 to 25\u201d. He added: \u201cYou can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops.\u201d Bloomberg has previously apologized for the use of stop-and-frisk, saying it was \u201coverused\u201d in New York. His rivals for the Democratic nomination, in particular the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, have accused Bloomberg of being out of step with voters and guilty of attempting to buy the nomination via his vast wealth. Bloomberg will appear on stage in Wednesday\u2019s debate in Las Vegas alongside former vice-president Joe Biden, Sanders, senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar and the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg. Fellow billionaire and philanthropist Tom Steyer is still hoping to qualify. The Democratic National Committee recently changed its rules for how a candidate qualifies for the debate, opening the door for Bloomberg to be on stage and drawing the ire of some candidates who dropped out of the race for failing to make prior stages. The candidates were previously required to receive a certain number of campaign contributions to qualify, but Bloomberg, who is worth an estimated $60bn, is not taking donations. The primetime event will be a stark departure from Bloomberg\u2019s highly choreographed campaign. He has poured more than $300m into television advertising, a way to define himself for voters without facing criticism. Bloomberg has barely crossed paths on the trail with his fellow Democrats. He decided to skip the first four voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina in favor of focusing on the 14 states that vote on 3 March and the contests that come afterward.

      "body": "<p>J\u00fcrgen Klopp stood and watched the referee pull the yellow card from his pocket, a symbol of his frustration, while to his right Diego Simeone raised the roof. Up and down the touchline Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s manager went, wildly waving, clenching his fists, urging on the fans. Come on, he called, the coach conductor once more. Louder and louder they got, singing, flags waving, scarves whirling, all looking at him, all of them so alive. For Simeone it has never been just about the players; it is about the place. And this place was his, like never before.</p> <p>With two minutes left, victory was close and against the team Simeone said would go down in history and the man that led them, in whom he saw some of himself. Here Klopp and Simeone met for the first time. There was admiration but above all there was competition and few compete, tooth and bloody nail, like <em>El Cholo</em>. He\u2019s back \u2013 if he ever went away. Simeone resisted, Klopp made changes, but could find no response in the din, for all that they pressed. It seems odd to suggest they were overwhelmed, odder still to see Klopp powerless, but it seemed that way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/18/disjointed-liverpool-fall-to-atletico-madrid-and-sauls-early-strike\">Sa\u00fal's early strike gives Atl\u00e9tico Madrid first-leg edge over disjointed Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s bus had arrived through red smoke, led by white horses; their team arrived, led by the man in black. This place would be bursting, Simeone had said, and even before the game he saw he was right. By the end, it was better than even he dared expect. No doubt, no disconnect, just the Metropolitano building a history of its own, becoming a home. Atl\u00e9tico reclaimed this area from their opponents, European champions here last June.</p> <p>This was Atl\u00e9tico being Atl\u00e9tico, unleashed. Their manager even more so. Maybe what they had needed was to feel inferior, or hear that said. Then there could be clarity and they could do what they always did best: rebel. \u201cWe always compete against the big teams,\u201d Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez said. Here was enthusiasm in inferiority, a common cause. Asked what he made of the pessimism, Simeone had replied: \u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t see pessimism.\u201d And four minutes in they led, optimism let loose.</p> <p>Sa\u00fal\u2019s goals tend to be big ones and this match could not be have been bigger, the stadium erupting. Simeone had said Liverpool are more intense, more direct, more varied, better than those historic teams \u201cwe admired before\u201d. The warmth was reciprocated: these coaches have much in common, shared values, and they embraced pre-game, flashes lighting them up. Playing Atl\u00e9tico, Klopp had said, is the hardest thing in football. Liverpool\u2019s first team had not conceded in two months; now they had conceded in little over three minutes.</p> <p>Klopp stood, hands in pockets. Simeone ran and barely stopped all night. The technical areas here are big, but not big enough to contain him. \u201cPeople say I\u2019m emotional,\u201d Klopp said, \u201cif I\u2019m level four, he\u2019s 12. Wow. I\u2019m like the kindergarten cop against him.\u201d</p> <p>Down there, Simeone was the grizzly New York detective, roughing up the bad guys, wondering what the rule book ever did for us. Twelve to four was about right. It was also 1-0; how very Atl\u00e9tico, Diego distilled. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Diego saw the game because he was constantly animating the crowd,\u201d Klopp added.</p> <p>The Argentinian\u2019s heat map was deep red. Occasionally this season he has apparently lacked something, much like his team: less dynamic, less aggressive, belief dented. Unthinkably, at times he has conducted and the crowd haven\u2019t followed. Not this time. The communion was complete.

      "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp stood and watched the referee pull the yellow card from his pocket, a symbol of his frustration, while to his right Diego Simeone raised the roof. Up and down the touchline Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s manager went, wildly waving, clenching his fists, urging on the fans. Come on, he called, the coach conductor once more. Louder and louder they got, singing, flags waving, scarves whirling, all looking at him, all of them so alive. For Simeone it has never been just about the players; it is about the place. And this place was his, like never before. With two minutes left, victory was close and against the team Simeone said would go down in history and the man that led them, in whom he saw some of himself. Here Klopp and Simeone met for the first time. There was admiration but above all there was competition and few compete, tooth and bloody nail, like El Cholo. He\u2019s back \u2013 if he ever went away. Simeone resisted, Klopp made changes, but could find no response in the din, for all that they pressed. It seems odd to suggest they were overwhelmed, odder still to see Klopp powerless, but it seemed that way. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s bus had arrived through red smoke, led by white horses; their team arrived, led by the man in black. This place would be bursting, Simeone had said, and even before the game he saw he was right. By the end, it was better than even he dared expect. No doubt, no disconnect, just the Metropolitano building a history of its own, becoming a home. Atl\u00e9tico reclaimed this area from their opponents, European champions here last June. This was Atl\u00e9tico being Atl\u00e9tico, unleashed. Their manager even more so. Maybe what they had needed was to feel inferior, or hear that said. Then there could be clarity and they could do what they always did best: rebel. \u201cWe always compete against the big teams,\u201d Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez said. Here was enthusiasm in inferiority, a common cause. Asked what he made of the pessimism, Simeone had replied: \u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t see pessimism.\u201d And four minutes in they led, optimism let loose. Sa\u00fal\u2019s goals tend to be big ones and this match could not be have been bigger, the stadium erupting. Simeone had said Liverpool are more intense, more direct, more varied, better than those historic teams \u201cwe admired before\u201d. The warmth was reciprocated: these coaches have much in common, shared values, and they embraced pre-game, flashes lighting them up. Playing Atl\u00e9tico, Klopp had said, is the hardest thing in football. Liverpool\u2019s first team had not conceded in two months; now they had conceded in little over three minutes. Klopp stood, hands in pockets. Simeone ran and barely stopped all night. The technical areas here are big, but not big enough to contain him. \u201cPeople say I\u2019m emotional,\u201d Klopp said, \u201cif I\u2019m level four, he\u2019s 12. Wow. I\u2019m like the kindergarten cop against him.\u201d Down there, Simeone was the grizzly New York detective, roughing up the bad guys, wondering what the rule book ever did for us. Twelve to four was about right. It was also 1-0; how very Atl\u00e9tico, Diego distilled. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Diego saw the game because he was constantly animating the crowd,\u201d Klopp added. The Argentinian\u2019s heat map was deep red. Occasionally this season he has apparently lacked something, much like his team: less dynamic, less aggressive, belief dented. Unthinkably, at times he has conducted and the crowd haven\u2019t followed. Not this time. The communion was complete. He had called this a transitional year, sure, but \u201canyone who thinks transition means sitting in the sun waiting for the flowers to bloom doesn\u2019t know me\u201d. Oh, they know him, and this was him: beating a \u201cbetter\u201d team, like old times. Just when he thought he was out, they pull him back in. Simeone had come with a surprise. Parking the bus is a well-worn tactic, but the European opening blitz is too. They led, now they could retreat, resist. In Champions League knockout games under him, they had let in 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 and 0. Here was another zero for the sequence. They suffered for it, Simeone playing that out.
