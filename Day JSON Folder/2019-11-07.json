      "bodyText": "Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, is opening the door to a possible 2020 presidential campaign. Bloomberg announced earlier this year that he would not seek the Democratic nomination. But in a statement on Thursday afternoon, his political adviser Howard Wolfson said that Bloomberg was worried that the current crop of Democratic presidential candidates was \u201cnot well positioned\u201d to defeat Donald Trump. A Bloomberg adviser said the former mayor had not made a final decision on whether to run. But he is expected to file to get on the ballot in Alabama\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. The Alabama primary takes place on 3 March. Alabama has an early filing deadline and is among the states that vote on so-called Super Tuesday, the nickname for the large number of state contests held that day in the process to choose the Democratic party nominee to challenge Trump for the White House next November. He could file the necessary paperwork as early as this week, the New York Times reported. The entry of Bloomberg into the crowded Democratic field would be a huge disrupting influence and as a centrist and former Republican, an older billionaire with a political track record who, unusually, served three terms as mayor of New York City, he could be a huge threat to current frontrunner Joe Biden. The 77-year-old co-founded his eponymous financial information and media company Bloomberg in 1981 and is now worth an estimated $52bn, according to Forbes magazine, making him the ninth-richest person in the US and the 14th in the world. He studied at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard and joined the financial industry at Salomon Brothers in 1966. Bloomberg served as mayor of New York for 12 years and one of his best-known early actions was to ban smoking in bars in the city in 2003. He later became a strong advocate of gun control and in 2006 co-founded a campaign group against illegal firearms that drew the support of 1,000 mayors across the US. The group has since evolved into an organization called Everytown for Gun Safety. But he was also something of a divisive figure, especially economically, in New York, seen by critics as a relentless gentrifier who encouraged and incentivized countless huge development projects across the city while affordable housing became more scarce. Tourism to the city soared while he was in office and projects such as the popular High Line park appeared alongside shiny new skyscrapers. Social media broke out the \u201cOk Bloomer\u201d jokes on Thursday afternoon, a take on the popular Gen Z retort to anyone perceived to be a patronizing older person: \u201cOk Boomer\u201d.

He was even-keeled and very well-connected, though not especially charismatic. But any prospect of Bloomberg entering the race will probably send shockwaves through the campaigns of the remaining moderate candidates, who will be hoping to maintain momentum through the November and December debates and contests in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. And despite his strong establishment political connections and solid track record, it is far from clear whether a Bloomberg candidacy would be welcomed by the Democratic party establishment.

      "body": "<p>A high-profile obstetrician and gynaecologist who is also a professor with the University of Sydney made remarks to peers attending a medico-legal conference in Melbourne that were so sexist and condescending that some attendees were in tears and conference organisers vowed never to invite him back.</p> <p>Prof Hans Peter Dietz, an internationally renowned pelvic floor expert, has been the subject of numerous complaints to his employers, the Nepean hospital and the University of Sydney.</p> <p>Numerous women, including midwives and professors, have separately expressed serious concerns about Dietz\u2019s behaviour.</p> <p>Three health professionals who spoke to Guardian Australia said Dietz told attendees at medical conferences that women should be forced to sign a consent form if they wanted to give birth vaginally, to confirm that they were aware of the risk that their bodies might be left with tears and other complications if they did not get a caesarean instead.</p> <h2>\u2018Midwives are incompetent\u2019</h2> <p>The director of midwifery studies at the University of Technology Sydney, Dr Christine Catling, attended the Annual Obstetric Malpractice Conference in Melbourne in August 2018 and was asked to speak about midwifery continuity of care and the management of large babies.</p> <p>While on a panel, Catling spoke of the importance of not scaring women if there were concerns about vaginal delivery and to instead discuss different options and risks. Dietz stood up and interrupted her. \u201cHe declared that it was his job to scare the bejesus out of women,\u201d Catling said.</p> <p>She said Dietz then said that the practice where he previously worked in New Zealand had changed policies since he left, which meant around 50% of women were now seen by midwives rather than obstetricians, a change he said would affect the quality of documentation.</p> <p>\u201cI grabbed the microphone and said that there was no reason that the documentation would be affected as the midwives are competent at their jobs,\u201d Catling said. \u201cIt was then that he stated that midwives are incompetent.\u201d</p> <p>The conference organiser apologised profusely to Catling during the break.</p> <p>\u201cThe next day I found the conference organiser in tears in the bathroom after she had asked him to pay some respect to the speakers,\u201d Catling said. In a subsequent email between the event organiser and Catling, seen by Guardian Australia, the organiser said she had been involved in the conference since its inception.</p> <p>\u201cI have never encountered a delegate/speaker who is so extreme in their views and was not aware of this prior to the event,\u201d she wrote to Catling. \u201cI will not be including him in any of my events moving forward. There is no place for aggression and disrespect at our events.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Hannah Dahlen, who in June was made a member of the Order of Australia for her <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/rising-rate-of-caesareans-cant-just-be-blamed-on-ageing-overweight-mothers-20130911-2tkoc.html\">research in midwifery</a>, said Dietz refused to use her \u201cprofessor\u201d title and had criticised her work publicly at conferences.</p> <p>\u201cI met Dietz in early 2000 and went to him with my PhD idea to do a large randomised controlled trial on the application of warm compresses to a woman\u2019s perineum during the late second stage of labour to see if it reduced tearing and increased comfort for women,\u201d Dahlen said.</p> <p>\u201cHe told me it was rubbish and not science and I would be laughed out of town for such a stupid idea.\u201d</p> <p>Dahlen went on to do the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://ebn.bmj.com/content/15/4/103\">largest randomised control trial on warm compresses during late-stage labour</a>, which is now recommended practice and the only treatment proven to make <a href=\"https://www.cochrane.org/CD006672/PREG_perineal-techniques-during-second-stage-labour-reducing-perineal-trauma\">a moderate difference to comfort</a> during late-stage labour. The evidence is used <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00637197/full\">in guidelines around the world</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI then debated him at a medical conference and realised how angry he was with midwives as he screamed at me, and it was clearly personal,\u201d Dahlen said.</p> <p>Bashi Hazard, a lawyer and the director of Human Rights in Childbirth, said she was invited by the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology to contribute a piece about Dietz\u2019s stance that all women should sign a form saying they understood the dangers of vaginal birth before choosing to give birth that way.</p> <p>\u201cMy legal argument was how can women consent to what is a natural bodily function they can\u2019t control?\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t force women to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Hazard said she sent the article to some lawyer peers and consumers for their feedback before sending it to the journal for review and publication. She was shocked to receive a response from the journal accusing her of breaching their guidelines by disseminating the article widely ahead of publication.</p> <p>\u201cI found out one of the people I consulted with on the article took the article without telling me and gave it to Dietz, which would have been fine,\u201d Hazard said. But he then forwarded it to other people, she said, which had led to the journal\u2019s response.</p> <p>Hazard was so rattled by the potential ramifications to her professional reputation that she went to the police. She also complained to the University of Sydney, Dietz\u2019s employer. In response the university said Hazard had not provided it with enough evidence to take the complaint further.</p> <p>The university declined to answer specific questions from Guardian Australia, but said it was \u201caware of certain complaints\u201d about Dietz and was \u201cmaking inquiries as a matter of priority\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are unable to make further comment while the process is ongoing,\u201d a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile our academics are entitled to express their own opinions, and would defend their right to do so, we consider recently reported statements from Dr Dietz to be unacceptable and in conflict with the university\u2019s own position, policies and practices. We are absolutely committed to our ongoing work to achieve a positive workplace culture and gender equity in Stem, including medicine and health.\u201d</p> <p>A Nepean Blue Mountains local health district spokesman did not answer questions from Guardian Australia about the number of complaints received about Dietz or whether they supported his comments at medical conferences.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost 74% of our staff are female,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThey are valued members of our clinical and professional teams.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Offensive language\u2019</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/australian-doctor-slammed-for-saying-more-women-make-workforce-more-vulnerable\">SBS news first reported</a> that Dietz sent an email to committee members of the NSW medical union stating the workforce was \u201cincreasingly vulnerable because it\u2019s increasingly female and not exactly prepared for adversity because school and uni are \u2018safe spaces\u2019 [sic].\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuicides are one result,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInability to cope with everyday nastiness is another.\u201d</p> <p>Further reports have since emerged.</p> <p>Dr Aimee Sing, a consumer advocate with Homebirth Access, complained to numerous bodies about Dietz after he had a letter published in a Blue Mountains local newspaper accusing her of taking a 1:100 risk of her or her baby dying by choosing to have a home birth for her second child, given she had a caesarean for her first.</p> <p>Peer-reviewed journal articles report that women with a <a href=\"https://ranzcog.edu.au/RANZCOG_SITE/media/RANZCOG-MEDIA/Women%27s%20Health/Statement%20and%20guidelines/Clinical-Obstetrics/Birth-after-previous-Caesarean-Section-(C-Obs-38)Review-March-2019.pdf?ext=.pdf\">prior caesarean scar are at some risk </a><a href=\"https://ranzcog.edu.au/RANZCOG_SITE/media/RANZCOG-MEDIA/Women%27s%20Health/Statement%20and%20guidelines/Clinical-Obstetrics/Birth-after-previous-Caesarean-Section-(C-Obs-38)Review-March-2019.pdf?ext=.pdf\"> of uterine rupture</a>, but a much lower risk than that described by Dietz. .</p> <p>Midwife Oceane Campbell also told Guardian Australia she had been disrespected by Dietz, this time at a medical seminar in Newcastle in 2017 where he was a guest speaker. She said she was \u201creally shocked about the offensive language he used around women\u2019s bodies and birthing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe was referring to different perineal tears and showing diagrams of tears, and he referred to one third-degree tear as a \u2018bomb site\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>When Dietz showed attendees a graph detailing tear rates following vaginal birth, Campbell asked a question, which she said prompted Dietz to begin shouting at her.</p> <p>\u201cI said my understanding is the weight of the pregnancy on the pelvic floor increases the risk of incontinence after a certain number of pregnancies, [and] this is the case whether you have a caesarean or vaginal birth,\u201d Campbell said.</p> <p>\u201cHe snapped at me. He looked angry \u2026 he [was] nearly frothing at the mouth. He was red-faced and was so hostile and he said \u2018you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2019. He called my intelligence and profession as a midwife into question. In the end the host had to ask him to stop.\u201d</p> <p>A midwife who attended an obstetrics conference in Sweden that Dietz also attended told a similar story of Dietz\u2019s attitude. \u201cThe thing that startled me most and upset the doctors as well was that he said that it was not good to be a female obstetrician working with female midwives,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cHe said this would lead to a competition between the two professions as they both want to care for the woman in labour. It was so strange that he said this with an audience of almost only women gynaecologists and obstetricians. And in Sweden where almost all women call themselves feminists, where we try really hard to collaborate.\u201d</p> <p>While women who have risk factors such as overweight, diabetes and previous caesareans are at higher risk of complications and therefore are not recommended to pursue home-births, there is increasing evidence that healthy, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2018/positive-childbirth-experience/en/\">low-risk women with no risk-factors are receiving too many interventions such as cesarean and forceps</a>. There is debate between health professionals as to whether these healthy women can be as safe receiving midwife-led care or by giving birth at home.</p> <p>The president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Dr Vijay Roach, criticised Dietz\u2019s comments.</p> <p>\u201cRANZCOG unequivocally refutes the recent comments made by Prof Dietz,\u201d he said. \u201cThe workplace only benefits from the full and equitable participation of women, and any vulnerabilities requires attention to underlying systemic inequities. Prof Dietz\u2019s language has no place in the speciality of obstetrics and gynaecology or medicine more broadly.\u201d</p> <p>Dietz did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>\u2022 After the publication of this article Prof Dietz told <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/controversial-obstetrician-expelled-from-sydney-hospital-20191212-p53jbw.html\">the Sydney Morning Herald</a> that he considered a number of the accusations in this article to be defamatory and others nonsensical: \u201cSeveral of the allegations, some dating back almost 20 years, are patently untrue and have already been rejected by the bodies involved,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider this a form of public bullying intended to silence criticism of natural childbirth ideology and activism\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 November 2019 to clarify claims around the risk of vaginal delivery for a second birth after having had a caesarean.</p>",

Prof Hans Peter Dietz, an internationally renowned pelvic floor expert, has been the subject of numerous complaints to his employers, the Nepean hospital and the University of Sydney. Numerous women, including midwives and professors, have separately expressed serious concerns about Dietz\u2019s behaviour. Three health professionals who spoke to Guardian Australia said Dietz told attendees at medical conferences that women should be forced to sign a consent form if they wanted to give birth vaginally, to confirm that they were aware of the risk that their bodies might be left with tears and other complications if they did not get a caesarean instead. \u2018Midwives are incompetent\u2019 The director of midwifery studies at the University of Technology Sydney, Dr Christine Catling, attended the Annual Obstetric Malpractice Conference in Melbourne in August 2018 and was asked to speak about midwifery continuity of care and the management of large babies. While on a panel, Catling spoke of the importance of not scaring women if there were concerns about vaginal delivery and to instead discuss different options and risks. Dietz stood up and interrupted her. \u201cHe declared that it was his job to scare the bejesus out of women,\u201d Catling said. She said Dietz then said that the practice where he previously worked in New Zealand had changed policies since he left, which meant around 50% of women were now seen by midwives rather than obstetricians, a change he said would affect the quality of documentation. \u201cI grabbed the microphone and said that there was no reason that the documentation would be affected as the midwives are competent at their jobs,\u201d Catling said. \u201cIt was then that he stated that midwives are incompetent.\u201d The conference organiser apologised profusely to Catling during the break. \u201cThe next day I found the conference organiser in tears in the bathroom after she had asked him to pay some respect to the speakers,\u201d Catling said. In a subsequent email between the event organiser and Catling, seen by Guardian Australia, the organiser said she had been involved in the conference since its inception. \u201cI have never encountered a delegate/speaker who is so extreme in their views and was not aware of this prior to the event,\u201d she wrote to Catling. \u201cI will not be including him in any of my events moving forward. There is no place for aggression and disrespect at our events.\u201d Prof Hannah Dahlen, who in June was made a member of the Order of Australia for her research in midwifery, said Dietz refused to use her \u201cprofessor\u201d title and had criticised her work publicly at conferences. \u201cI met Dietz in early 2000 and went to him with my PhD idea to do a large randomised controlled trial on the application of warm compresses to a woman\u2019s perineum during the late second stage of labour to see if it reduced tearing and increased comfort for women,\u201d Dahlen said. \u201cHe told me it was rubbish and not science and I would be laughed out of town for such a stupid idea.\u201d Dahlen went on to do the world\u2019s largest randomised control trial on warm compresses during late-stage labour, which is now recommended practice and the only treatment proven to make a moderate difference to comfort during late-stage labour. The evidence is used in guidelines around the world. \u201cI then debated him at a medical conference and realised how angry he was with midwives as he screamed at me, and it was clearly personal,\u201d Dahlen said. Bashi Hazard, a lawyer and the director of Human Rights in Childbirth, said she was invited by the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology to contribute a piece about Dietz\u2019s stance that all women should sign a form saying they understood the dangers of vaginal birth before choosing to give birth that way. \u201cMy legal argument was how can women consent to what is a natural bodily function they can\u2019t control?\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t force women to do that.\u201d Hazard said she sent the article to some lawyer peers and consumers for their feedback before sending it to the journal for review and publication. She was shocked to receive a response from the journal accusing her of breaching their guidelines by disseminating the article widely ahead of publication. \u201cI found out one of the people I consulted with on the article took the article without telling me and gave it to Dietz, which would have been fine,\u201d Hazard said. But he then forwarded it to other people, she said, which had led to the journal\u2019s response. Hazard was so rattled by the potential ramifications to her professional reputation that she went to the police. She also complained to the University of Sydney, Dietz\u2019s employer. In response the university said Hazard had not provided it with enough evidence to take the complaint further. The university declined to answer specific questions from Guardian Australia, but said it was \u201caware of certain complaints\u201d about Dietz and was \u201cmaking inquiries as a matter of priority\u201d. \u201cWe are unable to make further comment while the process is ongoing,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWhile our academics are entitled to express their own opinions, and would defend their right to do so, we consider recently reported statements from Dr Dietz to be unacceptable and in conflict with the university\u2019s own position, policies and practices. We are absolutely committed to our ongoing work to achieve a positive workplace culture and gender equity in Stem, including medicine and health.\u201d A Nepean Blue Mountains local health district spokesman did not answer questions from Guardian Australia about the number of complaints received about Dietz or whether they supported his comments at medical conferences. \u201cAlmost 74% of our staff are female,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThey are valued members of our clinical and professional teams.\u201d \u2018Offensive language\u2019 SBS news first reported that Dietz sent an email to committee members of the NSW medical union stating the workforce was \u201cincreasingly vulnerable because it\u2019s increasingly female and not exactly prepared for adversity because school and uni are \u2018safe spaces\u2019 [sic].\u201d \u201cSuicides are one result,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInability to cope with everyday nastiness is another.\u201d Further reports have since emerged. Dr Aimee Sing, a consumer advocate with Homebirth Access, complained to numerous bodies about Dietz after he had a letter published in a Blue Mountains local newspaper accusing her of taking a 1:100 risk of her or her baby dying by choosing to have a home birth for her second child, given she had a caesarean for her first. Peer-reviewed journal articles report that women with a prior caesarean scar are at some risk of uterine rupture, but a much lower risk than that described by Dietz. . Midwife Oceane Campbell also told Guardian Australia she had been disrespected by Dietz, this time at a medical seminar in Newcastle in 2017 where he was a guest speaker. She said she was \u201creally shocked about the offensive language he used around women\u2019s bodies and birthing\u201d. \u201cHe was referring to different perineal tears and showing diagrams of tears, and he referred to one third-degree tear as a \u2018bomb site\u2019.\u201d When Dietz showed attendees a graph detailing tear rates following vaginal birth, Campbell asked a question, which she said prompted Dietz to begin shouting at her. \u201cI said my understanding is the weight of the pregnancy on the pelvic floor increases the risk of incontinence after a certain number of pregnancies, [and] this is the case whether you have a caesarean or vaginal birth,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHe snapped at me. He looked angry \u2026 he [was] nearly frothing at the mouth. He was red-faced and was so hostile and he said \u2018you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2019. He called my intelligence and profession as a midwife into question. In the end the host had to ask him to stop.\u201d A midwife who attended an obstetrics conference in Sweden that Dietz also attended told a similar story of Dietz\u2019s attitude. \u201cThe thing that startled me most and upset the doctors as well was that he said that it was not good to be a female obstetrician working with female midwives,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said this would lead to a competition between the two professions as they both want to care for the woman in labour. It was so strange that he said this with an audience of almost only women gynaecologists and obstetricians. And in Sweden where almost all women call themselves feminists, where we try really hard to collaborate.\u201d While women who have risk factors such as overweight, diabetes and previous caesareans are at higher risk of complications and therefore are not recommended to pursue home-births, there is increasing evidence that healthy, low-risk women with no risk-factors are receiving too many interventions such as cesarean and forceps. There is debate between health professionals as to whether these healthy women can be as safe receiving midwife-led care or by giving birth at home. The president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Dr Vijay Roach, criticised Dietz\u2019s comments. \u201cRANZCOG unequivocally refutes the recent comments made by Prof Dietz,\u201d he said. \u201cThe workplace only benefits from the full and equitable participation of women, and any vulnerabilities requires attention to underlying systemic inequities. Prof Dietz\u2019s language has no place in the speciality of obstetrics and gynaecology or medicine more broadly.\u201d Dietz did not respond to requests for comment. \u2022 After the publication of this article Prof Dietz told the Sydney Morning Herald that he considered a number of the accusations in this article to be defamatory and others nonsensical: \u201cSeveral of the allegations, some dating back almost 20 years, are patently untrue and have already been rejected by the bodies involved,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider this a form of public bullying intended to silence criticism of natural childbirth ideology and activism\u201d. \u2022 Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com \u2022 This article was amended on 8 November 2019 to clarify claims around the risk of vaginal delivery for a second birth after having had a caesarean.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump wanted to hear three words out of the Ukrainian president\u2019s mouth, according to newly released testimony in the US impeachment inquiry: \u201cinvestigations\u201d, \u201cBiden\u201d and \u201cClinton\u201d. The Ukrainians had been told that the resumption of $400m in military aid \u201cwould likely not occur\u201d until President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a televised statement, according to previous testimony. The essential elements of the statement were dictated to diplomats by Trump himself, testified George P Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state who was in charge of Ukraine policy \u2013 until he abruptly was not. Trump told Zelenskiy on the phone in late July that he wanted him to pursue investigations of his political rival Joe Biden and a 2016 election conspiracy theory, according to a call summary released by the White House. But by early September, after a creep down what another witness has described as a \u201ccontinuum\u201d of \u201cinsidiousness\u201d, the demand had grown more specific. Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, told fellow diplomats at the time that \u201che, Gordon, had talked to the President \u2013 POTUS in sort of shorthand \u2013 and POTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelenskiy to go to a microphone and say \u2018investigations\u2019, \u2018Biden\u2019, and \u2018Clinton\u2019,\u201d Kent testified, according to the new transcripts. \u201cClinton\u201d was shorthand for the investigation of a conspiracy theory, credited by Trump, about the 2016 election and his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Allegations that Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election are at the heart of the current impeachment inquiry against him. Thinking the plot was \u201cinjurious to the rule of law\u201d, Kent took measures to document conversations and other observations in mid-August, a month after the military aid was suspended, he testified. \u201cI wrote a note to the file saying that I had concerns that there was an effort to initiate politically motivated prosecutions that were injurious to the rule of law, both Ukraine and the US,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not believe the US should ask other countries to engage in politically associated investigations and prosecutions,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs a general principle, I don\u2019t think that as a matter of policy the US should do that, period.\u201d Kent, a 27-year veteran of the foreign service, is scheduled to be the second witness to speak in public impeachment hearings to begin next week. In his closed-door testimony he described his shock at the hijacking of US policy in the region and his alarm to see Marie Yovanovitch, then ambassador to Ukraine, come under attack by \u201ctwo snake pits\u201d \u2013 one in Ukraine and one in the United States. Yovanovitch, who was recalled in May, fell victim to a runaway plot that began with a former Ukrainian general prosecutor who wanted \u201crevenge\u201d for her anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, working with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal emissary, Kent testified. The plot grew to take in Donald Trump Jr; Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Ukrainian-Americans arrested last month on campaign finance charges; and others, Kent said. \u201cMy reference to the snake pits would have been in the context of having had our ambassador just removed through actions by corrupt Ukrainians in Ukraine as well as private American citizens back here,\u201d Kent explained. \u201cMr Giuliani, at that point, had been carrying on a campaign for several months full of lies and incorrect information about Ambassador Yovanovitch, so this was a continuation of his campaign of lies,\u201d Kent said. Diplomats nevertheless decided to work with Giuliani, the ex-mayor of New York, owing to his link to Trump, Kent said. \u201cIt was clear that the former mayor had influence on the President in terms of the way the President thought of Ukraine,\u201d Kent said, quoting America\u2019s special Ukraine envoy, Kurt Volker. \u201cAnd I think by that moment in time, that was self-evident to anyone who was working on the issues, and therefore, it made sense to try to engage the mayor.\u201d But as his frustration at what he saw as the subversion of US policy grew, Kent began to take additional counter-action, some of it directed at his boss, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. After Pompeo sent what Kent thought was an inaccurate letter accusing Congress of attempting to bully career foreign service officers, Kent notified top state department lawyers and the director of the foreign service that what Pompeo said was wrong, he said. \u201cI was one of two career foreign service officers which had received letters from the committees, and I had not felt bullied, threatened, and intimidated,\u201d Kent said. Supervisors ultimately told Kent to temper his objections to the scrambling of Ukraine policy, he said. \u201cI was told to keep my head down,\u201d he said, \u201cand lower my profile in Ukraine.\u201d",

The dealer, John Ioannou, contacted Guardian Australia through a friend to provide his defence to allegations made against him by the APY artist collective in a letter to the federal ministers for Indigenous Australians and the arts, and the South Australian premier. Ioannou confirmed NT police had visited his residence to speak to the artists after receiving a complaint. He said he believed the allegations were being made against him because he was \u201cthe biggest threat [art centres] face\u201d. The letter that sparked the police visit is signed by 69 artists from APY Art Centre Collective. It alleges that the high-profile artist Yaritji Young was told she had to make paintings to service a $20,000 debt that her son owed Ioannou. Ioannou categorically denied the claim. He said he had nothing to hide and his \u201cbooks are open for anyone who wants to see\u201d. When asked if Young had painted for him this week, and what she\u2019d been paid, Ioannou responded: \u201cWhy do you want to know that?\u201d He said Young had started a couple of unfinished paintings, which he said were not of the quality he was looking for to display in his proposed gallery. Asked to clarify if she\u2019d been paid for that work, Ioannou replied \u201cNo.\u201d Ioannou said three artists had stayed, not at his house but at an Alice Springs hotel paid for by him, for the past 10 days and that they had all left or were about to leave for a funeral. He claimed they were discussing a new gallery he was opening but he later suggested they had painted for him. \u201cI made a proposition to a certain artist here because I\u2019m starting up a business again that will be run through a legal firm,\u201d Ioannou told Guardian Australia. \u201cA lot of the artists \u2013 I\u2019m very well known here \u2013 approach me on a daily basis to do painting.\u201d He said the three artists came of their own volition so they could discuss \u201cpropositions for future work together\u201d and he was seeking legal advice about working with the artists.

      "bodyText": "Gareth Southgate has urged Uefa to keep increasing sanctions against countries guilty of racism but admitted he was not sure whether expelling Bulgaria from Euro 2020 would have had the desired effect of eradicating discrimination from the game. The Bulgarian Football Union was ordered to stage its next home match, against the Czech Republic, behind closed doors and fined \u20ac75,000 after the incidents during England\u2019s qualifier last month that left play halted twice because of racism from home supporters during the first half. Southgate, asked whether his players had been let down by Uefa\u2019s punishment, said: \u201cIt depends on what we view as being enough. In some respects, if we had thrown Bulgaria out of the competition, that would\u2019ve been easy as well because they\u2019re out [not going to qualify]; OK, they might have a play-off opportunity. \u201cIn my head I\u2019ve got their captain [Ivelin Popov], who probably was as brave as anyone on the field that night, frankly, to go over to your own fans when you\u2019re getting thrashed and to try to affect it in the way he did; I thought was a hugely commendable act. So, would I want to see him as an individual punished? Certainly not, and there were loads of kids in the stadium who were desperate for pictures with our players. So we made friends there. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that we look at Bulgaria and think everything there was wrong.

That is the same sum of money that the government promised at the last spending review to put into social care, given acute concern over the deep cuts to the sector since austerity began in 2010. Around half of the \u00a315bn comes from local councils paying residents\u2019 fees and the other half from older people funding their own stays. Prof Bob Hudson, of Kent University\u2019s centre for health service studies, said the findings showed \u201csome large care providers are taking public money away from direct care into unwarranted profiteering\u201d. For small and medium-sized operators, \u00a37 out of every \u00a3100 they receive in fees goes into profit before tax, rent payments, directors\u2019 remuneration and net interest payments, the CHPI found.

One-sixth (16%) of the money received from councils or individuals by firms that are owned or backed by private equity outfits goes into debt repayment. That is linked to the fact that such operators have borrowed \u00a335,000 for each bed they own, CHPI said. Similarly, while some of the largest companies spend between 15% and 32% of their income on rent, the eight largest not-for-profit providers\u2019 outlay in this area is just 2% of their fees. Private firms own 94% of the UK\u2019s total stock of 464,900 beds, according to data collated by care market specialists Laing and Buisson.

Officers were called at about 4.40pm on Thursday to reports of a stabbing at Hillingdon Civic Centre in High Street, Uxbridge. The victim was taken to hospital with a stab wound to his chest, but was pronounced dead less than an hour later. A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder, and remains in police custody for questioning. Another teenage boy suffered a non-life-threatening knife wound to his ear. An area inside the centre has been cordoned off by police and forensic teams are working at the scene. The victim is the 21st teenager to be murdered in London this year. DCI Noel McHugh, who is leading the investigation, said: \u201cThis is a tragic loss of life. A young man with his whole life ahead of him has been fatally attacked.\u201d He urged witnesses to contact police, and said the Metropolitan police were doing \u201ceverything we can to find those involved\u201d. Knife crime in the capital has soared in recent years, with 44,076 knife or sharp object offences recorded in the 12 months prior to June 2019 \u2013 the highest figure since comparable data was first collected in 2011.",

Bye! Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a chat: We needed a win, but we needed a performance. The boys wanted to go forward, play forward, run forward. They could have had loads more tonight as well. But a pleasing performance, and very important for us to get the points. You expect to win at home against teams like this, no disrespect to Partizan, because they gave us a really good game over there, but you expect to win and we should have buried it in the first 10 minutes really. But going into half-time 2-0 up you\u2019re confident. Scott McTominay came off injured in the second half. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll be OK,\u201d Solskjaer says. Manchester United served up a feast of attacking football, and Paul Wilson was there, knife and fork in hand and serviette tucked into this collar, tucking in: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r wants to see Manchester United playing on the front foot and creating chances and they qualified for the knockout stages of the Europa League by doing just that. The second of two wins against Partizan Belgrade was achieved through the composed finishing of Mason Greenwood, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, though with just a little more composure they could have doubled the margin of victory. Much more here: This was a fine attacking display from Manchester United, especially in the first half. On BT Sport, Paul Scholes almost sounds excited. Ewan Murray was at Ibrox for Rangers 1-0 Porto: Here are your full-time classified results: Astana 0 AZ 5 Standard Li\u00e8ge 2 Eintracht Frankfurt 1 Basel 2 Getafe 1 Krasnodar 3 Trabzonspor 1 APOEL 2 Qarabag 1 Dudelange 2 Sevilla 5 Lazio 1 Celtic 2 CFR Cluj 1 Rennes 0 Rosenborg 0 Sporting 2 LASK 4 PSV 1 K\u00f8benhavn 1 Dynamo Kyiv 1 Lugano 0 Malm\u00f6 0 Wolfsburg 1 Gent 3 Oleksandria 2 Saint-\u00c9tienne 2 Sporting Braga 3 Besiktas 1 Wolverhampton Wanderers 1 Slovan Bratislava 0 Espanyol 6 Ludogorets 0 Ferencv\u00e1ros 0 CSKA Moskva 0 Borussia Monchengladbach 2 Roma 1 Wolfsberger 0 Istanbul Basaksehir 3 Feyenoord 1 Young Boys 1 Rangers 2 Porto 0 Manchester United 3 Partizan 0 It\u2019s all over at Molineux, and Wolves have won 1-0. All four British teams in action tonight have won! It is verily a land of hope and also glory! In other last-minute goal news, Marcus \u201cson of Lilian\u201d Thuram gave Borussia Monchengladbach a 2-1 win over Roma, and Maksim Zaderaka equalised for Oleksandriya against St Etienne! Most games have now finished, but at Wolves \u2013 where they are midway through 12 minutes of stoppage time \u2013 they play on. Wolves have snatched victory in the last minute! I can\u2019t tell you much about the goal, except that it happened. Apparently it came from a deflected Adama cross, headed in by Jimenez. Wolfsburger are 3-0 down now, Enzo Crivelli with his second goal of the night, and indeed his second in three minutes. And the wonderfully-named Michael Ngadeu-Ngadjui has put Gent 3-1 up at Wolfsburg. It\u2019s been a bad few minutes for Wolfsburgy teams. Goalflash latest: Braga are 3-1 up at home to Besiktas, Wilson Eduardo getting the third. Oleksandriya have pulled a goal back at home to St Etienne, Denys Bezborodko making it 2-1, and Enzo Crivelli has made it Wolfsburger 0-2 Istanbul Basaksehir. It continues to rain goals at Espanyol, where the home side are now 6-0 up against nine-man Ludogorets. Facundo Ferreyra has scored their latest. In other red card-related news, Wolfsberger have a) conceded a penalty; b) lost Nemanja Rnic to a second yellow card; and c) gone 1-0 down to Istanbul Basaksehir after Edin Visca converted from the spot. And another one! The ball is pulled back to Davis, 20 yards out, and his low shot deflects off a defender\u2019s boot, wrong-foots the goalkeeper and arrows into the net! That\u2019s a cracking strike! It\u2019s a low ball in from the right, and from 17 yards Morelos traps it and dispatches it in an instant, sending his shot low and hard across goal and in at the back stick! \u201cPeter Oh must be starving because Manchego Ungai (Cheese Eel) sounds stomach turning,\u201d notes Alex Amponsah. Marcus Rashford comes off, after scoring one and missing about half a dozen. He gets a standing ovation anyway, for being threatening and exciting and fun. Pereira is on. Meanwhile, Gent have taken a 2-1 lead at Wolfsburg, with Laurent Depoitre scoring their second. \u201cI must be hungry because the fixture looks like Manchego Unagi v Marzipan Belgrave to me,\u201d writes Peter Oh, as United take off Fred and bring on James Garner. Meanwhile Fazio, whose own-goal had given Borussia Monchengladbach the lead, has just equalised for Roma. Wolves\u2019 penalty miss was their first in over two years, ending a run of 14 successive successful spot-kicks. United have a free kick, in handy shooting range. For some reason Fred takes it rather than Rashford, and he sends the ball looping down the middle of goal. Luckily it was high enough that the keeper had to turn it over the bar, just to be safe, though the subsequent corner is wasted. In other news, Espanyol are four up against nine-man Ludogorets, Victor Campuzano scoring their latest, while Gent have equalised at Wolfsburg, Roman Yaremchuk making it 1-1. Marcus Rashford doesn\u2019t miss! It\u2019s a long ball from right to left, that Young cushions back into Rashford\u2019s path, and this time he lashes it into the top corner with his left foot from 15 yards! It\u2019s saved! Neves takes, but the goalkeeper goes the right way and palms it away to safety! Penalty to Wolves! Neto is brought down, the referee points to the spot, and Wolves will now have a great chance to take the lead. The second halves are under way! News of further goals and Rashford misses to follow. All the latest scores are yours to peruse and enjoy here. Half-time reading: A little earlier Celtic beat Lazio in Rome to qualify for the knockout bits. Read all about it: Half-time scores: Manchester United are stuffing Partizan 2-0, though it could have been five. Don\u2019t get too excited, though: Partizan are a humdrum fourth in the Serbia SuperLiga, 10 points behind the runaway leaders, Red Star. Rangers v Porto and Wolves v Slovan Bratislava are both goalless. It\u2019s not been all good for United. Soumah leads a break for Partizan, who have four forwards bearing down on two defenders, but his pass is rubbish, destroys all momentum and ruins everything. The visitors have had a few opportunities to punish United on the break, but have taken none of them. Paulinho (not that one, unless you\u2019re thinking of the 26-year-old who plays for Braga, in which case that one) has given Braga a 2-1 lead at home to Besiktas, and Roma\u2019s beanpole centre-back Federico Fazio has scored at the wrong end to give Borussia Monchengladbach a 1-0 advantage. Meanwhile at Old Trafford, Rashford has missed yet another chance. This time he was played through on the left of the area, but his attempt to chip the goalkeeper failed when the goalkeeper stayed on his feet, rendering himself unchippable. He was punished for this when Rashford\u2019s attempted finish hit him in an extremely painful place. Ludogorets are down to nine! Jacek Goralski has collected his second booking of the evening, and Espanyol are sniffing a stuffing here! In probably related news, Matias Vargas has scored from the penalty spot to make it 3-0. Get out your bumper book of superlatives, Tony Martial has scored an absolute stonker!!! The build-up is a little lucky, the ball deflecting to the Frenchman when Greenwood charged down Urosevic\u2019s attempted clearance, but his first touch is sublime, his second to jink inside Ostojic\u2019s sliding challenge was absolutely wondrous, the next takes it away from Pavlovic, and another prods it past Stojkovic and into the corner! GOOOAAALLL! Besiktas have equalised at Braga. Yes they have. Tyler Boyd, the New Zealand-born, USA-representing winger, as scored it. Meanwhile at Old Trafford, Natcho has been booked for fouling McTominay, who placed his body between ball and rival player cunningly to make the foul inevitable. A little goal update roundup thingy for you now: Espanyol have doubled their lead over 10-man Ludogorets, Llu\u00eds L\u00f3pez with their second. Meanwhile Jo\u00e3o Victor has given Wolfsburg a 1-0 lead at home to Gent, Serkan Asan\u2019s own-goal has given Krasnodar a 1-0 lead at home to Trabzonspor, and there have been a couple of penalties: Wahbi Khazri, once of Sunderland, has given St Etienne the lead at Oleksandriya, and Steven Berghuis, once of Watford, has given Feyenoord the advantage at home to Young Boys. Manchester United take the lead! Rashford pokes the ball across the edge of the area and Greenwood runs onto it on the right side of goal, jinks back onto his left foot, past Miletic\u2019s feeble attempt to make any difference whatsoever, and then with the goalkeeper expecting the textbook finish across goal he shoots inside the near post! There has been one goal in tonight\u2019s late games, and it came in the top-of-the-table Group H six-pointer, where Espanyol took the lead against Ludogorets in the fourth minute through Oscar Melendo. Ludogorets have since had a man sent off, Rafael Forster getting his marching orders for a professional foul, so things are looking very good indeed for the Spaniards. Meanwhile at Old Trafford, another Rashford miss \u2013 this time he\u2019s thumped a right-foot volley over the bar. Another Rashford miss! Mata is played into the area, befuddles Pavlovic with a fine turn and slides the ball inside to Rashford, but from close range his shot hits the keeper! That was an absolute sitter. Though it was the Partizan goalkeeper, Stojkovic, who was sitting down, as he made that stop. Incredible miss! Wan-Bissaka\u2019s cross deflects off the heel of a defender and rolls perfectly into the path of Rashford, who sidefoots it back across goal and just wide of the post! United should have taken the lead there. It is, incidentally, absolutely ratting down in Manchester. Lucky escape dept: Another goal has been disallowed at Old Trafford. This time Sadiq was offside, but a fair bit more narrowly, before he lifted the ball over Romero from the edge of the area. At Old Trafford, Martial tucks the ball into the corner of the net, but sadly he was a couple of yards offside. Meanwhile, news from Glasgow: Rangers: McGregor, Tavernier, Helander, Goldson, Barisic, Davis, Jack, Kamara, Barker, Morelos, Kent. Subs: Edmundson, Defoe, Ojo, Foderingham, Flanagan, Aribo, Arfield.

Some notable results there for LASK and Standard Li\u00e8ge in particular. After the wins for Cluj and Celtic, this is what it means for Group E. And that\u2019s the last kick of the game! Celtic have won in Italy for the first time in their history, at the 13th time of asking. Coming back from 1-0 down, they have confirmed their qualification with this victory. What a night for the Bhoys. 1-2 An absolutely awful pass from Berisha gives Edouard the ball \u2026 Celtic are three on two here \u2026 Edouard squares the ball to Ntcham, who is through on goal \u2026 it\u2019s a heavy touch as Strakosha races out \u2026 but Ntcham dinks him over it into the net. What a delicious finish to win the game. Eight thousand Celtic fans go bonkers!!! CELTIC HAVE SURELY WON IT!! d;jvbW SKVJN;kdvnsdkvdvkjbv 90+2 min: Lazio are resorting to throwing bombs forward, but Jullien has been absolutely magnificent, heading everything away. A huge goal in the other game in Celtic\u2019s group! Cluj look like they have nicked it at the death, which would send them top, ahead of Celtic. That is a hammerblow to Lazio\u2019s chances of qualifying, if the results stay like this. 90 min: Five minutes added on here, which is about right. Elyounoussi wins a corner, from which Ntcham has a free shot on goal! The Frenchman completely mis-hits the ball from eight yards out! 88 min: Celtic make their final change: Moritz Bauer on for Forrest, who looks knackered. 86 min: Forster comes up with the goods! Wow, what a performance the goalkeeper is putting in once again. Luis Alberto twists and finds some space in the box, curls a shot towards the corner, but Forster sticks a left hand out and turns it away! Milinkovic-Savic has a chance to score from the rebound but the Serbian smashes it wide! 84 min: Celtic are hanging on now. Lazio have no many attacking players on the pitch, and they all flood forward. Berisha, who has just come on, goes completely clear, but Forster spreads his 6ft7in frame and makes the save! This is just like the first reverse game in Glasgow! 82 min: Two more changes, both enforced. First Lazio\u2019s Vavro pulls a hamstring as he mis-controls the ball. Thirty seconds later, Elhamed does the same thing, overstretching as he clears. His Israeli compatriot, Bitton, will come on. For Lazio, they are sending on Berisha, an attacking midfielder! I make it that they\u2019ve only got two defenders left on the field now! 79 min: Celtic make a change: Ntcham comes on for Ryan Christie. 78 min: Edouard has two golden chances to grab the winner for Celtic! Some slick passing from McGregor and Christie releases the Frenchman, but he can\u2019t finish the one-on-one opportunity, passing his shot a yard wide of Strakosha\u2019s left-hand post. Next, Edouard wins a free-kick right on the edge of Lazio box. This is prime position, with the Frenchman over it \u2026 just over! The ball catches the top of the netting. Close! Man Utd: Romero, Wan Bissaka, Maguire, Rojo, Young, McTominay, Fred, Greenwood, Mata, Rashford, Martial. Subs: Jones, Grant, Lingard, Andreas Pereira, James, Garner, Williams. Partizan Belgrade: Stojkovic, Nemanja Miletic, Ostojic, Strahinja Pavlovic, Urosevic, Natcho, Zdjelar, Scekic, Asano, Soumah, Umar. Subs: Vujacic, Tosic, Ivanovic, Brezancic,Filip Stevanovic, Nemanja Stevanovic, Lutovac. 74 min: Lazio hit the post! Direct from a corner, Luis Alberto swings a ball into the near post. There is no Celtic defender on it, and Forster slides across to just keep it from squeezing into his net. That would have been such a disappointing way to concede but Celtic survive. 70 min: Lazio are really going for it now, but that means they are leaving space at the back, essentially going man for man. The ball breaks kindly for Edouard who looks favourite to get there first and race through on goal but a wonderful last-ditch tackle from Vavro saves the day. Lazio living dangerously. Celtic just need to keep their composure. 67 min: Frankfurt are back on level terms against Standard Li\u00e8ge, a clever free kick from Filip Kostic squirts underneath the wall into the corner. The Serbian is fast becoming one of the best players in Europe from dead-ball situations. 65 min: Just as a write that, Lazio spring into life: first Immobile breaks down the left, cuts back on his right and shoots at goal. Jullien gets across but the ball strikes him on the arm inside the area. No penalty! It would have been harsh \u2013 Jullian was only about a yard away from Immobile when he struck it, but the arm did prevent a shot on target. You\u2019ve seen them given. Next, Milinkovic-Savic has a point-blank header saved from Forster! Out of nowhere, Lazio are piling on the pressure! 63 min: Lazio just can\u2019t seem to get a proper foothold in this game. Their subs have made no impact whatsoever. 61 min: Two surprising scores to tell you about: LASK have score twice in four minutes against PSV to take a 2-1 lead, while Standard Li\u00e8ge have scored against Eintracht Frankfurt, who thrashed Bayern 5-1 at the weekend. 59 min: Lazio make two changes. They had to do something, they haven\u2019t had a kick in this second half. Luis Alberto and club captain Senad Lulic come on for Jony and Lucas Leiva. Two very attacking changes. With Lazio on two points in this group, they have to go for it. Inzaghi called this a must-win game beforehand. 57 min: Scott Brown out here looking like Lothar Matthaus. The captain is looking absolutely running things. Imperious. 55 min: More chances from Celtic, both coming from set pieces. First Elyounoussi flashes a deflected effort just over, then Ajer so nearly squares to McGregor for a tap in before Felipe \u2013 that man again! \u2013 clears desperately for Lazio. 53 min: This game has exploded into life in the second half! And it is Celtic who are making all the running, counter-attacking Lazio at pace with Forrest carrying the ball out from defence. It\u2019s three on two as Lazio defence backpedals, but Forrest chooses to go it alone when he has Elyounoussi and Edouard outside him! It\u2019s a fantastic challenge from Felipe that stops him. Ahhh, what a missed opportunity. 51 min: A couple of loose Celtic challenges. First, Scott Brown picks up a yellow card for a flailing arm which hits Jony in the face. It wasn\u2019t malicious \u2013 promise \u2013 but the elbow did connect as Brown looked to fend off the Spaniard. Next, Hayes catches Milinkovic-Savic with a high foot to the mid-riff. Lucky to escape a booking. 49 min: Chance for Edouard! Brown did brilliantly to win a loose ball in midfield and Lazio were suddenly outnumbered. McGregor fed Edouard, who rolled Acerbi but could only fire a low shot straight at Strakosha. 47 min: Caicedo goes down in a heap on the half-way line under a challenge of Jullien. The Frenchman would be suspended for one match if he picks up a yellow card here. No booking. Peeeeeeeep! We\u2019re underway again in Rome (and elsewhere). Following on from Kyle Walker\u2019s \u2018heroics\u2019 last night, here is a gallery for your viewing pleasure. Crucially for Celtic, Cluj and Rennes remains goalless. Eight thousand Celtic fans cheer them off. Simeone Inzaghi looks bereft at his side\u2019s performance. 45 min: Caicedo then bundles Ajer over clumsily. It wasn\u2019t a yellow card tackle, but the Ecuadorian has to be careful here. He looks like he could lose his head. Two minutes added on here for injury time. 43 min: Yellow card for Caicedo, who has looked woefully out-of-sorts up front for Lazio. A lazy tackle on Ryan Christie catches the Scot on the shins. 41 min: Lazio so nearly re-take the lead! Three golden chances they have inside a minute, and a combination of a good save from Forster, a goal-line clearance from Jullien and a wasteful header from Lazio\u2019s Parolo sees the score remain at 1-1. What a series of let offs for Celtic, who will just want to get to half time. Celtic are level! WHAT a goal from James Forrest. Milinkovic-Savic was sloppy on the edge of his own box, Elyounoussi pounced and slid a perfect ball into Forrest\u2019s stride. The winger got it out of his feet beautifully and even though he was forced wide, lashed a fearsome strike into the top corner! Strakosha no chance! Celtic\u2019s fans go crazy, limbs flying all around the Stadio Olimpico. 34 min: Krasnodar have raced into a 2-0 lead against Turkish side Trabzonspor. Both goals through Manuel Fernandes, the mercurial Portuguese, with the second a very special backheel from around the penalty spot. 31 min: Celtic\u2019s supporters have found their voice again. The reason why they seem especially loud tonight is because Lazio have been forced to shut four sections of their stands due to racist chanting against Rennes, earlier in the group. The sections are where their ultras would normally be stood. 29 min: Celtic are looking a lot better. They are yet to create any real chances, but are enjoying plenty of possession and Elyounoussi is starting to look dangerous when he turns and drives towards goal. Lucas Leiva has got his hands full at the base of Lazio\u2019s midfield, but is doing a decent job so far. 26 min: GOAL! Sevilla are now 2-0 up at Dudelange, on a pitch in Luxembourg that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the Vanarama League. That said, it\u2019s another beautiful goal, Sevilla again playing clever and intricate passes around before Dabbur squares the ball for Munir to tap home. 24 min: So nearly a own goal to gift Lazio a 2-0 lead! From a corner, Jullien heads just wide of his own far post, much for Celtic\u2019s relief. 22 min: Lucas Leiva is lucky to escape without a yellow card after a pretty poor tackle on McGregor, who signed a new five-year contract at Celtic yesterday. 20 min: Back in Rome, and Celtic are lucky to not be 2-0 down. A woeful offside line leaves Immobile one-on-one with Forster, but the Italian can\u2019t bring the bouncing ball down properly and Ajer just gets back in time to make a good tackle. A let off. 18 min: Coates gave Sporting the lead with a bullet header after Rosenborg cleared a corner, while Moanes Dabour basically walked the ball into the net for Sevilla against Dudelange after a sublime one-two between Lopes and Munir. 15 min: There have been some other early goals \u2026 Rosenborg 0-1 Sporting Apoel 0-1 Qarabag Dudelange 0-1 Sevilla Basel 1-0 Getafe FC Copenhagen 1-0 Dynamo Kyiv 12 min: Lazio\u2019s goal means they are right back in this group. This is the table, as it stands. Cluj are still 0-0 with Rennes. 10 min: The first positive forays for Celtic, with Forrest and Christie looking bright down the right wing. Neil Lennon will be so disappointed that it took a goal for Celtic to wake up. It also did a good job of silencing that bouncing Celtic away following. 8 min: Prior to the goal, Celtic just couldn\u2019t get out of their half. The goal was definitely coming. Who else? That\u2019s his 15th of the season (!) and his 101th goal for Lazio, arriving at the back post to sidefoot a volley past Forster. How he was unmarked there remains a mystery. A cross came into the box from the right, Jullien got a flick, but it fell to Immobile in acres of space. Celtic look shook. The German slots the ball home after LASK were penalised for a handball. 2 min: There is a huge Celtic following in Rome. The Scots are going absolutely bonkers but it\u2019s Lazio that have the first chance of the game: Lazzari lashing a volley towards goal after a head out from Jullien. It is well saved by Forster, and Caicedo is ruled offside with his rebound. Peeeeeeep! We\u2019re underway in the early kick offs. Astana\u2019s game with AZ finishes 5-0 to the Dutch side, by the way. Celtic and Lazio are out, with Scott Brown keeping the Italian team waiting in the tunnel. Classic Brown. Lazio line up in their sky blue, with white shorts and socks. Celtic are in their changed yellow kit. When in Rome \u2026 Celtic have never won in Italy. Here\u2019s Neil Lennon chatting pre-match. Lazio play predominantly 3-5-2, and they play very well. I came up against Antonio Conte\u2019s Juventus six years ago, and they were superb in that formation as well. Lazio are smart. They\u2019ve got lots of good movement and how they retain possession causes us problems. Realistically it\u2019s going to be very difficult to win here. We haven\u2019t won in Italy, but records are there to be broken. Sporting are a funny club. Last year\u2019s shenanigans have subsided somewhat. They might be well off the pace in the Portuguese league but they are in decent shape to qualify from Group D. Their team is a myriad of forgotten Premier League stars: Yannick Bolasie, on loan from Everton, Fifa legend Seydou Doumbia, Fulham legend Luciano Vietto leads the line, while former Liverpool greats Sebasti\u00e1n Coates and Tiago Ilori are at the back. Jes\u00e9, of PSG and Stoke City fame, is not in the match-day squad. Maybe he\u2019s concentrating on his music career, this was a summer release. Delighted to say that Lord Bendtner is also involved for FC Copenhagen, who face Dynamo Kiev. He\u2019s on the bench, perhaps because he\u2019s forgotten how to stick the ball in the onion bag. This is the former Arsenal man earlier this season. A week or so ago, we also ran an exclusive extract from his new book. It\u2019s definitely different.

Referee: Tobias Stieler (Germany) On paper, that is a formidable Lazio side. Ciro Immobile leads the line, he has scored 14 goals in 13 club appearances this season, topping the scoring charts in Serie A. Only Robert Lewandowski and Luis Muriel have a better goals-per-minute ratio than the Italian, who will be keen to make up for not scoring against Celtic last time out. Lazio\u2019s 2-1 defeat two weeks ago is the only club game in the last eight matches. Hello everyone! Hot Europa League action for you tonight, we\u2019ve no less than 23 matches to tell you about: That\u2019s not including Arsenal\u2019s match at Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es, a 1-1 draw which they were probably lucky to get, with the Portuguese side hitting the post and missing another golden chance at the death. As you can see above, we\u2019re into the second half now of Astana v AZ, with the Dutch side leading 1-0 thanks to promising 18-year-old striker Myron Boadu. A maverick 3.50pm (GMT) kick-off time there. We\u2019ll have team news for Lazio v Celtic and some of the other 5.55pm GMT kick-offs very shortly.",

      "bodyText": "Brazil\u2019s bitterly divided politics reached a new low on Thursday, when a rightwing columnist smacked the US journalist Glenn Greenwald in the face on a live radio program. Greenwald and Augusto Nunes are prominent figures on opposite ends of the political spectrum, but Thursday\u2019s physical violence \u2013 which was being livestreamed \u2013 left Brazilians stunned. Greenwald has become a central figure in Brazilian politics after publishing a string of articles challenging the legitimacy of the country\u2019s largest-ever corruption investigation. His reporting \u2013 based on a trove of leaked mobile phone messages \u2013 has been particularly damaging for the government of Jair Bolsonaro, making Greenwald a hate figure for those on Brazil\u2019s far right, who have accused him of illegal hacking. The altercation came when the two men appeared on a program for the Jovem Pan radio station on Thursday. Nunes, a well-known columnist for Veja magazine, had previously suggested that a family judge should look into taking away Greenwald\u2019s adopted children. Referring to Nunes\u2019s comments, Greenwald said: \u201cWhat he did was the ugliest, dirtiest thing I have seen in my career as a journalist.\u201d Nunes responded that he was merely asking who took care of Greenwald\u2019s children while his husband \u2013 the congressman David Miranda \u2013 was in the capital and the journalist was \u201cspending all his time dealing with stolen material\u201d. Greenwald accused Nunes of being a coward, prompting Nunes to take a swing at Greenwald. The two started lashing out at each other before they were pulled apart by station staff. In Brazil\u2019s current hyper-partisan atmosphere, reaction was divided predictably along political lines. Ciro Gomes, a leftwing politician who ran for president in 2018, called Nunes \u201cvermin\u201d and a \u201clowlife\u201d. Nunes was \u201cdestroying values, committing slander, aggression, throwing insults and defending the worst values of the corrupt right wing\u201d, he said in a video posted to social media.

Augusto Nunes didn\u2019t have another option. He reacted the way any normal person with blood in their veins would have done,\u201d Bolsonaro tweeted. Greenwald later posted a video to social media saying that Nunes\u2019s attack was homophobic and dangerous. \u201cMillions of Brazilians, and people all over the world \u2026 also have children and both parents work because of financial necessity or because they want to, but \u2026 he only says this about us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis use of physical force and violence in the political debate is very serious.

      "bodyText": "Jonny Bairstow has been asked to remain in New Zealand for next week\u2019s Test warm-up matches as England continue to monitor the fitness of Joe Denly. Bairstow, playing in the Twenty20 series, was dropped from the Test team after the summer\u2019s drawn Ashes series. Ed Smith, the national selector, told Bairstow to \u201creset\u201d and target a return as a specialist batsman, rather than his previous role as wicketkeeper. Denly has returned to training after suffering strained ankle ligaments at the start of the tour \u2013 the right\u2013hander did some light jogging and batted in the nets \u2013 but England have decided it is best to take the cautious route. Joe Root\u2019s Test squad play a two-day practice match against a New Zealand XI in Whangarei from Tuesday. That is followed by a three-day first-class match against New Zealand A beginning on Friday. The latter is Denly\u2019s target at this stage. It therefore hands Bairstow a chance to push his claims for the two-match Test series against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui starting on 21 November, even if England are saying at this stage the 30-year-old is only providing cover for Denly. England\u2019s red-ball players have arrived to begin preparations for the series \u2013 one that sits outside the World Test Championship points system \u2013 and will be joined by Darren Gough, the former quick who will spend the next two weeks as a consultant to the seamers. With Paul Collingwood about to sign a full-time contract as an assistant coach, it leaves the fast-bowling role as the one remaining vacancy in Chris Silverwood\u2019s backroom staff. Shane Bond, currently with the New Zealand camp for a short spell, performed this role for England during the first two Tests of the 2017-18 Ashes and built a strong rapport with Joe Root. Bond did not rule himself out but also summed up England\u2019s difficulty in finding a suitable candidate: the 44-year-old\u2019s freelance T20 work at Mumbai Indians and Sydney Thunder \u2013 and an upcoming assistant position with Southern Brave in The Hundred \u2013 is potentially more lucrative and less time-consuming than international cricket. Bond said: \u201cThe biggest challenge of the international game is the grind of a coach. Look at England in particular: 300 days a year on the road, it\u2019s challenging on family life. Whether it\u2019s coaches or players, good management of people is paramount.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A Chilean police major who shot two students during a school protest has been arrested as a wave of political unrest enters a third week and the number of injured in street violence topped 2,000. Maj Humberto Tapia was arrested by detectives on Thursday and charged with illegally discharging his shotgun inside a public school that had been occupied by students on Tuesday. A call by the beleaguered principal led to a confrontation with students in which Tapia fired into the floor, sending buckshot ricocheting into the legs of students. The arrest came a day after prosecutors announced that 12 other police were under investigation for allegedly beating a 55-year-old man \u2013 and amid growing allegations that officers had raped and sexually abused detained protesters. At least three soldiers have been charged for shooting protesters while an estimated 4,500 protesters have been arrested, although the vast majority have been released within 24 hours. What began as a protest over a rise in subway fares has grown into a tsunami of unrest in which hundreds of thousands of Chileans have joined peaceful marches calling for an overhaul of the country\u2019s economic and social model. Some protests have also turned violent and arson and looting is calculated to have caused as much as $1.5bn in damages. Chile\u2019s embattled president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, has been accused of a heavy-handed response to the protests: he initially responded by saying the country was \u201cat war\u201d and has since appeared to lurch between conciliation and further crackdown. On Thursday afternoon, he summoned the heads of the armed forces, supreme court and congress for an urgent meeting of the national security council and called for emergency legislation to increase prison sentences for protesters who wear masks, build barricades or destroy property. Pi\u00f1era also called for the creation of a new intelligence effort to increase surveillance of politically active Chileans. Such efforts are likely to cause concern in a country that only emerged from military rule in 1990 and has since witnessed a string of scandals involving the police. Last week, thousands of documents were dumped on the internet after the national police computer system was hacked, revealing surveillance of students and environmental activists. Jorge Sharp, a former student protest leader who is now mayor of the port city of Valpara\u00edso, said on Twitter that Pi\u00f1era had missed the point. \u201cMore repression won\u2019t resolve the social injustices,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cIt will only provoke more violence.\u201d In an attempt to defuse the nationwide rebellion that has lowered his approval rating to 9%, Pi\u00f1era has met with an injured protester and told the country in a broadcast that he too had participated in marches and fought for justice. But when his health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, arrived at Salvador hospital in Santiago on Thursday morning to visit injured civilians, a spontaneous protest led by nurses, doctors and hospital staff led to scenes of chaos. Ma\u00f1alich was first trapped inside the hospital, then barely made it into a ministerial car, which, as it left the public hospital, proceeded to run over one of the protesters.",

Mint-flavored products reportedly account for 70% of Juul\u2019s sales and are particularly popular with younger vapers. According to a Journal of the American Medical Association study published this week high school students use mint more than any other of Juul\u2019s flavors. \u201cThese results are unacceptable and that is why we must reset the vapor category in the US and earn the trust of society by working cooperatively with regulators, attorneys general, public health officials, and other stakeholders to combat underage use,\u201d Juul\u2019s chief executive officer, KC Crosthwaite, said in a statement. The decision to end mint sales comes after Juul dropped other flavors, including mango, that were popular with adolescent e-cigarette users. The Journal of the American Medical Association study found that more than half of teenagers who vape use Juul e-cigarettes, and its mint pods were the number one choice of high school students. Pressure to end the sales mounted after a former Juul executive claimed in a wrongful termination lawsuit that the company knew teens would buy mint products when mango was taken off the market. \u201cYou need to have an IQ of 5 to know that when customers don\u2019t find mango they buy mint,\u201d the then chief executive, Kevin Burns, allegedly told employees, according to the lawsuit. Juul has called the wrongful termination claim \u201cbaseless\u201d and has said it will vigorously defend it. Juul\u2019s decision to drop its most popular product comes as the Trump administration is preparing to ban the sale of flavored vaping products amid record levels of vaping among teenagers. Vaping advocates have pushed for the administration to exempt mint and menthol flavors from the ban. Some 27.5% of high school students, and 10.5% of middle school students, said they had used e-cigarettes in the past month, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association study. Vaping-related illnesses have also increased. On Thursday health officials reported 2,051 confirmed and probable cases of a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping and a further two deaths, taking the death toll to 39. The cause of those deaths and illnesses has yet to be ascertained but have been linked to the use of vaping oils containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 8 November. Top stories Emmanuel Macron has launched a remarkable broadside at Donald Trump, saying the US\u2019s recent actions in Syria signified \u201cbrain death\u201d for the Nato alliance, while flagging that European nations may not be able to rely on the US to defend its allies. The French president accused Washington of \u201cturning its back on us\u201d by not consulting leading European powers such as Britain, Germany or France before paving the way for Turkey to launch a polarising military offensive into Syria. Macron described Europe as \u201con the edge of precipice\u201d and in need of its own military force. A Queensland venture that was awarded a $1m government grant to boost regional jobs is losing money and facing deregistration, and the project is unlikely to happen for at least two years. One of 200 companies to receive a federal investment grant, Dindarr Pty Ltd had no previous experience in the transport sector but was looking to set up \u201cfast, low-cost ferry and bus services\u201d between Cairns and the Yarrahbah Indigenous community. The company\u2019s director, Peter McAllister, confirmed he has already had to lay off three bus drivers, but remained confident total staff could number 12 by mid-2020. Anthony Albanese will attempt to draw a line under Labor Party recriminations, as he publicly presents an internal review\u2019s key findings into the May federal election loss. Weak strategy, poor adaptability and an unpopular leader were the key factors offered by the report. Albanese will also use his press club address to outline future recommendations, including caps on individual donations and legislation governing truth in political advertising. Australia The Northern Territory and federal governments are failing to make gains on child protection issues, despite spending $500m annually, the Productivity Commission has said. Inadequate coordination between agencies and dual or multiple service provision were major issues undermining effectiveness, the report stated. Scott Morrison\u2019s promise to introduce a waste export ban could be doomed to fail, groups representing the waste and recycling industry have warned state and territory environment ministers, citing a lack of investment in local waste processing facilities. Key farming areas could become \u201cmore marginal and unproductive\u201d due to worsening drought, which must be accepted as an enduring feature of the Australian landscape due to climate change, drought coordinator Maj Gen Stephen Day has said. The world A potentially key witness in the Trump impeachment inquiry has failed to front, with former national security adviser John Bolton reportedly \u201cwilling\u201d to appear but requiring the committee to clear the way for him to do so, via the courts. Boris Johnson has offered a \u201ccast iron\u201d pledge to block any attempts for a second Scottish independence referendum, calling Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn \u201cyoke-mates of destruction\u201d. Hundreds of far-right extremists around the world could be identified, after an apparent online leak from a neo-Nazi website, Iron March. At least nine fascist groups around the world, including in Australia, are understood to be linked to the website. Italian farmers have descended on Rome en masse, protesting against the damage caused by wild boar. About two million feral pigs are estimated to be roaming free across Italy, and have been deemed responsible for an average of 10,000 road accidents annually. 15,000-year-old pits to trap mammoths have been unearthed in Mexico, with archaeologists discovering more than 800 bones from up to 14 animals in one pit. Recommended reads A master of squalor and cruelty, acclaimed author Christos Tsiolkas has turned his hand to Jerusalem and Antioch post-Jesus, in his new book, Damascus. \u201cThis is a novel that mourns what the world might have been, had bickering Christians back then agreed on a kinder version of Christ\u2019s message,\u201d writes David Marr. It\u2019s a novel treating a \u201clifetime\u2019s reckoning\u201d with the seminal messenger of Christianity, Paul: \u201ca stuttering zealot with a high-pitched voice \u2026 who masters himself, his rivals and his last doubts to remake the world\u201d. What does treasure hunting look like in the 21st century? Well, for starters, some modern-day bullion chasers prefer the term \u201carchaeo-metal detectorist\u201d, writes Jeff Sparrow, who speaks to three fascinating Australians, hunting everything from lost wedding rings to Spanish doubloons. There are two months left of the 2010s \u2013 which begs the question: what will now look like later? Imagine in 30 years the 2010s as a theme party, writes Brigid Delaney. Maxi dresses, salmon-pink shirts for men, sneakers instead of stilettos \u2013 for drinks there are espresso martinis, prosecco and hyper-local small batch gin. Food is poke bowls, cronuts and share plates. \u201cSince being banned by President Donald Trump at the end of the decade, vaping has gone underground. So in a smoky cloud of nostalgia that feels very 2017, vapers inhale a cinnamon and strawberry donut flavoured Juul.\u201d Listen Australia has the most diverse birdlife on Earth and Australians in cities, suburbs and country towns have a special relationship with our boisterous and beautiful feathered friends. In this episode of Full Story, Birdlife Australia\u2019s Sean Dooley talks to Laura Murphy-Oates about what makes these relationships unique and listeners call in to tell their best avian anecdotes. But with an endangered bird currently in the lead for the 2019 Australian bird of the year, Dooley and Murphy-Oates consider whether we are looking after our diverse birdlife well enough? Sport A once-in-a-generation athletic prodigy has opened up about years of physical and emotional abuse, detailing her treatment by now-disgraced coach Alberto Salazar, Sean Ingle writes. Scottish Rugby Union has been fined \u00a370,000 for its verbal brinkmanship during the Japan World Cup. CEO Mark Dodson was found to have brought the game into disrepute by suggesting the nation faced being disadvantaged by hosts Japan. And it wouldn\u2019t be Friday without your weekly David Squires \u2026 on Louis Fenton\u2019s foul-mouthed A-League tirade. Media roundup The NSW police minister, David Elliot, has denied manhandling a 17-year-old P-plate driver after an alleged road-rage incident but confirms he \u201cblew up\u201d at the boy, writes the Australian. Cracks found on 737 aircrafts owned by Indonesia\u2019s Lion Air have prompted renewed calls for Qantas and Virgin Australia to inspect their entire fleets, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. And the longest murder investigation in Australian history is set to go to court later this month, with the West Australian calling for the trial to be viewed publicly, online. Coming up Environment ministers meet on Friday in Adelaide, where they are expected to announce a timetable to end the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres.

      "bodyText": "Four indigenous Mexicans who were illegally detained and abused by immigration agents during a US-backed crackdown have received a rare public apology by the Mexican government for the ordeal. The group were on a bus of seasonal farmhands in central Mexico when apprehended in 2015 by immigration agents who targeted them because of their physical features, clothes and limited Spanish. The agents accused the four of being undocumented immigrants from Guatemala, but they were indigenous Tzeltal Mayans from the poor state of Chiapas in southern Mexico, where 25% of the population speak an indigenous language. Shortly after the ordeal, the Guardian revealed that three of the four \u2013 siblings aged 15 to 24 \u2013 were taken to a detention centre in Quer\u00e9taro in central Mexico and held for eight days. One of them, then aged 18, was beaten and given electric shocks until he agreed to sign a deportation document admitting they were Guatemalan, even though he cannot read or write. The siblings narrowly avoided being expelled from their home country after the fourth \u2013 the older sister\u2019s boyfriend \u2013 alerted a human rights organization. On Thursday, Mexico\u2019s current immigration (INM) chief admitted they were subjected to human rights violations as a result of racial profiling. \u201cOn behalf of the National Migration Institute, I offer this public apology, for the transgression of their human rights, for the damage to their image, honor and dignity caused by the actions of the migration agents,\u201d said Francisco Gardu\u00f1o Y\u00e1\u00f1ez. Six immigration officials, who have not been named, were suspended for two to four weeks for their role in the abuse, Gardu\u00f1o said. The apology does not mention torture, even though the Human Rights Commission in Mexico City concluded that Alberto suffered post-traumatic psychological symptoms as a result of being tortured. \u201cI really thought I was going to die, so I signed lots of sheets of paper \u2013 but I can\u2019t read or write so I didn\u2019t know what I was signing,\u201d Alberto told the Guardian through a translator in 2016. At the time, the INM denied the incident ever happened. As part of its package of reparation measures, the INM has also pledged to stamp out racial profiling by training agents in cultural sensitivity and human rights: \u201cThe institute is committed to ensuring that human rights violations like these do not happen again,\u201d Gardu\u00f1o said.

      "body": "<p>Electoral pacts remain rare in UK politics; but they are not new. The first Labour MPs arrived in parliament in 1906 after a pact with the Liberals. During the world wars, the main parties observed non-aggression byelection deals. In 1983 and 1987, Liberals and the Social Democratic party struck a general election seats pact. And there have been notable individual constituency deals too. These range from the Oxford byelection in 1938 over the appeasement of Hitler to the Batley and Spen byelection in 2016 after the murder of Jo Cox. In Northern Ireland, tactical withdrawals to give a nationalist or a unionist a clearer run at the other remain commonplace to this day. A slew of new arrangements of this kind are likely to have a big impact in <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-election-nireland/brexit-prompts-northern-ireland-electoral-pacts-that-could-shake-dup-grip-idUKKBN1XF1ZK\" title=\"\">Northern Ireland\u2019s 18 seats</a> next month.</p> <p>This week\u2019s announcement of a <a href=\"https://www.unitetoremain.org/\" title=\"\">Unite to Remain</a> pact on 12 December between the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and Plaid Cymru is therefore not unprecedented. It could be significant in three ways: its immediate impact in a number of tightly contested constituencies in England and Wales next month, its consequences for Brexit and, perhaps more lastingly, for the wider signal it sends that traditional partisan politics are under challenge from shifting alliances of less tribal voters. This in turn is partly a result of the transforming impact of Brexit on British party politics and partly of a perception that both Labour and the Conservatives have moved decisively towards the extremes. This has helped to spawn new campaigns such as <a href=\"http://www.commongrounduk.com/\" title=\"\">Common Ground</a> and the all-party <a href=\"https://moreunited.org.uk/\" title=\"\">More United</a> movement.</p> <p>There is no getting away from the fact that this week\u2019s pact is only a deal between three minor parties. The SNP and Labour \u2013 the former a remain party, the latter a party with a large majority of remain voters \u2013 have both refused to join in. The pact involves only 60 seats out of 650, 43 of them in England and 17 in Wales. Its direct impact is likely to be small. While it increases the chances of the Lib Dems in, say, Richmond Park, the Greens in Bristol West and Plaid in Ynys M\u00f4n, all three of which are among the respective parties\u2019 targets, it still leaves the Greens and Plaid a long way from translating the pact into more seats at Westminster. If the pact delivers, the Liberal Democrats stand to be the disproportionate beneficiaries. Even so, in a tight election even a small number of Conservative losses in seats the party might have expected to win in the absence of a pact <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/polling-expert-john-curtice-makes-prediction-about-remain-pact-1-6363288\" title=\"\">could be vital</a>.</p> <p>The other 572 seats in Britain \u2013 the overwhelming majority \u2013 will not be directly affected by this week\u2019s pact. True, a small number, including Beaconsfield, Broxtowe, Calder Valley and Luton South, have already witnessed unilateral Lib Dem or Green withdrawals in order to help pro-remain candidates, including pro-remain Labour ones.

      "bodyText": "Electoral pacts remain rare in UK politics; but they are not new. The first Labour MPs arrived in parliament in 1906 after a pact with the Liberals. During the world wars, the main parties observed non-aggression byelection deals. In 1983 and 1987, Liberals and the Social Democratic party struck a general election seats pact. And there have been notable individual constituency deals too. These range from the Oxford byelection in 1938 over the appeasement of Hitler to the Batley and Spen byelection in 2016 after the murder of Jo Cox. In Northern Ireland, tactical withdrawals to give a nationalist or a unionist a clearer run at the other remain commonplace to this day. A slew of new arrangements of this kind are likely to have a big impact in Northern Ireland\u2019s 18 seats next month. This week\u2019s announcement of a Unite to Remain pact on 12 December between the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and Plaid Cymru is therefore not unprecedented. It could be significant in three ways: its immediate impact in a number of tightly contested constituencies in England and Wales next month, its consequences for Brexit and, perhaps more lastingly, for the wider signal it sends that traditional partisan politics are under challenge from shifting alliances of less tribal voters. This in turn is partly a result of the transforming impact of Brexit on British party politics and partly of a perception that both Labour and the Conservatives have moved decisively towards the extremes. This has helped to spawn new campaigns such as Common Ground and the all-party More United movement. There is no getting away from the fact that this week\u2019s pact is only a deal between three minor parties. The SNP and Labour \u2013 the former a remain party, the latter a party with a large majority of remain voters \u2013 have both refused to join in. The pact involves only 60 seats out of 650, 43 of them in England and 17 in Wales. Its direct impact is likely to be small. While it increases the chances of the Lib Dems in, say, Richmond Park, the Greens in Bristol West and Plaid in Ynys M\u00f4n, all three of which are among the respective parties\u2019 targets, it still leaves the Greens and Plaid a long way from translating the pact into more seats at Westminster. If the pact delivers, the Liberal Democrats stand to be the disproportionate beneficiaries. Even so, in a tight election even a small number of Conservative losses in seats the party might have expected to win in the absence of a pact could be vital. The other 572 seats in Britain \u2013 the overwhelming majority \u2013 will not be directly affected by this week\u2019s pact. True, a small number, including Beaconsfield, Broxtowe, Calder Valley and Luton South, have already witnessed unilateral Lib Dem or Green withdrawals in order to help pro-remain candidates, including pro-remain Labour ones. True also, there are likely to be informal decisions by Labour not to contest some Lib Dem target seats very strongly; perhaps even some formal decisions too, as advocated by Clive Lewis or Paul Mason. But the main effect of the pact in these seats is likely to be through osmosis and as a result of anti-Brexit tactical voting campaigns. This week the Labour deputy leader Tom Watson joined the increasingly long list of moderately inclined Labour and Conservative MPs stepping down from politics. His departure, and those of many recent Tory ministers, seem to confirm that the big parties are not interested in working across even their own divides, never mind those between them.

      "bodyText": "Two former Labour MPs have urged voters to back Boris Johnson to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, saying the Labour leader is \u201ccompletely unfit\u201d to be in charge of the country. In remarks seized upon by Tory ministers, Ian Austin said he would not run again as an MP but wanted to speak out against Corbyn. Austin, a longtime critic of the Labour leader, who left the party over claims it had failed to do enough to tackle antisemitism in its ranks, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere\u2019s only two people who are going to be prime minister on 13 December, Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson. And I think Jeremy Corbyn is completely unfit to lead our country. Completely unfit to lead the Labour party.\u201d He said he was telling \u201cdecent, traditional, patriotic Labour voters that they should be voting for Boris Johnson at this election\u201d, claiming that Corbyn had \u201cspent his entire time in politics working with and defending all sorts of people: extremists and in some cases antisemites and terrorists\u201d. Austin added: \u201cIn the end, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a patriot. I don\u2019t think he loves his country.

This is the rich protesting against reasoned debate. Given that rich rightwing elites have most of the written media on their side, it\u2019s rich in a different sense that they claim to be oppressed by us financially poorer leftwing intellectuals. The repeated focus on the allegedly improper influence of the intellectual elite, rather than engaging with the evidence-based arguments about international cooperation, climate change, public services and inequality, demonstrates their lack of self-confidence in defending their own interests.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/07/general-election-sajid-javid-and-john-mcdonnell-come-out-fighting-on-economy-live-news?page=with:block-5dc4153c8f0867dcebfd0682#block-5dc4153c8f0867dcebfd0682\">1.04pm.)</a></p> \n  <p>But in an interview on the World at One, <strong>Prof Sir John Curtice</strong>, the leading elections expert, said that in practice he thought the pact would result in remain parties winning only around six more seats than if the three parties had been competing against each other.</p> \n  <p>He said just over one in three of the 60 seats were already held by one of the three pro-remain parties, or by Labour, which is committed to a referendum with remain as an option. And he said that in some of these seats, and in some seats where the Lib Dems were not far behind the Conservatives in 2017, the Greens did not stand anyway two years ago. </p> \n  <p>As a result, he said there were \u201cprobably, perhaps, five or six seats that might not be otherwise won by the Liberal Democrats, if they faced competition from the Greens or, in a couple of instances, from Plaid [that might now be won].\u201d He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That\u2019s probably the order of the impact given the current standing in the polls. Obviously, if the Liberal Democrats were to improve in the polls nationally, the picture might differ.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Curtice said that, by standing down in Beaconsfield, the Lib Dems and the Greens might also help Dominic Grieve to hold the seat, following his loss of the Conservative whip. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Around half a dozen seats that might otherwise be Conservative might go to one or other of these parties, or to Dominic Grieve.</p> \n   <p>Now, if the election is very close, it could be crucial. But, to be honest, given where the polls are at the moment, with about a 10-point Conservative lead, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be enough.

Now Osborne edits the Evening Standard, and he does not seem over-impressed by Javid\u2019s plan to turn on the borrowing taps. Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/evening-standard-comment-borrowing-now-taxes-later-as-spending-soars-a4281221.html\">today\u2019s Standard editorial</a>.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Number 11 is doing a heroic job trying to restrain its neighbours, but they too want to spend more.

That\u2019s the real choice.</p> \n   <p>What isn\u2019t a choice is that the ordinary taxpayer will pick up the bill. Because all borrowing is just higher taxes deferred. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Interestingly, in the editorial (which would have been approved by Osborne, if not actually written by him), the Standard also suggests that Boris Johnson is going to put plans for a \u201cnational care service\u201d at the heart of his manifesto. </p> \n  <p>Labour is also proposing a \u201cnational care service\u201d, although <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49787468\">the policy it announced at its party conference in the autumn</a> was just for personal care to be free, at a cost of \u00a36bn a year, not for all social care to be free.</p> \n  <p>This is what the Standard is predicting in its editorial.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s attitude to the public finances is simple: I\u2019m in charge, and if I don\u2019t spend it someone else will.</p> \n   <p>No 10 wants to make billions of pounds worth of commitments on spending and tax cuts during this campaign. The big idea for the Tory manifesto is social care. That might send a shiver down the spine of Conservative candidates who remember the fiasco of the 2017 manifesto pledge to make the well-off pay for their care.</p> \n   <p>But this Downing Street has found a different group of people to pay for it: you, the general public.</p> \n   <p>Get ready for plans for a national care service, funded out of general taxation like the NHS. It\u2019s a big expansion of the state \u2014 and an idea the Tories attacked when Labour proposed it a decade ago.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/George_Osborne/status/1192418464704675841\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our editorial \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EveningStandard?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EveningStandard</a>\u2069: all parties want to borrow more now, which means higher taxes later <a href=\"https://t.co/nTKR6vlBL7\">https://t.co/nTKR6vlBL7</a></p>\u2014 George Osborne (@George_Osborne) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/George_Osborne/status/1192418464704675841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 7, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-07T14:23:19.675Z\">at 2.23pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc41ea88f08c2d1f80db634\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-07T13:40:25.442Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Green party in Northern Ireland has announced it will not stand in any of Belfast\u2019s four constituencies in a bid to assist the election of pro-remain MPs, PA Media reports.

He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The real question, in the short run, is would it be possible sensibly to spend this scale of money.

\u201cbrainwashing\u201d, but according to the universities\u2019 regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), institutions now have a duty to facilitate the electoral registration of students.</p> \n  <p>Dan Elphick, a music lecturer, was among those to flag up his efforts to encourage student votes, when he said he was setting aside five minutes of his lecture time to allow students to register online, adding: \u201cI see this as being a vital part of their education.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The initiative has been supported by the University College Union (UCU), which represents university

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/boris-johnson-goes-on-attack-election-speech-after-high-profile-tory-gaffes\">Johnson kicked off the Conservative election campaign</a> yesterday with a speech in Birmingham that he hopes will give his party some positive momentum after a series of damaging gaffes in recent days. These include Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/06/rees-mogg-keeps-low-profile-after-grenfell-comments-outrage\">suggestion that victims of the Grenfell Tower fire lacked common sense</a> and <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/06/alun-cairns-welsh-secretary-resigns-from-cabinet-over-trial-allegations\">Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, having to resign</a> over his knowledge of a former aide\u2019s role in allegedly sabotaging a rape trial. </p> \n  <p>Johnson came out swinging at Corbyn, whom he accused of planning tax rises to fund \u201cderanged\u201d nationalism; at parliament, which he said was \u201cparalysed, blocked, generally incapable of digestive function, as an anaconda that has swallowed a tapir\u201d; and without naming him, at Nigel Farage, as the Brexit party leader has refused requests from pro-leave Tories to stand down Brexit party candidates in their seats. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the barricades,\u201d Johnson told supporters.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"446e419a-7ad6-44c8-96fa-8059ecb07419\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Lc1_nYlsj1Q?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc3a69f8f0867dcebfd038f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-lyons\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-07T05:59:10.867Z\">5.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning and welcome to the first day of the official election campaign. It has not yet been 24 hours since Boris Johnson visited the Queen, dissolved parliament, and formally announced that a general election would take place on 12 December, and already we have seen high drama.</p> \n  <p>On the Labour side this came as <strong>Tom Watson </strong>announced last night that <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-to-quit-as-labour-deputy-leader-and-stand-down-as-mp\">he will step down </a><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-to-quit-as-labour-deputy-leader-and-stand-down-as-mp\">as deputy leader</a>. Watson \u2013 who has spent 35 years in full-time politics, and has represented West Bromwich East as its MP since 2001 \u2013 has repeatedly clashed with Jeremy Corbyn, including over the Labour leader\u2019s Brexit stance and handling of antisemitism. </p> \n  <p>His departure is likely to reignite the debate about the direction of the Labour party under Corbyn after one senior Labour figure said Watson\u2019s announcement had led to \u201ca great sense of desolation and abandonment sweeping the moderates\u201d in the party. </p> \n  <p>Watson insisted his resignation was \u201cpersonal, not political\u201d and said he would \u201cspend this election fighting for brilliant Labour candidates and a better future for our country\u201d. Corbyn thanked Watson, saying: \u201cFew people have given as much to the Labour movement as you have.\u201d For his part Watson says he has a lot of irons in the fire, including training to become a gym instructor and a book about weight loss coming out in January. Here he is, talking about his plans for life post-politics.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff8fee9b-43b3-4549-9331-63e2106743b1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iAdvOZckGxM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Meanwhile today, Sajid Javid and his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, are <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/07/sajid-javid-and-john-mcdonnell-shift-battle-to-economy\">both set to give speeches in the north-west of England</a>. </p> \n  <p>Javid is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/sajid-javid-and-john-mcdonnell-shift-battle-to-economy\">expected to hammer Labour on the economy</a>, saying the Tories won\u2019t \u201clet Labour off the hook like last time\u201d. In 2017, the Conservatives\u2019 claims that Labour was relying on a \u201cmagic money tree\u201d to fund its lavish spending pledges fell flat when Theresa May\u2019s party failed to publish costings of its own policies. But Javid will signal the Tories\u2019 determination to attack Labour on the economy relentlessly over the next five weeks \u2013 although unlike two years ago, the government is touting a series of multibillion pound spending pledges of its own.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile McDonnell will announce a \u00a3100bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d to \u201crepair the fabric that the Tories have torn apart\u201d.</p> \n  <p>As usual, you can get in touch with me via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsKateLyons\">Twitter</a> and email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com).

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives and Labour have unveiled plans for an infrastructure spending boom that would increase investment in road, rail and buildings to the highest levels in more than 40 years, with both parties signalling a large rise in public borrowing to pay for it. John McDonnell has announced a radical Labour plan to commit \u00a3400bn of investment to what he called the twin crises of the climate emergency and social deprivation, saying \u201cfuture generations would never forgive us\u201d if rapid action was not taken. Sajid Javid has ripped up the Conservative party\u2019s former fiscal rules and loosened constraints on borrowing to the tune of \u00a320bn a year, while attacking Labour for planning to \u201csaddle the country with debt\u201d. George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, has said the Tory plans to increase investment spending will mean \u201chigher taxes later\u201d. (See 2.13pm.) Pro-EU candidates have said they are \u201cputting party politics aside\u201d at the launch of a pact under which they have agreed not to stand against each other in 60 seats at the general election to avoid splitting the remain vote. A former Lib Dem candidate in Wales has said that many Welsh Liberal Democrats are unhappy about his party being involved in the Unite to Remain pact. (See 4.26pm.) Ian Austin, the former Labour MP and ally of Gordon Brown, has urged the party\u2019s voters to back Boris Johnson to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, saying the Labour leader is \u201ccompletely unfit\u201d to lead the country. Boris Johnson has made a \u201ccast iron\u201d pledge that he will not grant Nicola Sturgeon the powers she needs to hold a second independence referendum, regardless of whether the Scottish National party wins a majority of Scottish seats in December\u2019s general election or if they win a pro-independence majority in the Holyrood elections of 2021. Boris Johnson has been forced to distance himself from comments made by a Conservative parliamentary candidate who once said women should keep their \u201cknickers on\u201d to avoid rape. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey on Ian Austin\u2019s decision to endorse the Tories. In a clip broadcast on the BBC, Jeremy Corbyn was asked to respond to the front page Jewish Chronicle editorial that says most British Jews think he is antisemitic. In his reply, Corbyn said that many Jewish people in Britain did not agree with what the paper was saying and that Labour had confronted the issue. He said: Antisemitism is a poison and an evil in our society. Any form of racism is a poison and an evil in our society. I have spent my whole life fighting against racism. I will die an anti-racist. I want every community to feel safe and supported in this country \u2013 the Jewish community, the Muslim community, any other community from any faith or any other part of the world. Our party has confronted the issue. We have suspended or expelled members. We have an education programme. And all of that has been set up since I became the leader of this party. And we will carry on doing exactly that. There are many Jewish people in this country who are members of the Labour party, supporters of the Labour party, work with the Labour party, and they do not share the views that have been put forward on the front page of the Jewish Chronicle. I regret the Jewish Chronicle has chosen to say that. I simply say to everyone: our community is stronger when people work together, when we recognise the danger and poison that antisemitism is. We will be a stronger community when we defeat all forms of racism. And I will be part of that campaign to eradicate racism in any form. At the Unite to Remain press conference this morning it was claimed that \u201cat least 44\u201d of the 60 seats covered by the Lib Dem/Green/Plaid Cymru pact were winnable. (See 1.04pm.) But in an interview on the World at One, Prof Sir John Curtice, the leading elections expert, said that in practice he thought the pact would result in remain parties winning only around six more seats than if the three parties had been competing against each other. He said just over one in three of the 60 seats were already held by one of the three pro-remain parties, or by Labour, which is committed to a referendum with remain as an option. And he said that in some of these seats, and in some seats where the Lib Dems were not far behind the Conservatives in 2017, the Greens did not stand anyway two years ago. As a result, he said there were \u201cprobably, perhaps, five or six seats that might not be otherwise won by the Liberal Democrats, if they faced competition from the Greens or, in a couple of instances, from Plaid [that might now be won].\u201d He went on: That\u2019s probably the order of the impact given the current standing in the polls. Obviously, if the Liberal Democrats were to improve in the polls nationally, the picture might differ. Curtice said that, by standing down in Beaconsfield, the Lib Dems and the Greens might also help Dominic Grieve to hold the seat, following his loss of the Conservative whip. He went on: Around half a dozen seats that might otherwise be Conservative might go to one or other of these parties, or to Dominic Grieve. Now, if the election is very close, it could be crucial. But, to be honest, given where the polls are at the moment, with about a 10-point Conservative lead, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be enough. But of course these parties are hoping that in the end the Conservatives won\u2019t do so well as they are currently doing in the polls. A Lib Dem candidate asked to stand aside as part of the Unite to Remain pact has vowed to run as an independent and said members of his party were \u201cextremely unhappy\u201d about how the deal was struck. As PA Media reports, Mike Powell, who intended to stand in Pontypridd as a Lib Dem candidate, said he was asked to stand aside three weeks ago. The pact involves the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green party agreeing not to stand against each other in 60 seats across England and Wales to give voters a single choice for a remain-supporting candidate. Powell, who has been a councillor since 1999, has refused to cooperate with the pact and will instead stand as an independent. As part of the pact, a Plaid candidate will stand in Pontypridd, PA Media reports. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s World at One, Powell said there was \u201cdisquiet and discomfort\u201d within the Welsh Lib Dems about the pact. Explaining his decision to run as an independent, he said: I think that people deserve to have an opportunity to vote for someone who\u2019s going to represent the people of Pontypridd, rather than standing to represent a cause to remove Wales from the United Kingdom. When it was put to him that by standing he would split the remain vote, he said: I don\u2019t think I will split the remain vote. That won\u2019t happen. It will not be a split. I understand the fundamentals. We\u2019re dealing with Plaid Cymru, they\u2019re the Welsh nationalist party. We\u2019re not dealing with the Scottish nationalist party, we\u2019re not dealing with the English nationalist party. These are nationalists. They want to remove Wales from the United Kingdom. I don\u2019t see them as a remain party as such. Their ultimate goal is to remove Wales from the United Kingdom. And myself and a lot of people in the valleys are not prepared to vote for that. Powell said many Welsh Liberal Democrats felt the same way: I know there are an awful lot of members in the Welsh Liberal Democrats who are extremely unhappy with the way this negotiation has been dealt with. Jeremy Corbyn has been in Rossendale and Darwen this afternoon. He said it was the 15th constituency he had visited in the campaign. It is a Conservative seat (Jake Berry was the sitting MP), but Labour finished behind by just 3,216 votes at the last election. In a short speech, he criticised the Daily Telegraph for the way it used its front page yesterday to promote Boris Johnson\u2019s column defending billionaires. He said: When the Tories and Boris Johnson decide to make the front page of the Daily Telegraph a defence of billionaires, it\u2019s a bid odd, it\u2019s a bit weird. I would have thought they\u2019d have some humility, some humility to understand just how offensive all of that is. At his Q&amp;A in Liverpool, when asked about Labour\u2019s handling of antisemitism allegations (in the light of what Ian Austin has been saying today), John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Labour had done what the Jewish community had asked it to do on this issue. (See 11.58am.) He said the same thing later on the World at One, telling the programme: Look, everything that has been asked of us by the Jewish community we\u2019ve done. We were asked to look at antisemitism in the party and we\u2019ve done a detailed investigation. We\u2019ve identified a small, a tiny number, of antisemitic activities and we\u2019ve dealt with it. We were asked to ensure we had disciplinary procedures that were fast, and I was saying ruthless as well, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve expelled people. We were asked to set up an education programme. We\u2019ve done that with independent organisations. I just say to them, have a look again at the reality of what we\u2019ve done because actually we\u2019ve done everything asked of us. But the Jewish Labour Movement, the mainstream organisation for Jews in the party, has said McDonnell is wrong, and that the party has not been doing enough. Boris Johnson has made a \u201ccast iron\u201d pledge that he will not grant Nicola Sturgeon the powers she needs to hold a second independence referendum, regardless of whether the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats in December\u2019s general election or if they win a pro-independence majority in the Holyrood elections of 2021. In his strongest rebuff yet to Sturgeon\u2019s vow to hold a second vote on independence next year, Johnson used his first visit to Scotland of the election campaign to insist: Absolutely, there is no case whatsoever [for a second referendum] because people were promised in 2014 that it would be a once in a generation event and I see no reason why we should go back on that pledge. Describing Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn as \u201cyoke-mates of destruction\u201d in terms of the future stability of the union, he told reporters: It\u2019s perfectly obvious that Jeremy Corbyn is going to rely on the SNP to get him into power and to do that he\u2019s done a shady deal to have a second referendum. On Wednesday, the leader of Scottish Labour, Richard Leonard, categorically ruled out any form of electoral deal with the SNP, after Johnson warned against making 2020 the \u201cyear of two referendums\u201d and Sturgeon told voters that demand for a second vote on independence would become \u201cirresistible\u201d if her party were to win the election in Scotland. Johnson visited the Roseisle distillery, near Elgin, in Moray, accompanied by the local Scottish Conservative candidate, Douglas Ross, who won the seat from the SNP\u2019s former Westminster leader Angus Robertson in 2017. Johnson spent little over an hour touring the rural distillery in a strictly managed visit during which he had no contact with the public. Boris Johnson has said that the comment from the Tory candidate Nick Conrad, who said in 2014 that women at risk of rape should keep their knickers on (see 12.20pm), was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Johnson told journalists: Those comments are completely unacceptable. He has apologised long ago. But I can\u2019t stress [enough], those comments are completely unacceptable. The Conservative MP Sir George Hollingbery, a former minister and former parliamentary private secretary to Theresa May, has announced that he standing down as an MP. As the Institute for Government\u2019s Gavin Freeguard points out, this takes the tally of MPs leaving parliament up to 72. Richard Tice, the Brexit party chairman, has confirmed that he is standing as a candidate in Hartlepool. As my colleague Josh Halliday reported in his story this morning, before Tice\u2019s candidature had been formally announced, the Labour-held constituency is one of the Brexit party\u2019s key targets. The Brexit party has joint control of the council and got a higher vote in the constituency in the European elections, according to one estimate, than in any other Labour seat. These are from my colleague Steven Morris, who has been with the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, on a campaign visit to Somerset. Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, is going to stand for the Labour deputy leadership after Tom Watson stands down after the election, Bloomberg is reporting. George Osborne was seen as a political patron to Sajid Javid when Osborne was chancellor and Javid was a new MP rapidly getting promoted into government. Now Osborne edits the Evening Standard, and he does not seem over-impressed by Javid\u2019s plan to turn on the borrowing taps. Here is an extract from today\u2019s Standard editorial. Number 11 is doing a heroic job trying to restrain its neighbours, but they too want to spend more. In an echo of his shadow, Sajid Javid announced today his own \u00a3100bn \u201cfund\u201d for a \u201cdecade of renewal\u201d. That\u2019s code for higher capital spending \u2013 on the grounds that one-off commitments to roads and hospital buildings can be turned off more quickly than recurring spending on things like welfare and staffing. All this borrowing by the Tories further shatters the fiscal rules that Philip Hammond established to constrain Theresa May, so his successor is proposing new rules ... Why are the Conservatives going through these contortions? Because they want to borrow more, while preserving their dividing line with Labour. The risk is that they blur a distinction that should be clear: yes the Tories want to spend billions more; but Labour want to spend a great deal more billions than that. That\u2019s the real choice. What isn\u2019t a choice is that the ordinary taxpayer will pick up the bill. Because all borrowing is just higher taxes deferred. Interestingly, in the editorial (which would have been approved by Osborne, if not actually written by him), the Standard also suggests that Boris Johnson is going to put plans for a \u201cnational care service\u201d at the heart of his manifesto. Labour is also proposing a \u201cnational care service\u201d, although the policy it announced at its party conference in the autumn was just for personal care to be free, at a cost of \u00a36bn a year, not for all social care to be free. This is what the Standard is predicting in its editorial. Boris Johnson\u2019s attitude to the public finances is simple: I\u2019m in charge, and if I don\u2019t spend it someone else will. No 10 wants to make billions of pounds worth of commitments on spending and tax cuts during this campaign. The big idea for the Tory manifesto is social care. That might send a shiver down the spine of Conservative candidates who remember the fiasco of the 2017 manifesto pledge to make the well-off pay for their care. But this Downing Street has found a different group of people to pay for it: you, the general public. Get ready for plans for a national care service, funded out of general taxation like the NHS. It\u2019s a big expansion of the state \u2014 and an idea the Tories attacked when Labour proposed it a decade ago. The Green party in Northern Ireland has announced it will not stand in any of Belfast\u2019s four constituencies in a bid to assist the election of pro-remain MPs, PA Media reports. The party had already withdrawn from the South Belfast contest earlier this week to endorse the SDLP\u2019s bid to unseat the outgoing DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly. The CBI, the leading business organisation, has cautiously welcomed the Labour and Conservative plans to spend more on investment. In a statement, Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI chief economist, said: Labour\u2019s ambitions to eradicate regional economic inequalities and upgrading our networks to decarbonise are shared by business. The Conservatives\u2019 new fiscal rules would allow the purse strings to be loosened to modernise our economic infrastructure. The Scottish Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie has appealed for support from Labour voters who feel they are \u201cwithout a political home\u201d. Speaking at his party\u2019s official campaign launch, Rennie said: The Labour party are moving far to the left. They\u2019re out of touch with moderate, reasonable people in this country. People who want to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union and want to focus on the big issues that the country faces. All of those people who are without a political home, I think they need to come with the Liberal Democrats, because we speak for them. Bad news for Northern Ireland\u2019s remainers and good news for the Democratic Unionist party: Lady Sylvia Hermon has decided to step down as an MP. The independent unionist, Northern Ireland\u2019s sole pro-remain voice at Westminster, announced on Wednesday night that she was vacating her North Down seat. The decision dismayed remainers and greatly boosts the DUP\u2019s chances of taking the seat. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s abstention from Westminster meant Hermon was the only Northern Ireland MP to challenge the DUP\u2019s Brexiters and to represent the 56% of people in her country who voted to stay in the EU. Tributes to her 18 years of service flowed from all sides. Hermon was an eloquent, effective parliamentarian. \u201cThis has been a particularly difficult decision but, after much thought, I have concluded that it is the right decision for my family and for me at this time,\u201d Hermon said. The prospect of a tumultuous, toxic campaign in Northern Ireland may also have influenced her decision. Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP had planned to stand aside in North Down to increase her chances of fending off the DUP\u2019s Alex Easton, who closed the gap to 1,200 votes in the last election. He is now favourite to take the seat and offset potential DUP losses in Belfast. Like Ian Austin, John Woodcock was elected as a Labour MP and subsequently left the party, strongly criticising Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership and his handling of the issue of antisemitism (although, unlike Austin, Woodcock was suspended at the time over a misconduct allegation). Woodcock and Austin both sat as independents instead of defecting to another party. Woodcock is standing down as an MP and today, like Austin, he is urging people to vote Conservative to keep Corbyn out of No 10. He said: There are one of two people who are going to be prime minister after an election. It is Boris Johnson or it is Jeremy Corbyn. We pleaded with our friends in the Labour party to face up to this choice, not to leave it until too late. Now all of that, to an extent, is water under the bridge, but we have arrived in a campaign where one of two people are going to be prime minister. The choice to keep Jeremy Corbyn away from Downing Street, to stop him getting his hands on the levers of national security and defence has to be to vote Conservative in this election and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing as well. Northern politicians and business leaders have joined forces with more than 30 regional news organisations to publish the first manifesto for the north, on the second day of an election campaign in which northern England is regarded as a key battleground. The manifesto demands the newly elected government sign up to five \u201cgame changers for the north\u201d, as the two main political leaders address crowds in Teesside, Liverpool and Manchester today. Uniting across political and geographical differences, the \u201cpower up the north\u201d collaboration will present the policy pledges to the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats, demanding they sign up to the vision to \u201cunleash\u201d the north\u2019s potential. The proposals came out of a conference in September, organised by NP11 - a group of the 11 Northern Local Enterprise Partnerships \u2013 and is backed by newspaper front pages across the region including those of the Manchester Evening News, Liverpool Echo, the Yorkshire Post and the Chronicle in Newcastle. They include: Taking local control of education and training Asking the government to make rebalancing the economy a formal Treasury objective A northern transport budget Greater scale and control of investment Placing the north at the helm of a green industrial revolution In an article for the Guardian, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said the pledges could free northerners \u201cfrom the shackles of short-sighted Westminster policies\u201d. He writes that the proposals are backed by analysis led by the former head of the UK civil service, Bob Kerslake, which found that the north-south divide in England was as \u201cstark as the east-west divide in Germany in the early 1990s\u201d. Roger Marsh, the chair of the NP11, said the north led the first industrial revolution and could be \u201cthe crucible\u201d for the \u201cfourth \u2013 and first sustainable \u2013 industrial revolution, but only if we take critical action now\u201d. He added: \u201cOur message to all political parties is clear; the north is ready to lead the transformation required for net zero 2050, enhanced productivity and a truly inclusive Great Britain.\u201d Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, said: \u201cOur north is one made up of many different and distinct places, but by working together like this we have shown we are a powerful region which is prepared to speak with one voice and do what is needed to create opportunity for the future\u201d. The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party have formed a general election pact, agreeing not to stand against each other in dozens of seats, PA Media reports. The deal, brokered by the Unite to Remain group, will give voters a single remain choice in 60 constituencies across England and Wales. The group is confident that \u201cat least 44\u201d of the 60 seats are \u201chighly winnable\u201d. As PA Media reports, the move follows an agreement earlier this year in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, where the Lib Dems took the seat from the Conservatives after the other two parties stood aside. Heidi Allen, the chairwoman of Unite To Remain and previously Lib Dem MP for South Cambridgeshire, said the cross-party arrangement was \u201cunprecedented in modern British political history\u201d. In total, the Lib Dems will stand in 43 constituencies, the Greens will stand in 10 and Plaid Cymru will stand in seven. At a press conference in London, Peter Dunphy, an election strategist and director at Unite to Remain, said: \u201cAt least 44 of those 60 can be regarded as highly winnable constituencies.\u201d As PA reports, he said this evaluation was based on a wide range of data, including current national opinion polls, and results from local and European elections. Here\u2019s my colleague Kate Proctor\u2019s story about the launch: These are from my colleague Richard Partington, who has been listening to the press conference that Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has been giving. Here is some more analysis of the Sajid Javid and John McDonnell speeches from economic specialists (journalists and thinktankers). From Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor From Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies From Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation From the economics professor Jonathan Portes From Newsnight\u2019s economics editor Ben Chu From Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation With the Conservatives and Labour both proposing to increase sustained public spending to a level last seen in the 1970s, it was perhaps appropriate that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, delivered his speech at the Aviation View Park in Manchester below a surviving Concorde - the supersonic passenger jet launched in the 1970s. Sadly, Concorde turned out to be unsustainable. These are from Reuters Kylie MacLellan. The Bank of England has today downgraded its growth forecasts for the UK. My colleague Graeme Wearden has more on his business live blog. These are from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the tax and spending thinktank, on the rival Conservative and Labour borrowing plans. A former BBC Radio Norfolk presenter who said women should \u201ckeep their knickers on\u201d while he was discussing a high-profile rape case has been chosen as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Broadland in Norfolk, the Press Association reports. Nick Conrad, 34, received the backing of the local party on Wednesday to run for the seat held by fellow Tory Keith Simpson, who has stepped down after 22 years as an MP. Simpson held the constituency at the 2017 election with a majority of 15,816. As the Press Association reports, Conrad was criticised for the comments he made in 2014 during a radio conversation about the footballer Ched Evans, who was jailed for rape before having his conviction quashed and being cleared at a retrial. Conrad said: What I\u2019m trying to say is that women also have to understand that when a man\u2019s given certain signals he\u2019ll wish to act upon them and if you don\u2019t wish to give out the wrong signals, it\u2019s best, probably, to keep your knickers on and not get into bed with him. Does that make sense? This week Conrad told the Eastern Daily Press that he had already apologised for what he said in 2014 and that he was apologising again. He said: I completely messed up, I knew I\u2019d got it wrong and it didn\u2019t demonstrate the fact that I know that it\u2019s the most abhorrent crime. I\u2019ve for many years broadcast very difficult subject matter and I was very disappointed in myself after the reaction flared up on the back end of those comments. I apologise, I learned from it and I moved forward. Jess Phillips, who is seeking re-election as a Labour MP, posted this on Twitter in response to the news about Conrad\u2019s selection. Q: Should Jacob Rees-Mogg be forced out as an MP? McDonnell says he and Jeremy Corbyn have been on the silent walks to commemorate the Grenfell Tower fire. He recalls Corbyn embracing survivors. That is what MPs should be doing. He says Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments show how Tories patronise the people. They must be removed from office, he says. That\u2019s what MPs should be doing, embracing and supporting [Grenfell Tower survivors]. What does it show? It shows they have no idea how we live. They have no idea how ordinary working people feel. And their sense of entitlement, elite, patronising, looks down on us. And when they get power, walk all over us. And that\u2019s it. The McDonnell Q&amp;A is over. I will post more from the Javid and McDonnell speeches and Q&amp;As, with reaction, shortly. McDonnell is now answering questions from activists at the event. He says Labour wants to give local authorities the power to control rents. People think that is radical, he says. But it is normal through Europe. And rent controls used to apply in this country too. Q: Why have Ian Austin and the Jewish Chronicle both decided that the election choice should not be Labour? McDonnell does not refer to Austin by name. But, referring to a \u201cformer Labour MP\u201d, he says Austin is now employed by the Tories, and so he speaks on their behalf. He\u2019s now employed by the Tories: what else do you expect him to do in an election campaign where you\u2019re employed by the Tories, you speak on behalf of the Tories. That\u2019s what this was about this morning. (That is a reference to Austin being a trade envoy to Israel. Trade envoys are unpaid, but their travel costs are covered by the government.) On the Jewish Chronicle editorial (see 9.28am), McDonnell says he is saddened by this. He says one antisemite in the party is one too many. But he says Labour has done what the Jewish community has asked for in terms of dealing with this problem. But he says anyone concerned about racism should not be supporting the Tories. He says they won\u2019t address Islamophobia in their own party. Q: What impact will the remain alliance pacts have on Labour? And why is Labour not part of that? McDonnell says Labour is heading for a majority. It does not need a pact, he says. But he says anyone considering a pact with the Lib Dems should consider their record in supporting austerity. McDonnell says what he is proposing stands in the best traditions of socialism. John McDonnell is now taking questions. Lucy Powell, the Labour candidate (not an MP now, because parliament has been dissolved) who is chairing the event, urges activists to be \u201crespectful\u201d when journalists ask questions. (In the past journalists have been booed for asking critical questions at these events.) Q: What is your response to Sajid Javid\u2019s speech? McDonnell says Javid seems to have become a climate change denier. He has not included this in his letter to the Bank of England. Under Javid\u2019s plans, the UK would not be able to meet its climate change targets, he says. He says Labour\u2019s plans do match the scale of the climate crisis. If Labour did not step up to the mark, future generations would not forgive it. Q: Will these plans allow you to increase your target for building homes? McDonnell says these borrowing plans will allow Labour to meet its housing targets. Details of those will be published in due course, he says. Q: Does the next Labour deputy leader have to be a woman? McDonnell says he is always in favour of a gender balance. McDonnell says Labour will exclude investment from its borrowing targets. Our fiscal rule for the next parliament will exclude borrowing for investment from our borrowing targets. It will mandate us to deliver an improvement in the overall balance sheet by the end of the parliament. So that when we invest in the infrastructure our country desperately needs, it\u2019s recognised both as a cost and as a benefit. Yes \u2013 adding to the government\u2019s debt but also adding to the government\u2019s assets and strengthening our public sector to deal with the future. With the rents on our new council homes and the electricity produced by our public sector energy agencies set against the cost of servicing the debt issued to build them. And a ceiling on that debt servicing cost \u2013 in normal times \u2013 of 10% of tax revenue. On this at least there\u2019s nothing radical, just common sense. McDonnell says the OBR forecasts there were expected to be published today (see 9.05am) would have shown an increase in borrowing. The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s restated forecast, which was meant to be published today, was expected to show tens of billions more borrowing Because the Tories designed an expensive student loan system that hid the costs off the books. They got caught out in the end. Too late for the millions who\u2019ve racked up tens of thousands in debt at eye-watering interest rates. That\u2019s what happens when you design fiscal rules to minimise the costs on one side of your balance sheet. Ignoring the benefits on the other. Labour won\u2019t make that mistake. McDonnell says Labour will build the tidal barrage proposed for the Mersey. McDonnell says he will also base the Treasury department dealing with the national transformation fund in the north. They will be supported by a national transformation fund unit of the Treasury. I can confirm that this powerful section of the Treasury unit will be based here in the north. At the same time my Treasury ministerial meetings will no longer be solely in London. Labour\u2019s Treasury ministers will meet outside of London and will have a ministerial office in the north. The centre of gravity, of political gravity, is shifting away from London. McDonnell says decisions about how this money is spent will be taken locally. We\u2019ll carve out part of our national transformation fund for a local transformation fund in each of England\u2019s regions with money for the devolved governments as well of course. And that money will be ringfenced for infrastructure projects decided and developed at a local level, with decisions made transparently and democratically in each region about how their fund is allocated. And regional offices of government departments overseen by a board of local county and city council leaders, with that board publicly accountable to open meetings of local councillors, trade unions and business representatives. McDonnell now explains the components of what he says will be Labour\u2019s national transformation fund. On the scale of change investment needed I can tell you today that Labour\u2019s national transformation fund will be bigger than we promised at the 2017 election. For areas that haven\u2019t had their fair share for years. We\u2019ll deliver \u00a3250bn of investment here and around the country over the next ten years through our green transformation fund. Upgrading our energy, transport and other networks. To meet our targets and decarbonise as thoroughly and fast as our commitment to a just transition will allow. But it\u2019s not just the natural world that\u2019s been neglected. So we\u2019ll also commit to an additional \u00a3150bn in a new social transformation fund spent over the first five years of our Labour government. The social transformation fund will begin the urgent task of repairing our social fabric that the Tories have torn apart. \u00a3150bn to replace, upgrade and expand our schools, hospitals, care homes and council houses. To deal with the human emergency which the Tories have created, alongside the climate emergency. McDonnell says decision making has to shift out of London. To achieve that objective also requires therefore an irreversible shift in the centre of gravity in political decision making and investment in this country from its location solely in London into the north and regions and nations of our country. McDonnell says Labour wants to achieve an \u201cirreversible shift\u201d in power. Our aim as a Labour government is to achieve what past Labour governments have aspired to. An irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people. This is a reference to an ambition first set out in Labour\u2019s February 1974 manifesto, which promised to \u201cbring about a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people and their families.\u201d McDonnell says there is an alternative, contrary to what the Tories claimed in the 1980s. This election is about that alternative, he says. It is a \u201conce-in-a-generation chance to get back on track, remake this country and transform everyone\u2019s lives for the better.\u201d McDonnell says the Tory attitude in the 1980s, towards Liverpool and other places, was summed up by the phrase \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d. The Tories are always the same. In the 80s it was dole queues and sky-high inflation Now it\u2019s zero hours contracts, universal credit and foodbanks. And if they win again it\u2019ll be more of the same. Slashing inheritance tax for the richest, despite an ever-deepening crisis in our care homes and a crumbling public transport system. A hard right Tory Brexit smashing a hole in our public finances. They treat us all with contempt. They think people are stupid. That with Brexit on the agenda, they think we\u2019ll all forget about the past ten years and the prospect of the next five years if they get back. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is speaking now. McDonnell was brought up in Liverpool, and he recalls his father working as a docker in the city. Like so many other families, his family moved south after work on the docks dried up. What happened to the Liverpool docks and to Liverpool is what happened to so many cities and communities across the North and Britain. Traditional industries declined and little was done to replace them. Old skills were lost and new skills were not invested in. Successive Labour governments sought to engage and invest, only to see their efforts swept aside when the Tories took charge. Corbyn is introducing John McDonnell. He says McDonnell is someone who has changed the economic debate in this county. Here is Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, making the same point in a tweet on the Sajid Javid speech. Jeremy Corbyn is now speaking at the Labour event in Liverpool. The main announcements will come from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who is due to speak shortly, but Corbyn is starting with a general warm-up. He criticises what Jacob Rees-Mogg said about the Grenfell Tower, and says a Labour government would act immediately to remove Grenfell-style cladding from tower blocks. There are massive imbalances in the country, he says, between east and west, north and south. He says Labour\u2019s tax plans will affect the richest 5% of the population. But everyone else will benefit, he says. These are from the FT\u2019s economic editor, Chris Giles. This is what Sajid Javid said about how much extra spending would be possible under his new fiscal rules. (See 10.50am.) The rules that I\u2019ve set out today, which will allow us to borrow more responsibly ... historically we have invested as a country about 1.8% of GDP a year in infrastructure. If you say add a percentage point, and which you comfortably can do [under the rules], that\u2019s about an extra \u00a320bn a year. Over a five-year period, you can easily add another \u00a3100bn. We will set out, both in our manifesto and then, if we win, in a future budget, much more detail about what this infrastructure investment looks like. Q: Isn\u2019t it irresponsible to be using the no-deal headroom when a no-deal Brexit is still a risk? Javid does not accept that. He says he only used half the headroom there. He says his plans are affordable. The difference between Labour and the Conservatives could not be bigger, he says. Anything John McDonnell promises today - it doesn\u2019t matter if it is an extra \u00a31, an extra \u00a3150bn, an extra \u00a31tn - it cannot be relied on. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Q: Can you commit to the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme in full? Javid says this is just the kind of plan that he wants to see for the north. He does not want to make an announcement about that today. But he says it would be \u201ccomfortably\u201d affordable under the plans he has announced. Labour can \u201cspray money around like confetti\u201d, he says. But that does not mean anything if they are going to crash the economy. Q: How much would you borrow for investment? Javid says historically the country has invested 1.8% of GDP per year for infrastructure. He says taking that to 2.8%, which would be affordable, would give you an extra \u00a320bn a year. Q: Swing voters have suffered cuts for 10 years. Why shouldn\u2019t they go with Labour? Javid says increased infrastructure spending can only happen with a strong economy. If you \u201ccrater\u201d the economy, that will not be possible. He says Labour\u2019s investment numbers are meaningless. John McDonnell is talking about \u00a3150bn in investment. He might as well talk about \u00a31tn. These numbers are meaningless. Q: Do you still want to reform stamp duty? Javid says he will not comment on particular taxes today. Sajid Javid is now taking questions. Q: Does this mean you won\u2019t be able to afford tax cuts? Javid says there will be scope for tax cuts. Q: Are you not guilty of doing what you accuse Labour of : increasing borrowing irresponsibly? No, says Javid. He says the difference between the two parties\u2019 approaches is \u201cthe difference between night and day\u201d. Under the Tory plan, debt as a proportion of GDP would come down over the course of the parliament, he says. He says Labour has just conjured up a new \u00a3150bn fund, on top of the \u00a3250bn one already planned. He says he does not know if Labour will have fiscal rules. But if they do, they will not meet them. He says Labour will have to raise taxes. There will be a \u201ctax bombshell\u201d under Labour, he says. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is still speaking. He is now attacking Labour\u2019s economic policies. He says Labour would \u201cruin your finances\u201d, raise tax and \u201csaddle the next generation with debt\u201d. He says every single Labour government in history has left this country with an economic crisis. He says the last Labour government took 13 years to undo the economic legacy left to it by the Conservatives. A Jeremy Corbyn government would only take 13 months, he says. He says Labour wants to renationalise companies, without paying market rates of compensation. And he singles out Labour\u2019s plans to make big companies allocate up to 10% of their shares to workers in \u201cinclusive ownership funds\u201d. He says this would take \u00a3300bn from companies. That is not socking it to to the rich. That is stealing private investments. And who owns those investments? Your pension funds. And these are from Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor. These are from Torsten Bell, a former Labour adviser who is now chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, an economic thinktank, on Javid\u2019s new fiscal rules. (See 10.31am.) Javid says the Tories are \u201ctaking the government forward from a decade of recovery to a decade of renewal\u201d. He summarises some of the government spending announcements since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Public services were a lifeline for people like him when he was growing up, \u201cand we must nurture them\u201d, he says. But he says that does not mean the party believes in an \u201cever-expanding state\u201d. He says when he became chancellor there was \u00a327bn of \u201cheadroom\u201d that he could use for spending. He used half of that, he says. He says it is possible to borrow at negative interest rates. So it makes sense to borrow. He says today he is announcing new fiscal rules, so that the government can borrow, but without being irresponsible. He says his first rule will be to have a balanced current budget. He says in his first budget, in the new year, he will announce plans to level up the whole of the country. There will be more money for new schools and hospitals, and for better broadband. We will borrow some more to invest, but we know all too well what happens if debt gets out of control. He says the second rule is that the government will only borrow to invest. That means: Javid said under the Tories investment will not exceed 3% of GDP. He says the average in the past has been 1.8%, and so this is a big increase. He says his third rule is that, if debt interest starts to rise significantly, the borrowing limit will be reviewed. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is giving a speech on the economy in Manchester. He says the biggest fear that business has is a government led by Jeremy Corbyn. He says the fundamentals of the economy are strong. The IMF forecasts that next year the UK will grow faster than France, Italy, Germany and Japan, he says. Here is my Guardian colleague Owen Jones, who of course is a prominent and active Jeremy Corbyn supporter, responding to Ian Austin\u2019s announcement that he is backing Boris Johnson. In his speech later today John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, will say that Labour would spend \u00a3150bn over five years through a \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d on items such as schools, hospitals, care homes and council houses. This is in addition to Labour\u2019s plans to spend \u00a3250bn over 10 years through a green transformation fund. The Labour party press notice with details of the plan is here. And our overnight story about the plan is here. On the Today programme this morning Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said this would be an \u201cabsolutely enormous increase\u201d on what the government spends on investment. It would take the UK from near the bottom in international league tables on investment to near the top. He said the plan did raise questions about how much borrowing might have to rise, and about how it would be paid for. But he suggested that the main short-term problem might be whether or not it would be possible for government to spend so much so quickly. He explained: The real question, in the short run, is would it be possible sensibly to spend this scale of money. Moving to a world in which you\u2019re doubling [spending] within a year or two, I would suspect, is actually just physically impossible to get there that quickly. Do we really have tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of construction workers, lying idle at the moment, who would be able next week or next year or even in a couple of years to start doing this? I think the answer is almost certainly no. It obviously takes a long time to go through the planning and sorting out things. If anyone\u2019s ever had to sort out an extension to the house or something, they know that getting the building started isn\u2019t something that happens next week. If you\u2019re talking about hundreds of hospitals and windfarms or whatever else you\u2019re doing, you need to do this gradually. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, dismissed reports that around 20 of the 600-odd candidates he is fielding in the election have decided not to stand. He said he was still committed to standing candidates all over Britain, and he went on: I\u2019ve never fought an election at which at the last minute candidates didn\u2019t pull out because they realise firstly the full responsibility of doing it and secondly they are coming under a huge amount of pressure. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has joined Ian Austin in attacking Jeremy Corbyn for his record on antisemitism, tweeting this front-page editorial addressed to non-Jews from the Jewish Chronicle. All the major newspapers in the north of England are today backing the plans set out in the first Manifesto for the North. In a Guardian article, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, explains what this campaign is about. Here is an extract. The publication of the first Manifesto for the North, resulting from the recent Convention of the North, simply can\u2019t be ignored. It is a positive intervention into an otherwise highly divided political debate. It sets out the terms for a new political settlement, around which all political parties can and should unite, and upon which a badly divided nation might begin to heal in the long term. Crucially, it asks the government to make rebalancing the economy a formal HM Treasury objective, to deliver transformational investment for the north. In the past, it has been all too easy for talk of the north-south divide to be labelled \u201cnorthern whinging\u201d and relegated to the margins of national political debate. But that won\u2019t be possible this time. First, our \u201cpower up the north\u201d call, championed by our newspapers, is a positive, self-confident ask for the power to do more for ourselves, rather than just a plea for resources. Second, it is backed by heavyweight analysis from a commission led by the former head of the UK civil service, Lord Kerslake, which has found that the north-south divide in England today is as stark as the east-west divide in Germany in the early 1990s. And here is Burnham\u2019s full article. Ahead of Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Scotland today, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the SNP leader, has called on him to apologise for what he has done to the people of Scotland. She said: The only thing Boris Johnson should be coming to Scotland to do today is apologise for the chaos he and his party have subjected us to for years. He is a prime architect of the Brexit vote and the utter shambles it has now led to. A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit and to put Scotland\u2019s future in Scotland\u2019s hands \u2013 not Boris Johnson\u2019s. On his visit to Scotland today, Boris Johnson should apologise not just for the Brexit mess he has created, but also for a decade of Tory austerity that has caused so much misery for so many. The Jeremy Corbyn rally tonight is in Manchester, not in Scotland as it initially said in the post at 8.58am. I\u2019ve corrected that. Sorry. One other item that was meant to be on the agenda for the day (see 8.58am) was the Office for Budget Responsibility publishing revised borrowing forecasts. Here is the story my colleague Larry Elliott wrote last week about how these were expected to show the public finances in a worse state than when the forecasts were last published in March. But now the OBR has said it has cancelled plans to publish this document, because the cabinet secretary has decided it would not be compatible with election \u201cpurdah\u201d rules (which are meant to stop the civil service making announcements during the election period that could affect the result). This is from Sky\u2019s Ed Conway. Here are the main election items in the diary for today. 10am: Unite for Remain holds a press conference in Westminster to announce details of the 60 seats where the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens will operate a pact, standing down in favour of the party with the best chance of winning. 10am: Sajid Javid, the chancellor, gives a speech on the economy. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech giving details of the party\u2019s plans for a \u00a3150bn social transformation fund. 1pm: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, campaigns in Somerset. 7.30pm: Jeremy Corbyn speaks at a rally in Manchester. And Boris Johnson is campaigning in Scotland. Rebecca Long-Bailey is now being asked about Ian Austin\u2019s declaration that he is urging voters to support Boris Johnson. The Today programme plays a clip from its earlier interview with Austin. Long-Bailey says: I\u2019m very sad. Ian did great work as an MP ... He doesn\u2019t like Jeremy, that\u2019s pretty clear. She says urging people to back Johnson is \u201cabsurd\u201d. She says she hopes that, if Jeremy Corbyn becomes PM, Austin will come round to backing him. Q: Austin says Corbyn isn\u2019t a patriot. That\u2019s wrong, says Long-Bailey. She says Corbyn is a patriot. Q: Austin says you have not done enough on antisemitism. Long-Bailey says initially the party could have responded more quickly, but a lot has changed recently. She says rules have changed and there is now auto-expulsion for these cases. Q: Are you worried that other people who support Tom Watson\u2019s position in Labour will join him in leaving? I hope not, she says. She says she does not accept that description that Watson and his supporters are \u201cmoderates\u201d. She says she would like to think everyone in the party is moderate. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is on the Today programme now. She is explaining Labour\u2019s plans for a \u00a3150bn social transformation fund. Asked whether borrowing costs would go up, Long-Bailey says it makes economic sense for governments to invest in this way. Q: But it also makes sense for government\u2019s to maintain a reputation for fiscal responsibility. Some economists think this will be impossible now given the scale of your borrowing? Long-Bailey does not accept that. She says Labour\u2019s policy would increase GDP (national wealth). Unlike the Tories, Labour believes in using the power of government to assist in this. Senior Conservatives continue to highlight Ian Austin\u2019s attack on Corbyn and endorsement of Johnson. Theo Bertram, a former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, sees a pattern here... Ian Austin has recorded a video for his local Express and Star on why he thinks Dudley North constituents should back Boris Johnson. Tory MPs have seized on that interview by Ian Austin and his endorsement of Boris Johnson and attack on Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson is heading for the north-eastern Scottish constituency of Moray, where Scottish Tory MP Douglas Ross unseated the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Angus Robertson in 2017, in one of the most shocking results of that election night. You can read more about the constituency here. In quotes released before the visit, Johnson hammered home his warning that Jeremy Corbyn \u201cwould spend next year dancing to the SNP\u2019s tune, wasting the year with two divisive referendums - one on the EU and one to give up on our union. Only a vote for the Conservatives will stop the SNP\u2019s plans to break up the UK.\u201d It\u2019s a message that may well resonate in Euro-sceptic Moray, home to one of the few remaining active fishing ports along the north-east coast. In 2016 this electorate delivered the narrowest margin of victory for the remain vote anywhere in the UK, falling just 112 votes short of ruining Scotland\u2019s unanimous pro-EU tally. In advance of the visit, first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon called on Johnson to apologise to the people of Scotland for Brexit and austerity. She said: \u201cOn his visit to Scotland today, Boris Johnson should apologise not just for the Brexit mess he has created, but also for a decade of Tory austerity that has caused so much misery for so many. He should also come clean on his Brexit deal and his plans for a no-deal exit in barely over a year\u2019s time if a trade deal cannot be agreed. That would be a disaster for Scotland and the rest of the UK, and it underlines the huge threat the Tories pose.\u201d Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary has urged Labour to remain a \u201cpluralist party\u201d following Tom Watson\u2019s announcement that he is quitting politics. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, while Austin was interviewed on Today, Long-Bailey paid tribute to Watson\u2019s record. She said: Tom was a big figure and commanded a lot of support and respect within the party from people from all wings at the party, not just those who are supposedly on the middle of ground. But we\u2019ve always been a pluralist party. And it\u2019s important that we stay that way, that we represent views right across the centre/left spectrum. Ultimately the Labour Party was created to bring together aspects of the centre/left to make as a credible force to defeat the Conservative Party. And hopefully, that\u2019s what we\u2019re certainly going to do for the next 30 40 50 years. Long-Bailey, who is often tipped as a possible successor to Corbyn, was asked if she would be standing to become the new deputy leader. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I\u2019m considering at all at the moment.\u201d Asked if she was ruling herself out from a position Labour has indicated should be held by a female MP, Long-Bailey said: It is not something that has even entered my mind at the moment at all. We\u2019ll make that decision and candidates will put themselves forward, I\u2019ve no doubt we\u2019ll have a range of really great candidates after the 12th of December because Tom will be our deputy until after the general election. Austin added: \u201cI think their [Labour\u2019s] economic policies would make our country worse off not better off. I think they would chase away investment. I think they would put businesses and jobs at risk. I think Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit policy is a completely fantasy.\u201d Austin described Tom Watson\u2019s decision to stand down from politics as \u201cenormously significant\u201d. He said: If Tom thought that Jeremy Corbyn was fit to lead our country and fit to form a government, would he really be standing down?\u201d Anybody who has spoken to Tom knows what he thinks about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. More importantly, they know how appalled he is, like so many other people, by the scandal of antisemitism that has poisoned the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. Austin also revealed that he would not be standing as an independent candidate in his constituency of Dudly North as he had previously indicated. Former Labour MP, Ian Austin, has called on voters to back Boris Johnson in the election saying his former party would make the country worse off. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 Today programme Austin said: I\u2019m not a Tory but I wouldn\u2019t say Boris Johnson is unfit to be our prime minister in the way that I say that about Jeremy Corbyn. UPDATE: Here are more quotes from Ian Austin talking about Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson in the interview. Austin said: Look, the public has to make this choice. The British people have to decide this. Lots of traditional Labour voters are going to be grappling with this question. If they have got to face up to that, then I don\u2019t think people like me should have the luxury of running away from it. What Jeremy Corbyn has done to the Labour party, I don\u2019t want him to be able to do that to the country ... The country faces a big choice - there are only who can be prime minister on December 13 and that\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson. And I think Jeremy Corbyn is completely unfit to lead our country and lead the Labour party. I joined the Labour party as a teenager ...so it has really come to something when I tell decent traditional patriotic Labour voters that they should be voting for Boris Johnson at this election. I can\u2019t believe it has come to this but that\u2019s where we are. University lecturers are giving students five minutes at the start of their lectures to register to vote as a nationwide campaign gets under way to ensure that students\u2019 voices are heard in the forthcoming general election. The move was condemned by some on social media as \u201cbrainwashing\u201d, but according to the universities\u2019 regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), institutions now have a duty to facilitate the electoral registration of students. Dan Elphick, a music lecturer, was among those to flag up his efforts to encourage student votes, when he said he was setting aside five minutes of his lecture time to allow students to register online, adding: \u201cI see this as being a vital part of their education.\u201d The initiative has been supported by the University College Union (UCU), which represents university workers, and is being replicated by lecturers elsewhere in the country before the 26 November deadline for registration. This is delightful and features this excellent picture of Tom Watson at Glastonbury in 2017. \u2018Watson quits\u2019: how the papers covered it Boris Johnson heads north today, travelling to Scotland for campaign events. Johnson kicked off the Conservative election campaign yesterday with a speech in Birmingham that he hopes will give his party some positive momentum after a series of damaging gaffes in recent days. These include Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion that victims of the Grenfell Tower fire lacked common sense and Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, having to resign over his knowledge of a former aide\u2019s role in allegedly sabotaging a rape trial. Johnson came out swinging at Corbyn, whom he accused of planning tax rises to fund \u201cderanged\u201d nationalism; at parliament, which he said was \u201cparalysed, blocked, generally incapable of digestive function, as an anaconda that has swallowed a tapir\u201d; and without naming him, at Nigel Farage, as the Brexit party leader has refused requests from pro-leave Tories to stand down Brexit party candidates in their seats. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the barricades,\u201d Johnson told supporters. Good morning and welcome to the first day of the official election campaign. It has not yet been 24 hours since Boris Johnson visited the Queen, dissolved parliament, and formally announced that a general election would take place on 12 December, and already we have seen high drama. On the Labour side this came as Tom Watson announced last night that he will step down as deputy leader. Watson \u2013 who has spent 35 years in full-time politics, and has represented West Bromwich East as its MP since 2001 \u2013 has repeatedly clashed with Jeremy Corbyn, including over the Labour leader\u2019s Brexit stance and handling of antisemitism. His departure is likely to reignite the debate about the direction of the Labour party under Corbyn after one senior Labour figure said Watson\u2019s announcement had led to \u201ca great sense of desolation and abandonment sweeping the moderates\u201d in the party. Watson insisted his resignation was \u201cpersonal, not political\u201d and said he would \u201cspend this election fighting for brilliant Labour candidates and a better future for our country\u201d. Corbyn thanked Watson, saying: \u201cFew people have given as much to the Labour movement as you have.\u201d For his part Watson says he has a lot of irons in the fire, including training to become a gym instructor and a book about weight loss coming out in January. Here he is, talking about his plans for life post-politics. Meanwhile today, Sajid Javid and his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, are both set to give speeches in the north-west of England. Javid is expected to hammer Labour on the economy, saying the Tories won\u2019t \u201clet Labour off the hook like last time\u201d. In 2017, the Conservatives\u2019 claims that Labour was relying on a \u201cmagic money tree\u201d to fund its lavish spending pledges fell flat when Theresa May\u2019s party failed to publish costings of its own policies. But Javid will signal the Tories\u2019 determination to attack Labour on the economy relentlessly over the next five weeks \u2013 although unlike two years ago, the government is touting a series of multibillion pound spending pledges of its own. Meanwhile McDonnell will announce a \u00a3100bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d to \u201crepair the fabric that the Tories have torn apart\u201d. As usual, you can get in touch with me via Twitter and email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). I\u2019ll have the reins of the blog for the first hour or so before I hand it over to my excellent colleagues. Day one, off we go.",

The darker side of independent living is knowing there\u2019s nobody to bail you out of financial trouble, so policies like a higher minimum wage or stronger employment rights start to matter more. (One reason conservatives worldwide tend to champion marriage may be that, without it, people become markedly less keen on a small state, favouring an interventionist one instead.)</p> <p>Single women helped put Barack Obama in the White House and, while they didn\u2019t stop Donald Trump, they helped drive interest in Bernie Sanders; now politicians such as Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may be filling a similar gap. British pollsters rarely ask respondents\u2019 relationship status, but it would be fascinating to see how much of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s support in 2017 came from singletons craving economic security.</p> <p>When I was Watson\u2019s age I could still just about stretch to buying a tiny flat on my own in north London. But those dizzy days are long gone now. The median English home now costs eight times the salary of a single man on median male earnings, according to the <a href=\"https://wbg.org.uk/media/press-releases/exclusive-data-housing-is-unaffordable-for-women-in-every-english-region/\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s Budget Group</a>, and 12 times the salary of a single woman on median female earnings. More shockingly, it calculates that for a lone woman on median female earnings, no region in England is affordable to rent in the private market.</p> <p>Middle-aged divorcees are falling back into student-style house-shares, and inevitably single parents have it toughest. Any singleton manifesto would put curbing house prices, stabilising rents and building more social housing at the top, but it wouldn\u2019t stop there.</p> <p>It might well overhaul universal credit, which has been noticeably harsh on single parents (one in five food bank users are single parents, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/05/welfare-changes-key-factor-rising-poverty-food-bank-use-study-finds\" title=\"\">according to a study published</a> this week by the Trussell Trust); it could also crack down on non-payment of alimony. A government for singletons would also prioritise social care, recognising that talk of more families looking after their own relatives is frankly scary for anyone ageing without children.</p> <p>It would crack down on gender or ethnicity pay gaps that make it unnecessarily hard for some lone earners to manage, and promote the flexible jobs that single parents often need. It would push car-sharing clubs, so that each household in a city street full of singletons doesn\u2019t feel it needs its own car. The manifesto might even come up with a more realistic version of our French commune fantasy, via co-housing developments offering a mix of shared facilities and private space for micro-households.</p> <p>Look at that list, and it\u2019s obvious Labour is already moving broadly in this direction. But it\u2019s not the only party eyeing up this territory, and the fact that Corbyn is still lagging behind the Conservatives in the polls suggests the contest for singleton votes remains open.</p> <p>Nobody wants to be the voice of doom, pointing out that being happily self-partnered is a lot harder for anyone not earning Emma Watson\u2019s salary. Millennials are right to run a mile from toxic relationships that make them miserable, and to hold out for the real thing; they also deserve the same chances that my generation had to live and travel alone, and thus to learn the intoxicating lesson that we could cope if we had to.</p> <p>But in retrospect that freedom was the result, however unintentional, of benign economic and political forces that we didn\u2019t even notice until they were gone, and it won\u2019t just fall back into our laps by accident. All the single ladies, as the song goes, now put your hands up.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The darker side of independent living is knowing there\u2019s nobody to bail you out of financial trouble, so policies like a higher minimum wage or stronger employment rights start to matter more. (One reason conservatives worldwide tend to champion marriage may be that, without it, people become markedly less keen on a small state, favouring an interventionist one instead.) Single women helped put Barack Obama in the White House and, while they didn\u2019t stop Donald Trump, they helped drive interest in Bernie Sanders; now politicians such as Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may be filling a similar gap. British pollsters rarely ask respondents\u2019 relationship status, but it would be fascinating to see how much of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s support in 2017 came from singletons craving economic security. When I was Watson\u2019s age I could still just about stretch to buying a tiny flat on my own in north London. But those dizzy days are long gone now. The median English home now costs eight times the salary of a single man on median male earnings, according to the Women\u2019s Budget Group, and 12 times the salary of a single woman on median female earnings. More shockingly, it calculates that for a lone woman on median female earnings, no region in England is affordable to rent in the private market. Middle-aged divorcees are falling back into student-style house-shares, and inevitably single parents have it toughest. Any singleton manifesto would put curbing house prices, stabilising rents and building more social housing at the top, but it wouldn\u2019t stop there. It might well overhaul universal credit, which has been noticeably harsh on single parents (one in five food bank users are single parents, according to a study published this week by the Trussell Trust); it could also crack down on non-payment of alimony. A government for singletons would also prioritise social care, recognising that talk of more families looking after their own relatives is frankly scary for anyone ageing without children. It would crack down on gender or ethnicity pay gaps that make it unnecessarily hard for some lone earners to manage, and promote the flexible jobs that single parents often need. It would push car-sharing clubs, so that each household in a city street full of singletons doesn\u2019t feel it needs its own car. The manifesto might even come up with a more realistic version of our French commune fantasy, via co-housing developments offering a mix of shared facilities and private space for micro-households. Look at that list, and it\u2019s obvious Labour is already moving broadly in this direction. But it\u2019s not the only party eyeing up this territory, and the fact that Corbyn is still lagging behind the Conservatives in the polls suggests the contest for singleton votes remains open. Nobody wants to be the voice of doom, pointing out that being happily self-partnered is a lot harder for anyone not earning Emma Watson\u2019s salary. Millennials are right to run a mile from toxic relationships that make them miserable, and to hold out for the real thing; they also deserve the same chances that my generation had to live and travel alone, and thus to learn the intoxicating lesson that we could cope if we had to. But in retrospect that freedom was the result, however unintentional, of benign economic and political forces that we didn\u2019t even notice until they were gone, and it won\u2019t just fall back into our laps by accident. All the single ladies, as the song goes, now put your hands up. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

And no democrat should support the path taken by the separatist leaders, who won less than 48% of the votes cast in regional elections. My government has promoted the expansion of rights and liberties and would never agree to even the smallest restriction of freedom of expression. The president of the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia\u2019s regional government), Quim Torra, is a radical separatist, but he is not prevented from expressing his views freely, despite the pain and damage they cause to peaceful coexistence in Catalonia. In Spain, everyone may express their opinions as they wish, provided that they do not promote and encourage criminal acts. The supreme court recently ruled against nine separatist leaders charged for the illegal acts they carried out in the autumn of 2017. The court acted with the greatest transparency: the entire proceedings were televised live. I fully respect those Catalan citizens who have peacefully exercised fundamental rights to protest and to strike against the ruling. But the organised and intentional acts of violence that have occurred across Catalonia in recent weeks are something else altogether and in no way represent the region\u2019s tolerance and welcoming spirit. The illegal effort to bring about Catalonia\u2019s independence has followed a roadmap that is all too familiar in today\u2019s Europe. It has used a web of lies, spun by fake news and viral messaging, to divide societies by exploiting the rhetoric of reaction to encourage polarisation and confrontation. Recently, the president of the main pro-separatist association, Elisenda Paluzie, stated that images of violent clashes between protesters and police officers had \u201cpositive and negative effects\u201d as they \u201clent visibility to the conflict\u201d and \u201ckeep us in the international press\u201d. But if we have learned anything from Europe\u2019s painful and bloody history, it is that no political ambition can ever justify resorting to violence, much less the normalisation of violence as a political tool. My government has responded with speed and proportion to restore peace and stability to Catalonia\u2019s citizens, a majority of whom reject the current unstable impasse. I call on the president of the Generalitat to condemn the violence fully and clearly, and to act as president of all Catalans, not only those who share his political beliefs. I will not allow another extreme nationalist outbreak to undermine the success of Spanish democracy. In the discussion about the future of Catalonia, only the healing and coexistence of the Catalan people and society, not independence, is on the agenda. This is our main challenge: to ensure that all understand and accept that a unilateral path toward independence constitutes a direct affront to fundamental democratic principles. At this moment, restraint and moderation are imperative. We will act with all the firmness needed to defend peaceful coexistence, all the while recognising that we have an opportunity to start a new chapter. I know that there are open wounds, pain and frustration. But, despite this, there is an opportunity for dialogue and hope, recognising what we have achieved together and thinking about what we can do, together. I will never turn away from dialogue, but for this to happen the separatist leaders must abide by the constitution and respect the rule of law. My government has positioned Spain at the forefront of the project of European integration and the fight against our greatest global challenges. These objectives transcend a nationalist vision, and we need Catalonia and Catalan society to help achieve them. \u2022 Pedro S\u00e1nchez is prime minister of Spain.

The money would be used to retrofit homes across the country, fund offshore wind projects and create a \u201cCrossrail for the north\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>What is Javid proposing?</strong></h2> <p>The chancellor said he would run a balanced current account budget \u2013 day-to-day government spending excluding infrastructure investment \u2013 by the middle of the next parliament. He also said borrowing for infrastructure would not exceed 3% of GDP, compared with a long-term average of 1.8%.</p> <p>\u201cIt means billions of pounds more to spend on the infrastructure revolution this country needs,\u201d Javid said.</p> <p>Capital spending has been reduced by the government since the financial crisis. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development recommends developed nations spend about 3.5% of GDP a year on infrastructure. Labour\u2019s proposals would take current government investment spending from about \u00a347bn (2% of GDP) to at least \u00a3100bn a year (about 4% of GDP).</p> <h2><strong>How is it paid for?</strong></h2> <p>The spending plans from both parties would be paid for by additional borrowing. The government\u2019s budget deficit has fallen steadily over the past decade from a peak of \u00a3158bn in 2010 after the financial crisis to about \u00a323bn in the year to March 2019.</p> <p>Borrowing is expected to rise in future as spending commitments already put in place by the Conservatives kick in. GDP growth has also slowed, affecting tax receipts.</p> <h2><strong>What is the difference between Labour and the Tories?</strong></h2> <p>Both Labour and the Tories have signalled higher spending, without sufficient tax rises or spending cuts elsewhere to keep the deficit falling in future years. Whatever impact Brexit has on the economy would also have an effect on government finances.</p> <p>Both parties are yet to publish manifestos, making it difficult for analysts to say which will most increase spending and borrowing. Carys Roberts, the chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research, a leftwing thinktank, said the decision facing voters was about which party to trust to raise spending and borrowing.</p> <p>\u201cThe Tories are calling their plans the end of austerity, while also calling Labour fiscally irresponsible. They\u2019re treading a fine line there. Both are increasing their borrowing by quite some margin. From Labour, it\u2019s more about borrowing for investment, with the Conservatives, it\u2019s more on current spending and tax cuts,\u201d she said.</p> <h2><strong>What are the pros and cons of higher borrowing?</strong></h2> <p>Increasing investment to stimulate the economy is nothing new, particularly during times of economic turbulence. Franklin D Roosevelt, the then US president, used the New Deal in the 1930s to massively expand US spending on public works to pull the economy out of the Great Depression.</p> <p>One danger is the government could face higher interest payments on its debt. Britain pays about \u00a340bn a year to service a debt pile of about \u00a31.8tn (84% of GDP). Adding to that with higher annual deficits could make the country a more risky prospect for international investors, driving up borrowing costs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the cost of borrowing has fallen since the financial crisis to historical lows, as central banks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/07/bank-of-england-vote-raises-chances-interest-rate-cut\">cut interest rates</a> around the world. Economists do not expect the trend to be dramatically reversed any time soon.</p> <p>Money spent on infrastructure should improve the performance of the economy in future, potentially making Labour\u2019s plans a sensible investment.</p> <p>However, economists say it could be unwise to spend as much as \u00a3150bn in as little as five years, given there are unlikely to be enough shovel-ready projects available, raising the risk the funds might be spent wastefully.</p>",

Labour\u2019s proposals would take current government investment spending from about \u00a347bn (2% of GDP) to at least \u00a3100bn a year (about 4% of GDP). How is it paid for? The spending plans from both parties would be paid for by additional borrowing. The government\u2019s budget deficit has fallen steadily over the past decade from a peak of \u00a3158bn in 2010 after the financial crisis to about \u00a323bn in the year to March 2019. Borrowing is expected to rise in future as spending commitments already put in place by the Conservatives kick in. GDP growth has also slowed, affecting tax receipts. What is the difference between Labour and the Tories? Both Labour and the Tories have signalled higher spending, without sufficient tax rises or spending cuts elsewhere to keep the deficit falling in future years. Whatever impact Brexit has on the economy would also have an effect on government finances. Both parties are yet to publish manifestos, making it difficult for analysts to say which will most increase spending and borrowing. Carys Roberts, the chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research, a leftwing thinktank, said the decision facing voters was about which party to trust to raise spending and borrowing. \u201cThe Tories are calling their plans the end of austerity, while also calling Labour fiscally irresponsible. They\u2019re treading a fine line there. Both are increasing their borrowing by quite some margin. From Labour, it\u2019s more about borrowing for investment, with the Conservatives, it\u2019s more on current spending and tax cuts,\u201d she said. What are the pros and cons of higher borrowing? Increasing investment to stimulate the economy is nothing new, particularly during times of economic turbulence. Franklin D Roosevelt, the then US president, used the New Deal in the 1930s to massively expand US spending on public works to pull the economy out of the Great Depression. One danger is the government could face higher interest payments on its debt. Britain pays about \u00a340bn a year to service a debt pile of about \u00a31.8tn (84% of GDP). Adding to that with higher annual deficits could make the country a more risky prospect for international investors, driving up borrowing costs. However, the cost of borrowing has fallen since the financial crisis to historical lows, as central banks cut interest rates around the world. Economists do not expect the trend to be dramatically reversed any time soon. Money spent on infrastructure should improve the performance of the economy in future, potentially making Labour\u2019s plans a sensible investment. However, economists say it could be unwise to spend as much as \u00a3150bn in as little as five years, given there are unlikely to be enough shovel-ready projects available, raising the risk the funds might be spent wastefully.",

      "bodyText": "Finally (I think), the FTSE 100 index has closed just 9 points higher at 7,406. A small rally, to a one-month high. Firms vulnerable to trade conflict rose today, including packaging firm Smirfit Kappa and fashion chain Burberry. Back in the markets, Wall Street has hit another record high on hopes of a US-China trade deal. The Dow has surged by 261 points, or almost 1%, at 27,754, after Beijing\u2019s commerce ministry said the two sides had agreed to lower some tariffs as part of a Phase One deal. The White House hasn\u2019t confirmed the move, but traders are optimistic that the talks are heading towards a breakthrough. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The trade tensions of late August and early September seem like a distant memory now as there is chatter of undoing the levies. Neither side wants to appear weak, but the tariffs are clearly hurting each other, so a joint de-escalation would be an easy way out. If President Trump is being reasonable with China, he is less likely to turn up the heat on the EU, which is helping stocks on this side of the Atlantic. Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s Bank of England forecasts, and interest rate decision: The chances of a cut in interest rates have increased after two members of the Bank of England\u2019s key policy body responded to a growth downgrade inspired by Brexit and a trade war by voting for cheaper borrowing. In the first split vote on Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) since June 2018, the Bank voted 7-2 to keep official interest rates on hold at 0.75%, but two of the outside experts the government appointed to the committee , Jonathan Haskell and Michael Saunders, said the weakness of the economy warranted an immediate reduction. The Bank thinks the short-term prospects for the economy have improved because the risk of a no-deal Brexit has diminished, but it expects the level of national output \u2013 gross domestic product \u2013 over the next three years to be 1% lower than it had anticipated in August. It said three-quarters of the downgrade had been because of changes in asset prices and a gloomier global outlook since the summer, while the rest came from changes to the Bank\u2019s Brexit assumptions offset by the impact of the boost to public spending announced by Sajid Javid in September. The Bank believes the chancellor\u2019s measures will increase the level of output by 0.4%. The Bank\u2019s latest monetary policy report for the first time included precise Brexit assumptions based on the withdrawal agreement the prime minister struck with the EU. It believes leaving the EU will lead to the economy growing more slowly but had previously been basing its forecasts on the average impact over 15 years. Threadneedle Street says Boris Johnson\u2019s deal means it is now possible to quantify the effects up until the end of 2022. Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University fears that parts of the BoE\u2019s growth projections (see here) may be too optimistic: What is really striking is that Business investment growth is expected to stay flat at 0.25% in 2020 and then (magically) shoot up to to 4% in 2021 and further up to 4.5% in 2022 which appears at odds with the 3% average growth rate over the pre-crisis period! This is puzzling. For this to happen, the UK will almost certainly have to reach a great new deal with the EU which will arguably be identical to the current status quo... Dr Kerstin Braun, President of trade finance provider Stenn Group, suspects UK interest rates may be cut in early 2020. She fears that the UK economy is \u2018running out of gas\u2019, after several years of Brexit uncertainty: \u201cMark Carney is right to hold rates for now. Brexit and trade worries have been weighing on the economy and now a snap general election has been thrown into the mix. But even if we avoid a Brexit crash out, or if Brexit is scrapped all together, the UK is slowly running out of gas, driven down by persistent uncertainty and the flagging global economy. European stocks might be up after some tariffs have been rolled back, but it will take time to undo the damage caused by the trade war. \u201cThe MPC has been hinting at a rate cut for a while, with or without a confirmed Brexit deal, but it\u2019s likely to be at least three more months of paralysis before we see a move. Business investment will consequently be lacking, and thus no resulting lift to the wider economy. Sterling will likewise muddle along. \u201cThis limbo is starting to feel like \u2018the new normal\u2019 when it should only be temporary. UK businesses need to be able to withstand the burden of this longer wait.\u201d Here\u2019s Commerzbank\u2019s take on the Bank of England\u2019s growth forecast cuts, and the split over interest rates: Given the headwinds facing the UK as a result of Brexit issues and mounting global headwinds, it was perhaps no real surprise that two members of the MPC voted for a rate cut this month \u2013 the first split decision since June 2018. This comes on the back of a growth forecast that has been revised down compared to August. For the first time the BoE has explicitly outlined the assumptions underpinning its Brexit view, assuming a FTA which enables tariff-free EU goods trade but nonetheless results in other frictions that will curb trade growth. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, predicts Mark Carney could bow to pressure and extend his term again, if Brexit isn\u2019t resolved soon. She says: \u201cCarney\u2019s potentially last inflation report painted a cautiously optimistic outlook for the UK economy, but further Brexit delays could see him and business uncertainty stay for longer. \u201cThe Bank of England remains concerned about limited upside to capacity. A relatively smooth transition to new UK-EU relations, coupled with a removal of some of the current global headwinds, could therefore see interest rates start rising earlier than markets currently anticipate. \u201cHowever, with the final UK-EU trade deal likely to take some time to conclude, uncertainty is likely to last longer, causing business investment and overall economic growth to be more muted than what the BoE is expecting at the moment.\u201d The TUC is disappointed that the UK economy is now expected to be 1% smaller in 2022 than the Bank thought back in August (under those new growth forecasts). TUC Head of Economics Kate Bell blames the austerity programme implemented since 2010, saying: \u201cThis is the Conservatives\u2019 economic legacy. Their decade of cuts and under-investment has put growth in the slow lane. \u201cWhen Britain needed rebuilding, they chose austerity and tax breaks for wealthy corporations. And they have damaged confidence in our economy by threatening a reckless no-deal. \u201cWe need leaders who will put working families first, not their rich mates and donors.\u201d Both chancellor Sajid Javid and shadow chancellor John McDonnell have outlined plans to borrow and spend more if they win next month\u2019s general election: This chart, from today\u2019s Monetary Policy Report, gives a detailed view of the Bank of England\u2019s new forecasts. It shows a predicted bounce-back in business investment in 2021 and 2022, as the weight of Brexit uncertainty is lifted. But exports are seen falling in 2021 and 2022, with imports little changed. And household consumption growth, which has kept the economy growing in recent years, is expected to be lower than average Remember: These forecasts are based on the revised UK-EU Brexit deal agreed by Boris Johnson last month. Previously, the BoE assumed a smooth and orderly Brexit, and a range of potential outcomes. Economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon thinks Mark Carney should say what he really thinks about the UK\u2019s new Brexit agreement: Here\u2019s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on Mark Carney\u2019s comments about Brexit: The economics press pack then make a final attempt to pin Mark Carney down about Brexit, and the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. But it\u2019s not too successful. Q: Just to clarify.... is the Bank saying that the economy will grow faster under the Brexit deal than if we\u2019d not voted to leave, or not? That\u2019s not a question that we have to answer, Mark Carney replies. The BoE doesn\u2019t have the \u201cremit, mandate, or the luxury of comparing it to a parallel situation\u201d he adds. Q: What will happen to your forecasts after the election if Britain doesn\u2019t leave the EU? They will change, Carney smiles, moving his hands back and forth. But he won\u2019t guess how. Q: Will Brexit uncertainties rise if Britain doesn\u2019t leave the UK on 31 January next year? It depends how businesses react, says Carney. We\u2019ll adjust accordingly. It also depends how much progress is made towards defining the \u2018deep free trade deal\u2019 that both side want, he continues. That\u2019s the end of the press conference. I\u2019ll post a summary and reaction next. Q: The Labour party want the Bank of England to play a role in fiscal policy - would you welcome that? Mark Carney points out that the BoE works to a mandate, while maintaining independence from government. It needs to have targets, and the tools to achieve them. That\u2019s a hint that some problems can\u2019t be tackled through monetary policy, and financial stability measures. Back in June, Labour said the Bank could play a role in the climate emergency. It has also called for action on productivity -- which is also beyond the Bank\u2019s current remit. Q: How steep are the barriers to the Bank of England easing monetary policy, on a rating of 1 to 10? I\u2019m so not going to answer that question, Carney chuckles. But on the broad point, the Bank\u2019s economists and policymakers don\u2019t see the imbalances that push the economy into recession. If there isn\u2019t a material improvement in trade tensions, the global economy would probably stabilise, and pick up, he adds. Q: Do you think rising trade tensions are the new normal? Mark Carney replies that protectionist measures are more \u201cpersistent, pervasive and damaging\u201d than expected a few years ago. Q: Is the Bank of England more likely to cut rates next, rather than hike them, given two policymakers voted to cut rates at this week\u2019s meeting? It largely depends how risks, such as the Brexit process, play out, Carney explains. Q: What is the risk of a global recession? Mark Carney points out that world recessions are \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d. We\u2019ve only had two consecutive quarters of falling global GDP in the last 35 years (after the financial crisis), and we both lived through it, he adds. Q: How do you think the UK economy fared in the last quarter? Mark Carney says the Bank predicts growth of 0.4% for Q3 2019. We\u2019ll find out if he\u2019s right on Monday, at 9.30am, when the latest GDP figures are released. If the economy grew, then Britain will have avoided a recession (GDP fell by 0.2% in April-June). This is from Paul Brand of ITV: But as Mark Carney pointed out, the Bank still expect growth to pick up over the next few years -- just slower than previously. Q: Why have you cut your growth forecast for 2021, from 2.3% to just 1.8%? Mark Carney says there are two main factors: 1) The world is weaker; 2) UK financial conditions have tightened as the pound has strengthened. But there\u2019s also the impact of the new Brexit deal, under which \u2018transition effects\u2019 hit the UK economy more rapidly than the Bank thought before. Q: Would you extend your term beyond its end date of 31 January 2020 if the government asked you? Mark Carney says its \u201centirely understandable\u201d that his successor hasn\u2019t been appointed yet. He\u2019s sure that once the election is concluded, the process will be completed. We\u2019ll make sure that the transition is smooth and orderly, he jokes. So, he\u2019s not ruled out staying longer, if asked.... [Carney has already agreed to extend his term twice, due to Brexit] Q: Your forecasts are based on a free trade deal being agreed - but can it be done by the end of 2020, as the government says? Governor Mark Carney says it could take longer, and there could be a transition period into this new free trade deal. But he also cites comments from Pascal Lamy, former head of the WTO, who said a UK-EU trade deal could be done relatively quickly given the two sides are currently very closely aligned. [in 2017, though, Lamy said a deal couldn\u2019t be done in just two years] Q: Are you warning UK households to expect an interest rate cut? Carney says inflation is expected to fall in the short term, due to cheaper petrol and utility bills. But the bank will look through these temporary moves. Ie, the Bank wouldn\u2019t slash borrowing costs to drive prices higher, and get inflation near its 2% target again. The key message is that the Bank would \u201creinforce\u201d the economy if downside risks (global growth or Brexit uncertainty) materialise, through a rate cut. Q: How would the spending promises being made in the general election campaign affect monetary policy? Carney says that future fiscal policy is an \u2018upside risk\u2019 to today\u2019s forecasts -- in other words, growth could be stronger if governments spend more. But he doesn\u2019t critique any party\u2019s plans. Q: You previously said that Theresa May\u2019s deal was better for growth than the Bank\u2019s central forecast, so are you now saying Boris Johnson\u2019s deal is worse? Mark Carney denies it. He says the Bank never based its forecasts on May\u2019s deal as it was never approved by MPs (unlike Johnson\u2019s deal, which passed a second reading in parliament). The biggest impact of a deal, he says, is the boost from lowered uncertainty. Q: Are you assuming that the UK will leave with a deal on 31 January, and that the impact of that deal will be negative? Yes to the first point, and no to the second, Carney replies. He says growth has been very weak recently, and it\u2019s expected to pick up if Britain leaves the EU under the current deal. That growth boost would mainly be due to domestic factors. Carney then explains that the Bank might have to ease policy (cut interest rates) if global growth failed to stabilise or if Brexit uncertainties remained entrenched (as explained here). On the UK economy, Mark Carney says that business investment has been persistently weak, and there are signs that the labour market is softening. He then turns to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. The Bank believes that growth will remain a little below potential in the near term, but will pick up afterwards. The withdrawal agreement and the extension to 31 January has lowered the perceived risk of a no-deal Brexit, and helped the pound to strengthen, Carney says. The Bank predicts that growth will pick up over the next few years, but that still leaves the economy 1% smaller in December 2022 than it expected back in August Here are the new forecasts: 2020: 1.6% growth 2021: 1.8% growth 2022: 2.1% growth Bank of England governor Mark Carney begins his press conference by warning that the global economic outlook has darkened. Carney says that the world risks slipping into \u201ca low growth, low inflation rut\u201d. But Britain now has the chance to break out of this rut, the governor adds. A Brexit deal creates the possibility of a pick-up in growth. The world economy is now expanding at its slowest rates since 2009, Carney continues. A broad-based expansion has turned into a widespread slowdown, and trade tensions are a significant cause. The Bank of England is holding a press conference now to discuss its new forecasts. You can watch it live here: The Bank of England\u2019s forecasts are now based on the revised Brexit deal agreed by Boris Johnson last month. That\u2019s significant, as the Bank has now lowered its growth forecasts for the next few years. The BoE now expects the UK economy will only grow by 1.2% this year, down from 1.3% previously. It\u2019s 2021 forecast has been cut sharply too, from 2.3% to 1.8%. Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway explains: The Bank of England has risked accusations of intervening in the election campaign as it published its first formal forecast of the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. In its Monetary Policy Report, the Bank forecast that over the course of the next three years the Conservative government\u2019s deal could leave the economy slightly weaker than it previously forecast. However the Bank added that there would be a near-term boost as uncertainty lifted and companies and households invested more. The Bank had previously stopped short of incorporating Theresa May\u2019s deal into its economic forecasts, choosing instead to forecast on the basis of a range of probabilities over a Brexit deal. But today it said it was now forecasting on the basis of Mr Johnson\u2019s recently-negotiated deal with Brussels, which passed its second reading in the House of Commons. The upshot, it said, was that it was now forecasting that uncertainty would lift in the near term but that the deal, which implied customs checks and regulatory divergence with European trading partners, would then come to weigh on the economy. The Bank of England has also hinted that it could cut interest rates soon, if Brexit uncertainty isn\u2019t resolved soon. The minutes of this week\u2019s minutes say: Monetary policy could respond in either direction to changes in the economic outlook in order to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. The Committee would, among other factors, monitor closely the responses of companies and households to Brexit developments as well as the prospects for a recovery in global growth. If global growth failed to stabilise or if Brexit uncertainties remained entrenched, monetary policy might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth and inflation. Reuters\u2019 Andy Bruce says this is a major change: The pound has fallen back to $1.282, down a third of a cent, as City traders digest the BoE decision. That\u2019s its lowest level in just over a week. The Bank of England is also gloomier about the UK\u2019s growth prospects. It now expects the UK to grow by 1% less over the next three years, compared to its August forecasts. In its latest Monetary Policy Report, just released, it says: Growth in the UK economy has been volatile this year in part because of Brexit preparations. Looking through those ups and downs, growth has slowed. We expect growth this year to be roughly half that in 2018. That is partly because growth in other countries has also slowed. Lower growth elsewhere has reduced the demand for the goods and services that the UK sells abroad. The minutes of the Bank\u2019s meeting show that Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders pushed for lower interest rates to protect the UK from the weakening global economy, and Brexit uncertainty. The Bank says: Two members preferred a 25 basis point cut in Bank Rate at this meeting. The UK economy already had a modest but rising amount of spare capacity, and core inflation was subdued. The headline unemployment rate was likely to be a lagging indicator of labour market tightness; other indicators, including vacancies and short-term unemployment, suggested that the labour market was turning. There were downside risks to the MPC\u2019s projections from a weaker world outlook and from more persistent Brexit uncertainties affecting corporate and household spending. As a result, these members judged that some extra stimulus was needed now to ensure a sustained return of inflation to the target. This is the first split interest rate decision in over a year, points out Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. Newsflash: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged, at its last monetary policy committee before the general election. But there were two dissenters! Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel both voted to cut rates back to 0.5%. But the other seven members of the MPC outvoted them, to leave BoE base rate at 0.75%. More to follow..... We\u2019ll hear the Bank of England\u2019s own assessment of the UK economy in 15 minutes, when it publishes its latest forecasts - and its interest rate decision (probably no change). Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on the new EC growth forecasts: The European Union\u2019s executive branch has cut its growth forecasts for the 19-country eurozone for this year and next. The European Commission said Thursday that the single currency bloc is expected to grow 1.1% this year, down 0.1 percentage point from the previous forecast. And next year, growth is expected to be 0.2 percentage point lower than previously estimated 1.2%. Growth in 2021 is also expected at 1.2%. The outgoing commissioner responsible for economic affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said all European economies are set to grow over the coming two years \u201cin spite of increasingly strong headwinds.\u201d He said the fundamentals are \u201crobust\u201d and that after six years of growth, unemployment across the wider 28-country EU is at \u201cits lowest since the turn of the century.\u201d As flagged earlier, the UK is tipped to grow by 1.3% this year, and 1.4% in 2020 (a small upgrade). The EC has also forecast that Italy\u2019s budget deficit will keep growing - potentially creating another clash between Brussels and Rome. Italy\u2019s budget deficit is expected to hit 2.2% of GDP this year, above the 2% target set by the EU. It\u2019s then expected to widen, to 2.3% of economic outlook next year, and 2.7% in 2021. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has just said the EC won\u2019t take any action against Italy right now, but is pushing for structural reforms to boost growth. However, the two sides fell out badly this year after Italy\u2019s government proposed tax cuts and spending increases to pull Italy out of stagnation. This chart shows the Commission\u2019s new forecasts. The EC\u2019s Autumn Forecasts are pretty gloomy. They warn that Europe\u2019s economic outlook has deteriorated since the summer, meaning the region faces \u201ca challenging road ahead\u201d. It cites a range of factors - some temporary, others much more entrenched. They say: Economic growth in the EU is being dampened by the high level of uncertainty linked to trade tensions and by structural factors, some of which are temporary while others are more permanent. In the US, cyclical factors (supplemented by trade policy uncertainty) appear more relevant. In order to assess the factors that are weighing on economic growth, one has to distinguish between factors reflecting long-term developments (e.g. a trend decline in productivity, ageing); supply shocks (e.g. US-China trade tensions, Brexit, and temporary oil supply constraints); cyclical features (e.g. the economic cycle in the US, Asian tech cycle); structural shifts (e.g. car demand going \u2018greener\u2019, transition in China); policy effects (e.g. fading fiscal stimulus in the US); but also elevated uncertainty (e.g. related to trade policy, Brexit, and geopolitical issues). The forecasts are online here. The EC singles out Brexit as one key factor behind its weaker growth forecasts, saying: Against the background of an escalation in trade tensions, a near stagnation in international trade, and slowing global growth, the external environment has become less supportive than in recent years. Moreover, tariff threats, rising geopolitical tensions, the unknown features of Brexit, the persisting weakness of manufacturing and several structural factors have conspired to ensure a prolonged period of high uncertainty that is keeping a lid on economic growth. But it also claims that a no-deal Brexit would only have \u2018minor\u2019 impact on Europe\u2019s economy..... Asset prices could also be vulnerable to a reassessment of risks, creating vulnerabilities for the real economy. A \u2018disorderly\u2019 Brexit could dampen economic growth, particularly in the UK, but also in the EU27, though to a minor extent. The EC has also cut its growth forecasts for many largest European economics, but raised its forecast for the UK. Germany is now expected to grow by just 0.4% this year, down from 0.5% expected six months ago. German GDP is now tipped to rise by 1% in 2020, down from 1.4% previously. France\u2019s 2019 growth forecast has been trimmed to 1.3%, from 1.4%, for 2019, but maintained at 1.3% in 2020. Italy\u2019s 2020 growth forecast has been almost halved, to 0.4% from 0.7%. The EC still expects growth of just 0.1% this year. The UK, though, is expected to grow by 1.4% in 2020, up from the 1.3% expected in the Spring forecast. Growth in 2019 is still forecast at 1.3%. Here are the full forecasts for this year and next: Just in: The European Commission has cut its growth forecasts, and warned that Europe\u2019s economy faces \u2018growing headwinds\u2019. In its new autumn forecasts, the EC warns that the European and world economy have weakened over the past year. Europe has seen a sharp slowdown in external demand and a contraction in manufacturing, which is starting to spill over to other parts of the economy. While the solid performance of the labour market has helped to sustain private consumption and domestic demand, GDP growth is unlikely to rebound swiftly. The fact that growth is no longer expected to rebound meaningfully in the next two years is a major shift compared to previous forecasts and is based on the assessment that many features of the global slowdown will be persistent. The EC now expects the eurozone to grow by 1.1% this year, down from a previous estimate of 1.2%. The growth forecast for 2020 has been cut to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici warns that Europe faces \u2018increasingly strong headwinds\u2019, including trade disputes, Brexit, and structural changes in the car industry (towards electric vehicles and self-driving cars). More to follow.... In other corporate news, UK supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s profits have been all-but-wiped out by the cost of restructuring and store closures. Pre-tax earnings for the last six months dropped to just \u00a39m, from \u00a3107m a year earlier. Underlying profits fell 15%, not helped by the 1% drop in like-for-like sales. Sophie Lund-Yates, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Sainsbury faces a tough fight in an increasingly competitive market. We\u2019ve had good news from M&amp;S\u2019 food business this week, and its deal with Ocado will just add more pressure into the mix. It begs the question: what can Sainsbury\u2019s do to differentiate itself? The integration of Argos has been a step in a new direction, but despite the cross-selling potential, it hasn\u2019t been enough to boost overall sales. German industrial giant Siemens has warned that the global economy faces a tough year. It told investors this morning (before the latest trade developments): We expect global macroeconomic development to remain subdued in fiscal 2020, with risks particularly related to geopolitical and geoeconomic uncertainties. We assume a moderate decline in market volume for our short-cycle businesses. CEO Joe Kaeser added that \u201cThe weakening of the global economy accelerated clearly during fiscal 2019\u201d. Siemens still managed to grow orders by 7% in the year, but net profits fell to \u20ac5.65bn, from \u20ac6.12bn. Every European stock market is higher this morning, driven by the prospect of the US and China rolling back some tariffs. Here\u2019s the situation after 90 minutes of upbeat trading, following Beijing\u2019s comments that trade levies could be removed in a Phase One deal. Michael Metcalfe, global head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, says there are clear signs of progress: \u201cMarkets are showing themselves sensitive to the precise timing of the talks and risk of delay. But progress is apparently being made and hopes that there will be partial reversal in tariffs hikes is a clear positive for equity markets. We\u2019ve had several false dawns on the trade war this year, but any agreement to start reversing prior to hikes, even in stages, is way more constructive than anything we\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d The Stoxx 600 index of European companies is at a four-year high, but only up 0.4% today. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, suggests the reaction is a little muted: One might have expected the market to spike on this news which suggests the agreement isn\u2019t clear cut. Indeed, talk of \u2018phase one\u2019 of the agreement implies this could be a long drawn-out process, hence only a muted market reaction. A trade deal can\u2019t come soon enough for German factories. Industrial production across Germany shrank by 0.6% in September, new figures show, worse than the 0.4% decline expected. That follows a 0.4% rise in August. On an annual basis, industrial production was 4.3% lower than in September 2018. This decline further fuels concerns that Germany\u2019s economy shrank in the third quarter of 2019, following a small contraction in Q2. That would put Germany into a recession. We learned yesterday that industrial orders rose in September, so industrial production could pick up in the coming months. But the picture isn\u2019t great: John Hardy of Saxo Bank says today\u2019s trade deal headlines carry more weight because they come from the Chinese side, rather than the White House. He was speaking on Saxo\u2019s daily \u2018market call\u2019 podcast, online here. His colleague Peter Garnry agrees that the news about cutting tariffs is \u2018significant\u2019, but may already be priced into markets. A trade deal should boost economic growth, but it could take up to a year for the impact to flow through, he adds. Newsflash: We\u2019re not going to get a new healthcheck on the UK economy today after all. The independent Office for Budget Responsibilities has been blocked from publishing its updated forecast, by Britain\u2019s top civil servant. These forecasts would have outlined the likely path of UK public finances, including how much needs to be borrowed in the coming years. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill has ruled that it would have breached election rules (which prevent civil servants from doing anything political that would breach impartiality) European stock markets have jumped to their highest level since July 2015. The news that China and the US have (apparently) agreed to roll back some tariffs has sparked a rally in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid, as well as London. This lifts the pan-European Stoxx 600 index to 406 points, a four year high. Industrial groups, miners and technology companies are all gaining ground. Germany\u2019s DAX is leading the way, up 0.7%, to its highest since January 2018. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Beijing\u2019s comments about rolling back tariffs have boosted risk sentiment. Let\u2019s be clear \u2013 this is more of the same kind of pump we see almost daily. But it\u2019s decidedly positive nonetheless. The question remains whether the White House would be prepared to ditch all tariffs in exchange for some vague commitments on agricultural products and IP and think it can sell that as a win to voters. However, the comments from the Chinese commerce ministry do indicate a path out of the mire. Bloomberg is also reporting that China and the US have agreed to roll back some tariffs. It says: China and the U.S. have agreed to proportionally roll back tariffs on each other\u2019s goods in phases, a Ministry of Commerce spokesman said. The amount of tariff relief that would come in the first phase, set to be signed in the coming weeks, would depend on the content of that agreement, spokesman Gao Feng said Thursday without giving further details. The two sides had \u201cconstructive talks\u201d in the past two weeks, he said. If confirmed by the U.S., such an understanding could provide a road-map to de-escalate a trade war that\u2019s cast a shadow over the world economy. China\u2019s key demand since the start of negotiations has been the removal of punitive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which by now apply to the majority of its exports to the U.S. Stocks rallied, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index climbing 0.7% and futures on the S&amp;P 500 adding 0.5%. But.... investors should still be a little cautious, as a Phase One deal still hasn\u2019t been nailed down (let alone a comprehensive trade deal). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hopes of an imminent breakthrough in the US-China trade war are driving Britain\u2019s stock market to a five-week high this morning, as shares rally across Europe. China\u2019s commerce ministry has pumped up expectations of a deal, by revealing that both sides have agreed in principle to lift tariffs, in stages, as part of a preliminary agreement. Reuters\u2019 Beijing bureau has the details: China and the United States must simultaneously cancel some existing tariffs on each other\u2019s goods for both sides to reach a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday. The proportion of tariffs cancelled must be the same, and how much tariffs should be cancelled can be negotiated, said Gao Feng, spokesman at the commerce ministry. Both sides have agreed in the past two weeks to cancel the additional tariffs imposed during their months-long trade war in different phases, Gao said. Importantly, the two sides are still talking - so they\u2019ve not actually reached a Phase One deal yet. But there\u2019s relief that both sides are talking about removing some of the hurdles to trade, which have hampered the global economy for more than a year. US stock futures are also pushing higher. The latest chatter is that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could sign the Phase One deal in December. Also coming up today The Bank of England is setting UK interest rates today, for the last time before the general election. The central bank will also publish new forecasts, which may take a gloomier view of the UK economy. Howard Cunningham, fixed income portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management, explains: \u201cThe UK market continues to be susceptible to UK politics and as such we would expect the central bank to cut growth and inflation forecasts in its Monetary Policy Report. Regardless of the forecasts in the next report, investors do not expect to see a change to interest rates until we receive some clarity on who will be running the country and their stance on Brexit. \u201cThis said, a poor economic forecast would put pressure on the central bank to introduce easing measures. The loss of momentum may even see previously hawkish members of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee acknowledge the need for a rate cut, although with just over a month until the next general election we would expect to see little change to policy this week. Today\u2019s forecasts have been rebranded as the Monetary Report, rather than the Inflation Report. There\u2019s a flurry of corporate news today. Supermarket chain Sainsbury has posted 1% fall in like-for-like sales, and a 15% drop in profits. Jet engine maker Rolls-Royce has cautioned that profits this year will come towards the \u2018lower end\u2019 of its guidance. due to ongoing problems with its Trent 1000 engine. Luxury car maker Aston Martin has posted a \u00a313.5m loss for the last quarter. Housebuilders Persimmon and Bovis, fashion chain SuperDry and bookmaker Flutter are also updating the market. More on all that, and more, shortly....

Three non-signatories \u2013 Israel, India and Pakistan \u2013 have nuclear weapons.</p> <p>This week the Iranian government took a fourth step in reducing its adherence to its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which has been unravelling since Donald Trump withdrew the US from the deal last year and reimposed sanctions. Iran announced on Tuesday it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/iran-announces-injection-of-uranium-gas-into-1044-centrifuges\">injecting uranium gas</a> into centrifuges at its Fordow plant, a move that dramatically increases its enrichment capacity.</p> <p>Baeidinejad said the advocates of withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty asked why Iran should be submitting to UN atomic agency verification of its programme when other countries did not recognise Iran\u2019s right under the treaty to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.</p> <p>The ambassador\u2019s warning about the demands of hardliners within Iran could be taken as a signal to Europe not to respond to Iran\u2019s recent actions by pulling out of the 2015 deal altogether.</p> <p>Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has said the uranium enrichment at Fordow is the most serious breach yet of the deal. France, Germany and the UK are consulting on how to respond, including whether to trigger the deal\u2019s dispute resolution mechanism, a step that could lead to a return of UN sanctions.</p> <p>Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, showed Washington\u2019s frustration at Europe\u2019s reluctance to abandon the deal, saying in a statement: \u201cIt is now time for all nations to reject this regime\u2019s nuclear extortion and take serious steps to increase pressure. Iran\u2019s continued and numerous nuclear provocations demand such action.\u201d</p> <p>Baeidinejad urged Europe to do more to boost trade with Iran, even if it came at a cost, through secondary sanctions imposed by the US. \u201cWe cannot continue to implement the deal one-sidedly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe latest measure is adopted as a warning sign that we are in a crisis.

      "bodyText": "The Iranian government is under growing domestic pressure to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty next year, the country\u2019s ambassador to the UK has said. Hamid Baeidinejad said it was government policy to remain in the treaty but there were growing calls to pull out next year, when it is due for renewal, as it required Iran to make one-sided commitments. \u201cThere are views by some circles, some personalities, that Iran has not benefited from membership of the [treaty] and it is time to withdraw,\u201d he said, adding that Iran remained committed on religious grounds to not developing nuclear weapons. Iran is a founding member of the treaty, which is aimed at achieving disarmament by nuclear-armed states. Three non-signatories \u2013 Israel, India and Pakistan \u2013 have nuclear weapons. This week the Iranian government took a fourth step in reducing its adherence to its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which has been unravelling since Donald Trump withdrew the US from the deal last year and reimposed sanctions. Iran announced on Tuesday it was injecting uranium gas into centrifuges at its Fordow plant, a move that dramatically increases its enrichment capacity. Baeidinejad said the advocates of withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty asked why Iran should be submitting to UN atomic agency verification of its programme when other countries did not recognise Iran\u2019s right under the treaty to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The ambassador\u2019s warning about the demands of hardliners within Iran could be taken as a signal to Europe not to respond to Iran\u2019s recent actions by pulling out of the 2015 deal altogether. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has said the uranium enrichment at Fordow is the most serious breach yet of the deal. France, Germany and the UK are consulting on how to respond, including whether to trigger the deal\u2019s dispute resolution mechanism, a step that could lead to a return of UN sanctions. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, showed Washington\u2019s frustration at Europe\u2019s reluctance to abandon the deal, saying in a statement: \u201cIt is now time for all nations to reject this regime\u2019s nuclear extortion and take serious steps to increase pressure. Iran\u2019s continued and numerous nuclear provocations demand such action.\u201d Baeidinejad urged Europe to do more to boost trade with Iran, even if it came at a cost, through secondary sanctions imposed by the US. \u201cWe cannot continue to implement the deal one-sidedly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe latest measure is adopted as a warning sign that we are in a crisis. Our aim and objective is to implement the nuclear deal and not to lead to its collapse.\u201d He said it was not a good message for Europe to tell the rest of the international community that \u201cwe do not have control over our trade, economy and national security policies and cannot implement our policies due to the US.\u201d He said it was \u201cagreed policy at the highest level\u201d to reduce Iranian commitments under the deal every two months, implying that Iran could have made as many as 10 steps away from the deal by the time of the next US presidential election in November 2020.",

The $200,000 in cash, allegedly secured in large plastic containers, probably didn\u2019t belong to Spanish pirates. Yet it\u2019s already inspired neighbours to dig on their own properties, hoping to unearth a hoard of their own. So what does treasure hunting mean in 21st century Australia? Nick Richards knows something of the emotions motivating the Runaway Bay searchers. \u201cThere\u2019s a treasure hunter in everyone,\u201d he says, \u201cparticularly in kids that refuse to grow up \u2013 which is basically me.\u201d Richards has wielded a metal detector for 25 years, but he\u2019s not using his skills to track down Lasseter\u2019s Reef or uncover the Mahogany Ship.

He credits Facebook for miraculous reunions, including the wedding ring returned to a couple from Dubbo after the woman\u2019s beautician saw it on Richards\u2019s page. \u201cI\u2019m still pretty sure that they\u2019re still not certain how they got it back but it was very, very satisfying.\u201d Finding jewellery lost in the ocean might not be the most swashbuckling way to acquire loot.

In 1998, researchers had found an antique French bottle cap on the island \u2013 and Sheppard and his team eventually unearthed an intact bottle. \u201cIt was pretty amazing.

It said governments \u201cshould focus on what outcomes they are collectively achieving from their investments, rather than seeking credit for individual funding announcements\u201d. The damning assessment, in the commission\u2019s draft report released on Friday, said the governments were operating in isolation in a system which was so fragmented they didn\u2019t know what each other was doing or whether services were having any impact \u2013 and fundamental change was needed. Children in the NT are four times more likely to come into contact with the child protection system than other Australian children. In an effort to address the hugely disproportionate rate, the NT and commonwealth governments have made significant financial commitments, spending about $538m in 2018-19. But the Productivity Commission found the money \u2013 which went through nine funding agencies in more than 700 grants to more than 500 service providers \u2013 was being spent without an understanding of what communities need, or what was already being funded by other agencies. \u201cThere is inadequate coordination between and within both governments, with each often unaware of what the other is funding and of what is being delivered on the ground,\u201d the commission said. \u201cThere is immense goodwill, positive reforms and pockets of good practice, but a fundamental shift in approach is needed \u2013 one that is underpinned by a stronger commitment to transparency and collaboration between governments, service providers and communities. \u201cThis would help to ensure that governments are collectively accountable for achieving their shared objective \u2013 of keeping children and young people safe and well.\u201d The report found a particular overlap in services addressing family violence and crisis accomodation, justice and legal services, sport and recreation, and community development services. In some locations dual services existed, while in other places there was nothing. Some individual services were funded from as many as seven different sources. Participants in the study also drew the commission\u2019s attention to gaps in services, including youth mental health, parenting programs, access to safe houses and various youth justice services including rehabilitation. In answer to a long-running complaint in the sector about unpredictable short-term contracts, which hindered long-term plans as well as staff hiring and retention, the commission recommended the government transition to contracts with a minimum seven years, with exceptions for things like program trials. The contracts should also cover the full cost of the service and properly took into account the capacity of organisations, particularly in Indigenous communities. A key finding of the NT royal commission into the protection and detention of children was that government funding was not properly tracked, monitored or evaluated. The commission noted there were more than 15 different types of geographical units used in NT government expenditure reports, and in some cases the money couldn\u2019t be linked to specific towns or communities. The NT government has been criticised previously over a lack of transparency in its Indigenous expenditure. It recommended a formal process between the federal and territory governments which agreed on each\u2019s level of funding, and pooled some funds for distribution based on needs identified in conjunction with the actual communities where they were directed. \u201cCommunity plans should be developed that provide a snapshot of the strengths and needs of children and families in the community and give community voice about which children and family services they would like to retain, change or replace.\u201d While there were positive moves being made, including the NT government\u2019s $230m reform packaged announced after the royal commission, its plan to transfer some government services to Aboriginal communities over the next 10 years, and the federal government\u2019s moving of Indigenous policy into a new specific agency, it wasn\u2019t enough. The significant changes wouldn\u2019t need to substantially realign each government\u2019s responsibilities, it said, which could prove counterproductive, but a new process to coordinate funding was needed.

Dindarr Pty Ltd was one of more than 200 companies to receive federal government grants under the Coalition\u2019s regional jobs and investment program, which was the subject of a scathing report from the auditor general released on Tuesday. The $1m allocated to Dindarr was for the Yarrabah Ferry and Bus Project in Queensland, which would connect the Yarrabah Indigenous community to Cairns by \u201cfast, low-cost ferry and bus services\u201d. Under the program guidelines, applicants were required to provide co-funding towards the total cost of the project, which in Dindarr\u2019s proposal was estimated at $2m. The Dindarr director Peter McAllister told Guardian Australia he was not aware of the \u201cconcerning\u201d strike-off action under way by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and said he would \u201chave to fix that\u201d. He also said that he had not been required to show he had $1m to match the federal government grant. Instead, he said he had been required to provide a letter from an accountant that said he was trading profitably in a different business, and that he would have the ability to access finance through this company. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to show I had the money, I had to show I had the ability to access the money, that the business was trading and had the ability to borrow.\u201d This was through a separate business \u2013 AwareHouse Analytics \u2013 which was not the company that received the grant. Dindarr Pty Ltd was registered in July 2017 to apply for the grant, McAllister confirmed. He also said that he did not operate a transport business prior to receiving the funds. McAllister said he had already invested approximately $300,000 from private funds into the business and was \u201con track to exceed our $1m commitment\u201d by November next year. \u201cI can confirm that my accountant did certify that AwareHouse could access funding of $1m on Dindarr\u2019s behalf, as it has, is and will continue to do.\u201d On the current operation, McAllister said that it was \u201cextremely difficult\u201d to establish the new service which was mostly dependent on bus fares being paid by members of the Yarrabah Indigenous community. \u201cWe are losing money. We are developing the business in a variety of ways but Yarrabah is a very challenging environment to work in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident that the service is going to survive and it will eventually develop, and eventually there will be a ferry service ... but there are a few hoops to jump through before we get there,\u201d McAllister said. He also confirmed that he had been forced to lay off three bus drivers and was now operating the service himself, because \u201cthe cash flow is hard to maintain\u201d.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While using the $1m grant to buy vehicles and boats, the ferries have since been moved to the Gold Coast because the proposed route for the ferry in Trinity Bay is not deep enough. The ferries are not yet operating commercially. McAllister said that dredging would now be required to allow the ferry route at Yarrambah to function, but this was unlikely to happen in the next two years. He said he had looked at buying a private shipyard at Trinity Bay for around $600,000 to secure a different ferry route, but had been unable to secure finance. A report in the Cairns Post in December last year said McAllister was seeking an \u201cangel\u201d investor to provide funding of $1m for capital expenditure, and an additional $600,000 in startup capital and operating costs. When the grant was initially announced, the ferry service was expected to be operational by August 2019. Under the grant guidelines, awarded projects were expected to \u201ccreate new local jobs in the region\u201d and \u201ccontribute to boosting the skills and knowledge of employees and people in the region\u201d, among a list of criteria for funding. According to the audit report, funding decisions that were made by a panel of government ministers under the RJIP program were often made against the recommendations of the department. Ministers declined to fund 28% of grant applications recommended to them by officials, and approved 17% of applications that had not been recommended to them. The audit found that projects approved most often against the recommendations of department were located in tropical north Queensland. The government is refusing to provide the list of recommended projects, with the department saying the information is not publicly available. It has also declined to comment on individual projects, saying information is \u201ccommercial in confidence\u201d. The department refused to say whether Dindarr was one of the recommended applicants for funding, but said progress payments were paid in arrears based on invoices supplied by the applicant that demonstrated their expenditure. Analysis by the Labor party, which had complained to the auditor general about potential bias in the grants program, shows that of the $18.1m spent in the tropical north Queensland region, 89% of this was spent in the LNP-held seat of Leichhardt, compared to just 11% spent in Kennedy, held by the independent MP Bob Katter.

      "bodyText": "The last time England beat Germany they played three at the back and ended up having medals placed around their necks. It was a little over four years ago, at Canada 2015, and the win secured a third-place World Cup finish but there is currently an even more compelling case for Phil Neville switching to a formation that might just enable him to marry philosophy with practicality. Neville\u2019s predecessor, Mark Sampson, outwitted Germany\u2019s then coach, Silvia Neid, by deploying a midfielder, Jo Potter, out of position at the heart of England\u2019s backline. It proved a highly successful, one-off gamble but, in Arsenal\u2019s Leah Williamson, Neville possesses precisely the type of talented, natural sweeper in the making that teams are often built around. England\u2019s coach could do with pulling a tactical rabbit from the hat when Martina Voss-Tecklenburg\u2019s Germany come calling for a high stakes friendly at a sold-out Wembley on Saturday. Neville, remember, remains \u201cunder pressure\u201d following a dismal run of results stemming from the Lionesses\u2019s France 2019 semi-final defeat against the USA and could do without another stumble in a showpiece fixture celebrating the burgeoning growth of the women\u2019s game. Before last month\u2019s narrow, and somewhat fortunate, victory away to lowly ranked Portugal, England had gone five games without a win, recording four defeats along the way. Their coach bridled when it was pointed out that a similar sequence, albeit in a different context, cost Hope Powell the job in 2013 but it has been evident for a while that all is not quite right. Tellingly, the Lionesses seem to have forgotten how to defend crosses and set pieces and frequently appear ridiculously vulnerable to diagonal balls into the penalty area.

Such a framework might offer England the shape and structure to control games in a manner they have found so elusive in recent months. With some slightly flattering wins airbrushing a few blemished World Cup performances during the summer, the only game en route to the final four that they genuinely dominated was the quarter-final demolition of Norway. Otherwise, they oscillated between convincing 20-minute cameos and passages of alarmingly slapdash stuff, with Ellen White\u2019s goals and Jill Scott\u2019s dynamism camouflaging numerous deficiencies. After the Lionesses lost the third-place play-off to Sweden in Nice an apparently throwaway remark from Bronze rang alarm bells. \u201cPhil\u2019s said himself he\u2019s not the best coach with the best tactics,\u201d said Lyon\u2019s right-back. \u201cBut he\u2019s helped us become a better team.\u201d It sounded suspiciously like damning with faint praise yet the idea appears to be that Neville\u2019s blend of welcome emotional intelligence \u2013 like all the best managers he prioritises properly understanding his players\u2019 psyches \u2013 and big-game nous is leavened by his assistant Bev Priestman\u2019s mastery of the small print. \u201cPhil\u2019s man-management\u2019s world class, so you have to allow him time to concentrate on it and not get bogged down in details,\u201d Priestman says. \u201cIt means he can get the best out of everyone.\u201d Unfortunately the balance does not seem quite right at present and England\u2019s manager is clearly not coaxing optimal performances out of certain players he privately believes have started to cruise a little.

Announcing the proposed ban in August, Morrison expressed concern about the amount of plastic waste ending up in the ocean and cited data suggesting just 12% of Australian plastic waste was recycled.</p> <p>Jeff Angel, the director of the Total Environment Centre, said to dealing with the problem the ministers\u2019 meeting needed to make significant commitments on the procurement of recycled products, recycling content requirements and funding to kickstart the domestic industry.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want this environment ministers\u2019 meeting to issue one of those usual vague, non-specific communiques,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In a video statement, the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the meeting would set a timetable for the ban, as promised. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we make it happen,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But she said it would not be achieved through \u201cgovernment grants and too much regulation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe sector is full of really smart people, they\u2019re doing this already, they need some help to scale up and I\u2019m always interested in how we can do that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, the Victorian minister, said the country needed \u201can urgent national plan to fund this ban so we\u2019re ready when it comes in\u201d.

Gayle Sloan, the chief executive of the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association, said a draft plan shared with interest groups included no policies or funding to help develop a local industry to process what would no longer be exported. She said the industry and environment sector were united in concern over an apparent lack of action. In a letter to ministers, Sloan applauded the vision to boost domestic recycling capacity and end reliance on exports, but said the industry was dismayed little had been done to enable the shift. She said it wanted a \u201crobust action plan\u201d for use of recycled material backed by strong, enforceable targets and matched by funding from \u201call players in the supply chain\u201d, including packaging producers. It urged the states to press the federal government to explain how it would spend $130m committed to recycling at the election, and called on them to match it. \u201cIf we are going to make real change and not just set targets we can\u2019t meet or will only meet through perverse outcomes of increasing waste to landfill, then we have to have real support packages and sensible timeframes,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cWe can do this, but not at zero cost and not with a few months\u2019 notice.\u201d Australia exports about 4.5m tonnes of waste to Asia each year, more than half of which is metal. Recycling companies have struggled to find new places to export waste since China introduced strict limits on the level of contaminated recycling material it would accept nearly two years ago. In Victoria, it culminated in recycling company SKM being put in administration and up to 180,000 tonnes of recyclable material potentially going to landfill. Compared with other developed economies, Australia generates more waste than average and recycles less. Announcing the proposed ban in August, Morrison expressed concern about the amount of plastic waste ending up in the ocean and cited data suggesting just 12% of Australian plastic waste was recycled. Jeff Angel, the director of the Total Environment Centre, said to dealing with the problem the ministers\u2019 meeting needed to make significant commitments on the procurement of recycled products, recycling content requirements and funding to kickstart the domestic industry. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this environment ministers\u2019 meeting to issue one of those usual vague, non-specific communiques,\u201d he said. In a video statement, the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the meeting would set a timetable for the ban, as promised. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we make it happen,\u201d she said. But she said it would not be achieved through \u201cgovernment grants and too much regulation\u201d. \u201cThe sector is full of really smart people, they\u2019re doing this already, they need some help to scale up and I\u2019m always interested in how we can do that,\u201d she said. Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, the Victorian minister, said the country needed \u201can urgent national plan to fund this ban so we\u2019re ready when it comes in\u201d. She said the state was investing $135m and called for a rapid injection of federal funding. Other ministers approached declined to comment on how the ban would be implemented or did not respond. In Queensland, the environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, said she wanted to introduce laws next year to ban many single-use plastics, with the possibility it could be extended to cups and heavyweight shopping bags. Enoch said the state\u2019s \u201cplastic pollution reduction plan\u201d was an Australian first in scope and structure and would encourage a shift to a circular economy that minimised waste and boosted recycling. She said any legislation would be the subject of widespread consultation and flagged exemptions for the disability and aged care sectors if suitable replacement products were not available. WWF-Australia\u2019s Katinka Day said if the Queensland plan was implemented the state would become the national leader in tackling single-use plastics, and called on other jurisdictions to follow. She said a major challenge would be dealing with inefficiencies in the waste management system that led to up to 130,000 tonnes of plastic entering local waterways and oceans each year. The environment ministers\u2019 meeting is also expected to reach a decision on a delayed national nature strategy meant to cover the years 2018 to 2030. A 17-page draft \u201cstrategy for nature\u201d was posted on the web just before Christmas 2017, replacing the previous 100-page biodiversity conservation strategy. It outlined three goals and 12 objectives but few details about what state and federal governments would do to meet them, and no measurable targets. The Wilderness Society and the Australian Conservation Foundation urged Ley to use the meeting to secure an agreement on a national plan to address a spiralling extinction crisis.",

Unencrypted, the Latin reads: \u201cEgo una Saxonica nomine Hugeburc ordinando hec scribebam,\u201d or \u201cI, a Saxon nun named Hugeburc, wrote this\u201d. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a modern translation so it\u2019s not something people could go and read, but a text like that is so important,\u201d said Watt. \u201cAnd for Leoba, who was a close supporter of St Boniface, her very first letter to him includes lines of verse, which she\u2019s composing in order to impress him. It seems to work because he subsequently invites her to travel to Germany to join the mission. She\u2019s using poetry almost [as a] CV. So we know women were writing poetry back then.\u201d Watt also argues that an anonymous eighth-century Life of Gregory the Great could have been produced by one of the nuns in Whitby\u2019s double monastery, not necessarily by a monk. \u201cThe emphasis on women within the text would seem to reflect the interests of women, which would seem to suggest female authorship,\u201d she said. She also makes the case that monastic writers of the time \u201coverwrote\u201d accounts by women of their own histories. One example, she claims, is Bede, who did not name the authors of the local books he drew upon for his account of the early abbesses of the English church in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People. \u201cI\u2019m 99.9% sure that these early sources were written by women, the early communities themselves producing their own histories,\u201d said Watt. \u201cBede came along and took these sources and incorporated them \u2026 It\u2019s not a deliberate censorship, but you have a major writer like Bede coming along, and his becomes the definitive text, and the earlier ones become redundant.\u201d It wasn\u2019t only medieval monks overlooking the work of women. Watt writes that that even recently published studies of literary history continue to give short shrift to women, especially in relation to the pre-modern period. \u201cI think the field of medieval literature is very slow to change, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do in this book is a lot of the groundwork for the texts available, because the texts are in Latin [and] Old English, so you have to have quite specific scholarly skills to access this material.\u201d Watt believes that understanding women writers\u2019 contribution is vital to understanding the period itself. \u201cOur understanding of the period as a whole is diminished by not acknowledging their contributions,\u201d she said.",

The verb \u201cto sort\u201d comes from the Latin sort\u012br\u012b, to distribute by lottery, which is why \u201csortition\u201d is the name for a system of democratic government, arguably superior to the one we currently enjoy, where leaders are made up of randomly chosen citizens. But Corbyn used the demotic sense of \u201csort\u201d to mean \u201csort out\u201d, to solve or clear up, as in the exclamation \u201cSorted!\u201d. Commuters on London\u2019s public transport have long been irritated by its \u201cSee It. Say It. Sorted\u201d slogan, though even \u201cto sort out\u201d \u2013 in the sense of to resolve rather than literally to divide \u2013 is relatively newfangled, recorded only since 1948. Yet the sense of \u201cto sort\u201d as to accomplish is of much more antique vintage. As the Third Citizen in Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III remarks: \u201cAll may be well: but if God sort it so / Tis more then we deserve or I expect.\u201d So might we feel about the election. \u2022 Steven Poole\u2019s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus.",

      "bodyText": "A police constable has been charged with murdering Dalian Atkinson in a clash during which a stun gun and other force was used on the former footballer. Atkinson, who played for Aston Villa and Manchester City, died, aged 48, after the fracas outside his father\u2019s home in Telford, Shropshire, in the early hours of 15 August 2016. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said on Thursday that two officers, both police constables with the West Mercia force, were facing charges. One had been charged with murder, which carries a sentence of life imprisonment, and also faced an alternate charge of manslaughter. The other had been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm. Neither officer has been named. The incident was investigated by the police watchdog after officers from the West Mercia force used a Taser as they tried to detain Atkinson, and other force. The Independent Office for Police Conduct then referred the case to the CPS in October 2018 to consider whether any criminal charges should be brought. The IOPC had previously said of its inquiry: \u201cThe investigation gathered evidence which indicates that police contact with Mr Atkinson involved the use of a Taser, followed by a period of restraint and other uses of force.\u201d It is rare for an officer to face a charge of murder for their actions while performing their duties. The incident happened while Atkinson, who lived nearby, was visiting his father in Meadow Close, Telford. A neighbour telephoned the police and officers were called to the scene at 1.30 am. Atkinson was pronounced dead 90 minutes later in hospital. Jenny Hopkins, of the CPS, saidAtkinson\u2019s family had been informed of the charges. \u201cThis decision was made following a careful review of all the evidence presented to us by the Independent Office for Police Conduct following an investigation,\u201d she said. Atkinson started his career at Ipswich Town and played for Sheffield Wednesday and Real Sociedad before moving to Villa. At Villa he scored more than 20 goals in the top flight of English football between 1991 and 1995 before going on to play less successfully for teams including Fenerbah\u00e7e and Manchester City. In cases involving death after contact with the police, both the families of the victims and the officers complain about the length of time it takes to investigate and decide on any charges. Those involved in this case face a further wait until criminal trials next year. Kate Maynard, the solicitor for the Atkinson family, said: \u201cDalian\u2019s family welcomes the decision to put the conduct of police officers before a jury but regrets that already more than three years have passed since Dalian died. \u201cThey ask for their privacy to be respected and press for the criminal proceedings to progress without delay or obstruction.\u201d The West Mercia chief constable, Anthony Bangham, said: \u201cOur thoughts continue to remain with the family and friends of Dalian Atkinson at this difficult time. \u201cWe understand the need for answers. However, as court proceedings are now under way it would not be appropriate for us to make any further comment regarding the circumstances of Mr Atkinson\u2019s death. \u201cThe officers involved have a right to a fair trial and we will continue to make sure they have the appropriate support throughout the forthcoming criminal justice process.\u201d When asked if the officers had been suspended, a West Mercia police spokesperson said: \u201cThere will be a process around the officers\u2019 duty status following the CPS decision today.\u201d Derrick Campbell, of the IOPC, said: \u201cWe appreciate the patience shown by all concerned during our thorough and independent investigation and the period it was with the CPS for consideration. We have kept Mr Atkinson\u2019s family, West Mercia police, and the coroner informed throughout.\u201d Deborah Coles of Inquest, which helps families whose relatives have died after contact with the police, said: \u201cTwo years ago, an independent review of deaths in police custody by Dame Elish Angiolini QC highlighted the negative impact of delays in investigations and prosecutions like this. Angiolini recommended that such cases be dealt with in the same timescales as a civilian homicide case. Clearly there is still much work to be done to meet those standards.\u201d",

If you want to discuss any of the further queries, you can probably find my email online.</p> <p>First: are there literally no other actors alive? Are there literally no other actors alive? Are there literally \u2026 no other actors alive? I struggle with the concept that there are no other actors alive, and that two film directors \u201csearched high and low\u201d, considered \u2013 I don\u2019t know, citing a random example \u2013 every other actor currently alive, and thought: \u201cNo, actually, the only one who can pull off the complex character arcs of the second lead of a film about a soldier who loves dogs is the resurrected, computer-generated face of James Dean with a voice by an as-yet unnamed actor.\u201d If I were an actor, who was currently alive, I would be very personally offended by this.</p> <p>Second: I would pay good money \u2013 an astonishing amount of good money \u2013 to be in the production meeting when this was first mooted. A load of Los Angeles types, sunglasses on indoors, sliding the comp cards of every actor on earth around on a five-seater table, umming and ahhing and deciding: \u201cNo, just <em>none of these people</em> has the right face that says, \u2018I love dogs \u2026 <em>but in a brooding way</em>.\u2019\u201d And then one person crashes back in from the bathroom with a sudden burst of energy and a huge idea: \u201cWhat about James Dean? What about James actual Dean?\u201d And everyone in the room bursts into impromptu applause and says: \u201cYes! Yes! He\u2019s the only man who can do the job. James Dean, James Dean. It has to be James Dean!\u201d</p> <p>Third: why would you go to the bother of resurrecting the dead \u2013 which a number of books, holy and not, have warned us very sternly about \u2013 just to get him to play second lead? Not even the lead: <em>second</em> lead? Which actor has the range to perform at a ping-pong ball on a stick, upon which they are going to eventually project the likeness of Dean in post-production, and actually nail the performance? I know that the answer to any complicated fix-it-in-post question is always \u201cAndy Serkis\u201d, but I think even Serkis would struggle with this.</p> <p>Fourth: did nobody see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-irishman-review-martin-scorseses-finest-film-for-30-years\" title=\"\">The Irishman</a> yet? It\u2019s a phenomenally accomplished and expensive film that uses astonishingly cutting-edge CGI technology to de-age Robert De Niro in a way that still cannot hide the fact that he walks like an old man. If they can\u2019t make De Niro move as if he has full prostate control, then I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to make Dean \u2013 a man who, I have to remind you, is dead \u2013 look like he loves dogs and is alive.</p> <p>And fifth, now I have actually thought about it: this is phenomenally good. Alive celebrities keep messing up, don\u2019t they? They keep talking about politics or releasing a flop album or dating a lingerie model born in 2000. In the midst of cancel culture, alive people will only let you down. And you know who can\u2019t let you down? You know who can never make negative headlines about their private life in the middle of your film\u2019s promo tour? Someone who got given to the Lord well over half a century ago. Culture can\u2019t cancel James Dean because a Porsche 550 Spyder already did it <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7285027/Never-seen-photographs-reveal-wreckage-Hollywood-star-James-Deans-fatal-1955-car-crash.html\" title=\"\">in the most ultimate way</a>.</p> <p>This is the future of film, isn\u2019t it? Mark Roesler, the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.cmgworldwide.com/clients/\" title=\"\">CMG Worldwide</a>, the company that represents Dean\u2019s family and owns the image rights, also owns the likenesses of Bettie Page, Aaliyah, Christopher Reeve and, all right then, Malcolm X.

Weird. \u201cThey come and say: \u2018Well, I just want you to know that there are other ways besides sex that the hymen can be broken like bike riding, athletics, horseback riding and just other forms of athletic physical activity.\u2019 So I say: \u2018Look, doc, she don\u2019t ride no horses, she don\u2019t ride no bike, she don\u2019t play no sports. Just check the hymen, please, and give me back my results expeditiously.\u2019\u201d Please, doctor, my daughter hasn\u2019t ridden a bike in 18 years of existence. She doesn\u2019t even leave the house. Please just tell me if her hymen is OK.</p> <p>As many people have pointed out, this behaviour borders on abuse, falls into a category of gender-based violence defined as \u201chumiliating and traumatic\u201d by the World Health Organization, and any doctor complicit in sharing hymen status with someone who guested on Blurred Lines should probably be at least investigated and, at worst, struck off. It is also unutterably bizarre and I cannot believe anyone would confess to it in public.</p> <p>But then it is TI, isn\u2019t it? This is a man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/13/ti-vote-woman-president-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">who said, of the 2016 US presidential election</a>, \u201cNot to be sexist but I can\u2019t vote for the leader of the free world to be a woman. Just because, every other position that exists, I think a woman could do well. But the president? It\u2019s kinda like, I just know that women make rash decisions emotionally \u2013 they make very permanent, cemented decisions \u2013 and then later, it\u2019s kind of like it didn\u2019t happen, or they didn\u2019t mean for it to happen. And I sure would hate to just set off a nuke.\u201d Would definitely be bad if we had an emotional president who constantly flirted with the idea of setting off a nuke, TI, agreed. Anyway: can we get a CGI version of James Dean to do Rhythm + Flow next year, instead? Once again, the dead outwit the alive.</p>",

A load of Los Angeles types, sunglasses on indoors, sliding the comp cards of every actor on earth around on a five-seater table, umming and ahhing and deciding: \u201cNo, just none of these people has the right face that says, \u2018I love dogs \u2026 but in a brooding way.\u2019\u201d And then one person crashes back in from the bathroom with a sudden burst of energy and a huge idea: \u201cWhat about James Dean? What about James actual Dean?\u201d And everyone in the room bursts into impromptu applause and says: \u201cYes! Yes! He\u2019s the only man who can do the job. James Dean, James Dean. It has to be James Dean!\u201d Third: why would you go to the bother of resurrecting the dead \u2013 which a number of books, holy and not, have warned us very sternly about \u2013 just to get him to play second lead? Not even the lead: second lead? Which actor has the range to perform at a ping-pong ball on a stick, upon which they are going to eventually project the likeness of Dean in post-production, and actually nail the performance? I know that the answer to any complicated fix-it-in-post question is always \u201cAndy Serkis\u201d, but I think even Serkis would struggle with this. Fourth: did nobody see The Irishman yet? It\u2019s a phenomenally accomplished and expensive film that uses astonishingly cutting-edge CGI technology to de-age Robert De Niro in a way that still cannot hide the fact that he walks like an old man. If they can\u2019t make De Niro move as if he has full prostate control, then I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to make Dean \u2013 a man who, I have to remind you, is dead \u2013 look like he loves dogs and is alive. And fifth, now I have actually thought about it: this is phenomenally good. Alive celebrities keep messing up, don\u2019t they? They keep talking about politics or releasing a flop album or dating a lingerie model born in 2000. In the midst of cancel culture, alive people will only let you down. And you know who can\u2019t let you down? You know who can never make negative headlines about their private life in the middle of your film\u2019s promo tour? Someone who got given to the Lord well over half a century ago. Culture can\u2019t cancel James Dean because a Porsche 550 Spyder already did it in the most ultimate way. This is the future of film, isn\u2019t it? Mark Roesler, the CEO of CMG Worldwide, the company that represents Dean\u2019s family and owns the image rights, also owns the likenesses of Bettie Page, Aaliyah, Christopher Reeve and, all right then, Malcolm X. All my brain can think of when I read that information is \u201cincredibly bad Avengers sequel\u201d. Make it happen, CMG. Show me Malcolm X in Iron Man\u2019s suit, punching Thanos Aaliyah into the moon. It\u2019s always nice when dads show an interest, but \u2026 I\u2019m a big fan of the concept of \u201chaving a normal one\u201d, an internet-adjacent term for doing something completely berserk and deranged while maintaining the calm patina of reality \u2013 and in that context I am bravely announcing that the rapper TI is this week having The World\u2019s Most Normal One, after the judge on the Netflix show Rhythm + Flow told the podcast Ladies Like Us that he accompanies his 18-year-old daughter on yearly trips to the gynaecologist, ostensibly to have her hymen examined to see if it\u2019s still intact. \u201cYes, I go with her,\u201d he said, in comments since edited out of the show, because, you know. Weird. \u201cThey come and say: \u2018Well, I just want you to know that there are other ways besides sex that the hymen can be broken like bike riding, athletics, horseback riding and just other forms of athletic physical activity.\u2019 So I say: \u2018Look, doc, she don\u2019t ride no horses, she don\u2019t ride no bike, she don\u2019t play no sports. Just check the hymen, please, and give me back my results expeditiously.\u2019\u201d Please, doctor, my daughter hasn\u2019t ridden a bike in 18 years of existence. She doesn\u2019t even leave the house. Please just tell me if her hymen is OK. As many people have pointed out, this behaviour borders on abuse, falls into a category of gender-based violence defined as \u201chumiliating and traumatic\u201d by the World Health Organization, and any doctor complicit in sharing hymen status with someone who guested on Blurred Lines should probably be at least investigated and, at worst, struck off. It is also unutterably bizarre and I cannot believe anyone would confess to it in public. But then it is TI, isn\u2019t it? This is a man who said, of the 2016 US presidential election, \u201cNot to be sexist but I can\u2019t vote for the leader of the free world to be a woman. Just because, every other position that exists, I think a woman could do well. But the president? It\u2019s kinda like, I just know that women make rash decisions emotionally \u2013 they make very permanent, cemented decisions \u2013 and then later, it\u2019s kind of like it didn\u2019t happen, or they didn\u2019t mean for it to happen. And I sure would hate to just set off a nuke.\u201d Would definitely be bad if we had an emotional president who constantly flirted with the idea of setting off a nuke, TI, agreed. Anyway: can we get a CGI version of James Dean to do Rhythm + Flow next year, instead? Once again, the dead outwit the alive.",

      "bodyText": "BritBox, the new \u201cbest of British\u201d streaming joint venture from the BBC and ITV, will not include classic homegrown series that are deemed to be inappropriate for modern audiences. The new \u00a35.99-a-month service, which will also offer shows from Channel 4 and Channel 5, is aiming to compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime Video by positioning itself as the home of the widest library of British shows, old and new. However, bosses have said a range of classic shows, such as the BBC\u2019s Till Death Us Do Part and ITV\u2019s Love Thy Neighbour, will not appear on the service because of content deemed racist or otherwise unacceptable. \u201c[BritBox] is a selection [of shows],\u201d said Reemah Sakaan, the senior ITV executive responsible for launching the subscription video-on-demand service. \u201cWe also recomply everything that goes on to BritBox [with modern TV viewing standards]. There\u2019s also the ability to create bespoke warnings around key programming.\u201d Sakaan confirmed that Till Death Us Do Part, featuring the bigoted character Alf Garnett, which first aired on BBC1 in 1965, and ITV\u2019s 1970s series Love Thy Neighbour, a sitcom about a West Indian couple who move next door to a white English couple, will not appear on the service. It Ain\u2019t Half Hot Mum, the BBC comedy about a military band in India during the second world war, will also be absent. There are numerous individual episodes of some beloved shows that will appear on BritBox \u2013 including the BBC\u2019s Only Fools and Horses and Fawlty Towers \u2013 which could be deemed inappropriate for modern viewing. However, it is understood that no Fawlty Towers episodes will be cut from the service, although they will run with warnings about offensive language. \u201cWe\u2019ve carefully selected a wide range of the very best in British programming which will appeal to viewers in 2019,\u201d an ITV spokeswoman said. ITV\u2019s compliance team is voluntarily vetting BritBox shows to make sure they adhere to the broadcasting code, which applies to the broadcaster\u2019s TV channels and is governed by Ofcom, the media and communications watchdog. The broadcasting code includes strict rules relating to harm and offence and generally accepted standards, including inappropriate, explicit and violent content. However, BritBox is officially subject to a much less stringent set of rules than those of traditional TV channels such as ITV and the BBC. BritBox offers a range of shows, from Downton Abbey, Gavin &amp; Stacey and Wolf Hall to Broadchurch, Brideshead Revisited, Blackadder and more than 600 episodes of Doctor Who. Channel 4 will add more than 1,000 hours of its TV and film content to the service in the spring but it is not clear whether its biggest hit, The Great British Bake Off, will be available, as the show\u2019s producers have a separate streaming deal with Netflix. \u201cWe are making our [show] selections with Channel 4 as we speak and that is the kind of show that is top of our list,\u201d Sakaan said. BritBox is a late arrival in an increasingly crowded streaming market. Earlier this month Apple launched its new streaming service, undercutting all rivals at just \u00a34.99 a month, or free for a year to buyers of new Apple devices. Netflix is the most popular subscription streamer in the UK, having 11 million subscribers, but it is becoming increasingly expensive, with its most popular package priced at \u00a38.99 a month. Prime Video is estimated to have 8.6 million UK subscribers, with Sky\u2019s Now TV the third most popular service with about 1.75 million. Sakaan took a swipe at Netflix, which has rung up debt and liabilities of more than $30bn (\u00a323bn) in the process of building the world\u2019s largest streaming service with more than 150m subscribers. \u201cFor the first time all the UK\u2019s public service broadcasters have joined forces to take part in the fast-paced streaming market,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ambitious plans for BritBox. We are realistic and confident about establishing a scale business and, unlike some of these [streaming] ventures, we intend for this to be profitable.\u201d She said there was a gap in the market because UK audiences often felt \u201clost\u201d using other streaming services dominated by US content. \u201cIn BritBox you are immediately in a world populated by people and faces and places you know. The scale of British content available eclipses what is on any other streaming service.\u201d",

Mary Cain, who qualified for the 2013 world championships as a 17-year-old and was considered a once-in-a-generation star, also said she suffered from suicidal thoughts and had self-harmed. Cain, 23, told the New York Times: \u201cI joined Nike because I wanted to be the best female athlete ever. Instead I was emotionally and physically abused by a system designed by Alberto and endorsed by Nike.\u201d When Cain first arrived at Nike as a 16-year-old the all-male staff convinced her that \u201cto get better I had to get thinner \u2026 and thinner \u2026 and thinner\u201d. Cain said: \u201cAlberto was constantly trying to get me to lose weight. He created an arbitrary number of 114lbs and he would usually weigh me in front of my teammates and publicly shame me if I wasn\u2019t hitting weight. He wanted to give me birth control pills and diuretics to lose weight. \u201cI felt so scared and alone and I felt so trapped and I started to have suicidal thoughts. I started to cut myself. Some people saw me cutting myself. And nobody really did anything or said anything.\u201d When she told her parents they immediately bought her a plane ride home. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even trying to make the Olympics any more, I was trying to survive,\u201d she said. In an email to the New York Times, Salazar, who has said he will appeal after being banned for four years last month for doping offences, denied many of Cain\u2019s claims and said he had supported her health and welfare. Nike did not respond to a request for comment. The Guardian has also contacted Salazar for his response. Cain also called for more women to be involved in track and field. \u201cI got caught in a system designed by and for men, which destroys the bodies of young girls. We have to protect them.\u201d Salazar\u2019s former assistant Steve Magness, who became a whistleblower, said he had witnessed the same behaviour at the Oregon Project. \u201cAt one point I was told I needed to make a female athlete lose weight,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I showed data on her body fat being low already, I was told: \u2018I don\u2019t care what the science says I know what I see with my eyes. Her butt is too big.\u2019 There was no adult in the room, looking after health and wellbeing. When the culture pushes to the extreme, this is what you get.\u201d The IAAF\u2019s new reforms to the Diamond League, which include cutting or limiting the 200m, 3,000m steeplechase, discus and triple jump in next year\u2019s programme, have been widely condemned by athletes. Among those critical of the proposals were the British sprinter Adam Gemili, who tagged the Diamond League Twitter account in a tweet featuring a gif of actor Tom Hanks mouthing \u201creally?\u201d, and the former 3,000m steeplechase world champion Emma Coburn, who called them \u201cinsane\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>The most recent episode of Watchmen ended, as it so often does, on a puzzling note. FBI agent Laurie Blake (Jean Smart) has adjourned to her hotel room for a moment of personal time, which will be facilitated by the contents of her briefcase. She cracks it open to reveal a metallic ice-blue dildo with attachable testicles, so shiny and girthy that it looks more like a relay runner\u2019s baton than a sex toy. Those familiar with Alan Moore\u2019s source material will make the connection to Laurie\u2019s ex Dr Manhattan and his robin\u2019s-egg genitals, but even viewers in the know will be stricken by bafflement. Why does she carry this with her in a bulky storage case at all times? What of the minimalist design, which showrunner Damon Lindelof <a href=\"https://decider.com/2019/11/03/watchmen-damon-lindelof-explains-silk-spectre-doctor-manhattan-dildo/\">likened</a> to a Jeff Koons sculpture in one of the instant-postmortem interviews that run every Sunday night? And why is the thing so gosh-darned big?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/21/watchmen-review-the-perfect-superhero-story-for-our-tattered-times-hbo-alan-moore\">Watchmen review \u2013 the perfect superhero story for our tattered times</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Questions like these serve as the currency for Lindelof\u2019s sequel/reinterpretation of the landmark graphic novel, a show that traffics in what-just-happened confusion on a week-to-week basis. Some of its many riddles \u2013 the enduring mystery of why one law enforcement official wears an oversized panda head, for instance, or the reason that a cloned manservant gives his master a horseshoe with which to eat a piece of cake \u2013 seem unlikely to ever be solved. Others, such as the party or parties operating the flying saucer that appeared out of nowhere to magnet-airlift one character\u2019s car away as if it was a crane-game prize, must be clarified for the plot to move forward. But telling one from the other is all ultimately guesswork, with the audience left in the dark, right where Lindelof wants them.</p> <p>We don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re supposed to know, and that\u2019s where the bother lies. Lindelof thrives on all things confounding, the one point his previous works Lost<em> </em>and The Leftovers<em> </em>made abundantly clear. When considered after the fact of their broadcast runs as a discrete, closed-off whole, the series making up his body of work constitute some of the most entrancingly strange television in the medium\u2019s history. But when experienced on a week-to-week basis, there\u2019s a mild yet consistent frustration all too familiar to those with fresh memories of mid-00s genre projects like Lost and its lesser kindred Heroes. The Lindelofian element gives the impression that this perfectly intelligent, worthy show feels the need to trick its audience into tuning in week after week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d581f3ca394f9759986dc0cc8b6d59c067858ab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d581f3ca394f9759986dc0cc8b6d59c067858ab5/0_44_1536_922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly in Lost\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly in Lost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4 Picture Publicity</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To put it in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unknown_Known\">Rumsfeldian</a> terms, most TV shows operate within the unknown known, establishing a clearcut quantity of suspense to be resolved over the course of a season or series: who will win the game of thrones, who will succeed as CEO of Waystar Royco, who will challenge Tony Soprano\u2019s mafia supremacy, etc. Lindelof descends into the unknown unknown, generating drama by showing viewers complete non sequiturs without the information required to make sense of them. Even Breaking Bad, and its decontextualized in-medias-res cold opens, isolated its floating eyeballs and destroyed pools from the main narrative. (And that still felt like a cheap hook for an already-gripping show to lean on.) If a showrunner\u2019s not mindful about tethering their show to some foundation of comprehensibility, they end up with something in the spacey universe of Legion, drowning in weirdness for its own sake.</p> <p>To an extent, Lindelof is at a disadvantage of medium. Films can afford to adopt this modus operandi; by the end of a self-contained unit of time spanning two hours or so, the viewer will have received all the textual clues required to understand the work, or barring that, to gin up their own interpretation.

      "bodyText": "The most recent episode of Watchmen ended, as it so often does, on a puzzling note. FBI agent Laurie Blake (Jean Smart) has adjourned to her hotel room for a moment of personal time, which will be facilitated by the contents of her briefcase. She cracks it open to reveal a metallic ice-blue dildo with attachable testicles, so shiny and girthy that it looks more like a relay runner\u2019s baton than a sex toy. Those familiar with Alan Moore\u2019s source material will make the connection to Laurie\u2019s ex Dr Manhattan and his robin\u2019s-egg genitals, but even viewers in the know will be stricken by bafflement. Why does she carry this with her in a bulky storage case at all times? What of the minimalist design, which showrunner Damon Lindelof likened to a Jeff Koons sculpture in one of the instant-postmortem interviews that run every Sunday night? And why is the thing so gosh-darned big? Questions like these serve as the currency for Lindelof\u2019s sequel/reinterpretation of the landmark graphic novel, a show that traffics in what-just-happened confusion on a week-to-week basis. Some of its many riddles \u2013 the enduring mystery of why one law enforcement official wears an oversized panda head, for instance, or the reason that a cloned manservant gives his master a horseshoe with which to eat a piece of cake \u2013 seem unlikely to ever be solved. Others, such as the party or parties operating the flying saucer that appeared out of nowhere to magnet-airlift one character\u2019s car away as if it was a crane-game prize, must be clarified for the plot to move forward. But telling one from the other is all ultimately guesswork, with the audience left in the dark, right where Lindelof wants them. We don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re supposed to know, and that\u2019s where the bother lies. Lindelof thrives on all things confounding, the one point his previous works Lost and The Leftovers made abundantly clear. When considered after the fact of their broadcast runs as a discrete, closed-off whole, the series making up his body of work constitute some of the most entrancingly strange television in the medium\u2019s history. But when experienced on a week-to-week basis, there\u2019s a mild yet consistent frustration all too familiar to those with fresh memories of mid-00s genre projects like Lost and its lesser kindred Heroes. The Lindelofian element gives the impression that this perfectly intelligent, worthy show feels the need to trick its audience into tuning in week after week. To put it in Rumsfeldian terms, most TV shows operate within the unknown known, establishing a clearcut quantity of suspense to be resolved over the course of a season or series: who will win the game of thrones, who will succeed as CEO of Waystar Royco, who will challenge Tony Soprano\u2019s mafia supremacy, etc. Lindelof descends into the unknown unknown, generating drama by showing viewers complete non sequiturs without the information required to make sense of them. Even Breaking Bad, and its decontextualized in-medias-res cold opens, isolated its floating eyeballs and destroyed pools from the main narrative. (And that still felt like a cheap hook for an already-gripping show to lean on.) If a showrunner\u2019s not mindful about tethering their show to some foundation of comprehensibility, they end up with something in the spacey universe of Legion, drowning in weirdness for its own sake. To an extent, Lindelof is at a disadvantage of medium. Films can afford to adopt this modus operandi; by the end of a self-contained unit of time spanning two hours or so, the viewer will have received all the textual clues required to understand the work, or barring that, to gin up their own interpretation. Watchmen dares its viewership to solve its puzzles, but only gives them a handful of the pieces per week. Ironically enough, at a time when everyone seems to be running for the hills of streaming, the one series begging to be binged instead props up HBO\u2019s programming schedule. Watchmen has so much going for it, from the immersive detail of its speculative-fiction America to its thorny meditations on the politics of law enforcement. It has more profound quandaries to offer than \u201cwhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019ll happen next?\u201d In the same episode containing the unconventional marital aid, Laurie stops for a chat with an old acquaintance and tells him a \u201cbrick joke\u201d, a form of humor in which one set-up\u2019s punchline doesn\u2019t come until the end of a second premise.

      "body": "<p>Earlier this year, British poet Roger Robinson met one of his idols, Linton Kwesi Johnson. With his 1978 album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puy8mKEi5DI\" title=\"\">Dread Beat an\u2019 Blood</a>, which fiercely criticised police brutality in London and forecast the 1981 Brixton riots, Johnson helped to establish dub poetry: a blend of chest-rattling bass and thunderous verses speaking truth to power. He gave Robinson a memorable, if cryptic, missive.</p> <p>\u201cHe said, \u2018Nobody needs to sound like me now,\u2019\u201d recalls Robinson, who records and performs with Kevin Martin (AKA deep bass explorer the Bug) as <a href=\"https://ninjatune.net/artist/king-midas-sound\" title=\"\">King Midas Sound</a>. \u201cThat made me think, what would dub poetry be now? He\u2019s a very progressive thinker and he would want to see it morph into something that has the same sentiment, but a different framework and emphasis.\u201d</p> <p>He may have found the answer. King Midas Sound\u2019s stark, resonant new album <a href=\"https://kingmidassoundmusic.bandcamp.com/album/solitude\" title=\"\">Solitude</a> arrived last spring, along with a wave of underground artists such as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pvsvkt4wehY\" title=\"\">Amet</a>, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/162819792\" title=\"\">Asda</a> and the duo of <a href=\"https://bokeh-versions.com/album/ymfees\" title=\"\">Jay Glass Dubs and Leslie Winer</a>, who are revitalising dub poetry for a new era of political tumult and social injustice. Like their predecessors, who emerged from reggae\u2019s soundsystem culture, this next generation of dub poets is by no means aesthetically similar.</p> <p>Even the term itself, coined by Jamaican dub poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/27/popandrock.poetry\" title=\"o\">Oku Onuora</a>, has been controversial, with luminaries such as Johnson and Mutabaruka identifying as simply \u201cpoets\u201d to distance themselves from it \u2013 but their ideologies are unquestionably shared. \u201cIt\u2019s about equality and justice,\u201d explains Lillian Allen, Toronto dub poet and professor. \u201cCalling the system to account and validating people\u2019s inner voices and experiences, and giving voice to all kinds of things that are unknown, unseen and unspoken, and recalibrating the knowledge to provide a new perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/18/the-last-poets-the-hip-hop-forefathers-who-gave-black-america-its-voice\" title=\"\">the Last Poets</a> \u2013 the godfathers of hip-hop \u2013 excoriated the US administration on their album Understand What Black Is. Founding member Abiodun Oyewole set their lyrics to reggae because it\u2019s \u201crebellious music that speaks volumes, and doesn\u2019t abide with the systems that exist, governmental systems and so forth\u201d. Indeed, when Oyewole booms \u201cAmerica is a terrorist!\u201d on Rain of Terror, his transmission comes through loud and clear, whether framed by spectral skanking or, on the dub version, syrupy reverb.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9549088d1da4d2e0ce03b30fd6460987b52a6e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9549088d1da4d2e0ce03b30fd6460987b52a6e9/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Camae Ayewa, AKA Moor Mother.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Camae Ayewa, AKA Moor Mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another dub poetry champion is Camae Ayewa, AKA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/20/moor-mother-hip-hop-artist-camae-ayewa-black-experience-civil-rights-interview\" title=\"\">Moor Mother</a>, a poet, musician and activist who runs youth workshops in her north Philadelphia community. \u201cI\u2019m a reactionary artist, in the sense that I\u2019m stuck in what\u2019s happening now,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the beautiful part of dub poetry: saying your perspective and everyone\u2019s perspective in the moment.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, Moor Mother released the formidable Fetish Bones, a eulogy for black people killed by police officers and a condemnation of the festering politics that gave the US President Trump.

With his 1978 album Dread Beat an\u2019 Blood, which fiercely criticised police brutality in London and forecast the 1981 Brixton riots, Johnson helped to establish dub poetry: a blend of chest-rattling bass and thunderous verses speaking truth to power. He gave Robinson a memorable, if cryptic, missive. \u201cHe said, \u2018Nobody needs to sound like me now,\u2019\u201d recalls Robinson, who records and performs with Kevin Martin (AKA deep bass explorer the Bug) as King Midas Sound. \u201cThat made me think, what would dub poetry be now? He\u2019s a very progressive thinker and he would want to see it morph into something that has the same sentiment, but a different framework and emphasis.\u201d He may have found the answer. King Midas Sound\u2019s stark, resonant new album Solitude arrived last spring, along with a wave of underground artists such as Amet, Asda and the duo of Jay Glass Dubs and Leslie Winer, who are revitalising dub poetry for a new era of political tumult and social injustice. Like their predecessors, who emerged from reggae\u2019s soundsystem culture, this next generation of dub poets is by no means aesthetically similar. Even the term itself, coined by Jamaican dub poet Oku Onuora, has been controversial, with luminaries such as Johnson and Mutabaruka identifying as simply \u201cpoets\u201d to distance themselves from it \u2013 but their ideologies are unquestionably shared. \u201cIt\u2019s about equality and justice,\u201d explains Lillian Allen, Toronto dub poet and professor. \u201cCalling the system to account and validating people\u2019s inner voices and experiences, and giving voice to all kinds of things that are unknown, unseen and unspoken, and recalibrating the knowledge to provide a new perspective.\u201d Last year, the Last Poets \u2013 the godfathers of hip-hop \u2013 excoriated the US administration on their album Understand What Black Is. Founding member Abiodun Oyewole set their lyrics to reggae because it\u2019s \u201crebellious music that speaks volumes, and doesn\u2019t abide with the systems that exist, governmental systems and so forth\u201d. Indeed, when Oyewole booms \u201cAmerica is a terrorist!\u201d on Rain of Terror, his transmission comes through loud and clear, whether framed by spectral skanking or, on the dub version, syrupy reverb. Another dub poetry champion is Camae Ayewa, AKA Moor Mother, a poet, musician and activist who runs youth workshops in her north Philadelphia community. \u201cI\u2019m a reactionary artist, in the sense that I\u2019m stuck in what\u2019s happening now,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the beautiful part of dub poetry: saying your perspective and everyone\u2019s perspective in the moment.\u201d In 2016, Moor Mother released the formidable Fetish Bones, a eulogy for black people killed by police officers and a condemnation of the festering politics that gave the US President Trump. On its follow-up, Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes, Moor Mother performs her signature \u201cDIY time travel\u201d to explore black histories, from slave narratives to the Rodney King beating, with hypnotic intonations, granular samples and churning digital noise. She also recently collaborated with the London Contemporary Orchestra on The Great Bailout, a free-verse poem that interrogates slavery, colonialism and commerce, and which helped the UK develop into a stronghold of dub poetry and other music of the Caribbean diaspora. Though her art is rooted in punk and hip-hop and draws from myriad sources \u2013 free jazz, Black Arts poet Sonia Sanchez, Rage Against the Machine \u2013 it fits under dub poetry\u2019s increasingly expansive sonic parameters. Ayewa speaks of her art and activism in the same breath but eschews \u201cprotest music,\u201d a label that Robinson and Martin embrace on Solitude, where Robinson\u2019s hollow declarations of lost love bottom out in a post-apocalyptic soundscape of formless low-end and high-pitched whines. Through the bleakness of Martin\u2019s production and Robinson\u2019s character, the personal becomes political, and ties Solitude to dub poetry\u2019s commentary on society. \u201cDub poetry is a form of protest art,\u201d says Martin. \u201cIt felt like there was an air of desolation in the record that\u2019s appropriate for where we are now in history, and in the world, which seems more turbulent than ever. There\u2019s this precipice of chaos leading to God knows where.\u201d Ayewa has also teamed up with Martin and Justin K Broadrick as Zonal. Though Broadrick\u2019s background as singer with the industrial metal titans Godflesh and his solo mutant shoegaze project Jesu might make him an odd choice for a dub poetry collaboration, he can bring Ayewa\u2019s philosophical dispatches to unsuspecting audiences who could benefit from it the most. \u201cI\u2019ve met many people over the years who said that Godflesh not only opened the doors for them musically, but socially and politically as well,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope that people are listening.\u201d On Zonal\u2019s standout track In a Cage, Moor Mother echoes the nihilism and futility that underpins Solitude as she riffs on the Smashing Pumpkins: \u201cDespite all my rage/ We still in a daze.\u201d Dub poetry\u2019s brilliance is to bring that dazed world into a little more focus.",

You could call Beautiful But Deadly a belated attempt to jump on the Def Jam rap-rock bandwagon, but it\u2019s smarter than that. Its distorted guitars are based not on heavy metal, but psychedelic soul: Eddie Hazel\u2019s stellar turn on Funkadelic\u2019s Maggot Brain provides the blueprint. Either way, it rocks.</p> <h2>19. Truth Hurts ft Rakim \u2013 Addictive (remix) (2002)</h2> <p>Addictive was a track that turned into a nightmare: an uncleared sample of Indian artist Lata Mangeshkar by original producer DJ Quik led to a $500m lawsuit and an injunction to prevent it being broadcast or performed. Dre\u2019s remix is still fabulous: Indian flutes, sitars and vocals fighting for space with high-drama synth stabs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/12/dr-dre-at-50-from-nwa-bangers-and-beef\">Dr Dre at 50: NWA, bangers and beef \u2013 the moments that made a megastar</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>18. The Lady of Rage \u2013 Afro Puffs (1994)</h2> <p>While the Lady of Rage\u2019s moment in the spotlight was brief, it produced one indisputable classic. Afro Puffs takes Dre\u2019s post-<a href=\"https://medium.com/@oliverwang/dr-dre-the-chronic-death-row-interscope-1992-snoop-doggy-dogg-doggystyle-death-row-a32ef1228c8f\">Chronic</a> sound down a dark and sinister alley \u2013 heavy, atonal bass, oddly creepy percussive clatter, high G-funk synths wailing off-key \u2013 while Rage offers a surprisingly woke lyrical stance for a Death Row artist, covering body positivity and Afrocentric beauty. Willow Smith has claimed the lyrics \u201cchanged my life\u201d.</p> <h2>17. TI \u2013 Popped Off (2012)</h2> <p>By the time Popped Off slipped out on TI\u2019s mixtape Fuck Da City Up, Dre\u2019s production work was becoming sporadic, his attention presumably consumed by the Beats company that would make him <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2019/06/18/dr-dre-net-worth-800-million-in-2019/\">a self-proclaimed billionaire</a>.

NWA \u2013 Express Yourself (1988)</h2> <p>Dre\u2019s handful of mid-80s productions for the World Class Wreckin Cru showed promise, but <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/n-w-as-straight-outta-compton-12-things-you-didnt-know-707207/\">NWA\u2019s Straight Outta Compton</a> was something else. Express Yourself\u2019s use of the bouncy Charles Wright original was a masterstroke, both commercially minded and at odds with NWA\u2019s relentlessly grim subject matter: even the relatively benign lyrics here are filled with violence.</p> <h2>15. The Game \u2013 How We Do (2005)</h2> <p>There was a marked decline in the quality of MCs Dre worked with in the early 00s: 50 Cent wasn\u2019t anything like as talented as Eminem, and the Game wasn\u2019t anything like as talented as 50 Cent. How We Do\u2019s success rests on Dre\u2019s spare, gripping production: a spindly hook endlessly repeated over old-school 808 beats.</p> <h2>14. 2 Pac \u2013 California Love (1996)</h2> <p>In 1996 Dre wisely fled Death Row, a label about to go <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/30/life-and-times-of-suge-knight\">horrifyingly out of control</a>, but not before producing one final anthem. Like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KL9mRus19o\">Blackstreet\u2019s No Diggity</a>, which Dre worked on incognito, California Love is powered by a piano riff \u2013 this one sampled from Joe Cocker\u2019s 1972 track Woman to Woman. He also paid homage to funk pioneer Roger Troutman, whose talk box provides the hook.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wBTdfAkqGU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5wBTdfAkqGU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>13. Bilal \u2013 Fast Lane (2001)</h2> <p>In the aftermath of Eminem\u2019s vast success, Bilal made for an unlikely Dr Dre collaborator: a \u201cconscious\u201d neo-soul artist, affiliated to Questlove\u2019s Soulquarians collective. But Fast Lane is amazing: the Curtis Mayfield-esque vocal and lush harmonies crashing against a sinister Dre beat, decorated with an eerie, shimmering organ and crawling analogue synth.</p> <h2>12. Dr Dre \u2013 Forgot About Dre (1999)</h2> <p>He is effortlessly out-rapped by Eminem \u2013 whose spectacular guest appearance was later lauded by Kendrick Lamar as the best verse on Dre\u2019s album 2001 \u2013 but the producer\u2019s bullish recounting of his achievements is lent weight by how good the music is: the perfect expression of 2001\u2019s chilly, bare post-G-funk sound.</p> <h2>11. 50 Cent \u2013 In Da Club (2003)</h2> <p>After the dazzling invention and technical brilliance of Eminem, Dre\u2019s next superstar protege was a backwards step, with tired gangsta cliches exploiting a lurid backstory. That said, 50 Cent sold millions, and at their best his collaborations with Dre have a creepy power.

Dr Dre \u2013 Talking to My Diary (2015)</h2> <p>The closing track of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/10/dr-dre-compton-review-alexis-petridis\">Dre\u2019s 2015 album Compton</a> sounded remarkably like Dre bidding farewell to his career as a rapper. If so, it\u2019s a great soundtrack to the end credits: flurries of strings sampled from Fran\u00e7ois de Roubaix\u2019s Dernier Domicile Connu (also the source for, of all things, Robbie Williams\u2019s Supreme) and live horns, including an exquisite jazzy solo.</p> <h2>9. Eve ft Gwen Stefani \u2013 Let Me Blow Ya Mind (2001)</h2> <p>Despite Dre\u2019s protestations, Let Me Blow Ya Mind demonstrated how adaptable to pop 2001\u2019s sound was. The beat could have been on that album, Eve\u2019s rap is suitably tough, but Gwen Stefani\u2019s chorus is the perfect sweetener: it became a global smash.</p> <h2>8. Dr Dre \u2013 Lil\u2019 Ghetto Boy (1992)</h2> <p>Easily overlooked amid The Chronic\u2019s bigger hits, Lil\u2019 Ghetto Boy is the album\u2019s emotional centre. In place of NWA\u2019s furious screw-you nihilism, it feels equivocal, thoughtful, even troubled by the cycle of street life it depicts, a mood embodied by the mournful Donny Hathaway sample that provides its chorus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"061e6db6fb4c3fce76b5cd6e04f5b517e43d7147\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/061e6db6fb4c3fce76b5cd6e04f5b517e43d7147/0_118_2040_1224/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Eminem in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Eminem in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Friedman/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7. Eminem \u2013 My Name Is (1999)</h2> <p>It\u2019s de rigueur to point out that the sample on My Name Is was played by Chas and Dave; more important is how brilliantly Dre uses it. In contrast to G-funk\u2019s slickness, it sounds slightly ungainly, jerky and off-kilter; even \u2013 as Dre suggested \u2013 \u201cannoying\u201d: the perfect backdrop for Eminem to introduce his disturbing Slim Shady character.</p> <h2>6. Dr Dre ft Snoop Doggy Dogg \u2013 Deep Cover (1992)</h2> <p>Dre\u2019s post-NWA solo debut was a ferocious statement of intent. As a rapper, he\u2019s upstaged by Snoop, but it\u2019s all about the beat, which turns a sample from Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s joyous Sing a Simple Song into something ominous, overlaid with a double bass and off-key horns. Big Pun\u2019s 1998 version of the same rhythm, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiwvPmRTv6M\">Twinz</a>, might be even better.</p> <h2>5. NWA \u2013 Real Niggaz Don\u2019t Die (1991)</h2> <p>NWA\u2019s 1991 album Efil4zaggin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/13/gangsta-rap-history-nwa-ice-cube-dr-dre\">is so unremittingly unpleasant</a> that its actual sound gets overlooked: what price skilful beats next to lyrics as foul as those on One Less Bitch? Nevertheless, the beats are a quantum leap on from Straight Outta Compton, as shown on its opening track: a vast, potent patchwork of samples, including a fabulous hook snatched from white funk-rockers Rare Earth.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2soGJXQAQec\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2soGJXQAQec?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>4. Snoop Doggy Dogg \u2013 Who Am I? (What\u2019s My Name) (1993)</h2> <p>All the singles taken from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/sep/09/snoop-dogg-10-of-the-best\">Doggystyle are brilliant</a>: the first might be the best. An imperious updating of the cluttered sound of P-Funk, Who Am I?\u2019s sound is thick with George Clinton samples, its bassline elastic and supremely funky, its grinding, squealing synths adding a hint of unease. That it ended up on a Money Supermarket advert tells you a lot about Snoop and Dre\u2019s journey from folk devils to beloved institution.</p> <h2>3. Dr Dre \u2013 Still DRE (1999)</h2> <p>Dre\u2019s late 90s were rocky: early releases on his label Aftermath were coolly received, rumours abounded regarding his failure to follow up The Chronic. But the album 2001 was a swaggering return. Still DRE sounds supremely confident: there\u2019s virtually nothing to the track beyond one insistent sample and the occasional synth flutter, but it\u2019s utterly addictive.</p> <h2>2. Dr Dre \u2013 Nuthin But a G Thang (1992)</h2> <p>The single that introduced the world to G-funk via Dre\u2019s patent blend of 70s soul samples \u2013 in this case Leon Haywood \u2013 and analogue synth tones (the trademark \u201cfunky worm\u201d whine was created on a Moog). Its brilliance, as here, lay in the contrast between the sound\u2019s warm nostalgia for the music of childhood and the harshness of the lyrics it supported.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znlFu_lemsU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/znlFu_lemsU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>1. Mary J Blige \u2013 Family Affair (2001)</h2> <p>The video for Family Affair features a brief cameo by its producer: with a broad grin, Dre lifts his arms in triumph. As well he might. It might seem wilfully perverse to pick one of his poppiest productions as his greatest, but Dre\u2019s snappy adaptability to different artists and eras has always been among his strongest skills. And besides, Family Affair is just a no-further-questions moment of perfection, such a fantastic, irresistible single as to disarm any criticism. Its construction is simple \u2013 an unrelenting two-chord piano line, staccato strings and the occasional subtle synthesised whoosh supporting one of Mary J Blige\u2019s most economical and understated vocals and the most earworm-y of melodies. The cumulative effect is undeniable.</p>",

      "bodyText": "20. The DOC \u2013 Beautiful But Deadly (1989) An intriguing anomaly in Dre\u2019s back catalogue. You could call Beautiful But Deadly a belated attempt to jump on the Def Jam rap-rock bandwagon, but it\u2019s smarter than that. Its distorted guitars are based not on heavy metal, but psychedelic soul: Eddie Hazel\u2019s stellar turn on Funkadelic\u2019s Maggot Brain provides the blueprint. Either way, it rocks. 19. Truth Hurts ft Rakim \u2013 Addictive (remix) (2002) Addictive was a track that turned into a nightmare: an uncleared sample of Indian artist Lata Mangeshkar by original producer DJ Quik led to a $500m lawsuit and an injunction to prevent it being broadcast or performed. Dre\u2019s remix is still fabulous: Indian flutes, sitars and vocals fighting for space with high-drama synth stabs. 18. The Lady of Rage \u2013 Afro Puffs (1994) While the Lady of Rage\u2019s moment in the spotlight was brief, it produced one indisputable classic. Afro Puffs takes Dre\u2019s post-Chronic sound down a dark and sinister alley \u2013 heavy, atonal bass, oddly creepy percussive clatter, high G-funk synths wailing off-key \u2013 while Rage offers a surprisingly woke lyrical stance for a Death Row artist, covering body positivity and Afrocentric beauty. Willow Smith has claimed the lyrics \u201cchanged my life\u201d. 17. TI \u2013 Popped Off (2012) By the time Popped Off slipped out on TI\u2019s mixtape Fuck Da City Up, Dre\u2019s production work was becoming sporadic, his attention presumably consumed by the Beats company that would make him a self-proclaimed billionaire. But Popped Off is a low-key reaffirming of his skill: a huge beat and sample snipped from Kool and the Gang\u2019s Summer Madness turned into an epic fanfare. 16. NWA \u2013 Express Yourself (1988) Dre\u2019s handful of mid-80s productions for the World Class Wreckin Cru showed promise, but NWA\u2019s Straight Outta Compton was something else. Express Yourself\u2019s use of the bouncy Charles Wright original was a masterstroke, both commercially minded and at odds with NWA\u2019s relentlessly grim subject matter: even the relatively benign lyrics here are filled with violence. 15. The Game \u2013 How We Do (2005) There was a marked decline in the quality of MCs Dre worked with in the early 00s: 50 Cent wasn\u2019t anything like as talented as Eminem, and the Game wasn\u2019t anything like as talented as 50 Cent. How We Do\u2019s success rests on Dre\u2019s spare, gripping production: a spindly hook endlessly repeated over old-school 808 beats. 14. 2 Pac \u2013 California Love (1996) In 1996 Dre wisely fled Death Row, a label about to go horrifyingly out of control, but not before producing one final anthem. Like Blackstreet\u2019s No Diggity, which Dre worked on incognito, California Love is powered by a piano riff \u2013 this one sampled from Joe Cocker\u2019s 1972 track Woman to Woman. He also paid homage to funk pioneer Roger Troutman, whose talk box provides the hook. 13. Bilal \u2013 Fast Lane (2001) In the aftermath of Eminem\u2019s vast success, Bilal made for an unlikely Dr Dre collaborator: a \u201cconscious\u201d neo-soul artist, affiliated to Questlove\u2019s Soulquarians collective. But Fast Lane is amazing: the Curtis Mayfield-esque vocal and lush harmonies crashing against a sinister Dre beat, decorated with an eerie, shimmering organ and crawling analogue synth. 12. Dr Dre \u2013 Forgot About Dre (1999) He is effortlessly out-rapped by Eminem \u2013 whose spectacular guest appearance was later lauded by Kendrick Lamar as the best verse on Dre\u2019s album 2001 \u2013 but the producer\u2019s bullish recounting of his achievements is lent weight by how good the music is: the perfect expression of 2001\u2019s chilly, bare post-G-funk sound. 11. 50 Cent \u2013 In Da Club (2003) After the dazzling invention and technical brilliance of Eminem, Dre\u2019s next superstar protege was a backwards step, with tired gangsta cliches exploiting a lurid backstory. That said, 50 Cent sold millions, and at their best his collaborations with Dre have a creepy power. In Da Club is as about as bleak and omnious-sounding a party-starting banger as it is possible to imagine. 10. Dr Dre \u2013 Talking to My Diary (2015) The closing track of Dre\u2019s 2015 album Compton sounded remarkably like Dre bidding farewell to his career as a rapper. If so, it\u2019s a great soundtrack to the end credits: flurries of strings sampled from Fran\u00e7ois de Roubaix\u2019s Dernier Domicile Connu (also the source for, of all things, Robbie Williams\u2019s Supreme) and live horns, including an exquisite jazzy solo. 9. Eve ft Gwen Stefani \u2013 Let Me Blow Ya Mind (2001) Despite Dre\u2019s protestations, Let Me Blow Ya Mind demonstrated how adaptable to pop 2001\u2019s sound was. The beat could have been on that album, Eve\u2019s rap is suitably tough, but Gwen Stefani\u2019s chorus is the perfect sweetener: it became a global smash. 8. Dr Dre \u2013 Lil\u2019 Ghetto Boy (1992) Easily overlooked amid The Chronic\u2019s bigger hits, Lil\u2019 Ghetto Boy is the album\u2019s emotional centre. In place of NWA\u2019s furious screw-you nihilism, it feels equivocal, thoughtful, even troubled by the cycle of street life it depicts, a mood embodied by the mournful Donny Hathaway sample that provides its chorus. 7. Eminem \u2013 My Name Is (1999) It\u2019s de rigueur to point out that the sample on My Name Is was played by Chas and Dave; more important is how brilliantly Dre uses it. In contrast to G-funk\u2019s slickness, it sounds slightly ungainly, jerky and off-kilter; even \u2013 as Dre suggested \u2013 \u201cannoying\u201d: the perfect backdrop for Eminem to introduce his disturbing Slim Shady character. 6.

As a rapper, he\u2019s upstaged by Snoop, but it\u2019s all about the beat, which turns a sample from Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s joyous Sing a Simple Song into something ominous, overlaid with a double bass and off-key horns. Big Pun\u2019s 1998 version of the same rhythm, Twinz, might be even better. 5. NWA \u2013 Real Niggaz Don\u2019t Die (1991) NWA\u2019s 1991 album Efil4zaggin is so unremittingly unpleasant that its actual sound gets overlooked: what price skilful beats next to lyrics as foul as those on One Less Bitch? Nevertheless, the beats are a quantum leap on from Straight Outta Compton, as shown on its opening track: a vast, potent patchwork of samples, including a fabulous hook snatched from white funk-rockers Rare Earth. 4. Snoop Doggy Dogg \u2013 Who Am I? (What\u2019s My Name) (1993) All the singles taken from Doggystyle are brilliant: the first might be the best. An imperious updating of the cluttered sound of P-Funk, Who Am I?\u2019s sound is thick with George Clinton samples, its bassline elastic and supremely funky, its grinding, squealing synths adding a hint of unease. That it ended up on a Money Supermarket advert tells you a lot about Snoop and Dre\u2019s journey from folk devils to beloved institution. 3. Dr Dre \u2013 Still DRE (1999) Dre\u2019s late 90s were rocky: early releases on his label Aftermath were coolly received, rumours abounded regarding his failure to follow up The Chronic.

As Valli <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/giambattista-valli-handm-designer-collaboration\" title=\"\">told Vogue</a> earlier this year: \u201cI was very surprised and flattered [by H&amp;M\u2019s interest]. The idea is to bring the Valli DNA of extraordinary, of one-of-a-kind, of uniqueness, of couture.\u201d</p> <p>Shoppers described how they felt about having the chance to get their hand on his designs \u2013 popular with celebrities such as Rihanna, Amal Clooney and Ariana Grande, they usually go for thousands of pounds. \u201cIt\u2019s not really in my price range,\u201d said Lindblad, \u201cso any couturier, especially from Paris, is exciting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7328efb32d9e9c4d5083b8159df6f0696010d776\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7328efb32d9e9c4d5083b8159df6f0696010d776/0_0_2480_3508/707.jpg\" alt=\"Embroidered coats and knee-high socks \u2026 items from the collaboration.\" width=\"707\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Embroidered coats and knee-high socks \u2026 items from the collaboration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: H&amp;M</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The collection\u2019s 41 pieces for women and 31 for men \u2013 the first time Valli has branched out into menswear \u2013 include embroidered coats for \u00a3299.99, a leopard print hoodie (\u00a359.99), logo tights, pearly jewellery and floaty floral dresses. There are jumpers decorated with rose prints and historical figures in ruffs (\u00a379.99), and knee-high socks adorned with pink hearts (\u00a314.99).</p> <p>This is a collaboration perhaps geared more towards the fashion-heads than previous H&amp;M offerings, as evidenced by those in the queue. Fashion student Nadia Roberts, 21, loves Valli\u2019s work: \u201cIt\u2019s just very beautiful, well-made couture.\u201d She had been queueing since 6.30am for a faux fur-trimmed aviator coat from the collection.</p> <p>Lindblad, who works for Christian Dior, thinks his work is interesting for being \u201ca little bit different shape-wise compared with what you normally find\u201d. While Anne-Marie Buckley, who has worked in fashion and has been familiar with his work for a long time, thinks \u201cit\u2019s very elegant and very feminine. I think at the moment things are very unstructured and hard-wearing, and I think he\u2019s delicate and fluid.\u201d It is, she said, a savvy pre-party season collaboration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9ac042fb2c0f388e19c473f3a8f62706d85592dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ac042fb2c0f388e19c473f3a8f62706d85592dd/0_0_2480_3508/707.jpg\" alt=\"A dress from the new collection.\" width=\"707\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dress from the new collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: H&amp;M</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Announced in May at the amfAR Gala in Cannes, the collection was unleashed at a show at Rome\u2019s grand palazzo in late October, where the model Kendall Jenner took over the runway in the collection\u2019s most hyped dress \u2013 large, red, frilly and available for \u00a3299.99.</p> <p>In recent years, Valli\u2019s couture collections have doubled down on the froufrou tulle frocks that found mainstream fans when a similarly voluminous Molly Goddard dress was worn by Jodie Comer in Killing Eve. Often compared to millefeuille, these colossi don\u2019t shout high street \u2013 and many in the queue admitted they were there for the more understated pieces.

      "bodyText": "The Italian couturier Giambattista Valli isn\u2019t a household name in the same way as H&amp;M\u2019s previous designer collaborators \u2013 which range from Balmain to Moschino and Versace \u2013 were, but it didn\u2019t stop some people camping out all night in parky weather. The number attending seemed to be lower than for previous collaborations \u2013 one regular queue-goer estimated that it was about half that of previous years \u2013 but there was still a small snake of people outside H&amp;M Oxford Circus in London before the collection\u2019s 8am launch. Alexandra Lindblad, 26, had been waiting since 4am, while others had been there since midnight. \u201cThey have only 100 pieces of each, so if you\u2019re not here early, you don\u2019t get anything \u2013 and the website always crashes,\u201d she said. The haute couture-inspired collection, which also launched at other big stores across London, Dublin, Manchester and Birmingham (as well as online) is perhaps the fanciest of H&amp;M\u2019s designer collaborations so far. As Valli told Vogue earlier this year: \u201cI was very surprised and flattered [by H&amp;M\u2019s interest]. The idea is to bring the Valli DNA of extraordinary, of one-of-a-kind, of uniqueness, of couture.\u201d Shoppers described how they felt about having the chance to get their hand on his designs \u2013 popular with celebrities such as Rihanna, Amal Clooney and Ariana Grande, they usually go for thousands of pounds. \u201cIt\u2019s not really in my price range,\u201d said Lindblad, \u201cso any couturier, especially from Paris, is exciting.\u201d The collection\u2019s 41 pieces for women and 31 for men \u2013 the first time Valli has branched out into menswear \u2013 include embroidered coats for \u00a3299.99, a leopard print hoodie (\u00a359.99), logo tights, pearly jewellery and floaty floral dresses. There are jumpers decorated with rose prints and historical figures in ruffs (\u00a379.99), and knee-high socks adorned with pink hearts (\u00a314.99). This is a collaboration perhaps geared more towards the fashion-heads than previous H&amp;M offerings, as evidenced by those in the queue. Fashion student Nadia Roberts, 21, loves Valli\u2019s work: \u201cIt\u2019s just very beautiful, well-made couture.\u201d She had been queueing since 6.30am for a faux fur-trimmed aviator coat from the collection. Lindblad, who works for Christian Dior, thinks his work is interesting for being \u201ca little bit different shape-wise compared with what you normally find\u201d. While Anne-Marie Buckley, who has worked in fashion and has been familiar with his work for a long time, thinks \u201cit\u2019s very elegant and very feminine. I think at the moment things are very unstructured and hard-wearing, and I think he\u2019s delicate and fluid.\u201d It is, she said, a savvy pre-party season collaboration. Announced in May at the amfAR Gala in Cannes, the collection was unleashed at a show at Rome\u2019s grand palazzo in late October, where the model Kendall Jenner took over the runway in the collection\u2019s most hyped dress \u2013 large, red, frilly and available for \u00a3299.99. In recent years, Valli\u2019s couture collections have doubled down on the froufrou tulle frocks that found mainstream fans when a similarly voluminous Molly Goddard dress was worn by Jodie Comer in Killing Eve. Often compared to millefeuille, these colossi don\u2019t shout high street \u2013 and many in the queue admitted they were there for the more understated pieces. Lindblad knows she wouldn\u2019t be able to wear the Jenner dress: \u201cI\u2019m not fancy enough to go anywhere where that would work.\u201d On the other hand, Roberts thinks it\u2019s amazing, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone; you have to be going to somewhere very special. I wouldn\u2019t buy it because I\u2019m short.\u201d Other people were feeling bolder. A 21-year-old student Tara Genovese was at least hoping to try on the big red dress. But \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to have the occasion to wear that, so I\u2019m more looking at the red shirt or the little dress with flowers\u201d. Elina Sharifi\u2019s boyfriend told her the pink tulle dress she was planning to buy would \u201cmake her look like a bonbonniere, but I think for a special occasion it will be very beautiful.\u201d While Pam Oushal, 51, planned to wear the dress to a big wedding she is attending soon. Of its impracticality, she said: \u201cDarling, fashion is impractical. If it\u2019s day clothes, sure, but things like that are occasion-wear.\u201d",

Daughter of modern feminism\u2019s founder, Mary Wollstonecraft, and the radical thinker William Godwin, this rebellious woman wrote one of the earliest and most influential gothic horror novels: Frankenstein. Published in 1818, when Shelley was just 20 years old, it remains a work of genius that can still horrify readers with the depths of man\u2019s depravity and pursuit of knowledge at all costs.

After all, this is the woman said to have married her lover, Percy Bysshe Shelley, after losing her virginity to him at the graveside of her mother. And then, after he drowned in a storm in 1822, carried his calcified heart \u2013 the only thing to survive his cremation \u2013 with her, wrapped in a silk shroud, until her death in 1851. (It was found in her desk, wrapped in the pages of one of his last poems.) But this week, Fiona Sampson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/04/in-search-mary-shelley-fiona-sampson-review\">author of In Search of Mary Shelley</a>, taught me something new: Shelley was bisexual.</p> <p>Writing to her close friend Edward Trelawny in 1835, Shelley recalled the years of loneliness and longing that followed Percy\u2019s death, saying: \u201cI was so ready to give myself away \u2013 and being afraid of men, I was apt to get tousy-mousy for women.\u201d Reading this as a historian of sexual culture, I recognised this as sexual slang \u2013 but did this allude to masturbation, or actual relationships?</p> <p>When I tweeted the quote above, revelations flooded in thick and fast. Jonathon Green, one of our most important historical lexicographers, was able to tell me that \u201ctuzzy-muzzy\u201d as slang for the vagina dates back to 1642. There are also stories of Shelley having a love affair with Jane Williams not long after Percy\u2019s death. She was also instrumental in procuring fake passports for two friends, Isabel Robinson and Mary Diana Dods, to flee to Paris and live there disguised as man and wife.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t unusual for women to live or travel together at this time, so they didn\u2019t need to disguise themselves. Rather, there may have been more at play here in terms of sexual and gender identities than you might expect to find in 19th-century history. Which is why it matters that we recognise that Shelley, by her own admission, was bisexual.</p> <p>As soon as I sent out my tweet, amongst the celebration and excitement that others shared came a consistent push back. Some people saw the acknowledgement of Shelley\u2019s bisexual life as crude and unnecessary, something that detracts from her achievements as a writer.</p> <p>We know that a socially conditioned, deep and destructive self-loathing is still often suffered by those who grow up knowing that to be gay, queer, trans, bisexual, or anything other than heterosexual, has historically been seen as evil and wrong. What I have found time and again in the archives, is incredible evidence of queer lives being lived throughout the centuries. In the 1880s, science and medicine perfected pathologising sexuality and defined anything outside heterosexuality as a mental disease. But before this, sex, love and identity were very much individual choices. Shelley\u2019s admission that she turned to women for sexual gratification shows us that to her, and many like her, sexuality did not fit the binary boundaries we have projected on to those in the past \u2013 and ourselves today. Acknowledging Shelley\u2019s sexuality is very important for bi-visibility, something we still struggle with. But bi-history is everywhere, and now it has a new icon.

      "bodyText": "Back-to-back defeats to start their tour of the southern hemisphere means there is a certain sense of adversity surrounding Great Britain at present: but this is nothing new for Alex Walmsley. Having targeted four wins from four against Tonga, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, two consecutive losses so far is certainly not ideal, but for Walmsley, just being on the trip alone is an achievement given what he has been through in his career. Walmsley has taken the unconventional route to the top, going from local playing fields to Great Britain international in just a handful of years, having played amateur rugby until the age of 22. But even after earning his big break with St Helens, Walmsley has had numerous hurdles to overcome to reach this point: including a serious neck injury last year which put his entire career in jeopardy. \u201cNobody had done that injury in professional sport and played again,\u201d Walmsley says in the run-up to Saturday\u2019s meeting with the Kiwis in Christchurch (7am GMT). \u201cThe actual neck injury I\u2019d sustained was three-levelled. I was questioning whether I was right to come back, and it was a question nobody could answer for a long time. There were so many unknowns. I had so many scans and the doctors told me I wasn\u2019t ready to play, and when I went for another last December, I started to think if it wasn\u2019t this time, when was it going to be?\u201d Eventually, after being told repeatedly he would be unable to return to playing, Walmsley got the all-clear. But even then, after an injury that could have easily put his health \u2013 as well as his career \u2013 at risk, there were serious doubts lingering in the forward\u2019s mind: \u201cWas it worth risking it all \u2026 my quality of life, being able to be a normal dad? \u201cDid I want to risk everything to play a game I love? It was something I had to decide, but I felt I wasn\u2019t done. There\u2019s a point when you know you\u2019re done, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Being cleared physically was not the end of Walmsley\u2019s battle, either: there were now mental demons to overcome. \u201cI was terrified going into games at first,\u201d he admits. \u201cBefore the first game, I just remember thinking that I want to be sat in the changing rooms in two hours\u2019 time.

      "body": "<p>Jean Heywood, who has died aged 98, was a character actor who found herself catapulted to national fame in 1976 as Bella, the matriarch who holds the poverty-stricken Seaton family together in the BBC TV drama When the Boat Comes In, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/19/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">James Mitchell</a>\u2019s story of a recession-hit Tyneside community between the two world wars.</p> <p>She and James Garbutt played Bella and Bill, parents of the unworldly teacher Jessie (Susan Jameson) who falls for Jack Ford (James Bolam), a disillusioned war veteran returning to the fictional Gallowshield and leading new battles, as a union leader. The traditional north-east of England folk song When the Boat Comes In provided a memorable theme, performed by Alex Glasgow.</p> <p>Heywood was herself from the north-east, as were many others in the cast. She and her screen husband cherished the opportunity to mould their alter egos. \u201cWe modified the characters quite a lot from the original concept,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cBella was a lot coarser than she has emerged. For example, she was really fond of the gin and could cut up rough. Bill, too, was a very rough diamond originally.\u201d</p> <p>They appeared in the first three series, screened in 1976 and 1977. Heywood described Bella as \u201cmore like me than I am\u201d.</p> <p>She was born Jean Murray in Blyth, Northumberland, to Elsie (nee Batey) and Jack Murray, a coalmine electrician. The family moved to New Zealand when Jean was six, but within six months her mother died. Several years later she returned to Britain after her father remarried, and she was brought up in Birmingham.</p> <p>On leaving King Edward VI grammar school, she worked as a librarian until marrying Roland Heywood, a mechanical engineer, in 1945, moving to Surrey and joining the Camberley Players, an amateur company. Once her three children had grown up, Heywood realised her ambition to act professionally.</p> <p>She joined the Castle theatre, Farnham (now the Redgrave theatre), in 1963 as acting wardrobe mistress and was given small acting parts.

      "bodyText": "Jean Heywood, who has died aged 98, was a character actor who found herself catapulted to national fame in 1976 as Bella, the matriarch who holds the poverty-stricken Seaton family together in the BBC TV drama When the Boat Comes In, James Mitchell\u2019s story of a recession-hit Tyneside community between the two world wars. She and James Garbutt played Bella and Bill, parents of the unworldly teacher Jessie (Susan Jameson) who falls for Jack Ford (James Bolam), a disillusioned war veteran returning to the fictional Gallowshield and leading new battles, as a union leader. The traditional north-east of England folk song When the Boat Comes In provided a memorable theme, performed by Alex Glasgow. Heywood was herself from the north-east, as were many others in the cast. She and her screen husband cherished the opportunity to mould their alter egos. \u201cWe modified the characters quite a lot from the original concept,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cBella was a lot coarser than she has emerged. For example, she was really fond of the gin and could cut up rough. Bill, too, was a very rough diamond originally.\u201d They appeared in the first three series, screened in 1976 and 1977. Heywood described Bella as \u201cmore like me than I am\u201d. She was born Jean Murray in Blyth, Northumberland, to Elsie (nee Batey) and Jack Murray, a coalmine electrician. The family moved to New Zealand when Jean was six, but within six months her mother died. Several years later she returned to Britain after her father remarried, and she was brought up in Birmingham. On leaving King Edward VI grammar school, she worked as a librarian until marrying Roland Heywood, a mechanical engineer, in 1945, moving to Surrey and joining the Camberley Players, an amateur company. Once her three children had grown up, Heywood realised her ambition to act professionally. She joined the Castle theatre, Farnham (now the Redgrave theatre), in 1963 as acting wardrobe mistress and was given small acting parts. Further work followed with other rep companies. She made her first television appearances in 1968 in serialised adaptations of two Emile Zola novels, Nana and Germinal. Switching to modern dramas, she appeared in Alan Plater\u2019s Land of Green Ginger (1973) as the mother of Gwen Taylor\u2019s young woman returning to her home town of Hull from London, and in Willy Russell\u2019s Our Day Out (1977) in the leading role of Mrs Kay, a remedial class teacher determined that her children, resigned to the fate of becoming \u201cfactory fodder\u201d, should have a good time on a coach trip from Liverpool to north Wales. In 1990 Heywood appeared throughout the final series of All Creatures Great and Small as the housekeeper, Mrs Alton, and a year later as Hilda Calder, mother of Freddy, in the police series Specials. She also played John Thaw\u2019s mother, Marjorie, in episodes of Kavanagh QC in 1995 and 1996. In sitcoms, she played David Roper\u2019s landlady in Leave It to Charlie (1978-80) and two mothers \u2013 of Barry Jackson\u2019s joke shop worker with learning difficulties in Horace (1982) and Dolly McGregor in The Brothers McGregor (1985-88). Her stints in soaps were generally short: as Phyllis Acaster, mother of Dolly, in Emmerdale Farm during 1978; Alice Kirby (1982-83), a widow who dumped Chalkie Whitely for a retired all-in wrestler in Coronation Street; Sally Hart (1997), who drowned in a canal, in the first two weeks of Family Affairs; and Kitty Hilton (2000-02), mother of Ray, in Brookside. In a rare film role she played the aspiring ballet dancer\u2019s grandmother in Billy Elliot (2000). On stage she was Glenda Jackson\u2019s mother in a West End production of Rose (Duke of York\u2019s theatre, 1980) and Margaret, the nurse, in The Father with the National Theatre company (1988-89). Heywood\u2019s husband died in 1996. She is survived by their children, Bryon and Carolyn, and another son, Ian, from a previous relationship. \u2022 Jean Heywood, actor, born 15 July 1921; died 14 September 2019",

      "body": "<p>Officials in Pakistan have been accused of covering up an outbreak of the most dangerous strain of polio and planning a covert vaccination programme to contain the disease.</p> <p>According to a source in Pakistan\u2019s polio eradication programme and documentation seen by the Guardian, a dozen children have been infected with the P2 strain of polio, which causes paralysis and primarily effects those under five.</p> <p>Dr Malik Safi, coordinator of the national emergency operation centre of the Pakistan polio eradication programme, confirmed the P2 outbreak, but would not give any further comment.</p> <p>The P2 strain had previously been eliminated from the country. However, the new cases were allegedly kept hidden from the government and from international donors, including the UK\u2019s Department for International Development, under direct instruction from Babar Bin Atta, the prime minister\u2019s focal representative on polio eradication, who was last month <a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1511547\">forced to resign</a> after he was accused of corruption. DfID, which has donated millions to Pakistan\u2019s polio eradication programme, was later informed of the new cases.</p> <p>The alleged cases, which have all resulted in paralysis, have been discovered mainly in Diamer district, with one in the capital, Islamabad.</p> <p>Under Pakistani law, every new case of polio in the country has to be officially registered with the government, which then alerts international health bodies. \u201cBut to hide their negligence and their poor performance, Babar Bin Atta decided not disclose the cases to anyone,\u201d said the source.</p> <p>The re-emergence of P2 would not only be a dramatic step back in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/14/the-women-defying-menace-and-mistrust-to-rid-pakistan-of-polio\">Pakistan\u2019s fight against the polio</a>, it would also be symptomatic of what those in the programme have described as \u201cterrible mismanagement\u201d under Bin Atta.</p> <p>Alongside Afghanistan, Pakistan is one of only two countries in the world that has not entirely eradicated polio. It was a key milestone in 2014, when Pakistan officially declared it had entirely eradicated P2 polio.</p> <p>Polio exists in three different strands, P1, P2, and P3, with P2 notorious as the most contagious and most vicious in its impact on those infected.</p> <p>According to the source within the programme, the renewed outbreak of the P2 strand came from a mismanagement of vaccines, which carry a live strain of the disease to create immunity.</p> <p>After the strand was eliminated from Pakistan five years ago, all P2 vaccines should have been collected from hospitals and clinics and not used. However, it appears a P2 vaccine was administered accidentally and a child became a carrier for the disease. Tests on the new cases allegedly show the children are all carrying a vaccine-derived form of the disease .</p> <p>\u201cSomewhere, somebody has inaccurately used this vaccine and because of this negligence \u2026 this virus was brought back into the environment and our children are again getting infected with P2,\u201d alleged the source.</p> <p>However, it is understood that, instead of publicly declaring the renewed outbreak and beginning a public vaccination campaign, a \u201csecret\u201d vaccination campaign will begin on Monday in Rawalpindi and surrounding cities in an attempt at containment. It is understood that only senior members of the polio programme are aware of the P2 campaign, with others \u2013 even those who will be administering the vaccines \u2013 led to believe it is a standard P1 and P3 polio vaccination programme.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/14/the-women-defying-menace-and-mistrust-to-rid-pakistan-of-polio\">The women defying menace and mistrust to rid Pakistan of polio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis P2 outbreak can only be contained if they do a quality vaccination campaign, and how can you do a quality campaign if you are carrying it out in secret, without any awareness or accountability?\u201d said the source.</p> <p>\u201cIf anything goes wrong and this P2 polio spreads throughout the whole country, who will take responsibility? Will they just keep telling more lies to cover up their mistakes and put more children at risk?\u201d</p> <p>Since 2018, there has been an \u201calarming\u201d rise in polio cases in Pakistan, according to experts, with <a href=\"http://polioeradication.org/where-we-work/pakistan/\">77 official cases</a> this year. Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq, who served as the prime minister\u2019s focal person on polio eradication from November 2013 to August 2018, said Bin Atta had \u201cruined\u201d the programme through corruption and mismanagement.</p> <p>Farooq accused the prime minister, Imran Khan, of refusing to listen to complaints against Bin Atta for the past 10 months. \u201cPM Khan did not take heed to the programme and ignored the complaints which were coming to him against Babar Bin Atta,\u201d she said. \u201cThey covered up the refusals and they allegedly used fake markers on kids\u2019 to show they were vaccinated who actually were not. The damage that has been done to the programme has literally reversed many of our achievements.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Since publication, the Pakistan government has denied any cover-up. It said it had waited until the strain had been formally identified before announcing it. Babar Bin Atta has dismissed the allegations reported as baseless.</p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on 11 November 2019 to clarify when DfID was informed of polio cases.<br></p> <p><br></p>",

The P2 strain had previously been eliminated from the country. However, the new cases were allegedly kept hidden from the government and from international donors, including the UK\u2019s Department for International Development, under direct instruction from Babar Bin Atta, the prime minister\u2019s focal representative on polio eradication, who was last month forced to resign after he was accused of corruption. DfID, which has donated millions to Pakistan\u2019s polio eradication programme, was later informed of the new cases. The alleged cases, which have all resulted in paralysis, have been discovered mainly in Diamer district, with one in the capital, Islamabad. Under Pakistani law, every new case of polio in the country has to be officially registered with the government, which then alerts international health bodies. \u201cBut to hide their negligence and their poor performance, Babar Bin Atta decided not disclose the cases to anyone,\u201d said the source. The re-emergence of P2 would not only be a dramatic step back in Pakistan\u2019s fight against the polio, it would also be symptomatic of what those in the programme have described as \u201cterrible mismanagement\u201d under Bin Atta. Alongside Afghanistan, Pakistan is one of only two countries in the world that has not entirely eradicated polio. It was a key milestone in 2014, when Pakistan officially declared it had entirely eradicated P2 polio. Polio exists in three different strands, P1, P2, and P3, with P2 notorious as the most contagious and most vicious in its impact on those infected. According to the source within the programme, the renewed outbreak of the P2 strand came from a mismanagement of vaccines, which carry a live strain of the disease to create immunity. After the strand was eliminated from Pakistan five years ago, all P2 vaccines should have been collected from hospitals and clinics and not used. However, it appears a P2 vaccine was administered accidentally and a child became a carrier for the disease. Tests on the new cases allegedly show the children are all carrying a vaccine-derived form of the disease . \u201cSomewhere, somebody has inaccurately used this vaccine and because of this negligence \u2026 this virus was brought back into the environment and our children are again getting infected with P2,\u201d alleged the source. However, it is understood that, instead of publicly declaring the renewed outbreak and beginning a public vaccination campaign, a \u201csecret\u201d vaccination campaign will begin on Monday in Rawalpindi and surrounding cities in an attempt at containment. It is understood that only senior members of the polio programme are aware of the P2 campaign, with others \u2013 even those who will be administering the vaccines \u2013 led to believe it is a standard P1 and P3 polio vaccination programme. \u201cThis P2 outbreak can only be contained if they do a quality vaccination campaign, and how can you do a quality campaign if you are carrying it out in secret, without any awareness or accountability?\u201d said the source. \u201cIf anything goes wrong and this P2 polio spreads throughout the whole country, who will take responsibility? Will they just keep telling more lies to cover up their mistakes and put more children at risk?\u201d Since 2018, there has been an \u201calarming\u201d rise in polio cases in Pakistan, according to experts, with 77 official cases this year. Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq, who served as the prime minister\u2019s focal person on polio eradication from November 2013 to August 2018, said Bin Atta had \u201cruined\u201d the programme through corruption and mismanagement. Farooq accused the prime minister, Imran Khan, of refusing to listen to complaints against Bin Atta for the past 10 months. \u201cPM Khan did not take heed to the programme and ignored the complaints which were coming to him against Babar Bin Atta,\u201d she said. \u201cThey covered up the refusals and they allegedly used fake markers on kids\u2019 to show they were vaccinated who actually were not. The damage that has been done to the programme has literally reversed many of our achievements.\u201d \u2022 Since publication, the Pakistan government has denied any cover-up. It said it had waited until the strain had been formally identified before announcing it. Babar Bin Atta has dismissed the allegations reported as baseless. \u2022 This story was amended on 11 November 2019 to clarify when DfID was informed of polio cases.",

      "bodyText": "A court order permitting 16 police officers to be screened from public view during an inquest into the death of a black man who had been restrained at Huddersfield police station has been overturned by a judge. It is the latest dispute over anonymity involving officers at coroners\u2019 courts. Human rights campaigners have warned of a growing trend for forces and the Police Federation to try to shield identities and restrict open justice. Andrew Hall, 43, died on 13 September 2016 at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary (HRI). He had collapsed at home after taking alcohol and prescription drugs. Paramedics took him to the accident and emergency department where he was revived and he allegedly slapped a nurse. Police were called and Hall was arrested. He was removed and put in a police cell where his condition was monitored. At one stage, as he was being returned to a cell, there was a struggle. \u201cOfficers forcibly moved him and then restrained him and it appears that during this ... one [or] more of the officers struck Andrew Hall multiple times,\u201d the high court judgment records. \u201cHe may have struck back.\u201d Paramedics were called and he was returned to hospital wearing handcuffs and leg restraints. Hall was sedated but his condition deteriorated and he died at the HRI later that night. The deaths of black men in police custody or shortly after being restrained have been highly controversial and have led to protests as well as protracted legal battles to obtain the truth about precisely what occurred. Police anonymity orders are more common in cases involving fatal shootings. The charity Inquest, which represents relatives at coroners\u2019 courts, says there has been an increase in the number of anonymity applications made and granted to police officers where the death involved police restraint. Recent inquests where anonymity has been granted to officers include the cases of Rashan Charles, a young black man who died after he was restrained by Metropolitan police officers on 22 July 2017, and Edson Da Costa, who died six days after becoming unconscious following restraint by Met officers, also in 2017. At a police misconduct hearing into a car pursuit that led to the death of Henry Hicks, a London carpenter, in December 2014, four officers were granted anonymity. Inquest says it is aware of two current cases involving the deaths of black men in custody or following restraint by police in which applications are being made for anonymity. For the Andrew Hall inquest, West Yorkshire police and the Police Federation applied for anonymity for officers and for them to give evidence from behind screens. The coroner granted permission. Lawyers for the family, represented by Leslie Thomas QC, went to the high court in Leeds to challenge the screening order. Delivering judgment, Mrs Justice Jefford said the coroner had misdirected himself because he had failed to take into consideration sufficiently the interests of open justice in a controversial case that involved the death of a black man following police restraint. Anonymity orders for the police involved will remain in place, and Jefford ruled that two officers, identified only as C and N, could still give evidence from behind screens. \u201cScreening of a witness who cannot, therefore, be seen by the general public and/or the press is an incursion [on the principle of open justice],\u201d the judge said. \u201cBeing able to see a witness give evidence is an important factor in assessing the witness\u2019s demeanour and, if it is in issue, credibility.\u201d Alice Stevens, a solicitor who represents the Hall family, said: \u201cRecent years have shown a rising trend in police officers seeking anonymity and screening at inquests in which their actions are called into question. This judgment rightly highlights the fact that open justice in inquests involving contact by state bodies should not be undervalued and that screening may undervalue public confidence and should not be granted without careful consideration.\u201d Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, said: \u201cWe repeatedly see defensive and combative tactics by police lawyers in the growing number of anonymity requests at inquests. This is about justice being done and being seen to be done. Anonymity goes against the spirit of an open and transparent investigation and hinders scrutiny of public officials. This judgment recognises the significant public interest in deaths of black men in custody.\u201d The Police Federation is considering an appeal against the decision.",

In February 1993, faced with obstruction of food supplies and other humanitarian aid, she banned all shipments to Bosnia. This led to reports of a clash with the UN secretary general Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Staff who were there at the time said this was untrue. Although she had not spoken to him directly before taking the decision, he fully supported her. Within days she won: those involved in the obstruction caved in and supplies resumed. She was famously impatient. Staff were the first to see the danger signs, her fingers tapping the table when faced with politicians or militia leaders or government bureaucrats she knew were lying. Always pressing for more funds for the organisation, she was personally austere and frugal. On her first day in office she found her desk lacked basics such as pens, blotting paper and trays. She slipped out to buy them herself. She left UNHCR in 2000 to return to Japan, where she went on to head the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the government body responsible for aid to developing countries. She was a frequent critic of the Japanese government for failing to provide sanctuary for refugees from Syria and other conflicts. Her husband died in 2014. She is survived by her son, Atsushi, and daughter, Akiko. \u2022 Sadako Ogata, diplomat, born 16 September 1927; died 22 October 2019",

The punishment handed to Bosco Ntaganda, 46, on Thursday was immediately welcomed by human rights activists. Ida Sawyer, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Africa division, said the sentence sent a strong message that even people considered untouchable might one day be held to account. \u201cWhile his victims\u2019 pain cannot be erased they can take some comfort in seeing justice prevail,\u201d Sawyer said. Ntaganda, whose cruelty and violence earned him the nickname the Terminator was found guilty in July on 18 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for acts committed when he was a key militia leader in DRC\u2019s restive Ituri province in 2002 and 2003. The atrocities included a mass killing at a village where people, including children and babies, were \u201cdisembowelled or had their heads smashed in\u201d, the court said. Ntaganda was also found responsible for the rape and sexual slavery of underage girls, for recruiting troops under the age of 15 and for personally killing a Roman Catholic priest. The conviction for sexual slavery is the first in the ICC\u2019s history. Prosecutors focused on two specific attacks involving Ntaganda\u2019s militia, one in late 2002 and another early in 2003. In one attack directed by Ntaganda, judges said soldiers killed at least 49 captured people in a banana field behind a village using \u201csticks and batons as well as knives and machetes\u201d. The presiding judge, Robert Fremr, said: \u201cMen, women, and children and babies were found in the field. Some bodies were found naked. Some had hands tied up. Some had their heads crushed.

Experts believe he gave himself up because he feared assassination after the collapse of the M23 movement, a rebel militia group which Ntaganda was accused of leading. The ICC had issued its first arrest warrant against Ntaganda for war crimes in Ituri in 2006 and the warlord became a symbol of impunity in the region.

He told judges during his trial that he was a \u201csoldier not a criminal\u201d and that the Terminator nickname did not apply to him. The time Ntaganda had spent in detention at the ICC from 2013 would be deducted from the sentence, the court said in a statement. The ICC was set up in 2002 as an independent international body to prosecute those accused of the world\u2019s worst crimes where national authorities are incapable of bringing perpetrators to justice.

      "body": "<p>It is dark outside and I am sitting alone at home, a silent phone to my ear. I had been promised that I would finally get to speak to the man known to his fans and friends as the Amazing Johnathan, but the minutes tick past and the streetlamps come on outside my window. In his heyday, the Amazing Johnathan was earning $3m a year and had a stage charisma as outsized as his tricks, which included appearing to<a href=\"https://tvtonight.com.au/2014/09/amazing-johnathan-reveals-he-is-dying-admits-to-performing-on-cocaine.html\" title=\"\"> snort an entire jar of </a><a href=\"https://tvtonight.com.au/2014/09/amazing-johnathan-reveals-he-is-dying-admits-to-performing-on-cocaine.html\" title=\"\">cocaine</a>, and seeming to plunge a spike through his tongue. But tonight, as the PR tries frantically to put my call through to him, there is only silence at the other end of the phone. The Amazing Johnathan has disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, welcome to my club,\u201d laughs Ben Berman when I tell him about my failure to speak to the man born John Edward Szeles. Berman is the director and co-star of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/11/magic-meth-and-mayhem-behind-the-years-most-mind-bending-documentary\" title=\"\">The Amazing Johnathan Documentary</a>, which has already been compared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2010/dec/17/catfish-film\" title=\"\">Catfish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/04/exit-through-the-gift-shop-review\" title=\"\">Exit Through the Giftshop</a>, which is pretty impressive, given this is Berman\u2019s first feature-length movie. But perhaps the most impressive thing is that he was ever able to film the Amazing Johnathan at all.</p> <p>\u201cThere were so many times when I was supposed to film in Vegas, or we\u2019d agree to be in this state on that day \u2013 and then it turned out that he and his wife were out of town that weekend. It was really hard,\u201d Berman says. Yet he spent two and a half years with the Amazing Johnathan. How could he bear being toyed with like this?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlTM74OeGD8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KlTM74OeGD8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cI like his sensibility, all that darkness and irreverence. There were many problems caused by him, and as painful as it was, I knew it would be valuable for my film,\u201d Berman says.</p> <p>It is fortunate for Berman that he was able to see the bright side because to say the magician caused him \u201cmany problems\u201d is like saying Noah and his ark encountered some bad weather.</p> <p>Originally, Berman set out to make a short, straight film about the Amazing Johnathan, now aged 61, confronting his mortality. Since the 1980s, the Amazing Johnathan had been a staple on American TV, making guest appearances on talkshows where he would do tricks such as <a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2017/06/20/the-amazing-johnathan-defies-death-on-stage-and-in-real-life/\" title=\"\">appear to swallow his own eyeball</a>. He was fun and funny, not cheesy like David Copperfield but not po-faced like David Blaine. At the beginning of this century he landed highly lucrative gigs in Las Vegas, and his wild-eyed, leonine face stared out from billboards across the Vegas strip.</p> <p>\u201cI lived in Vegas in 2005 for a few months and I\u2019d see the Amazing Johnathan in adverts out there,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/22/louis-theroux-i-backed-accusers-of-michael-jackson-due-to-my-time-with-savile\" title=\"\">Louis Theroux</a>, a fan of Berman\u2019s documentary. \u201cThere are certain people like that in Vegas \u2013 magicians, hypnotists, singers \u2013 and you think, are these people famous anywhere else? But he obviously wasn\u2019t a normal magician.\u201d</p> <p>Then, in 2014, the Amazing Johnathan disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cI was told I have a year to live,\u201d he announced during a talk that year. The audience, assuming this is another of his pranks, start to laugh, but he stops them: \u201cNot a joke,\u201d he says, his voice cracking.</p> <p>But after three years of waiting to die at home, the Amazing Johnathan was still alive and desperate to return to the stage. That was when Berman turned up. Except, as he captures in his movie, that is when the problems started. Because, as well as the difficulty of trying to film the Amazing Johnathan \u2013 who is either awol or smoking crystal meth in his bedroom \u2013 it turns out there are two, or maybe three, other documentarians also making a movie about the Amazing Johnathan.</p> <p>On top of that, Berman begins to wonder if the Amazing Johnathan is dying at all. After all, the evidence is right in front of us, lying in the pool, high on meth, three years after he was given a year to live. A friend warns Berman: \u201cCan you trust anything a magician says?\u201d</p> <p>Berman increasingly turns the film on himself, asking why he wants to make this documentary anyway, and whether he is disappointed that maybe the Amazing Johnathan isn\u2019t dying, and, if so, what does that say about him? He also confronts the other documentary crews.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df6d04dce05fd195b586bd7a1ca8cd69662111dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6d04dce05fd195b586bd7a1ca8cd69662111dd/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Edward Szeles, AKA the Amazing Johnathan, in a still from Ben Berman\u2019s documentary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Edward Szeles, AKA the Amazing Johnathan, in a still from Ben Berman\u2019s documentary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen you make a documentary, you are often aware of a journalist or director circling the same subject, and you either abandon the subject or ignore it. But you definitely don\u2019t feature the other team,\u201d says Theroux. \u201cI\u2019m in favour of showing things you\u2019re not supposed to see, like sound recorders, or someone tripping. But saying you\u2019re having to work around other crews, that\u2019s amazing. So I thought it was very bold of Ben and we get the sense of Johnathan as this supreme hustler and rogue.\u201d</p> <p>To say any more would commit hideous spoilers, but let\u2019s just say that much remains unexplained \u2013 including, most notably, whether Berman smokes meth with the Amazing Johnathan when the magician makes that a condition of them continuing to make their film.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t see me do it, so legally we\u2019re in the clear!\u201d Berman laughs. \u201cSuch a big theme of the movie is trying to determine what\u2019s truth and what\u2019s illusion, and there are still some things I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m going to stay cryptic on that.\u201d</p> <p>Berman also asks himself if there is something in his past that draws him towards this (possibly) dying magician, and so, with Johnathan now apparently out of the picture, he interviews his own, utterly delightful father, Doug.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Ben pointed the camera at me, I was thinking why would anyone be interested in me, and that the project could be ill-fated. But he was able to tell a very entertaining story with it!\u201d Doug tells me by email.</p> <p>Endearingly, Doug edits my questions during our interview \u201cto avoid spoiling some of the plot for your readers\u201d. It is reminiscent of how his son deconstructs his own documentary as he is creating it, unpicking the morality of documentaries such as the one he is making.</p> <p>\u201cI realised pretty early on that the movie was taking on a structure that wasn\u2019t traditional and, instead of seeing that as a negative, I decided to lean into it. I like that it became a documentary about documentaries,\u201d says Berman.</p> <p>Berman says his influences in the film range from Albert and David Maysles (Gimme Shelter, Grey Gardens) to Andrew Jarecki\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Good_Things_(film)\" title=\"\">All Good Things</a>, with its twist of a final act. Theroux mentions Michael Rubbo\u2019s Waiting for Fidel, in which the subject of the documentary never turns up, as well as Nick Broomfield\u2019s <a href=\"http://nickbroomfield.com/Driving-Me-Crazy\" title=\"\">Driving Me Crazy</a>, in which the documentarian is repeatedly frustrated in his effort to make the film he wants to, about a musical show in Munich.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes it takes a non doc person to bring something to the genre that refreshes it.

      "bodyText": "It is dark outside and I am sitting alone at home, a silent phone to my ear. I had been promised that I would finally get to speak to the man known to his fans and friends as the Amazing Johnathan, but the minutes tick past and the streetlamps come on outside my window. In his heyday, the Amazing Johnathan was earning $3m a year and had a stage charisma as outsized as his tricks, which included appearing to snort an entire jar of cocaine, and seeming to plunge a spike through his tongue. But tonight, as the PR tries frantically to put my call through to him, there is only silence at the other end of the phone. The Amazing Johnathan has disappeared. \u201cYeah, welcome to my club,\u201d laughs Ben Berman when I tell him about my failure to speak to the man born John Edward Szeles. Berman is the director and co-star of The Amazing Johnathan Documentary, which has already been compared to Catfish and Exit Through the Giftshop, which is pretty impressive, given this is Berman\u2019s first feature-length movie. But perhaps the most impressive thing is that he was ever able to film the Amazing Johnathan at all. \u201cThere were so many times when I was supposed to film in Vegas, or we\u2019d agree to be in this state on that day \u2013 and then it turned out that he and his wife were out of town that weekend. It was really hard,\u201d Berman says. Yet he spent two and a half years with the Amazing Johnathan. How could he bear being toyed with like this? \u201cI like his sensibility, all that darkness and irreverence. There were many problems caused by him, and as painful as it was, I knew it would be valuable for my film,\u201d Berman says. It is fortunate for Berman that he was able to see the bright side because to say the magician caused him \u201cmany problems\u201d is like saying Noah and his ark encountered some bad weather. Originally, Berman set out to make a short, straight film about the Amazing Johnathan, now aged 61, confronting his mortality. Since the 1980s, the Amazing Johnathan had been a staple on American TV, making guest appearances on talkshows where he would do tricks such as appear to swallow his own eyeball. He was fun and funny, not cheesy like David Copperfield but not po-faced like David Blaine. At the beginning of this century he landed highly lucrative gigs in Las Vegas, and his wild-eyed, leonine face stared out from billboards across the Vegas strip. \u201cI lived in Vegas in 2005 for a few months and I\u2019d see the Amazing Johnathan in adverts out there,\u201d says Louis Theroux, a fan of Berman\u2019s documentary. \u201cThere are certain people like that in Vegas \u2013 magicians, hypnotists, singers \u2013 and you think, are these people famous anywhere else? But he obviously wasn\u2019t a normal magician.\u201d Then, in 2014, the Amazing Johnathan disappeared. \u201cI was told I have a year to live,\u201d he announced during a talk that year. The audience, assuming this is another of his pranks, start to laugh, but he stops them: \u201cNot a joke,\u201d he says, his voice cracking. But after three years of waiting to die at home, the Amazing Johnathan was still alive and desperate to return to the stage. That was when Berman turned up. Except, as he captures in his movie, that is when the problems started. Because, as well as the difficulty of trying to film the Amazing Johnathan \u2013 who is either awol or smoking crystal meth in his bedroom \u2013 it turns out there are two, or maybe three, other documentarians also making a movie about the Amazing Johnathan. On top of that, Berman begins to wonder if the Amazing Johnathan is dying at all. After all, the evidence is right in front of us, lying in the pool, high on meth, three years after he was given a year to live. A friend warns Berman: \u201cCan you trust anything a magician says?\u201d Berman increasingly turns the film on himself, asking why he wants to make this documentary anyway, and whether he is disappointed that maybe the Amazing Johnathan isn\u2019t dying, and, if so, what does that say about him? He also confronts the other documentary crews. \u201cWhen you make a documentary, you are often aware of a journalist or director circling the same subject, and you either abandon the subject or ignore it. But you definitely don\u2019t feature the other team,\u201d says Theroux. \u201cI\u2019m in favour of showing things you\u2019re not supposed to see, like sound recorders, or someone tripping. But saying you\u2019re having to work around other crews, that\u2019s amazing. So I thought it was very bold of Ben and we get the sense of Johnathan as this supreme hustler and rogue.\u201d To say any more would commit hideous spoilers, but let\u2019s just say that much remains unexplained \u2013 including, most notably, whether Berman smokes meth with the Amazing Johnathan when the magician makes that a condition of them continuing to make their film. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t see me do it, so legally we\u2019re in the clear!\u201d Berman laughs. \u201cSuch a big theme of the movie is trying to determine what\u2019s truth and what\u2019s illusion, and there are still some things I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m going to stay cryptic on that.\u201d Berman also asks himself if there is something in his past that draws him towards this (possibly) dying magician, and so, with Johnathan now apparently out of the picture, he interviews his own, utterly delightful father, Doug. \u201cWhen Ben pointed the camera at me, I was thinking why would anyone be interested in me, and that the project could be ill-fated. But he was able to tell a very entertaining story with it!\u201d Doug tells me by email. Endearingly, Doug edits my questions during our interview \u201cto avoid spoiling some of the plot for your readers\u201d. It is reminiscent of how his son deconstructs his own documentary as he is creating it, unpicking the morality of documentaries such as the one he is making. \u201cI realised pretty early on that the movie was taking on a structure that wasn\u2019t traditional and, instead of seeing that as a negative, I decided to lean into it. I like that it became a documentary about documentaries,\u201d says Berman. Berman says his influences in the film range from Albert and David Maysles (Gimme Shelter, Grey Gardens) to Andrew Jarecki\u2019s All Good Things, with its twist of a final act. Theroux mentions Michael Rubbo\u2019s Waiting for Fidel, in which the subject of the documentary never turns up, as well as Nick Broomfield\u2019s Driving Me Crazy, in which the documentarian is repeatedly frustrated in his effort to make the film he wants to, about a musical show in Munich. \u201cSometimes it takes a non doc person to bring something to the genre that refreshes it. Like with Anvil!, which Sasha Gervasi made, and you can see that he\u2019s not a documentarian but a feature-film writer looking for a third act,\u201d says Theroux. As Berman says, much remains opaque by the end of the film, and just as I am thinking the Amazing Johnathan will remain mysterious to me, after various failed connections, I suddenly find myself speaking to him late one night. \u201cI like the documentary, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it\u2019s not really about me \u2013 it\u2019s more about Ben,\u201d says the distinctive irascible voice down the line. But why did he have so many documentary crews following him around? Was that just to mess with Ben? \u201cWell, no one yet has made the documentary I want! And wouldn\u2019t you want as many documentaries as possible?\u201d he replies, as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. He is not, he says, going to die any time soon, \u201cwhich makes me look like a big liar, but I\u2019m not.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t he stop smoking all that meth if he\u2019s so ill? \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop taking drugs now because I\u2019m dying \u2013 that\u2019s the stupidest fucking reason ever to quit drugs!\u201d he barks. The Amazing Johnathan has to go to the doctor now so I ask one last question: why has it been so hard for me to get hold of him? \u201cOh I just got the time wrong before,\u201d he says. Sometimes the mysterious truth turns out to be wholly prosaic. The Amazing Johnathan Documentary is released in the UK on 19 November. Louis Theroux will host a Q&amp;A screening of the film on that date, to be simulcast nationwide across the UK",

      "bodyText": "Finding Jack hasn\u2019t been made yet, but it sounds like the fifth movie you\u2019d watch on the return leg of a long haul flight. Its premise \u2013 an injured soldier in Vietnam becomes best friends with a labrador \u2013 suggests an onslaught of greasy sentimentality sickly enough to give you gastroenteritis. There is no way on earth you\u2019d pay to see Finding Jack. Or maybe there is. What if we amended Finding Jack\u2019s premise to \u201can injured soldier in Vietnam becomes best friends with a labrador, plus James Dean stars from beyond the grave as a crime against God\u201d? Of course you\u2019d watch that. You\u2019d watch it just to see if it was as distressing as it sounds. Luckily, it\u2019s happening. Yesterday, the Hollywood Reporter announced that the family of James Dean have given permission to allow their iconic ancestor to be digitally resurrected for a secondary lead role in Finding Jack. \u201cThe family views this as his fourth movie, a movie he never got to make,\u201d said film-maker Anton Ernst in a statement. \u201cWe do not intend to let his fans down.\u201d What great news! They\u2019re taking the likeness of a long-dead actor and feeding it into a technology largely known for producing creepy, waxy, lifeless monstrosities so that it can lumber through a terrible, legacy-destroying film while an impressionist makes it perform dialogue about how nice dogs are. Realistically, the film-makers would be better served by digging up James Dean\u2019s body, dressing it in an army uniform and jerking it about on wires. But, hey, at least they don\u2019t intend to let his fans down. This has been coming for a long time. Those old arch enemies Marvel and Martin Scorsese have both found potential in digital de-ageing, even though \u2013 given Robert De Niro\u2019s upsetting Polar Express eyes in The Irishman, Samuel L Jackson\u2019s weirdly exhausted-looking Nick Fury in Captain Marvel and that one shot of Michael Douglas looking like he was melting in Avengers: Endgame \u2013 the process has clearly yet to be perfected. And while Star Wars brought Peter Cushing back from the dead for Rogue One, the end result was distracting at best and the actual stuff of nightmares at worst. And Cushing was playing a character that he\u2019d already played before, so at least there was a modicum of artistic leeway there. James Dean, meanwhile \u2013 who died before the Vietnam war began \u2013 will be playing a role in a film he has absolutely no relationship with.

      "bodyText": "Dylan Hartley insisted he would not change a thing about his career after announcing injury had forced the former England captain to retire. The 33-year-old won 97 caps, the most by any England hooker, and led his country to two Six Nations titles \u2013 one of which was a grand slam\u2013 and a first away series win in Australia having taken over the captaincy following Eddie Jones\u2019s appointment as coach. As the England captain he had an 85% winning record and had hoped to play in the Rugby World Cup this year. The knee injury sustained 11 months ago playing for Northampton ruled out that possibility and has now ended his career. \u201cThe last few months have been difficult mentally and physically as I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact I am no longer able to compete,\u201d said Hartley, who will retire with immediate effect. \u201cI am extremely proud of my journey but now is the right time to hang up my playing boots. \u201cMy career wasn\u2019t perfect but I wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. I\u2019m privileged to have experienced some amazing highs while there have also been some personal lows, all of which are powerful experiences that will stay with me forever. The final chapter of my career was supposed to go a different way but that is the nature of professional sport.\u201d Hartley, who stands behind only Jason Leonard in terms of England\u2019s most-capped players, made his final appearance for England off the bench in the victory against Australia last November. His career was not without controversy, with the hooker racking up almost two years\u2019 worth of bans for foul play, missing out on the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour of Australia and, indirectly, the 2015 World Cup. Jones, who was criticised for his appointment of Hartley because of his disciplinary record, said England would be \u201cfor ever indebted\u201d to their first captain on the four-year road to last weekend\u2019s World Cup final in Japan. \u201cDylan has had a significant international career playing for his country, and was a tough, enduring character for us,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe owe him a lot for his contribution to the making of this team. We will be for ever indebted to him for his dedication and commitment to the team and his love of English rugby.\u2019 At Northampton, Hartley captained the club for eight years, and made 251 appearances, his final match coming against Worcester at Sixways on 21 December last year. Hartley said. \u201cI came to England as a teenager hoping to get a few games and to see the world. I could have never predicted that one day I\u2019d play 14 years for such a special club and go on to represent and captain England. \u201cNorthampton has been more than just a club to me. It has been a place that has provided me with direction, purpose, a sense of family, home and belonging, and ultimately a community I was so proud to represent.\u201d His retirement has been in the offing but Hartley continued to train up until Tuesday and has been advising Northampton\u2019s two current captains Alex Waller and Teimana Harrison as well as mentoring the club\u2019s hookers. Former teammates for England and Northampton followed Jones in paying tribute. \u201cSo much will be said about all his achievements and status within the game ... and rightly so,\u201d said Tom Wood, who played alongside Hartley for club and country. \u201cI\u2019m just sad to see another of my mates have to step away from the field. I know you\u2019ll land on your feet whatever route you choose to take.\u201d Will Hooley, the USA full-back who began his career at Northampton, said: \u201cSimply one of the best leaders.

      "bodyText": "Johnny Marr has dismissed rumours of a Smiths reunion after a fan asked for clarification about a rumoured 2020 tour. The rumour, posted on the forum Morrissey Solo, came from a \u201ctrusted source\u201d who claimed that concert promoter Live Nation had won the rights to the band\u2019s reunion. In response to the fan, who said they needed to know the truth \u201cpretty sharpish so I can get a loan and sell everything I own to go to every date\u201d, Marr replied: \u201cNigel Farage on guitar,\u201d appearing to rubbish the gossip by alluding to the incompatibility of his and Morrissey\u2019s political beliefs. The Guardian has contacted representatives of Marr for comment. In recent years, Morrissey has made explicit his support for the rightwing, anti-Islam For Britain political party. In June, he reposted a video from a rightwing YouTube channel to Morrissey Solo, which argued that the British establishment was using Stormzy to promote multiculturalism at the expense of white culture. He has expressed his approval of the Brexit referendum result, and blamed immigration for the loss of British identity. He recently performed in Los Angeles wearing a T-shirt that read: \u201cFuck the Guardian.\u201d Billy Bragg has said it is \u201cbeyond doubt\u201d that Morrissey is spreading far-right ideas. Marr is leftwing. On his most recent album, Call the Comet, he imagines an alternative society that \u201cresets the ridiculousness of the last few years\u201d, he told the Independent in 2018.

      "body": "<p>The rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fka-twigs\">FKA twigs</a> is one of the most intriguing in modern pop. It has not been an ascent to dizzying commercial success: her releases sell respectably rather than astonishingly. It\u2019s more about the acclaim she\u2019s achieved. Rock and pop stars of any stripe usually struggle to convince the world that they\u2019re actually polymath geniuses; FKA twigs \u2013 AKA Tahliah Barnett \u2013 seems to have been accepted as one from the start. In the five years since her debut album, she has diversified into everything from arty webzines in which she features as a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BiR3zVojLic/\">comic strip superhero called Anomalie</a> to starring in <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/spike-jonze-and-fka-twigs-made-a-jaw-dropping-short-film-for-apples-homepod/\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/spike-jonze-and-fka-twigs-made-a-jaw-dropping-short-film-for-apples-homepod/\">commercial for Apple</a> directed by Spike Jonze. Live, she frequently spends more time engaged in choreography than actually singing, as if music is a secondary pursuit to abstract tap-dancing and demonstrating her mastery of sword-based kung fu. Her videos aren\u2019t just promotional items but exercises in visual art with mini-documentaries attached, explaining the practice behind them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b6c41585eeb10ec5fa6473bc1d93d86774e34a8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6c41585eeb10ec5fa6473bc1d93d86774e34a8d/0_0_4000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The artwork for Magdalene.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The artwork for Magdalene.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Critics could have greeted all this with scepticism, for distracting from the music that drew people to her in the first place, but quite the opposite. The uniformly rhapsodic response to it all has seen Barnett fast-tracked into a very rarefied space, spoken of in the same breath as Kate Bush and Bj\u00f6rk, not as a lazy comparison but as their contemporary auteur heir.</p> <p>The praise is sometimes deserved \u2013 but not always. Magdalene\u2019s sound cuts almost all Barnett\u2019s ties with the \u201calt-R&amp;B\u201d label that attached itself to her debut (and which she has decried as racist). Instead, she heads further into the realms of abstraction: a discombobulating aural scrapbook of pummelling, funeral march percussion, slivers of eerie electronics and white noise and warped samples of voices. As in one of the videos for which Bennett learns pole dancing, martial arts, oncological neurosurgery, hang-gliding or whatever, you can sense the pains that have been staked in its making. However chaotic the musical backdrop appears to get, you know everything has been very carefully assembled, that not a note or a beat or a wisp of feedback is out of place, that nothing has happened at random. It\u2019s strange enough to make the ordinary moments jarring, as when rapper Future appears on Holy Terrain, rhyming over a straightforward beat, Auto-Tune cranked up to full.</p> <p>Sometimes the results are stunning, as on the beautiful microcosmos of tiny, constantly shifting sounds that fade in and out of Mary Magdalene. Or on Home With You, with its rhythm track made up of bursts of static interference, noises that sound like distorted gunshots, whoops that sound like someone catching their breath mid-sob. Barnett\u2019s voice seems to have shifted slightly from her debut, becoming more refined. A high, perfectly enunciated RP quaver that sounds like a postwar BBC announcer on the verge of tears, it\u2019s definitely an acquired taste but capable of sounding simultaneously wracked and icy \u2013 an impressive ruse to pull off.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YkLjqFpBh84?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>FKA twigs: Cellophane \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Sometimes, however, the songs are weirdly stifling. Magdalene is clearly a very personal work: a breakup album that ruminates on the power of female sexuality and the toxic effects of fame and media intrusion on one\u2019s personal life (Barnett became an unlikely tabloid fixture after dating actor Robert Pattinson). \u201cIf I walk out the door it wakes a thousand eyes,\u201d protests opener Thousand Eyes. \u201cThey want to see us alone, they want to see us apart,\u201d notes closer Cellophane, bitterly. But there are moments where the music seems to work against the listener fully engaging with the emotions of the songs. Fallen Alien features a lot of clever production touches \u2013 beats that sound like swords clashing, unexpected explosions of industrial clamour, high-drama bursts of sped-up backing vocals \u2013 allied to a meandering, episodic tune. The result is something you admire for its audacity, and for the fastidious technique involved, rather than immerse yourself in.</p> <p>There are very good songs here that would pack a punch stripped of the accompanying sonic barrage \u2013 Bad Day, Mary Magdalene, the exquisitely careworn Mirrored Heart \u2013 but occasionally the sound seems like scaffolding to support some quite slender material: the two lines of melody that make up Thousand Eyes; the repetitious Day Bed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/28/fka-twigs-in-shadow-of-man-robert-pattinson-surgery-new-album-miranda-sawyer\">FKA twigs: \u2018An incredible woman always in the shadow of a man? I can relate\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, for all its variable quality, you don\u2019t finish Magdalene mystified as to why FKA twigs has attracted so much praise. Her ambition is lofty. She shows a genuine desire to press forward, to create something new, and that is utterly at odds with huge swathes of current British pop, where trying to fit in and appear as normal as possible is very much the order of the day. Magdalene is not carefully constructed to slot unobtrusively into a curated streaming playlist. Its highlights achieve their ambition in a genuinely impressive style, and if other moments fall short, it\u2019s not for want of trying. At a time when a lot of twigs\u2019s peers aren\u2019t trying to do much more than tick boxes, that\u2019s laudable in itself.</p> <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5Y58JmlBpQ\">Cate Le Bon and Bradford Cox: Secretary</a></strong><br>Art-rock summit meeting yields hauntingly rickety song: out-of-tune piano, ramshackle percussion, spoken-word interlude from the Deerhunter frontman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2w8Wshbp9RCPJdPU1iOpaY\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2w8Wshbp9RCPJdPU1iOpaY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

Rock and pop stars of any stripe usually struggle to convince the world that they\u2019re actually polymath geniuses; FKA twigs \u2013 AKA Tahliah Barnett \u2013 seems to have been accepted as one from the start. In the five years since her debut album, she has diversified into everything from arty webzines in which she features as a comic strip superhero called Anomalie to starring in a commercial for Apple directed by Spike Jonze. Live, she frequently spends more time engaged in choreography than actually singing, as if music is a secondary pursuit to abstract tap-dancing and demonstrating her mastery of sword-based kung fu. Her videos aren\u2019t just promotional items but exercises in visual art with mini-documentaries attached, explaining the practice behind them. Critics could have greeted all this with scepticism, for distracting from the music that drew people to her in the first place, but quite the opposite. The uniformly rhapsodic response to it all has seen Barnett fast-tracked into a very rarefied space, spoken of in the same breath as Kate Bush and Bj\u00f6rk, not as a lazy comparison but as their contemporary auteur heir. The praise is sometimes deserved \u2013 but not always. Magdalene\u2019s sound cuts almost all Barnett\u2019s ties with the \u201calt-R&amp;B\u201d label that attached itself to her debut (and which she has decried as racist). Instead, she heads further into the realms of abstraction: a discombobulating aural scrapbook of pummelling, funeral march percussion, slivers of eerie electronics and white noise and warped samples of voices. As in one of the videos for which Bennett learns pole dancing, martial arts, oncological neurosurgery, hang-gliding or whatever, you can sense the pains that have been staked in its making. However chaotic the musical backdrop appears to get, you know everything has been very carefully assembled, that not a note or a beat or a wisp of feedback is out of place, that nothing has happened at random. It\u2019s strange enough to make the ordinary moments jarring, as when rapper Future appears on Holy Terrain, rhyming over a straightforward beat, Auto-Tune cranked up to full. Sometimes the results are stunning, as on the beautiful microcosmos of tiny, constantly shifting sounds that fade in and out of Mary Magdalene. Or on Home With You, with its rhythm track made up of bursts of static interference, noises that sound like distorted gunshots, whoops that sound like someone catching their breath mid-sob. Barnett\u2019s voice seems to have shifted slightly from her debut, becoming more refined. A high, perfectly enunciated RP quaver that sounds like a postwar BBC announcer on the verge of tears, it\u2019s definitely an acquired taste but capable of sounding simultaneously wracked and icy \u2013 an impressive ruse to pull off. Sometimes, however, the songs are weirdly stifling. Magdalene is clearly a very personal work: a breakup album that ruminates on the power of female sexuality and the toxic effects of fame and media intrusion on one\u2019s personal life (Barnett became an unlikely tabloid fixture after dating actor Robert Pattinson). \u201cIf I walk out the door it wakes a thousand eyes,\u201d protests opener Thousand Eyes. \u201cThey want to see us alone, they want to see us apart,\u201d notes closer Cellophane, bitterly. But there are moments where the music seems to work against the listener fully engaging with the emotions of the songs. Fallen Alien features a lot of clever production touches \u2013 beats that sound like swords clashing, unexpected explosions of industrial clamour, high-drama bursts of sped-up backing vocals \u2013 allied to a meandering, episodic tune. The result is something you admire for its audacity, and for the fastidious technique involved, rather than immerse yourself in. There are very good songs here that would pack a punch stripped of the accompanying sonic barrage \u2013 Bad Day, Mary Magdalene, the exquisitely careworn Mirrored Heart \u2013 but occasionally the sound seems like scaffolding to support some quite slender material: the two lines of melody that make up Thousand Eyes; the repetitious Day Bed. And yet, for all its variable quality, you don\u2019t finish Magdalene mystified as to why FKA twigs has attracted so much praise. Her ambition is lofty. She shows a genuine desire to press forward, to create something new, and that is utterly at odds with huge swathes of current British pop, where trying to fit in and appear as normal as possible is very much the order of the day. Magdalene is not carefully constructed to slot unobtrusively into a curated streaming playlist. Its highlights achieve their ambition in a genuinely impressive style, and if other moments fall short, it\u2019s not for want of trying. At a time when a lot of twigs\u2019s peers aren\u2019t trying to do much more than tick boxes, that\u2019s laudable in itself. This week Alexis listened to Cate Le Bon and Bradford Cox: Secretary Art-rock summit meeting yields hauntingly rickety song: out-of-tune piano, ramshackle percussion, spoken-word interlude from the Deerhunter frontman.",

They have attempted to find ways of dealing with the pay explosion that comes when academy products on small salaries quickly become England players on significant wages.</p> <p>As holders, Saracens were due to be centre stage at the launch of this season\u2019s European Champions Cup in Cardiff on Wednesday. Participating teams are obliged to send their head coach and captain (or agreed alternatives) to the event or face being fined, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/06/exeter-director-saracens-stripped-rugby-union-premiership-titles\" title=\"\">they declined to attend</a>, 24 hours after Premiership Rugby announced the result of a five-day hearing into the alleged salary cap breaches. Saracens claim they feared turning what was meant to be a look forward into a sideshow, but they dominated it anyway.</p> <p>The points deduction, which initially dropped Saracens to the bottom of the Premiership on -26, was provisionally rescinded when the club announced it would appeal. Saracens had based their defence on a contention the cap had not been breached, because co-investing with players in businesses did not constitute salary. The club also claimed there had been no attempt to mislead in making financial arrangements with leading players, but the next step will be to challenge the legal validity of the cap under competition law.</p> <p>It may take a high-court judge to rule on that, but the club has grounds for appeal on \u201cprocedural unfairness\u201d. The 35-point deduction had to be agreed by the Rugby Football Union which, even though it apparently received advice that the wording on the Premiership\u2019s salary cap regulation was \u201csloppy\u201d, did not withhold its consent or even refer the matter to the professional game board. It decided the matter should be left to the clubs, a decision that may come to haunt the governing body, should the club that provides England with its core group, and which has long had a policy of developing homegrown players, loses its elevated status.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faa2adb481395644543d16446552724b574c73d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/faa2adb481395644543d16446552724b574c73d3/0_63_3805_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One rival director of rugby has called for Saracens to remove the words \u2018honesty\u2019 and \u2018integrity\u2019 from their Allianz Park home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One rival director of rugby has called for Saracens to remove the words \u2018honesty\u2019 and \u2018integrity\u2019 from their Allianz Park home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Paston/PA Archive/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were nine Saracens players in the wider England squad that reached last week\u2019s World Cup final, including Elliot Daly and Jack Singleton, who have yet to play for the club after signing in the close season. Four came through the academy system; Ben Spencer signed as a 19-year-old from Cambridge and the Vunipola brothers joined when they were 20. Bath, one of the most vocal clubs against Saracens in Premiership meetings, had five England players in Japan: three who joined from London Irish and none of whom they developed.</p> <p>Champions Cup organisers believe Saracens will soon begin deregistering players from the group stage, beyond Liam Williams and Alex Goode, who will not play again until the start of the Six Nations at least. Having lost the hearing, Sarries have to trim the wage bill to avoid breaching the cap again this season. It is too risky to wait until the outcome of an appeal that may not be heard for months.</p> <p>When players such as Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje came through the club\u2019s system, they were paid a nominal wage.

      "bodyText": "Saracens have never courted popularity, but they have never been more isolated than now. Their Premiership rivals have welcomed the draconian 35-point penalty and \u00a35m fine (which will rise if legal costs are awarded against them) slapped on the English and European champions for breaching the league\u2019s salary cap regulations over a three\u2011year period. The Exeter chairman, Tony Rowe, will call for Saracens to be relegated when the Premiership board next meets in January. The Harlequins captain, Chris Robshaw, not one given to overreaction, said he found it hard to take now that success was found to have been built on cheating. Sale\u2019s director of rugby, Steve Diamond \u2013 a former coach at Saracens \u2013 called on the club to remove the words \u201cintegrity\u201d and \u201chonesty\u201d from their Allianz Park ground. Chris Boyd, Northampton\u2019s director of rugby, said a salary cap demanded sacrifices \u2013 although he also sympathised with Sarries\u2019 predicament. They have attempted to find ways of dealing with the pay explosion that comes when academy products on small salaries quickly become England players on significant wages. As holders, Saracens were due to be centre stage at the launch of this season\u2019s European Champions Cup in Cardiff on Wednesday. Participating teams are obliged to send their head coach and captain (or agreed alternatives) to the event or face being fined, but they declined to attend, 24 hours after Premiership Rugby announced the result of a five-day hearing into the alleged salary cap breaches. Saracens claim they feared turning what was meant to be a look forward into a sideshow, but they dominated it anyway. The points deduction, which initially dropped Saracens to the bottom of the Premiership on -26, was provisionally rescinded when the club announced it would appeal. Saracens had based their defence on a contention the cap had not been breached, because co-investing with players in businesses did not constitute salary. The club also claimed there had been no attempt to mislead in making financial arrangements with leading players, but the next step will be to challenge the legal validity of the cap under competition law. It may take a high-court judge to rule on that, but the club has grounds for appeal on \u201cprocedural unfairness\u201d. The 35-point deduction had to be agreed by the Rugby Football Union which, even though it apparently received advice that the wording on the Premiership\u2019s salary cap regulation was \u201csloppy\u201d, did not withhold its consent or even refer the matter to the professional game board. It decided the matter should be left to the clubs, a decision that may come to haunt the governing body, should the club that provides England with its core group, and which has long had a policy of developing homegrown players, loses its elevated status. There were nine Saracens players in the wider England squad that reached last week\u2019s World Cup final, including Elliot Daly and Jack Singleton, who have yet to play for the club after signing in the close season. Four came through the academy system; Ben Spencer signed as a 19-year-old from Cambridge and the Vunipola brothers joined when they were 20. Bath, one of the most vocal clubs against Saracens in Premiership meetings, had five England players in Japan: three who joined from London Irish and none of whom they developed. Champions Cup organisers believe Saracens will soon begin deregistering players from the group stage, beyond Liam Williams and Alex Goode, who will not play again until the start of the Six Nations at least. Having lost the hearing, Sarries have to trim the wage bill to avoid breaching the cap again this season. It is too risky to wait until the outcome of an appeal that may not be heard for months. When players such as Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje came through the club\u2019s system, they were paid a nominal wage. Both were capped early and their salaries increased significantly. The club\u2019s owner, Nigel Wray, who took over at the start of the professional era in 1995, has long raged at the failure of the salary cap to properly compensate clubs who face pay explosions after serving the national cause. The policy allows for the first \u00a350,000 of a homegrown international\u2019s salary to be excluded from the cap, and the \u00a3228m deal between the Premiership and the RFU means wages are subsidised. All clubs benefit, even if they do not have a single player in the England squad. Then there is the issue of welfare. The chances are that even if Rowe gets his wish and Saracens are relegated, their tightly knit group of players would remain, potentially suspending their England careers. One club owner complained recently he was looking to get rid of a big-name signing who had hardly played because of injuries. There was no consideration of the player\u2019s future or the fact his inactivity was involuntary. That does not happen at Saracens. It does not excuse their failure to clear schemes such as the co-investment programme with the Premiership before going ahead with them, no matter that they were not hidden. Four years ago, Saracens were among a number of clubs being investigated for salary cap breaches, but no action was taken because there was an acceptance more than a few were at it.

It is also closing a net five supermarkets and will shut 40 convenience stores, although it intends to open 100 new ones. Even if one-off costs are excluded, profits fell 15% to \u00a3238m as sales slipped by 0.2% to \u00a316.8bn. However, Mike Coupe, the chief executive, said Sainsbury\u2019s had \u201ccreated positive momentum\u201d with price cuts and investments in large beauty areas, premium ready meals and exclusive partnerships with brands such as the fast-food business Leon. The supermarket blamed poor weather compared with last year for a 0.1% fall in grocery sales over the half year. It said sales had risen by 0.6% in the most recent three months after it cut prices on 1,000 of its bestselling products since February. The grocer has ditched its cheapest Basics range in favour of 200 low-price products under new in-house labels including Stamford Street ready meals, Mary Ann\u2019s Dairy and Greengrocer fruit and veg. Clothing sales rose by 3.3% and general merchandise sales fell by 2%. Coupe said the retail market was highly competitive and the outlook for consumer confidence was uncertain as a result of the forthcoming general electionand the continuing Brexit debate. He said it was unclear how an election so close to Christmas would affect sales as this had not happened since 1923, but that consumer sentiment was still soft and appeared to have become poorer as a result of the difficult political backdrop. \u201cPeople will still have a great Christmas and spend their money,\u201d he said, but added: \u201cThe sooner we can resolve our future [in relation to Brexit] the better. Ultimately that\u2019s what will fuel consumer confidence and retail in the UK.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s and the other traditional supermarkets, including Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose, have all had to slash prices on basic groceries while trying to improve service, as discounters including Aldi, Lidl, B&amp;M and Home Bargains have all expanded rapidly in recent years. Richard Lim, the chief executive of the analysis firm Retail Economics, said: \u201cBlaming the weather and higher marketing expenses suggests there is significant pressure on profit margins bubbling under the surface. There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that sales fell across all parts of the business, reflecting tough market conditions. \u201cHowever, the integration of Argos appears to be progressing well. It offers a truly attractive proposition for customers who increasingly bounce across physical and digital channels, often at the same time.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s had wanted to improve efficiency through a merger with Asda, the UK\u2019s third largest supermarket, but the \u00a37bn deal was blocked by competition regulators this year.",

But figures compiled by the Guardian show that LGIM as a whole actually spent about $367m (\u00a3285m) since January increasing its stake in those companies \u2013 the oil corporation ExxonMobil, the insurer Metlife, the maker of Spam, Hormel Foods, the US retailer Kroger and Korean Electric Power Corporation (KEPC) \u2013 even when accounting for the divestments made by its Future Worlds Funds.

LGIM remains a top 30 shareholder in all but one of those five firms, having recently sold another chunk of KEPC shares that relegated the fund manager to the firm\u2019s 78th largest investor. Catherine Howarth, the chief executive of investment campaign group ShareAction, said: \u201cThe analysis raises the issue of index funds which automatically channel capital into fossil fuels companies \u2013 this is far from a perfect model for socially conscious investors.\u201d \u201cWhat is crucial is that index fund managers use their voting rights as shareholders in fossil fuels companies to demand ambitious change from company boards and senior management, and to vote against the election of directors that fail to commit to transition. As ShareAction\u2019s recent analysis of voting on climate-related resolutions shows, LGIM has indeed done this.\u201d A recent report by ShareAction lauded LGIM for backing 82% of key shareholder climate votes, many of which were aimed at forcing world\u2019s most polluting companies to cut their emissions. LGIM\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cClimate change is a very important topic for us and we have been working strenuously to bring about change in the companies in which we invest.\u201d In line with its climate pledge, LGIM has used its shareholder powers to vote against corporate chairs of companies it believed failed to take adequate action on the climate crisis. Voting records seen by the Guardian show it voted against re-electing the top board members of companies including Volkswagen, Barrick Gold and Japan\u2019s Tepco, which it believed were not doing enough to mitigate the climate emergency.",

      "bodyText": "The Brexit party chairman, Richard Tice, is standing as its candidate in the Labour stronghold of Hartlepool in December\u2019s election, the Guardian understands. Sources in the leave-voting town said Tice\u2019s candidacy would be announced in Hartlepool later on Thursday. The multimillionaire property tycoon, who was elected as an MEP for the party in May, founded the Leave Means Leave and Leave.EU campaigns. Hartlepool has long been considered one of the Brexit party\u2019s most winnable seats in next month\u2019s general election, after it took joint control of the local council in September. A Brexit party spokesman declined to comment. However, well-placed sources locally confirmed the news. The town voted 69.3% to leave the EU three years ago and there is little sign that opinion has softened. According to estimates by the academic Chris Hanretty, it returned a higher Brexit party vote than any other Labour seat in May\u2019s European parliamentary elections. But Tice\u2019s candidacy has also raised eyebrows locally, as the Brexit party had already publicly announced its election candidate as Ken Hodcroft, the former Hartlepool FC chairman. The local Labour party, which is fighting to keep hold of a seat it has held for 56 years, said the Brexit party had decided to \u201cdump a millionaire with at least some links to the town and replace him with a multimillionaire who has none\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A majority of the UK public and almost half of Conservative voters support a radical plan to transform the economy and tackle the climate crisis, a poll suggests. YouGov found that 56% of people back the total decarbonisation of the UK economy by 2030 and just under half support public spending to make large swathes of public transport free to use. The findings appear to highlight a growing awareness of the scale of the climate crisis and the increasingly radical policy solutions the public is willing to support. Last week a separate survey found that the climate emergency would influence how most people vote, with almost two-thirds agreeing it was the biggest issue facing humankind. The new poll, commissioned by Green New Deal UK, a non-party-aligned campaign group, found that 47% of Conservative voters back a zero-emissions target by 2030, compared with just 16% who support the government\u2019s current aim of reaching that point by 2050. Labour wants the UK to hit zero carbon by 2030 as part of its Green Industrial Revolution agenda, the Green party also has a target date of 2030, and the Liberal Democrats have set a target of 2045. Aliya Yule, a co-founder of Labour for a Green New Deal, which campaigned for Labour to adopt the 2030 target, said the polling showed next month\u2019s vote was becoming the UK\u2019s first \u201cclimate election\u201d. \u201cThe figures demonstrate the huge public appetite for rapid and radical government action on climate change,\u201d he said. Yule said only Labour\u2019s Green Industrial Revolution plans \u2013 which aim to tie radical action on the environment to huge job creation and housing upgrade schemes \u2013 would address the scale of the crisis. \u201cNot even Conservative voters support the Tories\u2019 net zero 2050 target. They have no credibility on climate change, not even with their own supporters,\u201d he added. \u201cA target date of 2030 has been Green party policy for years,\u201d said a Green party spokesperson. \u201cThe fact that the majority of people now support it shows how much concern about the climate emergency is accelerating, and how little support there is for the government\u2019s policy of setting targets for mid-century and using that as an excuse to take very little action to achieve them.\u201d This week student and pensioner groups called on the leaders of all the main parties to take part in a televised leaders\u2019 debate on the climate. All agreed except for Boris Johnson, who did not respond. Noga Levy-Rapoport, a participant in the youth climate strikes, said: \u201cThis general election is our last chance to face up to the climate crisis.

The whole thing is horribly nihilistic and cheerful all at once. \u2022 Rise of the Footsoldier 4: Marbella is released in the UK on 8 November.",

Like sex, drugs or money, a little bit of sugar makes us want more. It\u2019s easy to long for the vegetable markets and luxurious lunches of Italy. Unfortunately, Americans have exported our diet around the world \u2013 a colonization by Cocoa Puffs. Even the \u201cmythical Mediterranean diet\u201d, as Julia Belluz called it in Vox, has been usurped by sugar. With nowhere to hide, the burden remains on the consumer. Reducing the added sugar in one\u2019s diet is difficult, and success depends on a number of social and environmental factors. But changing what you can is important, so read the labels and try to find fresh alternatives to processed foods. We can\u2019t escape the Milky Way\u2019s orbit, but most of us can at least learn to cook fish. Eleanor Cummins is a science journalist based in New York City",

That finding obviously is encouraging for Buttigieg, who has moved from unknown to contender in just a few months, and for Warren, who has risen steadily throughout the campaign while Sanders stagnated and Biden sank.</p> <p>But a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/upshot/trump-biden-warren-polls.html\">new Times/Siena survey</a> of likely voters also finds that in the half-dozen battleground states where a close presidential contest is likely to be decided, Biden is the only Democratic candidate who leads Donald Trump, albeit by narrow margins. Sanders trails Trump in every state but Michigan, and Warren is behind in all six states. In separate head-to-head polling in Iowa (the only state where the survey included Buttigieg), Biden trails Trump by one point, Sanders by three, Buttigieg by four, and Warren by six.</p> <p>These findings are likely to intensify Democratic fears that a Warren-Trump matchup would lead to a repeat of the 2016 debacle.

African Americans in the deep south were once disenfranchised with literacy tests and other racist laws, and in recent years a surge in restrictive voting legislation, including voter identification laws and sweeping electoral roll purges, has ushered in an era <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/stacey-abrams-election-governor-georgia.html\">described by some</a> as a neo-Jim Crow.</p> \n<p>Abrams did not win that night.

Abrams believes that voter suppression played a central role, which has led her to her next chapter: she has announced that for the next year, she will lead a nationwide voting rights campaign. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=The%20fight%20to%20vote&amp;description=Investigating%20efforts%20to%20stop%20millions%20of%20Americans%20voting&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Fthe-fight-to-vote&amp;links=true&amp;link-1-headline=Why%20voter%20suppression%20threatens%20democracy&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fnov%2F07%2Fis-america-a-democracy-if-so-why-does-it-deny-millions-the-vote&amp;link-2-headline=The%20worst%20place%20to%20vote%20in%20America&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fng-interactive%2F2019%2Fnov%2F07%2Fwhich-us-states-hardest-vote-supression-election&amp;link-3-headline=Guardian%20US%20launches%20voting%20rights%20series&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fnov%2F07%2Ffight-to-vote-voter-suppression-editors-note\" data-alt=\"box 2\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=The%20fight%20to%20vote&amp;description=Investigating%20efforts%20to%20stop%20millions%20of%20Americans%20voting&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Fthe-fight-to-vote&amp;links=true&amp;link-1-headline=Why%20voter%20suppression%20threatens%20democracy&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fnov%2F07%2Fis-america-a-democracy-if-so-why-does-it-deny-millions-the-vote&amp;link-2-headline=The%20worst%20place%20to%20vote%20in%20America&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fng-interactive%2F2019%2Fnov%2F07%2Fwhich-us-states-hardest-vote-supression-election&amp;link-3-headline=Guardian%20US%20launches%20voting%20rights%20series&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fnov%2F07%2Ffight-to-vote-voter-suppression-editors-note\">box 2</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Her goal is to export lessons she learned fighting voter suppression in Georgia, and to mobilize a base of progressives and marginalized communities to help Democrats win the White House in 2020.

While voter suppression laws in various states no longer explicitly target particular groups, the method is more insidious, using carefully constructed policy to make it harder to register, to cast a vote and to have a ballot counted. It has fundamentally changed the electoral landscape in the United States.</p> \n<p>Abrams\u2019 home state of Georgia is an incubator for these new suppression tactics, and Kemp, her opponent last year, is a primary instigator. Beginning in 2010, he served as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, overseeing voting and elections, and controversially declined to step down from the post while he ran for governor, meaning he effectively oversaw his own election.</p> \n<p>Since the landmark supreme court decision, which allowed states to impose new voting laws without federal approval, Georgia has enacted a swath of voter suppression laws, from rapidly purging the voter rolls of those deemed inactive, to the closure of <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/precincts-have-closed-across-georgia-and-nation-since-court-ruling/ecgFnCOcs46mJkpXehwm2L/\">hundreds of polling places</a>, often in poorer black neighbourhoods. It introduced a new law terminating voter registration four weeks before the 2018 election day, <a href=\"https://www.apmreports.org/story/2019/10/28/georgia-voting-deadlines-2020-election\">preventing an estimated 87,000 people from voting</a>.</p> \n<p>The state also introduced a controversial \u201cexact match\u201d law requiring that details on new voter applications match precisely with government-issued documents \u2013 meaning an errant hyphen or a changed married name can block the registration process. This system proved contentious last year after 53,000 applications \u2013 mostly from African Americans \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/lawsuit-challenges-000-stalled-georgia-voter-registrations/PK3tylRO9Z1ICNzDcH0FyH/\">were revealed to have stalled</a> less than a month before election day.</p> \n<p><em>\u201c</em>We saw an implementation of almost every possible iteration of voter suppression,\u201d Abrams says. \u201cYes, we became an incubator, but we also became a singularity where almost every one of those pieces [of suppression] was implemented by the person who would go on to become governor of the state.\u201d</p> \n<p>Abrams accepts she cannot prove empirically that these policies altered the election outcome. But she also refuses to rule it out, and she has not formally conceded the election, a move Kemp\u2019s campaign branded \u201ca disgrace to democracy\u201d. It is a slur she shrugs off as hypocritical posturing. Kemp, privately educated and wealthy, is to her a representative of the sort of conservative, white patriarchal power she has spent much of her career fighting against.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"829980842a062019fe5d90568931f045f4f7dce3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/829980842a062019fe5d90568931f045f4f7dce3/0_0_4089_2725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attendees look at a laptop computer during an election night watch party for Stacey Abrams, Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, not pictured, in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attendees look at a laptop computer during an election night watch party for Stacey Abrams in Atlanta, Georgia on Tuesday, November 6th 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin D.

The president even appeared with Kemp during the 2018 campaign and reiterated a number of the conservative attacks on Abrams: that she had encouraged undocumented migrants to vote, would support widespread firearms confiscation, and was at the helm of a \u201cradical\u201d agenda across other areas of public life.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless Abrams\u2019 success at mobilizing a progressive base means that many observers now see Georgia, a Democratic stronghold until the late 90s, as a swing state once again.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe galvanized the most Democratic voters we\u2019ve ever seen in Georgia,\u201d says Tharon Johnson, a veteran Democratic strategist in the state. \u201cShe was able to get a lot of sporadic voters who historically don\u2019t come out in gubernatorial races, to turn out.

She appeared on TV news, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, alongside the city\u2019s first black mayor, Maynard Jackson, where the two sparred over Atlanta\u2019s policing tactics. Jackson later gave Abrams her maiden job in politics as a research assistant for the city.</p> \n<p>It was also at Spelman that Abrams begin to organize her life into a series of formal goals. Spurred by a romantic breakup at the time, she started entering her ambitions into a spreadsheet. By 24, she aimed to write a bestselling spy novel. By 30, she would become a millionaire. And at 35, the mayor of Atlanta. Her goals shifted over time \u2013 she published eight romance novels rather than spy novels, and she was elected to the Georgia house of representatives in 2007.</p> \n<p>\u201cStacey has always been very, very direct,\u201d says her youngest sister, Jeanine Abrams McLean. \u201cShe always had plans and knows what she wants to do and develops plans to make sure it gets done.\u201d</p> \n<p>As leader of the Democratic minority, Abrams earned bipartisan respect for her practical approach to governance..</p> \n<p>\u201cShe may be the most brilliant woman or person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d says Allen Peake, a former Georgia house Republican who supported Kemp in 2018. \u201cShe is incredibly intelligent, incredibly quick on her feet, incredibly well prepared for every political battle she enters.\u201d</p> \n<p>Peake mentions the time Abrams rallied Democrats to support a medical marijuana bill he worked on, as well as numerous GOP budgets passed with her support. \u201cShe was very pragmatic,\u201d he says.

Some of her closest friends and mentors declined to back her bid. Their message was blunt: Georgia was not ready to elect a black woman to high office. Abrams almost dropped out of the primary after one close mentor, who she does not name, declined to support her.</p> \n<p>\u201cI became more and more afraid, reluctant to do the work of campaigning because I didn\u2019t want to pick up the phone and hear another person I admired tell me my skin color and gender would be my undoing,\u201d she writes in the book, which was published before last year\u2019s election.</p> \n<p>Even though she is pouring her energy into fighting voting suppression, and has been touted as a potential running mate for Joe Biden, those feelings are still \u201cdevastating\u201d. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt remains a reason that I have people I thought were friends that I acknowledge now weren\u2019t true friendships. A number of them came back after I won the primary, but it\u2019s a conversation that helped me understand that this is not simply a trope held by those who oppose me as a Democrat. It was a trope held by those who just didn\u2019t believe in the capacity of communities of color to hold power.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Democrats are hoping to win back the mostly white voters who swung to Trump in 2016, yet Abrams argues that embracing ostracized communities of color is essential.</p> \n<p>\u201cIdentity politics is good politics for Democrats,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is not possible to win and to build the coalitions we need to build by only talking to those we\u2019ve talked to before.\u201d</p> \n<p>Abrams laughs a little awkwardly when asked if she has been approached by any of the candidates. \u201cNo one has rung my phone yet.\u201d But she remains open. \u201cI think it would be fantastic to be invited to be someone\u2019s running mate, but you can\u2019t plan your life around someone else\u2019s wishes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Abrams still maintains those spreadsheets she started writing back at university. She last updated one in February of this year. She struck off \u201cGovernor of Georgia by 2018\u201d from the list, and updated it to include her forthcoming work on voting rights.</p> \n<p>But she didn\u2019t touch one goal that has been on there for years : president of the United States by 2028. \u201cIt\u2019s still on there, but for later,\u201d she says.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>To contact the Guardian\u2019s voting rights team, email <a href=\"mailto:votingrights@theguardian.com\">votingrights@theguardian.com</a></p></li> \n</ul>",

      "bodyText": "One year ago, at an election night party in downtown Atlanta, Stacey Abrams took the stage and delivered a speech that could well have been made 60 years ago, when this city was known as the cradle of the civil rights movement. \u201cDemocracy only works when we work for it. When we fight for it. When we demand it,\u201d she said, the microphone peaking under the power of her voice. \u201cIn a civilized nation, the machinery of democracy should work for everyone, everywhere. Not just in certain places. And not just on a certain day.\u201d Abrams was then the Democratic candidate for Georgia governor, attempting to become the country\u2019s first black female state executive. The race captivated America not only for its potential to make history. It also dredged up the country\u2019s darkest past. African Americans in the deep south were once disenfranchised with literacy tests and other racist laws, and in recent years a surge in restrictive voting legislation, including voter identification laws and sweeping electoral roll purges, has ushered in an era described by some as a neo-Jim Crow. Abrams did not win that night. Her opponent, the Trump-endorsed Republican Brian Kemp, eventually edged to victory by a thin, 55,000-vote margin. Abrams believes that voter suppression played a central role, which has led her to her next chapter: she has announced that for the next year, she will lead a nationwide voting rights campaign.

Abrams\u2019 home state of Georgia is an incubator for these new suppression tactics, and Kemp, her opponent last year, is a primary instigator. Beginning in 2010, he served as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, overseeing voting and elections, and controversially declined to step down from the post while he ran for governor, meaning he effectively oversaw his own election. Since the landmark supreme court decision, which allowed states to impose new voting laws without federal approval, Georgia has enacted a swath of voter suppression laws, from rapidly purging the voter rolls of those deemed inactive, to the closure of hundreds of polling places, often in poorer black neighbourhoods. It introduced a new law terminating voter registration four weeks before the 2018 election day, preventing an estimated 87,000 people from voting. The state also introduced a controversial \u201cexact match\u201d law requiring that details on new voter applications match precisely with government-issued documents \u2013 meaning an errant hyphen or a changed married name can block the registration process. This system proved contentious last year after 53,000 applications \u2013 mostly from African Americans \u2013 were revealed to have stalled less than a month before election day. \u201cWe saw an implementation of almost every possible iteration of voter suppression,\u201d Abrams says. \u201cYes, we became an incubator, but we also became a singularity where almost every one of those pieces [of suppression] was implemented by the person who would go on to become governor of the state.\u201d Abrams accepts she cannot prove empirically that these policies altered the election outcome. But she also refuses to rule it out, and she has not formally conceded the election, a move Kemp\u2019s campaign branded \u201ca disgrace to democracy\u201d. It is a slur she shrugs off as hypocritical posturing. Kemp, privately educated and wealthy, is to her a representative of the sort of conservative, white patriarchal power she has spent much of her career fighting against. \u201cBrian Kemp is emblematic of what is happening across this country, which is that a community that has enjoyed a certain hegemony finds their control of power weakening,\u201d she says. Critics have leveled the same charge at Donald Trump, who himself has spent much of his presidency casting false and inflammatory allegations of widespread illegal voting, the central justification for many voter suppression laws across the country. The president even appeared with Kemp during the 2018 campaign and reiterated a number of the conservative attacks on Abrams: that she had encouraged undocumented migrants to vote, would support widespread firearms confiscation, and was at the helm of a \u201cradical\u201d agenda across other areas of public life. Nonetheless Abrams\u2019 success at mobilizing a progressive base means that many observers now see Georgia, a Democratic stronghold until the late 90s, as a swing state once again. \u201cShe galvanized the most Democratic voters we\u2019ve ever seen in Georgia,\u201d says Tharon Johnson, a veteran Democratic strategist in the state. \u201cShe was able to get a lot of sporadic voters who historically don\u2019t come out in gubernatorial races, to turn out. She went to low-propensity voters \u2013 folks that have moved or maybe fell off the voting rolls. I think the operation and apparatus she built then will be used to help elect a Democrat [next year].\u201d \u2018She always had plans and knows what she wants to do\u2019 Abrams began to find her own political voice in the early 1990s, while studying at the historically black Spelman College in Atlanta. She led organizing efforts when an unarmed black man, Rodney King, was assaulted by Los Angeles police in 1991. She appeared on TV news, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, alongside the city\u2019s first black mayor, Maynard Jackson, where the two sparred over Atlanta\u2019s policing tactics. Jackson later gave Abrams her maiden job in politics as a research assistant for the city. It was also at Spelman that Abrams begin to organize her life into a series of formal goals. Spurred by a romantic breakup at the time, she started entering her ambitions into a spreadsheet. By 24, she aimed to write a bestselling spy novel. By 30, she would become a millionaire. And at 35, the mayor of Atlanta. Her goals shifted over time \u2013 she published eight romance novels rather than spy novels, and she was elected to the Georgia house of representatives in 2007. \u201cStacey has always been very, very direct,\u201d says her youngest sister, Jeanine Abrams McLean. \u201cShe always had plans and knows what she wants to do and develops plans to make sure it gets done.\u201d As leader of the Democratic minority, Abrams earned bipartisan respect for her practical approach to governance.. \u201cShe may be the most brilliant woman or person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d says Allen Peake, a former Georgia house Republican who supported Kemp in 2018. \u201cShe is incredibly intelligent, incredibly quick on her feet, incredibly well prepared for every political battle she enters.\u201d Peake mentions the time Abrams rallied Democrats to support a medical marijuana bill he worked on, as well as numerous GOP budgets passed with her support. \u201cShe was very pragmatic,\u201d he says. Even so, he remains critical of her 2018 platform, which he characterizes as \u201cradical\u201d. Kemp\u2019s tenure as governor, meanwhile, has proved disastrous for progressive causes in the state, among the most rapidly diversifying in the country. He signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in America and has refused to expand healthcare provisions, despite polling indicating a majority of Georgians disapproved of both decisions. Abrams describes this as a \u201ctyranny of the minority\u201d \u2013 suppressing the vote, she argues, has led to the suppression of the views of the majority. \u2018It is not possible to win by only talking to those we\u2019ve talked to before\u2019 There is an arresting passage in Abrams\u2019 autobiography, Lead from the Outside, describing the doubts she battled as she announced her gubernatorial candidacy. Some of her closest friends and mentors declined to back her bid. Their message was blunt: Georgia was not ready to elect a black woman to high office. Abrams almost dropped out of the primary after one close mentor, who she does not name, declined to support her. \u201cI became more and more afraid, reluctant to do the work of campaigning because I didn\u2019t want to pick up the phone and hear another person I admired tell me my skin color and gender would be my undoing,\u201d she writes in the book, which was published before last year\u2019s election. Even though she is pouring her energy into fighting voting suppression, and has been touted as a potential running mate for Joe Biden, those feelings are still \u201cdevastating\u201d. \u201cIt remains a reason that I have people I thought were friends that I acknowledge now weren\u2019t true friendships. A number of them came back after I won the primary, but it\u2019s a conversation that helped me understand that this is not simply a trope held by those who oppose me as a Democrat. It was a trope held by those who just didn\u2019t believe in the capacity of communities of color to hold power.\u201d The Democrats are hoping to win back the mostly white voters who swung to Trump in 2016, yet Abrams argues that embracing ostracized communities of color is essential. \u201cIdentity politics is good politics for Democrats,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is not possible to win and to build the coalitions we need to build by only talking to those we\u2019ve talked to before.\u201d Abrams laughs a little awkwardly when asked if she has been approached by any of the candidates. \u201cNo one has rung my phone yet.\u201d But she remains open. \u201cI think it would be fantastic to be invited to be someone\u2019s running mate, but you can\u2019t plan your life around someone else\u2019s wishes.\u201d Meanwhile, Abrams still maintains those spreadsheets she started writing back at university. She last updated one in February of this year. She struck off \u201cGovernor of Georgia by 2018\u201d from the list, and updated it to include her forthcoming work on voting rights. But she didn\u2019t touch one goal that has been on there for years : president of the United States by 2028. \u201cIt\u2019s still on there, but for later,\u201d she says.

      "body": "<p>Martin Luther King Jr marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama,<strong> </strong>in 1965 in protest of attempts by white legislators across the south to prevent African Americans from voting. At the time, black people outnumbered white people in Selma but comprised<strong> </strong>only <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/selma-montgomery-march\">2%</a> of the voting rolls.</p> <p>Over 50 years later, King\u2019s cousin, Christine Jordan, then 92 years old, showed up at her polling station in Atlanta, Georgia, to vote in the 2018 midterm election, just as she had in elections for the previous 50 years. But she was told there was no record of her voter registration. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrible, she held civil rights meetings in her home and they had no record of her,\u201d Jessica Lawrence, her granddaughter, <a href=\"https://www.gregpalast.com/92-year-old-georgia-grandmother-purged-from-voter-rolls/\">said</a><a href=\"https://www.gregpalast.com/92-year-old-georgia-grandmother-purged-from-voter-rolls/\"> </a>at the time. </p> <p>Jordan\u2019s troubles were not unusual. Although America prides itself on holding free and fair elections, and the right to vote is enshrined as the foundational principle of its democracy, there is mounting evidence of systemic attempts to prevent growing numbers of Americans from being able to exercise it.</p> <p>Until recently, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ensured that the federal government had oversight of changes to voting systems in those US states that had a history of voting discrimination. But that changed six years ago with a supreme court ruling that gutted the law. It meant that those very same states no longer had to get \u201cpre-clearance\u201d from the federal government for legislation affecting elections and voting processes. In other words, the states with the worst history of voting discrimination were free to revert to something like their previous behavior.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"26feb1a27bd7def017de22a4db06ac2bde4e2889\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26feb1a27bd7def017de22a4db06ac2bde4e2889/0_0_3543_2358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Last-minute voters arrive to cast their vote during Missouri primary voting at Johnson-Wabash Elementary School on March 15, 2016 in Ferguson, Missouri.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last-minute voters arrive to cast their vote during Missouri primary voting at Johnson-Wabash Elementary School on March 15, 2016 in Ferguson, Missouri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael B Thomas/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Brennan Center at New York University \u2013 the foremost non-partisan organization devoted to voting rights and voting reform \u2013 reports that \u201cover the last 20 years, states have put barriers in front of the ballot box \u2013 imposing strict voter ID laws, cutting voting times, restricting registration, and purging voter rolls.

A report released a few months ago by the <a href=\"https://civilrights.org/edfund/\">the Leadership Conference Education Fund</a>, a civil rights organization, revealed that 1,688 polling places have been shut since 2012. These closures have taken place in states with histories of racial discrimination in elections, including 214 precinct closures in Georgia.</p> <p>As Sean Young, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution, \u201cour elections officials are supposed to defend and protect our democracy. Instead, many have been aggressively pushing poll closures in communities of color with phony pretexts.\u201d</p> <p>Ten per cent of Georgia\u2019s counties were left with a single precinct for all voters, with some having to travel miles to cast their votes. Outranking Georgia, Texas had 760 poll closures and Arizona had 320.</p> <p>These poll closures are a direct result of the changes to the Voting Rights Act in 2013 \u2013 previously Georgia was one of nine states that had to get pre-clearance before they shuttered polling stations or made changes to electoral law. That is no longer the case.</p> <h2>Voter purge</h2> <p>And if stricter voter ID laws and the closure of polling booths aren\u2019t sufficient deterrents, there are yet more ways to discourage and suppress the vote. Another method is called a \u201cvoter purge\u201d- and it is precisely what happened to Christine Jordan, King\u2019s cousin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6ce6423c4114ac97022797aa99522356ed08cbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6ce6423c4114ac97022797aa99522356ed08cbe/174_0_1554_1017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Jordan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Jordan, Martin Luther King\u2019s cousin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Palast</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jordan thought she was registered to vote when she went to the polls. She hadn\u2019t changed her residence or her name. Yet she had still been wiped from the rolls, like <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/voter-purge-rates-remain-high-analysis-finds\">17 million other people</a> in the US between 2016 and 2018, according to the Brennan Center.</p> <p>\u201cVoter purging\u201d is when officials scrub names from the voter rolls ostensibly to ensure people don\u2019t vote twice and that people who have died or moved get removed from the rolls. These are perfectly legitimate justifications.</p> <p>Yet it tends to be on the rise, the Brennan Center reported, in areas and states that previously would have been prevented from making such changes by the Voting Rights Act. Places, that is, with a history of voting discrimination.</p> <p>And as the Brennan Center reports, \u201cProblems arise when states remove voters who are still eligible to vote. States rely on faulty data that purport to show that a voter has moved to another state.</p> <p>\u201cOftentimes, these data get people mixed up. In big states like California and Texas, multiple individuals can have the same name and date of birth, making it hard to be sure that the right voter is being purged when perfect data are unavailable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08e08d2cc25eb1388171b6aeceab3ad5f9963a7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08e08d2cc25eb1388171b6aeceab3ad5f9963a7b/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boxes containing mail-in-ballots sit waiting to be sorted at the San Francisco City Hall polling location in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boxes containing mail-in-ballots sit waiting to be sorted at the San Francisco City Hall polling location in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One infamous system, the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck System, has been used by dozens of states since it was introduced in 2005 to search for people who are registered in more than one jurisdiction.

      "bodyText": "Martin Luther King Jr marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965 in protest of attempts by white legislators across the south to prevent African Americans from voting. At the time, black people outnumbered white people in Selma but comprised only 2% of the voting rolls. Over 50 years later, King\u2019s cousin, Christine Jordan, then 92 years old, showed up at her polling station in Atlanta, Georgia, to vote in the 2018 midterm election, just as she had in elections for the previous 50 years. But she was told there was no record of her voter registration. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible, she held civil rights meetings in her home and they had no record of her,\u201d Jessica Lawrence, her granddaughter, said at the time. Jordan\u2019s troubles were not unusual. Although America prides itself on holding free and fair elections, and the right to vote is enshrined as the foundational principle of its democracy, there is mounting evidence of systemic attempts to prevent growing numbers of Americans from being able to exercise it. Until recently, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ensured that the federal government had oversight of changes to voting systems in those US states that had a history of voting discrimination. But that changed six years ago with a supreme court ruling that gutted the law. It meant that those very same states no longer had to get \u201cpre-clearance\u201d from the federal government for legislation affecting elections and voting processes. In other words, the states with the worst history of voting discrimination were free to revert to something like their previous behavior. The Brennan Center at New York University \u2013 the foremost non-partisan organization devoted to voting rights and voting reform \u2013 reports that \u201cover the last 20 years, states have put barriers in front of the ballot box \u2013 imposing strict voter ID laws, cutting voting times, restricting registration, and purging voter rolls. These efforts, which received a boost when the supreme court weakened the Voting Rights Act in 2013, have kept significant numbers of eligible voters from the polls, hitting all Americans, but placing special burdens on racial minorities, poor people, and young and old voters.\u201d The measures these states have introduced, affecting millions of Americans, are designed to suppress the vote, hence the term \u201cvoter suppression\u201d. Such policies not only endanger the gains of the civil rights era, which ushered in the Voting Rights Act, but they also threaten the notion that the United States is at the forefront of western liberal democracies. In an interview last year Barack Obama said, \u201cWe\u2019re the only advanced democracy that deliberately discourages people from voting.\u201d And Carol Anderson, author of One Person No Vote and an adviser on the Guardian\u2019s new voting rights series, wrote in a piece titled Voting While Black that \u201cthe recent spate of whites calling 911 on African Americans for barbecuing while black, waiting in Starbucks while black, sleeping at Yale while black ad nauseam has led to a much-needed discussion about the policing of public spaces. Yet, there\u2019s another important public space where blackness has been policed and we have been far too silent about it: the voting booth. \u201cIn 2016, pummeled by voter suppression in more than 30 states, the black voter turnout plummeted by seven percentage points. For the GOP, that was an effective kill rate. For America, it was a lethal assault on democracy.\u201d This is why today the Guardian is launching The Fight to Vote, a yearlong investigation of the American democratic process and its failures. It will scrutinize compromised electoral systems, give a platform to voices silenced at the polls and reveal how voting suppression is already shaping the 2020 election. Struggle for the franchise The struggle for the right to vote in the US has existed as long as the country itself. In 1789, after the ratification of the constitution, suffrage was extended only to white, property-owning men. Following the abolition of slavery in the 19th century, black people were permitted to vote, but after a brief period when black politicians began to win elections, the white majority began to institute restrictions like those that motivated King\u2019s march from Selma. International comparisons show how voting restrictions are a stain on US democracy. In Australia, voting is compulsory. In Sweden, all voters are automatically registered. Both nations rank high on an \u201celectoral integrity index\u201d produced by academics at Harvard University and the University of Sydney. Yet rather than being ranked with other major western democracies, the US falls lower down the list alongside countries like Kosovo and Romania. Of particular concern in the US, said Sarah Repucci, senior director at Freedom House, a thinktank in Washington DC, \u201care the techniques that target minority (mostly black) voters, instituted by Republican-controlled state governments. Countries that have targeted minority voters include Cameroon, Kosovo \u2013 hardly regimes that Americans would consider to be our peers.\u201d It\u2019s no surprise that the US trails behind other democracies in voter turnout \u2013 about 55% of eligible Americans voted in the 2016 elections, compared with around 87% in Belgium and 78% in South Korea. Partisan officials At every stage of the voting process, Americans face hurdles determined by where they live. Election law is set by partisan state lawmakers and administered, in most places, by secretaries of state, who are partisan officials. In several Republican-leaning states, the difficulties voters face start with the documents they are required to produce in order to exercise their democratic right. Legislators across the country have tightened the requirements for acceptable forms of identification \u2013 this in a country where 7% of Americans do not have photo IDs, and the number is higher among black and Hispanic populations. In 2016, Wisconsin reinstated strict voter ID laws, ostensibly to fight voter fraud, which experts have repeatedly found to be almost non-existent. For this reason, in the run-up to the presidential election, a woman named Anita Johnson traversed three counties in the south-east of the state. She was part of an entire industry of activists trying to get people to the polls. When Johnson, who is an attorney and works with the not-for-profit VoteRiders, made her way through the majority black communities in towns such as Racine and Kenosha, she battled rumors and confusion about what forms of ID people needed to vote. She accompanied them to various government offices to get a driver\u2019s license or helped them find the old address records that they needed to register. It became clear to her that Wisconsin\u2019s policies were discouraging would-be voters. \u201cI\u2019ve done this all year since the 2018 election \u2013 the thing is to not stop,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is going to be a lot of confusion during the 2020 election because not everyone pays attention to democracy like I do.\u201d And not everyone in the state had an activist like Johnson to help them. When Donald Trump eventually won Wisconsin with a 22,000-vote lead, political analysts found that in the city of Milwaukee alone there was a 3% lower turnout, or 41,000 fewer votes cast, than four years before. \u201cThe most serious curtailment to voting rights and turnout in Wisconsin is due to the extreme and restrictive photo voter ID law,\u201d said Jay Heck, director of Common Cause, a non-partisan government accountability group in the state. The same year, 600,000 people in Texas were estimated to lack the IDs needed to vote under the state\u2019s strict guidelines. Virginia put new restrictions on organizations and not-for-profits that were registering people to vote through drives and campaigns. This year, Tennessee sought to make such groups subject to criminal penalties if they make mistakes. \u2018Phony pretexts\u2019 For many Americans, even finding a voting booth presents a formidable challenge. A report released a few months ago by the the Leadership Conference Education Fund, a civil rights organization, revealed that 1,688 polling places have been shut since 2012. These closures have taken place in states with histories of racial discrimination in elections, including 214 precinct closures in Georgia. As Sean Young, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution, \u201cour elections officials are supposed to defend and protect our democracy. Instead, many have been aggressively pushing poll closures in communities of color with phony pretexts.\u201d Ten per cent of Georgia\u2019s counties were left with a single precinct for all voters, with some having to travel miles to cast their votes. Outranking Georgia, Texas had 760 poll closures and Arizona had 320. These poll closures are a direct result of the changes to the Voting Rights Act in 2013 \u2013 previously Georgia was one of nine states that had to get pre-clearance before they shuttered polling stations or made changes to electoral law. That is no longer the case. Voter purge And if stricter voter ID laws and the closure of polling booths aren\u2019t sufficient deterrents, there are yet more ways to discourage and suppress the vote. Another method is called a \u201cvoter purge\u201d- and it is precisely what happened to Christine Jordan, King\u2019s cousin. Jordan thought she was registered to vote when she went to the polls. She hadn\u2019t changed her residence or her name. Yet she had still been wiped from the rolls, like 17 million other people in the US between 2016 and 2018, according to the Brennan Center. \u201cVoter purging\u201d is when officials scrub names from the voter rolls ostensibly to ensure people don\u2019t vote twice and that people who have died or moved get removed from the rolls. These are perfectly legitimate justifications. Yet it tends to be on the rise, the Brennan Center reported, in areas and states that previously would have been prevented from making such changes by the Voting Rights Act. Places, that is, with a history of voting discrimination. And as the Brennan Center reports, \u201cProblems arise when states remove voters who are still eligible to vote. States rely on faulty data that purport to show that a voter has moved to another state. \u201cOftentimes, these data get people mixed up. In big states like California and Texas, multiple individuals can have the same name and date of birth, making it hard to be sure that the right voter is being purged when perfect data are unavailable. One infamous system, the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck System, has been used by dozens of states since it was introduced in 2005 to search for people who are registered in more than one jurisdiction. A 2017 study found that Crosscheck is 99% more likely to purge legitimate rather than inadmissible voters. The authors of the study stated, \u201cWe find that one of Crosscheck\u2019s proposed purging strategies would eliminate about 300 registrations used to cast a seemingly legitimate vote for every one registration used to cast a double vote.\u201d Felon disenfranchisment Weigh up the combined impacts of strict ID laws, poll closures and voter purges and you are still nowhere close to estimating the number of people who are actively deterred from voting in the US. Another approximately 4.7 million Americans are prevented from voting at all. This is the number of convicted felons who have no right to vote, including those incarcerated for grave crimes such as homicide and rape but also encompassing charges including burglary and repeated driving under the influence. Forty-eight states have some form of felon disenfranchisement, but three states \u2013 Iowa, Kentucky and Virginia \u2013 disenfranchise people for life. The impacts are disproportionate: one in 13 African Americans have lost their right to vote as a result, compared with one in 56 non-black voters, according to the Sentencing Project. Jevon Gerrard Stevens, a 42-year-old water treatment plant operator for Miami-Dade county water and sewer department in Florida, was convicted of third-degree grand theft auto in 1998, which resulted in his jailing for three months. He hasn\u2019t been able to vote for 21 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for those that are in power to control the less fortunate, and once you become a convicted felon you fall right into that category,\u201d he said. There are signs, however, of a nationwide change in sentiment. Until recently, Florida had one of the strictest felon disenfranchisement rules in the country. Then, in late 2018, a majority of Floridians voted to return the franchise to felons after they leave prison \u2013 to Stevens\u2019 delight. The move, which has been contested by Republicans, has the potential to restore the vote to 1.4 million people in the state, a not insignificant number considering that the margin between Trump and Hillary Clinton in the last presidential election in Florida was just 1.2 points. Gerrymandering There are numerous other ways politicians and operatives have worked to dilute the power of Americans\u2019 votes. Many states allow gerrymandering, or the drawing of electoral district lines to favor one party by packing voters from another party into as few districts as possible, leaving them with fewer seats after election day. In a remarkable move in July, the supreme court decided not to offer a ruling, in a 5-4 majority decision, on partisan gerrymandering. It was saying, in effect, that it would not find partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional. In an excoriating dissent, Elena Kagan and the court\u2019s liberal justices accused the court\u2019s majority of shirking its duty. \u201cThe partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights: the rights to participate equally in the political process, to join with others to advance political beliefs, and to choose their political representatives.\u201d It is for all the issues cited here that the Guardian has pledged to put the issue of voting rights at the heart of our 2020 coverage. And we are not alone. There is a growing, if still small, movement of people and organizations that are similarly motivated by the need to return the vote to as many Americans as possible.

Paradise is a special place, and I think it\u2019s going to be a new and better place.\u201d</p> <p>The future of Paradise looks promising, town officials such as Zuccolillo say, and will be aided by ongoing support from the state government and a $270m settlement with PG&amp;E, the bankrupt utility whose equipment caused the fire. The utility has also agreed to pay to put the town\u2019s power lines underground. That funding will help pay for expensive projects such as constructing a long-desired sewer system.</p> <p>Zuccolillo, who plans on rebuilding his home in the coming years, expects the town will continue to grow over the next five to 10 years. In the near future, Paradise is focused on clearing out some of the nearly half a million dead trees, and bringing people back.

One year after the deadliest fire in California history tore through Paradise, the town in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada is slowly coming back to life. And its former and current residents are navigating a life for ever changed. Last November, the fast-moving Camp fire forced tens of thousands of people in the town and the surrounding communities of Concow and Magalia to flee. Eighty-five people lost their lives in the inferno. More than 18,000 buildings, including 14,000 homes, were left destroyed. The disaster has been devastating, particularly for those without means. About 90% of Paradise\u2019s population of 27,000 remains dispersed into nearby valley towns and cities across the United States.

      "body": "<p>One of the best offerings on BritBox \u2013 the new archive streaming site officially launched by ITV and the BBC today \u2013 is arguably the greatest single-series British TV drama ever made: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, the 1979 BBC adaptation of John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s espionage novel.</p> <p>But the opening of another digital bank of programming will confront even the most assiduous viewer with a new parody of the children\u2019s counting song \u2013 Netflix, Amazon, Apple, BritBox, Disney, <em>Why</em>?</p> <p>Until sleep and work are abolished, finding time to watch all this stuff is one issue; another the financial outlay of around six pounds a month for each service.</p> <p>When it was announced, after years of delay, BritBox immediately faced two possibly ruinous obstacles. It was coming late to a market that felt owned by Netflix, and, having decided to exclude the multiple original dramas that are Netflix\u2019s prime asset, faced difficulties even in securing rights to old BBC and ITV work, already snapped up by Netflix or Amazon, or available on in-house sites, BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/07/britbox-uk-networks-plan-to-tackle-netflix-amazon-and-apple-tv\">BritBox: 'inappropriate' classic UK TV shows to be kept off service</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A third common objection \u2013 that BBC licence-payers have already paid once for this stuff, so should see it for free \u2013 is preposterous. We cannot expect a single annual payment to confer viewing rights in perpetuity on all platforms, any more than buying a hardback book makes you eligible for a free paperback.</p> <p>Timing feels problematic too. It seems symbolic of the jostling in the sector that Apple TV+ managed to sneak in a week before BritBox. Still, at least the UK players beat Disney.</p> <p>Looking at the initial offering, ITV seems to have brought more to the table than the BBC, with one of the best dramas of 2019 (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/02/a-confession-review-a-profoundly-sad-drama-about-suffering-strength-and-justice\">A Confession</a>, starring Martin Freeman) and one of the most compelling of the past (Broadchurch) advertised as \u201cBritBox Exclusive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f4bd80653c65323ed0c006a7e4df514bc5c6e944\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4bd80653c65323ed0c006a7e4df514bc5c6e944/0_118_3224_1934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Is it really a BritBox Exclusive? ...

Broadchurch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kudos/ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The few BBC exclusives include the comedy Him &amp; Her and the Hilary Mantel adaptation, Wolf Hall. But for the Corporation\u2019s strongest recent work \u2013 Line of Duty, Bodyguard, Call the Midwife, Peaky Blinders \u2013 you still need Netflix.</p> <p>This reflects a disparity in how the UK\u2019s two oldest broadcasters make their shows. While almost all TV fiction is now created by independent producers, ITV owns most of its suppliers, under the ITV Studios umbrella, while the BBC effectively buys limited screening rights from indies who can deal with whichever streamers they want.</p> <p>For this reason, subscribers should look very carefully at the labelling. \u201cNew to BritBox\u201d \u2013 not hard, as it\u2019s only just launched \u2013 means the shows (Absolutely Fabulous, The Trip) can usually be found somewhere else.</p> <p>And on launch day, there were signs of how hard streamlining streaming rights may be. A Confession can be watched on BritBox, ITV Hub and Amazon Prime. All episodes neatly became unavailable on ITV\u2019s own site at 23.59 last night, and were advertised on the newcomer as \u201cBritBox Exclusive.\u201d However, it is still available for purchase on Amazon, although admittedly at a much higher cost.</p> <p>The closest thing to new material is Lambs of God, a 2019 drama from Australia about Catholic nuns. How Brit is that? There will also be a chance to view two episodes of Midsomer Murders before they air on ITV.

      "bodyText": "One of the best offerings on BritBox \u2013 the new archive streaming site officially launched by ITV and the BBC today \u2013 is arguably the greatest single-series British TV drama ever made: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, the 1979 BBC adaptation of John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s espionage novel. But the opening of another digital bank of programming will confront even the most assiduous viewer with a new parody of the children\u2019s counting song \u2013 Netflix, Amazon, Apple, BritBox, Disney, Why? Until sleep and work are abolished, finding time to watch all this stuff is one issue; another the financial outlay of around six pounds a month for each service. When it was announced, after years of delay, BritBox immediately faced two possibly ruinous obstacles. It was coming late to a market that felt owned by Netflix, and, having decided to exclude the multiple original dramas that are Netflix\u2019s prime asset, faced difficulties even in securing rights to old BBC and ITV work, already snapped up by Netflix or Amazon, or available on in-house sites, BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub. A third common objection \u2013 that BBC licence-payers have already paid once for this stuff, so should see it for free \u2013 is preposterous. We cannot expect a single annual payment to confer viewing rights in perpetuity on all platforms, any more than buying a hardback book makes you eligible for a free paperback. Timing feels problematic too. It seems symbolic of the jostling in the sector that Apple TV+ managed to sneak in a week before BritBox. Still, at least the UK players beat Disney. Looking at the initial offering, ITV seems to have brought more to the table than the BBC, with one of the best dramas of 2019 (A Confession, starring Martin Freeman) and one of the most compelling of the past (Broadchurch) advertised as \u201cBritBox Exclusive.\u201d The few BBC exclusives include the comedy Him &amp; Her and the Hilary Mantel adaptation, Wolf Hall. But for the Corporation\u2019s strongest recent work \u2013 Line of Duty, Bodyguard, Call the Midwife, Peaky Blinders \u2013 you still need Netflix. This reflects a disparity in how the UK\u2019s two oldest broadcasters make their shows. While almost all TV fiction is now created by independent producers, ITV owns most of its suppliers, under the ITV Studios umbrella, while the BBC effectively buys limited screening rights from indies who can deal with whichever streamers they want. For this reason, subscribers should look very carefully at the labelling. \u201cNew to BritBox\u201d \u2013 not hard, as it\u2019s only just launched \u2013 means the shows (Absolutely Fabulous, The Trip) can usually be found somewhere else. And on launch day, there were signs of how hard streamlining streaming rights may be. A Confession can be watched on BritBox, ITV Hub and Amazon Prime. All episodes neatly became unavailable on ITV\u2019s own site at 23.59 last night, and were advertised on the newcomer as \u201cBritBox Exclusive.\u201d However, it is still available for purchase on Amazon, although admittedly at a much higher cost. The closest thing to new material is Lambs of God, a 2019 drama from Australia about Catholic nuns. How Brit is that? There will also be a chance to view two episodes of Midsomer Murders before they air on ITV. But as I wouldn\u2019t watch them for free even if ITV paid me, it does not seem much of a lure. Because of the vast past achievements of BBC and ITV, the old material on BritBox already feels better value than the new shows on Apple TV+. As well as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, two more dramatic landmarks \u2013 The Jewel in the Crown and Brideshead Revisited \u2013 are also here, as well as every Doctor Who ever. BritBox will get more interesting, though, when Channel 4 joins next year. But, if the aim was to challenge Netflix, that mission feels impossible \u2013 until and unless British broadcasters can secure exclusive streaming licences for their own shows. As it stands, I\u2019ll happily continue on the 30-day free trial, but have set a reminder to cancel before the \u00a371.88 annual contract kicks in.",

The Jockey Club has said on Thursday that it will \u201ccontinue to respond through the ongoing consultation process\u201d.

And you can\u2019t build more roads there unless you\u2019re going to expropriate 150 properties.\u201d</p> \n<p>Doyle says the next critical stage will be an examination in public of the council\u2019s development plan, before a planning inspector with power to swing things back towards development of Kempton. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a bun-fight of immense proportions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Jockey Club could still get their way. We haven\u2019t seen the whites of anyone\u2019s eyes yet.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Thursday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>Champ is the big name at Newbury today and I\u2019d expect him to make a winning debut over fences, without being at all interested in backing him. He has all that excellent novice hurdle form, of course, and looks like he should make a chaser. He comes from the Nicky Henderson yard that so often fares well at this track, which is just down the road from Seven Barrows.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, taking odds-on about a horse that has never jumped a fence in public is not my idea of a good time and it\u2019s worth noting that this is much more competitive than any beginners chase has a right to be. In the three years that this race has been going, the favourite has yet to win and the beaten horses include Lostintranslation and Topofthegame.</p> \n<p>Henderson\u2019s <strong>Diablo De Rouhet (3.10)</strong> makes more betting appeal at 3-1 in the Pertemps qualifier. This youngster is two from three over fences since joining the yard in the summer and this looks like a canny attempt to exploit a handicap mark which looks pretty beatable in light of the improvement he\u2019s been showing. That said, Venetia Williams has the second-favourite in Geordie B and she seems in good form suddenly.</p> \n<p>You can get 7-1 about <strong>Air Navigator (3.40)</strong> in the following handicap chase, which isn\u2019t bad, considering he won on his reappearance last year. He was well treated for his chasing debut that time, of course, but he has since suggested several times that this rating would be beatable when things fall right. Tom George\u2019s yard is going well and this one had a wind op over the summer.</p> \n<p>At similar odds, I\u2019ll give a chance to <strong>Oxwich Bay (3.50)</strong> at the end of Market Rasen\u2019s card. He\u2019s dropped to a handy rating and ran well until failing to stay three miles last time.</p> \n<p><strong>Starplex (1.15)</strong> is interesting in the Sedgefield opener, his rating having crashed during his time with another yard. Now that he\u2019s back with Keith Dalgleish and all the sharper for a run on the Flat, he could be ready for his first hurdles win since April 2017. Everyone seems to know this, however, as he is 6-4 from the opening 3s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e7642457-48c0-4a5e-84f2-13bb23e85ca1\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Newbury</b>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>12.55 </b>Our Merlin <b>1.30</b> Sir Valentine <b>2.05</b> Champ <b>2.35</b> Floressa <b>3.10 </b>Diablo De Rouhet <b>3.40</b> Air Navigator <b>4.15 </b>Cadzand&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Market Rasen</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>1.05</b> Notre Pari <b>1.40</b> Who\u2019s The Boss <b>2.15 </b>The Bay Birch <b>2.45</b> Ballyhome <b>3.20</b> Ask Paddy <b>3.50</b> Oxwich Bay&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Sedgefield&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>1.15</b> Starplex (nb) <b>1.50</b> Beechwood Jude <b>2.25</b> Late Date <b>2.55</b> New Frontier <b>3.30</b> Mah Mate Bob <b>4.00</b> Darlyn&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Chelmsford</b>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>4.25</b> Bullfinch <b>4.55</b> Great Image (nap) <b>5.25</b> Silver Machine <b>5.55</b> Dubai Warrior <b>6.25</b> Omran <b>6.55</b> The Gill Brothers <b>7.25</b> Three Little Birds <b>7.55</b> Flora Tristan&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Southwell</b>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>4.40</b> Ventura Destiny <b>5.10</b> Filbert Street <b>5.40 </b>Royal Context <b>6.10</b> Erissimus Maximus <b>6.40</b> I\u2019ll Be Good <b>7.10</b> Al Erayg <b>7.40</b> Geography Teacher <b>8.10</b> Blyton Lass&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Social media apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat have also been noted as important sites from which people get their news. Further, private groups within such apps are often a key point of news consumption for many individuals. The often ever-present smartphone has created a channel of constant access to an infinite number of news sources and we want to know which of these sources you use the most. How to contribute We are interested in hearing about all the different areas from where you find your news stories. Where do you get your news from? We would like to know where key conversations are happening, both within and away from the traditional media. Where on the internet do you find your main sources of news? Do you listen to podcasts? Do you use social media applications such as Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat? If so, are you part of any private groups in which important discussions are happening and what sort of things are being shared? Do such conversations have an impact on your overall attitudes? Do you notice changing habits in your parents or among your children in the last few years? Alternatively, perhaps you prefer to use a specific independent journalism organisation for your news? If this is the case, then which one do you use? Finally, where do your family members of varying ages access their news - are there cross-generational differences? To get in touch you can fill in the encrypted form below, anonymously if you wish. You can also get in touch via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. Leave contact details if you can as one of our journalists may be in touch to discuss further. If you\u2019re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.",

In the eastern state of Thuringia, where the CDU was beaten into third place by the openly xenophobic Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) at state elections last month, 17 politicians from the party have written a letter calling for lifting the cordon sanitaire around the far-right outfit. The letter, which does not mention the AfD by name, demands a readiness for coalition talks with \u201call democratically elected parties\u201d \u2013 a breach of the CDU\u2019s official party line.

The wrangle over principles and power in the eastern state is part of a wider free-for-all in the party that has governed Germany for 17 out of 24 postwar terms, facilitated by Merkel\u2019s relative absence from the hubbub of domestic politics and her designated successor\u2019s struggle to build a profile. CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer was once seen as Merkel\u2019s successor-in-waiting but has struggled to make her mark, even after taking over the defence ministry in July, not least because her mentor\u2019s support for her policy initiatives has remained lukewarm at best.

      "bodyText": "Heineken is ditching single-use plastic rings and shrink wrap from millions of multipack cans and replacing them with eco-friendly cardboard. The Dutch company has invested \u00a322m in new technology and production facilities at its UK sites that will enable it to start rolling out the changes across its popular brands , which include Heineken and Foster\u2019s, from April 2020. The can \u201ctoppers\u201d are made from recyclable cardboard and are strong enough to carry the weight of a multipack. Their adoption by Heineken in the UK will lead to 517 tonnes of plastic being removed from the packaging of its brands by the end of 2021. The changes will be rolled out first across Heineken, Foster\u2019s and Kronenbourg 1664, then all its other brands in multipack cans, such as Strongbow, Bulmer\u2019s, Red Stripe and John Smith\u2019s, by the end of 2021. Plastic pack rings, known in the industry as hi-cones or yokes, are used to hold together multipacks of canned drinks, particularly beer. A standard packaging device for more than 50 years, they have contributed to growing plastic pollution in the oceans and pose a major threat to marine life. The UK is the first of the brewer\u2019s 190 world markets to introduce the new packaging. In the UK it produces 530m cans across all its brands every year, of which Foster\u2019s accounts for 150m and Heineken 39.5m. Cindy Tervoort, the head of marketing at Heineken, said: \u201cIt\u2019s what our customers want and expect, and we have been working on and testing this innovation for three years.\u201d Manufacturers and supermarkets have been taking action amid a growing public backlash over plastic packaging after the BBC One\u2019s Blue Planet II series highlighted marine litter. A spokeswoman for the Marine Conservation Society said: \u201cThis is an interesting development [from Heineken] and will help cut down the amount of plastic on our beaches and in our seas. These kinds of can yokes are regularly found on our beach cleans.\u201d Last year, in a quest to find an alternative, Carlsberg announced plans to replace rings with recyclable glue. Diageo has started phasing out plastic packaging from multipacks of its Guinness, Harp, Rockshore and Smithwick\u2019s beers and replacing it with cardboard packs. In September, Budweiser said it was removing single-use plastic pack rings from its entire range of UK-produced beer \u2013 which include the bestselling brands Stella Artois, Budweiser and Bud Light \u2013 by the end of 2020. Heineken said its introduction of eco-friendly materials will cut the carbon emissions associated with producing multipack cans by one third.",

      "body": "<p>Tasnim Lowe was 16 months old when she was found under the apple tree where her father had left her, wrapped in a blanket. Behind her, the house in Telford, Shropshire, where her mother, aunt and grandparents lived was on fire and would soon be totally gutted. Her 16-year-old mother, Lucy, who was pregnant again, her 17-year-old aunt, Sarah, and their mother, Linda, were killed; Lowe\u2019s grandfather, George, managed to escape.</p> <p>The following year, 2001, Lowe\u2019s father, Azhar Ali Mehmood, was convicted of three charges of murder and one of attempted murder. Eighteen years on, he is seeking parole, with a hearing likely to take place in the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>The case \u2013 and Lowe\u2019s attempts to understand why her father committed such a crime \u2013 is now the subject of three powerful BBC Three films. Made over more than a year, the series follows Lowe as she uncovers the horrific truth about her parents\u2019 \u201crelationship\u201d.</p> <p>We meet at her flat in Telford. Lowe is small and slight and looks younger than 20. But when she speaks, she is so articulate and independent that she seems older. There is a tiny hint of a burn scar just above her cheekbone. Doing the documentary, she says, \u201cdid take a toll on my mental health because [I had] to take in so much information, and process it \u2026 Now I can look back on what I learned and understand it better.\u201d She smiles. \u201cBut at the time it was terrible.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, Lowe was contacted by the Mirror journalist Geraldine McKelvie, who was investigating child sexual exploitation (CSE) rings operating in Telford at the time Lowe\u2019s family were killed. Lowe\u2019s mother\u2019s case seemed to fit the pattern \u2013 she was 13 when she met Mehmood, a taxi driver nearly 10 years older than her, and 14 when she became pregnant. Chillingly, other girls in Telford had told McKelvie that, at the time, Lucy\u2019s murder was used as a threat against speaking out. This was all new to Lowe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08f37a791930057c230aef0eccc769acc353e463\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08f37a791930057c230aef0eccc769acc353e463/0_0_4177_5610/745.jpg\" alt=\"Tasnim, aged three, with her grandfather, George, who cared for her after her mother was killed.\" width=\"745\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tasnim, aged three, with her grandfather, George, who cared for her after her mother was killed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That story led to this BBC documentary. Making it, she says, \u201cwas good, because I wanted to know everything I possibly could about the case. But at times, there were things that I couldn\u2019t \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cCertain things I still can\u2019t get over.\u201d</p> <p>She means details about the relationship between her parents. Miraculously, during the filming, the police handed back Lucy\u2019s diaries \u2013 Lowe had not known they existed. In them, Lucy had written about going to a place notoriously used by grooming rings and performing sex acts on older men.</p> <p>Yet there was also some comfort in the new information. Lowe was raised by her grandfather (although she also lived with other family members and was in foster care for a few years as a teenager). This was a man who had lost his wife and both daughters, who suddenly had a baby to look after. \u201cMy granddad tried his best,\u201d she says and \u201cgrowing up with him was really good, but I didn\u2019t really understand why he was always unhappy. If you met him, you can tell that he\u2019s had a lot of hurt in his life. So it was interesting learning about what type of person he was [before], with his family, being so bubbly and happy. I feel like it\u2019s brought me and him closer.\u201d</p> <p>Lowe was too young to remember anything of her mum. All she had while she was growing up were a few photos, a bit burnt and crumbling. There was just one of the mother and daughter together. She doesn\u2019t remember ever being told what had happened, but she grew up with some knowledge of the facts \u2013 that her father had killed her mother, aunt and grandmother. \u201cAll I remember was that my mum was in heaven and my dad was far away. And that my dad wasn\u2019t a nice person.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>She knew people had said that her parents\u2019 relationship \u201cwas a bit iffy\u201d but she never gave their age gap much thought. \u201cBut obviously as I\u2019ve got to understand CSE [child sexual exploitation] better, I\u2019ve understood that there is a big difference. I was told a completely different story \u2013 I was taught that they were in a relationship and they were not.\u201d</p> <p>How did that feel? \u201cWe still don\u2019t know everything that went on,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we do know is pretty terrible, so it\u2019s been hard.\u201d She talks in the film about the pain of knowing she was conceived within an abusive relationship: \u201cI have a bad feeling towards myself \u2026 and it\u2019s really not nice thinking of yourself like that.\u201d</p> <p>There is a powerful moment in the film when Lowe challenges her grandfather about why he didn\u2019t try to do more to stop Lucy seeing Mehmood. She is torn, she says. \u201cI get really angry about it,\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t want him to feel any worse than he already does. I didn\u2019t want to seem like the bad person, but at the same time I really needed him to realise what he did wrong. To acknowledge it. I think he has.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5eedc1ee85b58b13da24c3723e163a48e58439fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eedc1ee85b58b13da24c3723e163a48e58439fc/0_0_4282_2858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lowe in a memorial garden for her mother, aunt and grandmother.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lowe in a memorial garden for her mother, aunt and grandmother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Slater King/BBC/Expectation Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does she still feel angry? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. In 2000, people didn\u2019t really understand CSE or grooming, she says. And he was far from the only one whose lack of action seems astonishing in hindsight. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t right with how Linda was or how the police were, or social services or Lucy\u2019s school or anyone. I think he\u2019s learned and the rest of society have learned and hopefully now we can improve on how we tackle it.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy, she says, was failed in the way that thousands of girls who were victims of child-grooming gangs were with such catastrophic results. \u201cPeople knew what was happening, but they just didn\u2019t care enough or they just pass the blame on. So it\u2019s upsetting, not just the fact that I\u2019ve lost my mum, and my granddad\u2019s lost his daughters and his wife and the whole life that he used to have, it\u2019s also upsetting because this is just one case out of thousands.\u201d Unsurprisingly, she says: \u201cI had a lot of distrust in systems and authorities because of this.\u201d</p> <p>At secondary school, people started to find out what had happened to Lowe\u2019s family, forcing her to confront other people\u2019s vehement reactions to her personal tragedy. She did have close friends who were supportive, but \u201cpretty much all my friends have a set view on my dad or my mum, so there\u2019s a lot of strong opinions.\u201d These days, she says with a small laugh, when people ask about her family: \u201cI\u2019m just like \u2018Google me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Growing up, she had some contact with Mehmood\u2019s family. \u201cThere was a time in my life where I wanted to understand that side of my family, my culture and my dad\u2019s religion and things.\u201d When she met them, they rarely talked about Mehmood, and never about his crime. \u201cThey\u2019d tell me things about the Qur\u2019an and about my grandparents, my aunties and uncles and my cousins, and my distant family members that were in Pakistan.\u201d</p> <p>Astonishingly, when Lowe was 16, she went to visit her father in prison \u2013 the first time she had any contact with him. Why did she want to meet him? \u201cCuriosity,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to form [my own] opinions, to do with the situation but also separate from that. Because, I could have \u2026\u201d She pauses and says it is not likely to happen at the moment, \u201cbut I could have had a relationship with him, if I got to know him as a person. So that\u2019s why I wanted to meet him \u2013 to see if we could move past it.\u201d</p> <p>Did she get what she wanted? \u201cNot really. You know when politicians answer questions, they don\u2019t really answer it \u2013 it was like that.\u201d I find it difficult to comprehend how she could consider building a relationship, but unless you are the child born into an abusive relationship it must be impossible to understand the complexity. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a bit confused.

      "bodyText": "Tasnim Lowe was 16 months old when she was found under the apple tree where her father had left her, wrapped in a blanket. Behind her, the house in Telford, Shropshire, where her mother, aunt and grandparents lived was on fire and would soon be totally gutted. Her 16-year-old mother, Lucy, who was pregnant again, her 17-year-old aunt, Sarah, and their mother, Linda, were killed; Lowe\u2019s grandfather, George, managed to escape. The following year, 2001, Lowe\u2019s father, Azhar Ali Mehmood, was convicted of three charges of murder and one of attempted murder. Eighteen years on, he is seeking parole, with a hearing likely to take place in the next couple of weeks. The case \u2013 and Lowe\u2019s attempts to understand why her father committed such a crime \u2013 is now the subject of three powerful BBC Three films. Made over more than a year, the series follows Lowe as she uncovers the horrific truth about her parents\u2019 \u201crelationship\u201d. We meet at her flat in Telford. Lowe is small and slight and looks younger than 20. But when she speaks, she is so articulate and independent that she seems older. There is a tiny hint of a burn scar just above her cheekbone. Doing the documentary, she says, \u201cdid take a toll on my mental health because [I had] to take in so much information, and process it \u2026 Now I can look back on what I learned and understand it better.\u201d She smiles. \u201cBut at the time it was terrible.\u201d Last year, Lowe was contacted by the Mirror journalist Geraldine McKelvie, who was investigating child sexual exploitation (CSE) rings operating in Telford at the time Lowe\u2019s family were killed. Lowe\u2019s mother\u2019s case seemed to fit the pattern \u2013 she was 13 when she met Mehmood, a taxi driver nearly 10 years older than her, and 14 when she became pregnant. Chillingly, other girls in Telford had told McKelvie that, at the time, Lucy\u2019s murder was used as a threat against speaking out. This was all new to Lowe. That story led to this BBC documentary. Making it, she says, \u201cwas good, because I wanted to know everything I possibly could about the case. But at times, there were things that I couldn\u2019t \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cCertain things I still can\u2019t get over.\u201d She means details about the relationship between her parents. Miraculously, during the filming, the police handed back Lucy\u2019s diaries \u2013 Lowe had not known they existed. In them, Lucy had written about going to a place notoriously used by grooming rings and performing sex acts on older men. Yet there was also some comfort in the new information. Lowe was raised by her grandfather (although she also lived with other family members and was in foster care for a few years as a teenager). This was a man who had lost his wife and both daughters, who suddenly had a baby to look after. \u201cMy granddad tried his best,\u201d she says and \u201cgrowing up with him was really good, but I didn\u2019t really understand why he was always unhappy. If you met him, you can tell that he\u2019s had a lot of hurt in his life. So it was interesting learning about what type of person he was [before], with his family, being so bubbly and happy. I feel like it\u2019s brought me and him closer.\u201d Lowe was too young to remember anything of her mum. All she had while she was growing up were a few photos, a bit burnt and crumbling. There was just one of the mother and daughter together. She doesn\u2019t remember ever being told what had happened, but she grew up with some knowledge of the facts \u2013 that her father had killed her mother, aunt and grandmother. \u201cAll I remember was that my mum was in heaven and my dad was far away. And that my dad wasn\u2019t a nice person.\u201d She knew people had said that her parents\u2019 relationship \u201cwas a bit iffy\u201d but she never gave their age gap much thought. \u201cBut obviously as I\u2019ve got to understand CSE [child sexual exploitation] better, I\u2019ve understood that there is a big difference. I was told a completely different story \u2013 I was taught that they were in a relationship and they were not.\u201d How did that feel? \u201cWe still don\u2019t know everything that went on,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we do know is pretty terrible, so it\u2019s been hard.\u201d She talks in the film about the pain of knowing she was conceived within an abusive relationship: \u201cI have a bad feeling towards myself \u2026 and it\u2019s really not nice thinking of yourself like that.\u201d There is a powerful moment in the film when Lowe challenges her grandfather about why he didn\u2019t try to do more to stop Lucy seeing Mehmood. She is torn, she says. \u201cI get really angry about it,\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t want him to feel any worse than he already does. I didn\u2019t want to seem like the bad person, but at the same time I really needed him to realise what he did wrong. To acknowledge it. I think he has.\u201d Does she still feel angry? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. In 2000, people didn\u2019t really understand CSE or grooming, she says. And he was far from the only one whose lack of action seems astonishing in hindsight. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t right with how Linda was or how the police were, or social services or Lucy\u2019s school or anyone. I think he\u2019s learned and the rest of society have learned and hopefully now we can improve on how we tackle it.\u201d Lucy, she says, was failed in the way that thousands of girls who were victims of child-grooming gangs were with such catastrophic results. \u201cPeople knew what was happening, but they just didn\u2019t care enough or they just pass the blame on. So it\u2019s upsetting, not just the fact that I\u2019ve lost my mum, and my granddad\u2019s lost his daughters and his wife and the whole life that he used to have, it\u2019s also upsetting because this is just one case out of thousands.\u201d Unsurprisingly, she says: \u201cI had a lot of distrust in systems and authorities because of this.\u201d At secondary school, people started to find out what had happened to Lowe\u2019s family, forcing her to confront other people\u2019s vehement reactions to her personal tragedy. She did have close friends who were supportive, but \u201cpretty much all my friends have a set view on my dad or my mum, so there\u2019s a lot of strong opinions.\u201d These days, she says with a small laugh, when people ask about her family: \u201cI\u2019m just like \u2018Google me.\u2019\u201d Growing up, she had some contact with Mehmood\u2019s family. \u201cThere was a time in my life where I wanted to understand that side of my family, my culture and my dad\u2019s religion and things.\u201d When she met them, they rarely talked about Mehmood, and never about his crime. \u201cThey\u2019d tell me things about the Qur\u2019an and about my grandparents, my aunties and uncles and my cousins, and my distant family members that were in Pakistan.\u201d Astonishingly, when Lowe was 16, she went to visit her father in prison \u2013 the first time she had any contact with him. Why did she want to meet him? \u201cCuriosity,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to form [my own] opinions, to do with the situation but also separate from that. Because, I could have \u2026\u201d She pauses and says it is not likely to happen at the moment, \u201cbut I could have had a relationship with him, if I got to know him as a person. So that\u2019s why I wanted to meet him \u2013 to see if we could move past it.\u201d Did she get what she wanted? \u201cNot really. You know when politicians answer questions, they don\u2019t really answer it \u2013 it was like that.\u201d I find it difficult to comprehend how she could consider building a relationship, but unless you are the child born into an abusive relationship it must be impossible to understand the complexity. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a bit confused. Because, like, biologically I\u2019m supposed to feel a certain way, so it\u2019s quite difficult \u2026 And the fact that I don\u2019t have my mum with me, so I\u2019ve only got him and my granddad, essentially.\u201d She says she grew up feeling angry at her father, then adds \u201cbut not really angry. I know what my dad did was wrong and terrible. But for a person to do that type of thing \u2013 the sex abuse, the murder, all of that \u2013 there\u2019s got to be a reason why he\u2019s doing that.

City have been the team to beat for two impeccable campaigns now \u2013 last season they added a clean sweep of domestic trophies to their impressive 100-point total in 2017\u201118 \u2013 yet before the overseas money arrived they were even longer in the wilderness between titles, not to mention dropping as low as the third tier of English football.</p> <p>So while this particular two-team hegemony is a new twist at the top of the Premier League, no one quite knows how long it will last and a certain amount of ill-feeling building up over time is what is required to produce memorable set pieces such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/25/match.manchesterunited\" title=\"\">Arsenal\u2019s Battle of the Buffet</a> at Old Trafford or Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s infamous list of facts.</p> <p>Klopp and Pep Guardiola seem to quite like each other. On the evidence of previous meetings mutual admiration is more likely than mischief or mind games and to an extent the same is true of both sets of supporters. There is not much history of grudge or animosity between Liverpool and City fans, even if the former did give <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2018/apr/05/manchester-city-coach-posts-footage-of-attack-on-team-bus-video\" title=\"\">the visitors\u2019 coach a rough ride</a> when the teams met in the Champions League at Anfield two seasons ago. All too plainly their common dislike of Manchester United is greater than any rancorous mistrust of each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee9d79e6e91ad5d50149bdaa4172a62691e86adb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee9d79e6e91ad5d50149bdaa4172a62691e86adb/23_41_1180_708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The managers J\u00fcrgen Klopp, left, and Pep Guardiola seem to quite like each other.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The managers J\u00fcrgen Klopp, left, and Pep Guardiola seem to quite like each other.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What might it take then, to turn the absorbing battle between the best two sides in the country into a fully fledged rivalry, something to be savoured in the present and remembered down the years? It would undoubtedly help for a start were Guardiola and Klopp to stick around for several more seasons.</p> <p>At the moment they are not perceived as permanent fixtures at their clubs; Guardiola especially is expected to continue moving around rather than putting in many more years at the Etihad Stadium and the idea that City and Liverpool have achieved their present levels of excellence by bringing in the best European managers available on a short-term basis is contributing to the feeling that this phase of English football might be a relatively transitory one.</p> <p>Short-term is itself a relative construct \u2013 both managers have been at their clubs for three or four years already and could easily stay much longer \u2013 but it would be a considerable surprise were either to last half as long as Sir Alex Ferguson or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Nothing wrong with that, probably no one is going to manage that sort of longevity in the Premier League again, though as Klopp and Guardiola are undoubtedly wringing the utmost from their respective sets of players it follows they might be hard to replace without a drop in performance.</p> <p>Without attempting to look too far into the future, it is not easy to see how City or Liverpool will be able to carry on seamlessly under different managers and the suspicion that succession problems lie ahead adds to the impression that these two sides may never have it quite so good again.</p> <p>Before all that is worked out, however, another intriguing possibility could take shape. Supposing City were to win the Champions League this season, and Liverpool end their wait for a league title? This was a plausible scenario for much of last season and remains so this time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given City\u2019s frustrations in Europe over the years and Liverpool\u2019s overwhelming desire to see their title total ticking over again, both clubs would be highly satisfied with such an outcome. It is not a binary situation: either City or Liverpool could win both prizes, or end up with one between them or nothing at all, though there would be a pleasing symmetry should last season\u2019s roles be reversed.</p> <p>This mirror-image conclusion would not be a first for English football or even for Liverpool. Bob Paisley\u2019s side won the European Cup in 1978 and the First Division title a year later, while Brian Clough\u2019s Nottingham Forest were European champions in 1979 a season after picking up their first and only English title.</p> <p>While that was not the most long-lasting of rivalries either, it was feisty at the time and the names will never be forgotten. If City and Liverpool can stage some sort of repeat, in the intensified era of the Premier League and the Champions League, it is probably safe to say that history will take due note.</p>",

It is not that Klopp feels the United rivalry particularly keenly \u2013 during his time in England he has never had to encounter a sustained threat from the direction of Old Trafford \u2013 it is more that like everyone else he doubts whether City and Liverpool have been going at it long enough to claim a place at the forefront of this country\u2019s footballing culture. Liverpool have not won a league title for 30 years, and in those circumstances Klopp is understandably wary of claiming his side are at the forefront of anything. City have been the team to beat for two impeccable campaigns now \u2013 last season they added a clean sweep of domestic trophies to their impressive 100-point total in 2017\u201118 \u2013 yet before the overseas money arrived they were even longer in the wilderness between titles, not to mention dropping as low as the third tier of English football. So while this particular two-team hegemony is a new twist at the top of the Premier League, no one quite knows how long it will last and a certain amount of ill-feeling building up over time is what is required to produce memorable set pieces such as Arsenal\u2019s Battle of the Buffet at Old Trafford or Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s infamous list of facts. Klopp and Pep Guardiola seem to quite like each other. On the evidence of previous meetings mutual admiration is more likely than mischief or mind games and to an extent the same is true of both sets of supporters. There is not much history of grudge or animosity between Liverpool and City fans, even if the former did give the visitors\u2019 coach a rough ride when the teams met in the Champions League at Anfield two seasons ago. All too plainly their common dislike of Manchester United is greater than any rancorous mistrust of each other. What might it take then, to turn the absorbing battle between the best two sides in the country into a fully fledged rivalry, something to be savoured in the present and remembered down the years? It would undoubtedly help for a start were Guardiola and Klopp to stick around for several more seasons. At the moment they are not perceived as permanent fixtures at their clubs; Guardiola especially is expected to continue moving around rather than putting in many more years at the Etihad Stadium and the idea that City and Liverpool have achieved their present levels of excellence by bringing in the best European managers available on a short-term basis is contributing to the feeling that this phase of English football might be a relatively transitory one. Short-term is itself a relative construct \u2013 both managers have been at their clubs for three or four years already and could easily stay much longer \u2013 but it would be a considerable surprise were either to last half as long as Sir Alex Ferguson or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Nothing wrong with that, probably no one is going to manage that sort of longevity in the Premier League again, though as Klopp and Guardiola are undoubtedly wringing the utmost from their respective sets of players it follows they might be hard to replace without a drop in performance. Without attempting to look too far into the future, it is not easy to see how City or Liverpool will be able to carry on seamlessly under different managers and the suspicion that succession problems lie ahead adds to the impression that these two sides may never have it quite so good again. Before all that is worked out, however, another intriguing possibility could take shape. Supposing City were to win the Champions League this season, and Liverpool end their wait for a league title? This was a plausible scenario for much of last season and remains so this time. Given City\u2019s frustrations in Europe over the years and Liverpool\u2019s overwhelming desire to see their title total ticking over again, both clubs would be highly satisfied with such an outcome. It is not a binary situation: either City or Liverpool could win both prizes, or end up with one between them or nothing at all, though there would be a pleasing symmetry should last season\u2019s roles be reversed. This mirror-image conclusion would not be a first for English football or even for Liverpool. Bob Paisley\u2019s side won the European Cup in 1978 and the First Division title a year later, while Brian Clough\u2019s Nottingham Forest were European champions in 1979 a season after picking up their first and only English title. While that was not the most long-lasting of rivalries either, it was feisty at the time and the names will never be forgotten. If City and Liverpool can stage some sort of repeat, in the intensified era of the Premier League and the Champions League, it is probably safe to say that history will take due note.",

      "bodyText": "The luxury carmaker Aston Martin Lagonda has slumped to \u00a313m loss over the most recent three months, blaming tough trading conditions in the UK and Europe and weak sales of its Vantage two-seater sports car. The 106-year-old British marque has had a torrid year since floating on the stock market last October with its shares priced at \u00a319, valuing the company at \u00a34.3bn. The shares have since slumped, diving below \u00a34 at one point in August, as sales have fallen amid \u201ccontinuing macro uncertainties\u201d. They were down 3% at 404p at midday, valuing the company at just over \u00a3900m. Aston Martin has pinned its hopes on a \u201csecond century plan\u201d unveiled in 2016, under which it launches seven new cars in seven years. The Vantage, which costs from \u00a3120,900, is the second model in the plan, but sales have been weaker than expected because the two-seater luxury sports car market is in decline. The \u00a313.5m loss in the three months to 30 September compares with a profit of \u00a33.1m a year earlier. Revenues fell 11% to \u00a3250m, as wholesale volumes \u2013 cars sold to dealers \u2013 fell 16% to 1,497 vehicles. Retail sales were down 6%. Over the first nine months of 2019, Aston Martin has now racked up a loss of more than \u00a392m compared with a profit of \u00a324m in the same period of 2018. Andy Palmer, the chief executive, acknowledged that things had not gone as expected. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect the downturn in the market, we didn\u2019t expect the delay of Brexit \u2026 We are working to the plan and DBX is a key part of that plan.\u201d The DBX will be Aston Martin\u2019s first foray into the sports utility vehicle market, and the carmaker hopes it will become its most popular model. It will be unveiled in Beijing later this month, and manufactured at its new St Athan factory in south Wales. The company plans to make up to 5,000 DBXs a year, priced at \u00a3158,000. Palmer said the SUV market was growing globally, and noted that 72% of Aston Martin customers already had an SUV in their garage. They were, he said, \u201can obvious target\u201d. The DBX is also designed to appeal to women in countries such as China and the US, enabling the company to expand away from its traditional male-dominated sports car clientele. The third-quarter results showed revenues in the UK were down 22%. In the Europe, Middle East and Asia region they were down 17%. The Americas grew by 2% and Asia Pacific fell 34%, against strong growth last year when the figures were boosted by the launch of the Vantage and DBS Superleggera. Aston Martin said wholesale volumes would be lower than predicted for 2019 but within the range of City expectations, which came as a relief to investors. The car industry has been hit by falling sales in China, a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies and a slump in diesel sales in Europe. \u201cTough trading conditions, particularly in the UK and Europe, persist,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cWe prepared for Brexit all year and have \u00a315m of stock in our Brexit preparations. We continue to be ready for whatever Brexit throws at us. Our hope is that on the 12 December [after the general election] we\u2019ll have a clearer view what Brexit will look like.\u201d The company was forced to borrow $150m (\u00a3120m) at a hefty interest rate of 12% in September to shore up its finances.

However, the 300-strong workforce at the new St Athan plant is due to double before the start of production of the DBX next spring. The company said that for the first time four Aston Martin cars would feature in the next James Bond film, out next April: the classic DB5 and V8 Saloon, along with the new DBS Superleggera and Valhalla.

      "body": "<p>US rapper, actor and TV host TI has prompted revulsion after he revealed he accompanies his 18-year-old daughter Deyjah Harris to a gynaecological exam each year, for her hymen (and therefore virginity) to be checked \u2013 a practice condemned as \u201chumiliating and traumatic\u201d by the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>The rapper is a major celebrity in the US, where he has had seven Top Five albums, three of them reaching No 1. He has had roles in films including American Gangster, Entourage and the Marvel movie Ant-Man and its sequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp. He is currently appearing alongside Cardi B and Chance the Rapper in Rhythm + Flow, a talent competition on Netflix.</p> <p>Asked on the <a href=\"https://www.podcastone.com/ladies-like-us-with-nazanin-and-nadia\">Ladies Like Us podcast</a> about sex education for his children, he said: \u201cNot only have we had the conversation, we have yearly trips to the gynaecologist to check her hymen. Yes, I go with her \u2026 I will say, as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact.\u201d</p> <p>He acknowledged a woman\u2019s hymen can be broken outside of sexual activity, but countered by saying: \u201cSo then they come and say, \u2018Well, I just want you to know that there are other ways besides sex that the hymen can be broken like bike riding, athletics, horseback riding and just other forms of athletic physical activity\u2019. So I say, \u2018Look, Doc, she don\u2019t ride no horses, she don\u2019t ride no bike, she don\u2019t play no sports. Just check the hymen, please, and give me back my results expeditiously.\u2019\u201d The comments have since been edited out of the podcast.</p> <p>In 2018, virginity tests like these were <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/17-10-2018-united-nations-agencies-call-for-ban-on-virginity-testing\">condemned by three United Nations agencies</a>: the World Health Organisation (WHO), UN Human Rights and UN Women. A statement read: \u201cThis medically unnecessary, and often times painful, humiliating and traumatic practice must end \u2026 WHO states that there is no evidence that either method can prove whether a woman or girl has had vaginal intercourse or not.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, a spokesperson for the New York State Department of Health described the tests as \u201can assault on young women with no scientific or medical basis\u201d.</p> <p>Among hundreds of disgusted tweets reacting to the rapper\u2019s comments, the sexual health nonprofit organisation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PPFA/status/1192187632488472586\">Planned Parenthood tweeted</a>: \u201cIdk who needs to hear this but virginity is a made-up social construct, and it has absolutely nothing to do with your hymen \u2026 Some people think you can tell if someone\u2019s had sex before if their hymen is stretched open. But that\u2019s not the case.\u201d</p> <p>TI and Harris have not commented since the podcast was released, though Harris has liked tweets condemning her father, including one that described his behaviour as \u201cdisgusting, possessive and controlling\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "US rapper, actor and TV host TI has prompted revulsion after he revealed he accompanies his 18-year-old daughter Deyjah Harris to a gynaecological exam each year, for her hymen (and therefore virginity) to be checked \u2013 a practice condemned as \u201chumiliating and traumatic\u201d by the World Health Organisation. The rapper is a major celebrity in the US, where he has had seven Top Five albums, three of them reaching No 1. He has had roles in films including American Gangster, Entourage and the Marvel movie Ant-Man and its sequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp. He is currently appearing alongside Cardi B and Chance the Rapper in Rhythm + Flow, a talent competition on Netflix. Asked on the Ladies Like Us podcast about sex education for his children, he said: \u201cNot only have we had the conversation, we have yearly trips to the gynaecologist to check her hymen. Yes, I go with her \u2026 I will say, as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact.\u201d He acknowledged a woman\u2019s hymen can be broken outside of sexual activity, but countered by saying: \u201cSo then they come and say, \u2018Well, I just want you to know that there are other ways besides sex that the hymen can be broken like bike riding, athletics, horseback riding and just other forms of athletic physical activity\u2019. So I say, \u2018Look, Doc, she don\u2019t ride no horses, she don\u2019t ride no bike, she don\u2019t play no sports. Just check the hymen, please, and give me back my results expeditiously.\u2019\u201d The comments have since been edited out of the podcast. In 2018, virginity tests like these were condemned by three United Nations agencies: the World Health Organisation (WHO), UN Human Rights and UN Women. A statement read: \u201cThis medically unnecessary, and often times painful, humiliating and traumatic practice must end \u2026 WHO states that there is no evidence that either method can prove whether a woman or girl has had vaginal intercourse or not.\u201d Last month, a spokesperson for the New York State Department of Health described the tests as \u201can assault on young women with no scientific or medical basis\u201d. Among hundreds of disgusted tweets reacting to the rapper\u2019s comments, the sexual health nonprofit organisation Planned Parenthood tweeted: \u201cIdk who needs to hear this but virginity is a made-up social construct, and it has absolutely nothing to do with your hymen \u2026 Some people think you can tell if someone\u2019s had sex before if their hymen is stretched open. But that\u2019s not the case.\u201d TI and Harris have not commented since the podcast was released, though Harris has liked tweets condemning her father, including one that described his behaviour as \u201cdisgusting, possessive and controlling\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>The Los Angeles Chargers returned to southern California on Sunday after playing the previous two weeks on the road, but it didn\u2019t make much difference. Home-field advantage doesn\u2019t really apply to the Chargers, not when visiting fans routinely make the team feel like they\u2019re behind enemy lines in their own stadium. That was the case again on Sunday, when the Chargers hosted the Green Bay Packers. The predominant color in the stands was the green of the visitors, and the cheers rang out louder for Aaron Rodgers than Philip Rivers. The home team won, convincingly at that, but most people left the stadium disappointed.</p> <p>It has become one of the peculiar features of the NFL calendar since both the Chargers and Rams relocated to Los Angeles in 2017, marking a reunion between America\u2019s second-largest market and its most popular sporting league: more often than not, the teams\u2019 home games look and sound like home games for the opposition. Chargers players were showered with boos when they took the field against the visiting Philadelphia Eagles two years ago. The Rams got the same treatment last season at home against the Packers. Both Rivers, the Chargers quarterback, and Rams quarterback Jared Goff have regularly been forced to use a silent count to combat the noise generated by the away side\u2019s fans, typically an unnecessary measure to take for a team playing at home.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not ideal,\u201d Rivers said with a hint of resignation after the 2017 game against the Eagles. The home-field hostility hit a fresh apex for both teams on the same Sunday last month. That afternoon, the Rams were overwhelmed on the field and in the stands, which were blanketed by the red of the visiting San Francisco 49ers. \u201cThis turned into a home game pretty quickly,\u201d said San Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo after the game. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t been quite as enjoyable for the ostensible home teams. A few hours later that day, the Chargers hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers, whose fans roared with approval when the stadium PA system blasted their team\u2019s adopted anthem, Renegade by Styx. It was supposed to be a gag; the song eventually transitioned to Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley, the punctuation to a long-running internet prank. But the joke didn\u2019t land, and Chargers players were miffed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/05/los-angeles-chargers-london-move-uk-tottenham-hotspur-uk\">LA Chargers owner: rumor of ground share with Tottenham Hotspur is 'bullshit'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d Chargers running back Melvin Gordon said. \u201cThey started playing [the Steeelers\u2019] theme music. I don\u2019t know what we were doing \u2013 that little soundtrack, what they do on their home games. I don\u2019t know why we played that.\u201d Chargers offensive lineman Forrest Lamp was more blunt: \u201cWe\u2019re used to not having any fans here. It does suck, though, when they\u2019re playing their music in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re the ones at home. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s in charge of that, but they probably should be fired.\u201d</p> <p>The go-to line from Rams and Chargers brass is that it will take time to cultivate a true fan base in Los Angeles. Chargers owner Dean Spanos, who engineered the franchise\u2019s move from San Diego after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/09/beware-the-walking-dead-the-san-diego-chargers-10m-farewell-tour\">voters there rejected his bid for public funding of a new stadium</a>, told the New York Times earlier this year that it will \u201ctake maybe a generation\u201d for the team to find its footing in LA. On Tuesday this week, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/05/los-angeles-chargers-london-move-uk-tottenham-hotspur-uk\">was forced to deny rumors</a> the team has discussed relocating to London.</p> <p>The two Los Angeles teams have varying histories in the city. The Chargers played their inaugural season there in 1960 before decamping for San Diego, where they remained for 56 years. The Rams have deeper roots in Los Angeles, playing in the area for 48 years beginning in 1946. But in 1995, the Rams moved to St Louis and the Raiders went up the coast to Oakland, leaving LA without an NFL franchise.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take us some time to build the fan base back up again,\u201d said Ralph Valdez, the president and founder of the So Cal Rams Booster Club. \u201cThe Rams were gone for 21 years, and there were a lot of people who were left without a team to follow.\u201d</p> <p>Valdez started the group in 2004, when the Rams were just four years removed from winning a Super Bowl in St Louis, but he has been a fan since watching the team as a kid in the 1960s. \u201cOnce I saw the horns on the helmet, I was like, I\u2019m gonna follow them for the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could be in Egypt. That\u2019s still going to be my team.\u201d</p> <p>Both LA teams are currently playing in temporary home stadiums \u2013 the Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the permanent home of the University of Southern California\u2019s football team; the Chargers at the 27,000-seat Dignity Health Sports Park, which serves as the home for the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer \u2013 before moving to the $5bn SoFi Stadium in the suburb of Inglewood next year. There is hope that the opening of the stadium, which will host the Super Bowl in 2022 and is expected to host the main opening ceremony for the 2028 Summer Olympics, will deepen the bond between the teams and the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f06eabc7e10a56141b6160045ddf81f260da3e06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f06eabc7e10a56141b6160045ddf81f260da3e06/0_237_4694_2818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo described a recent meeting in Los Angeles as a \u2018home game\u2019 for his team\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo described a recent meeting in Los Angeles as a \u2018home game\u2019 for his team. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Locher/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen we get to Inglewood, that\u2019s our home. That\u2019s the Rams\u2019 opportunity to start gathering new fans,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cWhen you have a home, you can build something.\u201d<br>He added: \u201cIn 10 or 15 years, you\u2019re still going to have fans of other teams [in Los Angeles]. But their kids, their grandkids, I would expect them to be Rams fans.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps. But to some outside observers, the recurring sight of away fans swarming Chargers and Rams home games has made the NFL\u2019s return to Los Angeles look frivolous. \u201cZero teams in Los Angeles \u2013 that wasn\u2019t enough. Two\u2019s clearly too many,\u201d said ESPN anchor Scott Van Pelt in a commentary that aired last month. \u201cThere are NFL fans in Los Angeles, plenty of them. Most of them just root for other teams. And they\u2019re going to have a fancy new place to see them play when they come to town.\u201d</p> <p>The Chargers and Rams are not only contending with lost time in their bid to attract fans. With the proliferation of apps like SeatGeek and StubHub, through which customers can easily buy and resell tickets, the away fan takeover has become ubiquitous \u2013 and not just in Los Angeles. Fans of the Minnesota Vikings flooded Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday for the team\u2019s away game against the Kansas City Chiefs, generating as much noise as the home supporters and performing their signature \u201cskol\u201d chant with impunity. New England Patriots fans turned out in droves for the team\u2019s road game last month against Washington; they did the same two weeks later when the Patriots played at the New York Jets. When iconic teams like the Patriots, Steelers, Packers or Dallas Cowboys come to town, whether in Los Angeles or elsewhere, the home fans are always at risk of being outnumbered. Resale ticket prices are an average of 53% higher than a typical game when the Packers are visiting, according to figures provided by SeatGeek. They are 55% higher for Cowboys road games. That can be enticing for a season-ticket holder, looking to resell a ticket.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/barrysvrluga/status/1180880760997322758\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The walk from the Metro to FedEx Field, home of the Washington Redskins. <a href=\"https://t.co/nQJfjTyz8t\">pic.twitter.com/nQJfjTyz8t</a></p>&mdash; Barry Svrluga (@barrysvrluga) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/barrysvrluga/status/1180880760997322758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Johnny Abundez, a member of the Chargers fan group Bolt Pride who lives in the San Diego area, expected Packers fans to account for about 80% of attendees at Sunday\u2019s game, a projection that was easily corroborated both by those at the stadium and those watching on television.</p> <p>\u201cI know Chargers fans who sold cheap seats for $350 to that game,\u201d Abundez said. \u201cI\u2019m not one to judge. I know a lot of Chargers fans who like watching the game on TV.\u201d</p> <p>Abundez said that southern California, with its high concentration of transplants and warm climate, is particularly vulnerable to the away fan takeover. New York Yankees fans turned out en masse for the team\u2019s road trip against the Los Angeles Dodgers in August. And while the Los Angeles Clippers are NBA contenders now, the team\u2019s home games have long attracted throngs of visiting fans. It happened frequently to the Chargers in San Diego, too. \u201cSan Diego is a military community,\u201d Abundez said. \u201cAnd once it gets to this time of the year, you see snow and rain in the Midwest and on the East Coast, and we have beautiful weather out here.\u201d</p> <p>For Valdez, however, the secondary ticket market has been a source of frustration. His Rams group encourages members to sell to supporters of the home team.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand people who call themselves Rams fans and who are selling their tickets to make a premium,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cWe tell them that if they\u2019re going to sell them, sell them to Rams fans.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Los Angeles Chargers returned to southern California on Sunday after playing the previous two weeks on the road, but it didn\u2019t make much difference. Home-field advantage doesn\u2019t really apply to the Chargers, not when visiting fans routinely make the team feel like they\u2019re behind enemy lines in their own stadium. That was the case again on Sunday, when the Chargers hosted the Green Bay Packers. The predominant color in the stands was the green of the visitors, and the cheers rang out louder for Aaron Rodgers than Philip Rivers. The home team won, convincingly at that, but most people left the stadium disappointed. It has become one of the peculiar features of the NFL calendar since both the Chargers and Rams relocated to Los Angeles in 2017, marking a reunion between America\u2019s second-largest market and its most popular sporting league: more often than not, the teams\u2019 home games look and sound like home games for the opposition. Chargers players were showered with boos when they took the field against the visiting Philadelphia Eagles two years ago. The Rams got the same treatment last season at home against the Packers. Both Rivers, the Chargers quarterback, and Rams quarterback Jared Goff have regularly been forced to use a silent count to combat the noise generated by the away side\u2019s fans, typically an unnecessary measure to take for a team playing at home. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not ideal,\u201d Rivers said with a hint of resignation after the 2017 game against the Eagles. The home-field hostility hit a fresh apex for both teams on the same Sunday last month. That afternoon, the Rams were overwhelmed on the field and in the stands, which were blanketed by the red of the visiting San Francisco 49ers. \u201cThis turned into a home game pretty quickly,\u201d said San Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo after the game. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d It hasn\u2019t been quite as enjoyable for the ostensible home teams. A few hours later that day, the Chargers hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers, whose fans roared with approval when the stadium PA system blasted their team\u2019s adopted anthem, Renegade by Styx. It was supposed to be a gag; the song eventually transitioned to Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley, the punctuation to a long-running internet prank. But the joke didn\u2019t land, and Chargers players were miffed. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d Chargers running back Melvin Gordon said. \u201cThey started playing [the Steeelers\u2019] theme music. I don\u2019t know what we were doing \u2013 that little soundtrack, what they do on their home games. I don\u2019t know why we played that.\u201d Chargers offensive lineman Forrest Lamp was more blunt: \u201cWe\u2019re used to not having any fans here. It does suck, though, when they\u2019re playing their music in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re the ones at home. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s in charge of that, but they probably should be fired.\u201d The go-to line from Rams and Chargers brass is that it will take time to cultivate a true fan base in Los Angeles. Chargers owner Dean Spanos, who engineered the franchise\u2019s move from San Diego after voters there rejected his bid for public funding of a new stadium, told the New York Times earlier this year that it will \u201ctake maybe a generation\u201d for the team to find its footing in LA. On Tuesday this week, he was forced to deny rumors the team has discussed relocating to London. The two Los Angeles teams have varying histories in the city. The Chargers played their inaugural season there in 1960 before decamping for San Diego, where they remained for 56 years. The Rams have deeper roots in Los Angeles, playing in the area for 48 years beginning in 1946. But in 1995, the Rams moved to St Louis and the Raiders went up the coast to Oakland, leaving LA without an NFL franchise. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us some time to build the fan base back up again,\u201d said Ralph Valdez, the president and founder of the So Cal Rams Booster Club. \u201cThe Rams were gone for 21 years, and there were a lot of people who were left without a team to follow.\u201d Valdez started the group in 2004, when the Rams were just four years removed from winning a Super Bowl in St Louis, but he has been a fan since watching the team as a kid in the 1960s. \u201cOnce I saw the horns on the helmet, I was like, I\u2019m gonna follow them for the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could be in Egypt. That\u2019s still going to be my team.\u201d Both LA teams are currently playing in temporary home stadiums \u2013 the Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the permanent home of the University of Southern California\u2019s football team; the Chargers at the 27,000-seat Dignity Health Sports Park, which serves as the home for the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer \u2013 before moving to the $5bn SoFi Stadium in the suburb of Inglewood next year. There is hope that the opening of the stadium, which will host the Super Bowl in 2022 and is expected to host the main opening ceremony for the 2028 Summer Olympics, will deepen the bond between the teams and the city. \u201cWhen we get to Inglewood, that\u2019s our home. That\u2019s the Rams\u2019 opportunity to start gathering new fans,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cWhen you have a home, you can build something.\u201d He added: \u201cIn 10 or 15 years, you\u2019re still going to have fans of other teams [in Los Angeles]. But their kids, their grandkids, I would expect them to be Rams fans.\u201d Perhaps. But to some outside observers, the recurring sight of away fans swarming Chargers and Rams home games has made the NFL\u2019s return to Los Angeles look frivolous. \u201cZero teams in Los Angeles \u2013 that wasn\u2019t enough. Two\u2019s clearly too many,\u201d said ESPN anchor Scott Van Pelt in a commentary that aired last month. \u201cThere are NFL fans in Los Angeles, plenty of them. Most of them just root for other teams. And they\u2019re going to have a fancy new place to see them play when they come to town.\u201d The Chargers and Rams are not only contending with lost time in their bid to attract fans. With the proliferation of apps like SeatGeek and StubHub, through which customers can easily buy and resell tickets, the away fan takeover has become ubiquitous \u2013 and not just in Los Angeles. Fans of the Minnesota Vikings flooded Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday for the team\u2019s away game against the Kansas City Chiefs, generating as much noise as the home supporters and performing their signature \u201cskol\u201d chant with impunity. New England Patriots fans turned out in droves for the team\u2019s road game last month against Washington; they did the same two weeks later when the Patriots played at the New York Jets. When iconic teams like the Patriots, Steelers, Packers or Dallas Cowboys come to town, whether in Los Angeles or elsewhere, the home fans are always at risk of being outnumbered. Resale ticket prices are an average of 53% higher than a typical game when the Packers are visiting, according to figures provided by SeatGeek. They are 55% higher for Cowboys road games. That can be enticing for a season-ticket holder, looking to resell a ticket. Johnny Abundez, a member of the Chargers fan group Bolt Pride who lives in the San Diego area, expected Packers fans to account for about 80% of attendees at Sunday\u2019s game, a projection that was easily corroborated both by those at the stadium and those watching on television. \u201cI know Chargers fans who sold cheap seats for $350 to that game,\u201d Abundez said. \u201cI\u2019m not one to judge. I know a lot of Chargers fans who like watching the game on TV.\u201d Abundez said that southern California, with its high concentration of transplants and warm climate, is particularly vulnerable to the away fan takeover. New York Yankees fans turned out en masse for the team\u2019s road trip against the Los Angeles Dodgers in August. And while the Los Angeles Clippers are NBA contenders now, the team\u2019s home games have long attracted throngs of visiting fans. It happened frequently to the Chargers in San Diego, too. \u201cSan Diego is a military community,\u201d Abundez said. \u201cAnd once it gets to this time of the year, you see snow and rain in the Midwest and on the East Coast, and we have beautiful weather out here.\u201d For Valdez, however, the secondary ticket market has been a source of frustration. His Rams group encourages members to sell to supporters of the home team. \u201cI don\u2019t understand people who call themselves Rams fans and who are selling their tickets to make a premium,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cWe tell them that if they\u2019re going to sell them, sell them to Rams fans.\u201d",

It\u2019s also an ethical decision. \u201cI believe in sex workers\u2019 rights, but I can never be sure how consensual mainstream porn is,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter I started listening to audio erotica I realised there was another option \u2013 though I knew it would take some reconfiguration.\u201d She uses as an example the story of a teenage girl who went missing and was recently found through videos on Pornhub: \u201cWhen you watch these free tube sites, how can you be sure that nothing messed up has happened? The ethics of that became hugely complicated.\u201d A distribution model that allows people to upload and download for free, and has little protections against things like revenge porn was a turn-off, she says. For Fatima, the solution is to pay for porn \u2013 particularly porn produced by women, or feminists. But she is particularly besotted with getting hers audibly. \u201cI have never felt investment in this stuff before, but now I do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of John Lewis delivery trucks will begin running on cow power from 2021 as the retailer weans its fleet off polluting diesel fuel and switches to carbon-neutral cow manure. The retailer will begin using renewable biomethane made from manure slurry for almost 300 John Lewis and Waitrose delivery vans under new plans from its fuel supplier to swap rotting vegetables for poo power at no extra cost. John Lewis currently runs 80 vans on biomethane from food waste, but plans to expand its green fleet by up to 200 vans within the next 18 months before switching to manure. The company\u2019s fuel supplier, CNG Fuels, said it also planned to use the manure-based fuel to supply the 200-strong fleet of trucks used by courier service Hermes, as well as the delivery vans of Asda and Argos. A spokesman for CNG said the majority of the manure used to make the fuel would be sourced from cows, but the slurry might include human sewage too. According to the heavy vehicle fuelling specialist, using biomethane made from food scraps reduces the carbon emissions of delivery vans by 85% compared with those running on diesel. But biofuel made from manure is considered carbon-neutral under EU law because it helps stop methane \u2013 a greenhouse gas which is 28 times more potent than CO2 \u2013 being released into the atmosphere. The supplier is also looking at ways to update its network of heavy vehicle fuelling stations to include low-carbon hydrogen and powerful battery charging options. Philip Fjeld, the chief executive of CNG Fuels, said: \u201cRenewable biomethane sourced from manure is currently the best low-carbon solution for HGVs, but we want to be ready to support our customers when other technologies are commercially viable for freight transport.\u201d Heavy goods vehicles account for 4.2% of UK carbon emissions, so decarbonising the sector is essential to meet the UK\u2019s goal of achieving Net Zero by 2050.

If you concentrate politicians and civil servants in one part of the country, it is unsurprising that they will make decisions that favour that place over others. And if people in other places feel they have no real means of challenging this injustice, it is unsurprising that they will come to feel alienated from a political system that neglects where they live.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At a time when our politicians can barely agree on anything, devolution is perhaps the only idea uniting people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is the backdrop to the 2019 general election. The Brexit debate is real, but it is also a proxy for a much deeper dissatisfaction with our politics, which has been brewing for decades. A system that rewards parties for focusing on a small number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/03/10-key-marginal-seats-that-may-define-the-general-election\" title=\"\">key marginals</a> rather than the fortunes of whole regions is, by definition, dysfunctional.</p> <p>So far, this election appears to be following the usual pattern. We have seen certain lucky towns hand-picked for visits and government funding, but little mention of the north-south divide that has been widening for decades.</p> <p>This is now dangerous. An election campaign pitting \u201cthe people\u201d against parliament could easily take the country to an even darker place and unleash unfocused anger unless, alongside the Brexit discussion, it quickly gets into a much more positive debate about real solutions to the loss of trust in our political system, and the serious reforms needed to rebalance our country economically and socially. This election desperately needs to be a change election for the north of England. So far I\u2019m not feeling it \u2013 but I hope that\u2019s about to change.</p> <p>Thursday brings a general election intervention truly without precedent. Never before has an entire English region united across geographical and political divides to call for change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9581ad72063d7f81d2b2c63a5f19d218f4455c9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9581ad72063d7f81d2b2c63a5f19d218f4455c9b/0_336_5520_3312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The transport system feels as though it belongs to a different era and country to the one that operates in London.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The transport system feels as though it belongs to a different era and country to the one that operates in London.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russell Hart/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The publication of the first <a href=\"https://www.np11.org.uk/manifesto-for-the-north/\">Manifesto for the North</a>, resulting from the recent <a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/convention-north-np11-call-seismic-16911522\" title=\"\">Convention of the North</a>, simply can\u2019t be ignored. It is a positive intervention into an otherwise highly divided political debate. It sets out the terms for a new political settlement, around which all political parties can and should unite, and upon which a badly divided nation might begin to heal in the long term. Crucially, it asks the government to make rebalancing the economy a formal HM Treasury objective, to deliver transformational investment for the north. In the past, it has been all too easy for talk of the north-south divide to be labelled \u201cnorthern whinging\u201d and relegated to the margins of national political debate. But that won\u2019t be possible this time. First, our \u201cpower up the north\u201d call, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/10/northern-newspapers-demand-revolution-in-regions-treatment\" title=\"\">championed by our newspapers</a>, is a positive, self-confident ask for the power to do more for ourselves, rather than just a plea for resources. Second, it is backed by heavyweight analysis from a commission led by the former head of the UK civil service, Lord Kerslake, which has found that the north-south divide in England today is as stark as the east-west divide in Germany in the early 1990s.</p> <p>To many people here, that gets to the heart of the matter. It has always felt that we live in two different countries. The most obvious example is transport. The transport system in the north, which runs on Victorian infrastructure, feels as though it belongs to a different era and country to the one that operates in London and the south east. But the great transport divide is not just down to infrastructure. It also runs to different rules or, in the case of our buses, no rules at all.</p> <p>Westminster\u2019s decision to deregulate bus services everywhere except London in the 80s has left people in the north paying more for a poorer service. A single bus journey here can cost \u00a34 compared with \u00a31.50 in the capital. Vital routes can be cut on a whim.</p> <p>Then there is housing. The north is not alone in suffering from a housing crisis, but it is hurting people here in a more profound way than many in Whitehall realise. This week, the Manchester Evening News published a hard-hitting <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/broken-people-broken-system-manchesters-17192581\" title=\"\">investigation</a> into the growing scale of hidden homelessness. It exposed a 400% increase in the number of families in temporary accommodation since 2015 \u2013 often filthy single-rooms in B&amp;Bs, miles from their children\u2019s schools and friends.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/10/northern-newspapers-demand-revolution-in-regions-treatment\">Northern newspapers demand \u2018revolution\u2019\u00a0in region\u2019s treatment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given the north\u2019s lower-wage economy, it has always been the case that communities have had a higher need for social housing than elsewhere. It therefore follows that the government\u2019s right-to-buy policy and curbs on councils building replacement homes have hit the north harder. When you add on top of that the cuts to benefits over the last decade \u2013 and in particular the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/20/government-fuelling-homelessness-freezing-benefits-rents-soaring\" title=\"\">freeze</a> on the local housing allowance, which helps people afford homes in the private-rented sector \u2013 you can see how the hellish conditions described by the Manchester Evening News\u2019s Jennifer Williams have come about.</p> <p>The Manifesto for the North confronts this reality of life in the north today. It seeks to free us from the shackles of short-sighted Westminster policies on transport and housing, and give us the power to solve these things for ourselves.</p> <p>At a time when our politicians can barely agree on anything, devolution of power to the English regions is perhaps the only big idea in politics uniting people across the political spectrum.

      "bodyText": "The UK is both the most politically centralised and regionally unbalanced country in the OECD. That was the finding of Bob Kerslake\u2019s UK2070 commission earlier this year. These two depressing facts are intrinsically linked. If you concentrate politicians and civil servants in one part of the country, it is unsurprising that they will make decisions that favour that place over others. And if people in other places feel they have no real means of challenging this injustice, it is unsurprising that they will come to feel alienated from a political system that neglects where they live. This is the backdrop to the 2019 general election. The Brexit debate is real, but it is also a proxy for a much deeper dissatisfaction with our politics, which has been brewing for decades. A system that rewards parties for focusing on a small number of key marginals rather than the fortunes of whole regions is, by definition, dysfunctional. So far, this election appears to be following the usual pattern. We have seen certain lucky towns hand-picked for visits and government funding, but little mention of the north-south divide that has been widening for decades. This is now dangerous. An election campaign pitting \u201cthe people\u201d against parliament could easily take the country to an even darker place and unleash unfocused anger unless, alongside the Brexit discussion, it quickly gets into a much more positive debate about real solutions to the loss of trust in our political system, and the serious reforms needed to rebalance our country economically and socially. This election desperately needs to be a change election for the north of England. So far I\u2019m not feeling it \u2013 but I hope that\u2019s about to change. Thursday brings a general election intervention truly without precedent. Never before has an entire English region united across geographical and political divides to call for change. The publication of the first Manifesto for the North, resulting from the recent Convention of the North, simply can\u2019t be ignored. It is a positive intervention into an otherwise highly divided political debate. It sets out the terms for a new political settlement, around which all political parties can and should unite, and upon which a badly divided nation might begin to heal in the long term. Crucially, it asks the government to make rebalancing the economy a formal HM Treasury objective, to deliver transformational investment for the north. In the past, it has been all too easy for talk of the north-south divide to be labelled \u201cnorthern whinging\u201d and relegated to the margins of national political debate. But that won\u2019t be possible this time. First, our \u201cpower up the north\u201d call, championed by our newspapers, is a positive, self-confident ask for the power to do more for ourselves, rather than just a plea for resources. Second, it is backed by heavyweight analysis from a commission led by the former head of the UK civil service, Lord Kerslake, which has found that the north-south divide in England today is as stark as the east-west divide in Germany in the early 1990s. To many people here, that gets to the heart of the matter. It has always felt that we live in two different countries. The most obvious example is transport. The transport system in the north, which runs on Victorian infrastructure, feels as though it belongs to a different era and country to the one that operates in London and the south east. But the great transport divide is not just down to infrastructure. It also runs to different rules or, in the case of our buses, no rules at all. Westminster\u2019s decision to deregulate bus services everywhere except London in the 80s has left people in the north paying more for a poorer service. A single bus journey here can cost \u00a34 compared with \u00a31.50 in the capital. Vital routes can be cut on a whim. Then there is housing. The north is not alone in suffering from a housing crisis, but it is hurting people here in a more profound way than many in Whitehall realise. This week, the Manchester Evening News published a hard-hitting investigation into the growing scale of hidden homelessness. It exposed a 400% increase in the number of families in temporary accommodation since 2015 \u2013 often filthy single-rooms in B&amp;Bs, miles from their children\u2019s schools and friends. Given the north\u2019s lower-wage economy, it has always been the case that communities have had a higher need for social housing than elsewhere. It therefore follows that the government\u2019s right-to-buy policy and curbs on councils building replacement homes have hit the north harder. When you add on top of that the cuts to benefits over the last decade \u2013 and in particular the freeze on the local housing allowance, which helps people afford homes in the private-rented sector \u2013 you can see how the hellish conditions described by the Manchester Evening News\u2019s Jennifer Williams have come about. The Manifesto for the North confronts this reality of life in the north today. It seeks to free us from the shackles of short-sighted Westminster policies on transport and housing, and give us the power to solve these things for ourselves. At a time when our politicians can barely agree on anything, devolution of power to the English regions is perhaps the only big idea in politics uniting people across the political spectrum. For that reason alone, it must be embraced. \u2022 Andy Burnham is the mayor of Greater Manchester",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of French police have begun clearing more than 1,000 migrants and refugees from a makeshift camp in northern Paris, where they had been sleeping rough in squalid conditions for months. Police arrived at the site near Porte de La Chapelle before 6am local time (0500 GMT) on Thursday, after the country\u2019s centrist government set out Emmanuel Macron\u2019s tougher stance on immigration this week and vowed to clear the camps. Within an hour the first buses had departed to take people temporarily to gyms and requisitioned buildings in the Paris region while immigration authorities check their status. Women and children were first in the queues, while men waited calmly to leave, some clutching bags of few belongings. More than 3,000 people had been sleeping on pavements and under bridges and canals in northern Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis, with scant access to running water and no showers. Many had complained of rats, and charities had warned of appalling sanitary conditions. Some of those queuing for buses had refugee status but had not been able to find permanent accommodation. One such man from Sudan told France Info radio: \u201cIt is awful. I sleep outside, sometimes I eat, sometimes I don\u2019t.\u201d He said he expected to be taken to a makeshift shelter in a gymnasium. \u201cBut I really need a proper home, to get some training, to work. I want to live.\u201d The problem of makeshift camps for migrants and asylum seekers forming on the streets of northern Paris is not new. There have been more than 30 clearances in the capital over the last four years, but each time hundreds more people end up back on the streets shortly after. Local politicians have said the problem is that the state does not offer proper accommodation and facilities for asylum seekers who are being processed. The Socialist mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has regularly accused Macron\u2019s government of failing to provide help for the large number of people sleeping rough in the city. She said she had been given assurances from state authorities that those being evicted on Thursday would be found permanent accommodation. Hidalgo, observing the police clearance, said: \u201cAt last today a message is being sent that we have to have organised, dignified, humanitarian solutions.\u201d She said it also sent a message to residents of the area that \u201cyou have not been abandoned\u201d. In a sign of the state\u2019s determination to stop people returning to sleep rough in the same part of the city, Michel Cadot, the head of Paris\u2019s police force, said there would be a permanent police presence there \u201cto stop these camps reforming. That is the new element compared to all the measures taken in the past,\u201d he said. He described the evacuation of the camps as allowing the state to \u201ctake back the public space\u201d. Police authorities described it as a \u201chumanitarian\u201d operation to take people to shelter. Other camps in northern Paris will be evacuated in the coming days.",

      "body": "<p>Whatever happens in next month\u2019s general election, it is hard to see how Theresa May can win. If Boris Johnson gets a parliamentary majority and is able to force his version of Brexit through, he will be the one who did what she couldn\u2019t, who got the backing of the voters where she failed, who reopened a deal she said was closed, and who seized his moment when she didn\u2019t dare. It will be his victory. On the other hand, if Johnson comes a cropper at the polls and Brexit ends up stymied again, May will go down in the annals of her party as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/02/brexit\" title=\"\">PM who squandered their best chance to save Brexit</a> and to save themselves. He will be the fall guy. But she will get the ultimate blame.</p> <p>Anthony Seldon\u2019s exhaustive inside account of May\u2019s tenure in Downing Street offers little ammunition for anyone hoping to mount a defence of her premiership. Based on extensive interviews with all the key players (except the PM herself), his book portrays May as a brittle and shallow politician, incurious, inflexible and ultimately out of her depth. She has her moments \u2013 he commends her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/28/theresa-may-exchanges-cool-handshake-with-vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">handling of the Salisbury poisonings</a>, for example \u2013 but on the whole she comes across as fixed in her views when she needed to be open, yet indecisive when she needed to act: a fatal combination.</p> <p>Some of Seldon\u2019s judgments are withering. He says May should have appreciated the enormous challenges that the referendum result posed for the whole of the UK and the deep difficulty of the choices she faced. \u201cAny knowledge of history would have told her these were not ordinary decisions. But she knew no history.\u201d Seldon calls it \u201cone of the worst failures of imagination and opportunity\u201d by any PM since 1945.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t understand the present either. One of the mysteries of the first phase of the Brexit negotiations was how long it took the UK government to appreciate the intractable problem posed by the Irish border. On Seldon\u2019s account, this was partly down to sheer ignorance on May\u2019s part. \u201cShe showed no understanding, because she simply didn\u2019t understand, that it was the EU\u2019s customs union and the single market which made possible the dismantling of the hard border.\u201d You would think someone might have told her. The problem was that she didn\u2019t know how to listen to what she didn\u2019t want to hear.</p> <p>Yet this book is not quite as devastating as it appears, because Seldon\u2019s approach is flawed. By relying so heavily on personal testimony from the people involved, he is essentially trading in post-hoc rationalisations. <em>May at 10</em> is not so different from Tim Shipman\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/21/all-out-war-tim-shipman-the-brexit-club-owen-bennett-bad-boys-of-brexit-arron-banks-review\" title=\"\">All Out War</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/20/fall-out-tim-shipman-house-gold-wilding-review\" title=\"\">Fall Out</a></em>, which cover much of the same ground in even more breathless detail (Seldon occasionally relies on Shipman\u2019s account to fill in gaps in his own). But while Shipman \u2013 a journalist \u2013 never pretends to be offering anything more than a gossipy tale of back-stabbing and score-settling, Seldon \u2013 a historian \u2013 wants to be doing something more. So he interposes his own magisterial verdicts on the events he describes. The problem is that it\u2019s not clear where these verdicts come from.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f91d11658460208db1a377fdbefa2c80ee929d5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f91d11658460208db1a377fdbefa2c80ee929d5e/0_86_3434_2061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"May on a walkabout during an election campaign stop in Mevagissey, Cornwall, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May on a walkabout during an election campaign stop in Mevagissey, Cornwall, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For instance, he says that May was right to call an election in 2017 and only has herself to blame for the crushing outcome. He lists six things that went wrong (from the botched manifesto to her timid and robotic behaviour on the campaign trail), and he places ultimate responsibility for each at her door. What\u2019s missing, though, is any sense of the wider political context. Yes, May was a terrible campaigner. But how does Seldon know that the campaign was the root cause of her failure?</p> <p>The truth is that the Tories did not underperform in 2017 \u2013 May got roughly the vote share that was predicted by the polls when she called the election and more than any Conservative leader since John Major. What caused all her difficulties was that the opposition vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/22/the-inside-story-of-labours-election-shock-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">unexpectedly coalesced around Labour</a> \u2013 it was the falling away of Lib Dem, Green and Ukip support that did for her. Could she have prevented that? Maybe she could have been more alive to the risks, but much of what happened \u2013 including Labour\u2019s highly effective under-the-radar social media campaign \u2013 was out of her hands. Some of her stress during the election came from her sense of her own powerlessness. But Seldon wants to make it all about her.</p> <p>This highly personalised approach means most of the book\u2019s verdicts relate to individuals and their characters, for better and for worse. Some come out very well. Seldon seems particularly enamoured of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/10/philip-may-theresa-may-one-show-human-shield\" title=\"\">Philip May</a>, the PM\u2019s husband, whom he describes as a consort of \u201cconsummate skill\u201d and one of the key figures of her entire administration. But he provides very little evidence for what Philip May actually contributed, beyond being loyal and supportive throughout all his wife\u2019s travails. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is some soft sexism at work here \u2013 what made it remarkable was that a husband was performing a role we normally associate with prime ministers\u2019 wives.</p> <p>The person who emerges best is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/04/former-civil-service-chief-sir-jeremy-heywood-dies-aged-56\" title=\"\">Jeremy Heywood</a>, the head of the civil service, whose untimely death in late 2018 robbed the government of its wisest counsellor and safest pair of hands. This judgment is hard to argue with. He was not just consistently helpful, he was also solicitous, notwithstanding some bruising battles with May and her entourage. When the PR disaster of her tin-eared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/jun/21/may-apologises-for-government-response-to-grenfell-tower-fire-video\" title=\"\">response to the Grenfell fire</a> left her deeply exposed, Heywood texted a fellow official in No 10 to say: \u201cWe failed her. We deserve the blame for this, not her.\u201d That others should have been so forgiving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"efa86ff7ae1c8d551b32292d611c7188e73edd9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efa86ff7ae1c8d551b32292d611c7188e73edd9f/1171_225_835_501/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Heywood with May at a Cabinet meeting, January 2017.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Heywood with May at a Cabinet meeting, January 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heywood stabilised May\u2019s administration after the disastrous election result forced her to ditch long-standing special advisers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/nick-timothy-and-fiona-hill-unelected-advisers-who-acted-more-like-dpms\" title=\"\">Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill</a>. With Heywood\u2019s loss, things began to unravel again and her Brexit strategy lost its way. But May was far from being alone in the misjudgments she made. It\u2019s clear that almost everyone on the UK side miscalculated the likelihood that the EU would buckle under pressure. Equally, the EU\u2019s leading players fundamentally misunderstood how British politics works. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/12/nasty-political-games-row-over-top-eu-appointment-martin-selmayr\" title=\"\">Martin Selmayr</a>, chief of staff to Jean-Claude Juncker and an EU powerbroker in his own right, was astonished to discover that Corbyn did not have May\u2019s mobile number. \u201cI would have expected that the leader of Her Majesty\u2019s opposition and the Prime Minister might speak at least two or three times a week on the phone personally and have a standing communication line to solve this matter.\u201d Really? The British thought the Europeans would behave like them and ditch their guiding principles when the going got tough. The Europeans thought the British would behave like them and stitch up a compromise when they needed one. May might have been tin-eared, but it was a dialogue of the deaf all round.</p> <p>Seldon is interested in the what-ifs of Brexit and he identifies some key moments when it could all have been different, if only one or two people had changed their tune. He says that just before the third and final meaningful vote on May\u2019s deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/30/steve-baker-the-ex-brexit-minister-hell-bent-on-torpedoing-mays-chequers-plan\" title=\"\">Steve Baker of the ERG</a> finally decided to side with the government, potentially bringing enough Brexit diehards with him to get the deal over the line. He went to the office of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/30/dup-deputy-leader-id-rather-stay-in-eu-than-back-theresa-may-deal\" title=\"\">DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds</a> to tell him of his decision, but because Dodds wasn\u2019t there Baker had time to reconsider, and he ended up changing his mind again a few hours later. Seldon remarks: \u201cOn such flutters of a butterfly\u2019s wings do great events hinge.\u201d Yet what persuaded Baker to back down was bumping into a couple of his fellow Brexit hardliners who told him he was crazy to back May. So perhaps this butterfly didn\u2019t have quite the influence Seldon thinks.</p> <p>In the end, there probably is no defence of May\u2019s premiership: she was dogged, she was determined, but Seldon is right that she lacked the skills and the knowledge to navigate the Brexit minefield. However, by making it so much about the individuals concerned \u2013 their feuds, their foibles, their resentments and regrets \u2013 he does her time in office a disservice. The wider story included many factors beyond any of their power to control. This highly personalised picture of the May years purports to account for the dysfunctional and factional state of current British politics. But it is also a symptom of what it seeks to explain.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Where Power Stops</em><em> by David Runciman is published by Profile.

      "bodyText": "Whatever happens in next month\u2019s general election, it is hard to see how Theresa May can win. If Boris Johnson gets a parliamentary majority and is able to force his version of Brexit through, he will be the one who did what she couldn\u2019t, who got the backing of the voters where she failed, who reopened a deal she said was closed, and who seized his moment when she didn\u2019t dare. It will be his victory. On the other hand, if Johnson comes a cropper at the polls and Brexit ends up stymied again, May will go down in the annals of her party as the PM who squandered their best chance to save Brexit and to save themselves. He will be the fall guy. But she will get the ultimate blame. Anthony Seldon\u2019s exhaustive inside account of May\u2019s tenure in Downing Street offers little ammunition for anyone hoping to mount a defence of her premiership. Based on extensive interviews with all the key players (except the PM herself), his book portrays May as a brittle and shallow politician, incurious, inflexible and ultimately out of her depth. She has her moments \u2013 he commends her handling of the Salisbury poisonings, for example \u2013 but on the whole she comes across as fixed in her views when she needed to be open, yet indecisive when she needed to act: a fatal combination. Some of Seldon\u2019s judgments are withering. He says May should have appreciated the enormous challenges that the referendum result posed for the whole of the UK and the deep difficulty of the choices she faced. \u201cAny knowledge of history would have told her these were not ordinary decisions. But she knew no history.\u201d Seldon calls it \u201cone of the worst failures of imagination and opportunity\u201d by any PM since 1945. She didn\u2019t understand the present either. One of the mysteries of the first phase of the Brexit negotiations was how long it took the UK government to appreciate the intractable problem posed by the Irish border. On Seldon\u2019s account, this was partly down to sheer ignorance on May\u2019s part. \u201cShe showed no understanding, because she simply didn\u2019t understand, that it was the EU\u2019s customs union and the single market which made possible the dismantling of the hard border.\u201d You would think someone might have told her. The problem was that she didn\u2019t know how to listen to what she didn\u2019t want to hear. Yet this book is not quite as devastating as it appears, because Seldon\u2019s approach is flawed. By relying so heavily on personal testimony from the people involved, he is essentially trading in post-hoc rationalisations. May at 10 is not so different from Tim Shipman\u2019s All Out War and Fall Out, which cover much of the same ground in even more breathless detail (Seldon occasionally relies on Shipman\u2019s account to fill in gaps in his own). But while Shipman \u2013 a journalist \u2013 never pretends to be offering anything more than a gossipy tale of back-stabbing and score-settling, Seldon \u2013 a historian \u2013 wants to be doing something more. So he interposes his own magisterial verdicts on the events he describes. The problem is that it\u2019s not clear where these verdicts come from. For instance, he says that May was right to call an election in 2017 and only has herself to blame for the crushing outcome. He lists six things that went wrong (from the botched manifesto to her timid and robotic behaviour on the campaign trail), and he places ultimate responsibility for each at her door. What\u2019s missing, though, is any sense of the wider political context. Yes, May was a terrible campaigner. But how does Seldon know that the campaign was the root cause of her failure? The truth is that the Tories did not underperform in 2017 \u2013 May got roughly the vote share that was predicted by the polls when she called the election and more than any Conservative leader since John Major. What caused all her difficulties was that the opposition vote unexpectedly coalesced around Labour \u2013 it was the falling away of Lib Dem, Green and Ukip support that did for her. Could she have prevented that? Maybe she could have been more alive to the risks, but much of what happened \u2013 including Labour\u2019s highly effective under-the-radar social media campaign \u2013 was out of her hands. Some of her stress during the election came from her sense of her own powerlessness. But Seldon wants to make it all about her. This highly personalised approach means most of the book\u2019s verdicts relate to individuals and their characters, for better and for worse. Some come out very well. Seldon seems particularly enamoured of Philip May, the PM\u2019s husband, whom he describes as a consort of \u201cconsummate skill\u201d and one of the key figures of her entire administration. But he provides very little evidence for what Philip May actually contributed, beyond being loyal and supportive throughout all his wife\u2019s travails. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is some soft sexism at work here \u2013 what made it remarkable was that a husband was performing a role we normally associate with prime ministers\u2019 wives. The person who emerges best is Jeremy Heywood, the head of the civil service, whose untimely death in late 2018 robbed the government of its wisest counsellor and safest pair of hands. This judgment is hard to argue with. He was not just consistently helpful, he was also solicitous, notwithstanding some bruising battles with May and her entourage. When the PR disaster of her tin-eared response to the Grenfell fire left her deeply exposed, Heywood texted a fellow official in No 10 to say: \u201cWe failed her. We deserve the blame for this, not her.\u201d That others should have been so forgiving. Heywood stabilised May\u2019s administration after the disastrous election result forced her to ditch long-standing special advisers Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill. With Heywood\u2019s loss, things began to unravel again and her Brexit strategy lost its way. But May was far from being alone in the misjudgments she made. It\u2019s clear that almost everyone on the UK side miscalculated the likelihood that the EU would buckle under pressure. Equally, the EU\u2019s leading players fundamentally misunderstood how British politics works. Martin Selmayr, chief of staff to Jean-Claude Juncker and an EU powerbroker in his own right, was astonished to discover that Corbyn did not have May\u2019s mobile number. \u201cI would have expected that the leader of Her Majesty\u2019s opposition and the Prime Minister might speak at least two or three times a week on the phone personally and have a standing communication line to solve this matter.\u201d Really? The British thought the Europeans would behave like them and ditch their guiding principles when the going got tough. The Europeans thought the British would behave like them and stitch up a compromise when they needed one. May might have been tin-eared, but it was a dialogue of the deaf all round. Seldon is interested in the what-ifs of Brexit and he identifies some key moments when it could all have been different, if only one or two people had changed their tune. He says that just before the third and final meaningful vote on May\u2019s deal, Steve Baker of the ERG finally decided to side with the government, potentially bringing enough Brexit diehards with him to get the deal over the line. He went to the office of the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds to tell him of his decision, but because Dodds wasn\u2019t there Baker had time to reconsider, and he ended up changing his mind again a few hours later. Seldon remarks: \u201cOn such flutters of a butterfly\u2019s wings do great events hinge.\u201d Yet what persuaded Baker to back down was bumping into a couple of his fellow Brexit hardliners who told him he was crazy to back May. So perhaps this butterfly didn\u2019t have quite the influence Seldon thinks. In the end, there probably is no defence of May\u2019s premiership: she was dogged, she was determined, but Seldon is right that she lacked the skills and the knowledge to navigate the Brexit minefield. However, by making it so much about the individuals concerned \u2013 their feuds, their foibles, their resentments and regrets \u2013 he does her time in office a disservice. The wider story included many factors beyond any of their power to control. This highly personalised picture of the May years purports to account for the dysfunctional and factional state of current British politics. But it is also a symptom of what it seeks to explain. \u2022 Where Power Stops by David Runciman is published by Profile.

      "bodyText": "The government faces an uphill battle in winning independent senator Jacqui Lambie\u2019s vote to expand its cashless debit-card program across the Northern Territory. Labor and Greens senators on a committee reviewing the government\u2019s latest expansion plan of the income management program have rejected the legislation, arguing there was no verifiable, independent evidence the scheme was beneficial and had the potential to push back Closing the Gap targets. The government is pushing ahead with its plan despite the concerns, although it remains short of the necessary numbers to have the plan pass the Senate. After visiting most trial sites \u2013 most recently Ceduna three times, with visits to the Western Australia sites planned for January \u2013 Lambie remains unconvinced the necessary supporting infrastructure has been put in place. A spokeswoman for the senator said that while she remained \u201cbroadly supportive\u201d of the cashless debit-card program, she \u201cis concerned that the promised services, including rehabilitation and vocational training centres, are simply not there\u201d. Without those services, the spokeswoman said, \u201cshe absolutely does not support a nationwide roll out\u201d. Lambie\u2019s unmoving position shows the government has an uphill battle to rolling out its \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d program, which also includes drug testing of job-seeking welfare recipients. Both measures have split the parliament, leaving the crossbench to make the ultimate decision. Under the cashless debit-card scheme, which came into effect in 2016, up to 80% of income is quarantined in a special bank card that can be used only at certain vendors, and cannot be used to buy alcohol or gamble, although loopholes have allowed this to happen in some cases. Under new legislation, the minister would, in some cases, be able to restrict 100% of a welfare payment to the card. But critics argue the scheme leaves some participants worse off, as they are unable to buy goods and services outside of prescribed stores, such as second-hand stores or markets that offer goods at cheaper prices than stores approved to take the debit card. Labor wants the government to make opting into the card voluntary, as well as an independent inquiry established to judge the card\u2019s effectiveness. The committee\u2019s report recommended the minister \u201cclarify\u201d the discretionary powers to determine rates of quarantined income, and how communities can request changes, but did not recommend the proposal be dropped. Labor senators on the committee, including Malarndirri McCarthy, rejected the bill on the grounds it was not supported by evidence. \u201cTwelve years after it was introduced, there is no evidence that broad-based compulsory income management has worked in the Northern Territory to improve outcomes,\u201d the Labor dissenting report said. \u201cLabor senators are also concerned about the lack of local consultation and the absence of consent for this proposed policy in the Northern Territory. \u201cLabor Senators do not believe the CDC trials should be extended or expanded unless: the card is made voluntary; it is only applied in specific instances, with intensive case management and is time limited, eg child protection; or a community genuinely gives their informed consent to trial the card, consistent with self-determination.\u201d Greens senator Rachel Siewart also said there was no justification for a compulsory rollout of the program into any new areas, including the Northern Territory. \u201cIt relies on anecdotal evidence, misleading data and evaluations that are heavily criticised for their lack of rigour to support their claims that cashless debit card is working,\u201d Siewert said. \u201cWe heard some heartbreaking evidence through this inquiry, of the deep poverty that people on compulsory income management in the NT are experiencing, how the underlying causes of disadvantage are not being addressed and the harsh impact income management has had on people in the NT for 12 years. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to make plans far away in an office in a capital city and another to listen to the lived experiences of people, living on income support, living in poverty and struggling under income quarantining.

So is the satellite broadcaster\u2019s box still the one to beat?</p> <p>When Q launched in 2016 it dragged Sky\u2019s pay-TV platform <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/sky-q-review-broadcast-satellite-pay-tv\">kicking and screaming into the TV-anywhere age</a> first ushered in by services such as Netflix.</p> <p>There were some great bits, such as the ability to stream your recordings around the house both to Q Mini boxes attached to TVs and to apps on tablets and phones. There were also some not-so-great bits, such as a polarising touch-sensitive remote that some simply couldn\u2019t stand.</p> <p>After three years of maturation, Sky Q has improved in all the right areas while keeping the good bits just the way they were.</p> <h2>Broadcast TV</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c1893aa05a6695fa48ade45bd93fe0060b115ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c1893aa05a6695fa48ade45bd93fe0060b115ff/148_319_4298_2579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"sky q review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Once you\u2019ve used an edited, re-ordered TV guide you\u2019ll never want to go back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sky Q is arguably the best regular TV-watching experience you can get for a couple of key reasons. If you pay the extra \u00a35 a month, proactively everything is in HD, apart from FreeSports, which is in HD exclusively on Virgin. It\u2019s fast to switch in and out of channels and to the guide. You can also edit the TV guide, not only to remove channels you don\u2019t want to see, but to reorder them into your preferred list.</p> <p>I can\u2019t tell you how much of a revelation that has been. No more is there standard definition BBC 1 right at the top \u2013 who wants to watch SD content in 2019? My Favourites guide shows me just the channels I want and in an actually logical order.</p> <p>The New Series guide is excellent too, keeping you abreast of the latest shows starting up in the very near future. Go here, set them to record and relax.

Shows are downloaded to the box but you can watch them while they\u2019re downloading, which means there\u2019s no buffering to deal with \u2013 great for those without really fast broadband.</p> <p>There\u2019s so much on-demand content that Sky rivals Netflix for binge-watching potential. If you\u2019re watching a box set the next episode will download in the background while you\u2019re watching, meaning it\u2019s ready to go when you are. And with the right package you also get Netflix thrown in, which is searchable alongside everything else.</p> <h2>Voice search and control</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afa91bbc44edc9604dea900266d190e760d27b89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afa91bbc44edc9604dea900266d190e760d27b89/112_194_3824_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"sky q review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voice search and control is fast and powerful, just press and hold the button on the remote while speaking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sky Q had unified search at launch, which worked very well.

      "bodyText": "Three years on from launch, Sky\u2019s Q pay-TV service has changed quite a lot, and so has the competition, both from old and new players. So is the satellite broadcaster\u2019s box still the one to beat? When Q launched in 2016 it dragged Sky\u2019s pay-TV platform kicking and screaming into the TV-anywhere age first ushered in by services such as Netflix. There were some great bits, such as the ability to stream your recordings around the house both to Q Mini boxes attached to TVs and to apps on tablets and phones. There were also some not-so-great bits, such as a polarising touch-sensitive remote that some simply couldn\u2019t stand. After three years of maturation, Sky Q has improved in all the right areas while keeping the good bits just the way they were. Broadcast TV Sky Q is arguably the best regular TV-watching experience you can get for a couple of key reasons. If you pay the extra \u00a35 a month, proactively everything is in HD, apart from FreeSports, which is in HD exclusively on Virgin. It\u2019s fast to switch in and out of channels and to the guide. You can also edit the TV guide, not only to remove channels you don\u2019t want to see, but to reorder them into your preferred list. I can\u2019t tell you how much of a revelation that has been. No more is there standard definition BBC 1 right at the top \u2013 who wants to watch SD content in 2019? My Favourites guide shows me just the channels I want and in an actually logical order. The New Series guide is excellent too, keeping you abreast of the latest shows starting up in the very near future. Go here, set them to record and relax. If you don\u2019t watch TV with adverts \u2013 as I don\u2019t \u2013 discovering when new things are going to be broadcast is really difficult without something like this. More 4K TV If you\u2019ve bought a 4K UHD TV, and it\u2019s likely you have if you\u2019ve bought practically any new large TV in the last year, then you want things to watch on it. While there are some 4K movies and TV shows on services such as Netflix or Amazon, Sky has the most broadcast and TV show 4K content available. You need the Sky Q Experience pack and the 2TB Sky Q box to get 4K, but you can watch all of Sky\u2019s Premier League games and many English Football League games live in 4K, alongside F1, darts, rugby, boxing and others. The one hole is BT Sport, which is not currently available in 4K on Sky, but is on competitors. TV other than sport is accessed through on-demand in 4K, with a large proportion of TV shows shown on Sky\u2019s various channels are available to download in 4K, including series such as Game of Thrones. Sadly that doesn\u2019t include the traditional terrestrial channels, such as BBC, ITV or Channel 4. The Q box doesn\u2019t support HDR yet, although it is coming. There\u2019s also no way to automatically grab the 4K version as soon as something is recorded, meaning I ended up recording a programme as a placeholder then downloading it in 4K before I wanted to watch it. Sky\u2019s handling of on-demand content is also excellent \u2013 seamless and entirely within the same user interface without throwing you out to another app such as iPlayer. Shows are downloaded to the box but you can watch them while they\u2019re downloading, which means there\u2019s no buffering to deal with \u2013 great for those without really fast broadband.

That means you have to wait some time for the latest blockbusters, and that you could have bought or rented them from Amazon, iTunes, Google Play or Sky before they are included in your subscription. TV around the house Q changed the way Sky delivered content to multiple TVs, essentially turning the main box into a hub to feed smaller Mini Q boxes or the Sky Q on a smartphone or tablet. The Mini Q boxes remain unchanged and are great for putting Sky on another TV, but only in HD, not 4K. Better is the new Sky Go app, which has superseded the Sky Q app and is available on a wider range of devices, including iPads, iPhones, Android devices and Amazon\u2019s popular Fire tablets. With the Sky Go app you can watch live TV, continue watching recordings in the home or download them to go, or set things to be recorded remotely on Q box.

BBC, ITV and Channel 4 HD channels are in HD regardless. Ultimate On Demand includes 500 of Sky\u2019s box sets and Netflix subscription for \u00a312 a month. Sky Sports comes in HD by default and ranges in price from \u00a318 to \u00a330 a month depending on how many channels or sports you want. BT Sport is an extra \u00a320 a month at least. Sky Cinema comes in HD by default and costs \u00a311 a month. Sky Kids TV is \u00a35 a month and is aimed at children up to 12 years old with 11 channels and over 5,000 episodes on demand, plus access to the Sky Kids app and a Kids Safe Mode on the Sky Q box. Sky Q Experience costs \u00a313 a month and is required for 4K, but also enables viewing on the Sky Go app or Q Mini boxes in the home.

And then a figure, at the edge of his vision. Now something grabbed his fingers or stroked his arm. There was more \u2013 and it was happening more frequently.</p> <p>\u201cI saw a Catholic priest,\u201d said the man. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t help. Can you?\u201d</p> <p>Yes, yes I could. I knew exactly what he needed to do.</p> <p>I was a fortune teller. Every Sunday, I climbed the stairs of an old terrace house in Sydney\u2019s historic Rocks district, to sit in the attic and divine the future. I would read Tarot cards or interpret horoscopes.</p> <p>As a teenager, I\u2019d devoured a book called <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1228113.Positive_Magic\">Positive Magic</a><em>.</em> An instruction manual for witches, its central idea was that if you wanted something, and you had good intentions, you just told the universe and magic would happen. Although nothing I wanted (fame, money, hot boyfriend) actually arrived, one thing led to another and I taught myself to read Tarot cards.

I knew exactly what he needed to do. I was a fortune teller. Every Sunday, I climbed the stairs of an old terrace house in Sydney\u2019s historic Rocks district, to sit in the attic and divine the future. I would read Tarot cards or interpret horoscopes. As a teenager, I\u2019d devoured a book called Positive Magic. An instruction manual for witches, its central idea was that if you wanted something, and you had good intentions, you just told the universe and magic would happen. Although nothing I wanted (fame, money, hot boyfriend) actually arrived, one thing led to another and I taught myself to read Tarot cards. At the time I was a science student, and just considered it a fun game at parties. That changed after I took my cards to my part-time job and read them for a colleague during the break.

It\u2019s directed by Seamus Murphy, a photojournalist and friend of Harvey who she travels with on research field trips to Afghanistan, Kosovo and low-income black neighbourhoods of Washington DC. But the film\u2019s political engagement is oddly wishy-washy, while fans hungry for intimate access to the singer will leave frustrated \u2013 Murphy politely respects Harvey\u2019s cool, emotionally reserved public persona.</p> <p>In Washington, Harvey meets Paunie, a teenage girl who dresses like a boy and commands total respect on the street. (It\u2019s Paunie\u2019s dog that gives the film the title.) In Kosovo, an elderly woman keeps the keys of neighbours who fled the village during the war (and presumably won\u2019t be coming back). Murphy shoots with compassion and journalistic curiosity, his camera inching closer and closer to the face of a boy in Washington who is explaining how his dad, cousin and friend were all shot dead on the same block \u2013 two murders, one suicide.</p> <p>Harvey is mostly a watchful observer with a notebook; sometimes she reads lines of poetry she\u2019s jotted down on the voiceover. But we barely see her interacting with anyone on the ground, which gives the whole thing an impersonal feel. And there are patience-testing scenes of the album being recorded in Somerset House, London, as members of the public look on.</p> <p>But it\u2019s here, in a throwaway line, that we get what might be the most revealing moment in the film, as a musician tells an anecdote about Harvey recording her previous album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/13/pj-harvey-let-england-shake\">Let England Shake</a>. The record company hadn\u2019t heard a single track and were getting jittery. Harvey invited half a dozen executives to her house in Dorset, made a pot of tea, put the album on her CD player then disappeared off to do a bit of gardening. Now that I would pay to see.</p> <p>\u2022 A Dog Called Money is released in the UK on 8 November.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBRnlCQ35RQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mBRnlCQ35RQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

It\u2019s directed by Seamus Murphy, a photojournalist and friend of Harvey who she travels with on research field trips to Afghanistan, Kosovo and low-income black neighbourhoods of Washington DC. But the film\u2019s political engagement is oddly wishy-washy, while fans hungry for intimate access to the singer will leave frustrated \u2013 Murphy politely respects Harvey\u2019s cool, emotionally reserved public persona. In Washington, Harvey meets Paunie, a teenage girl who dresses like a boy and commands total respect on the street. (It\u2019s Paunie\u2019s dog that gives the film the title.) In Kosovo, an elderly woman keeps the keys of neighbours who fled the village during the war (and presumably won\u2019t be coming back). Murphy shoots with compassion and journalistic curiosity, his camera inching closer and closer to the face of a boy in Washington who is explaining how his dad, cousin and friend were all shot dead on the same block \u2013 two murders, one suicide. Harvey is mostly a watchful observer with a notebook; sometimes she reads lines of poetry she\u2019s jotted down on the voiceover. But we barely see her interacting with anyone on the ground, which gives the whole thing an impersonal feel. And there are patience-testing scenes of the album being recorded in Somerset House, London, as members of the public look on. But it\u2019s here, in a throwaway line, that we get what might be the most revealing moment in the film, as a musician tells an anecdote about Harvey recording her previous album, Let England Shake. The record company hadn\u2019t heard a single track and were getting jittery. Harvey invited half a dozen executives to her house in Dorset, made a pot of tea, put the album on her CD player then disappeared off to do a bit of gardening. Now that I would pay to see. \u2022 A Dog Called Money is released in the UK on 8 November.",

      "body": "<p>When I received an email from the Kurdish feminist writer and activist Houzan Mahmoud, asking if I would speak at the first conference on sexual violence against women and girls to be held in Iraqi Kurdistan, I could barely contain my excitement.</p> <p>Mahmoud, a campaigner for Kurdish and Iraqi women\u2019s rights \u2013 \u201chonour\u201d killings, the rape and abduction of women in Iraq and the imposition of Islamic sharia law are among the areas she tackles \u2013 was supporting the Sofia Society, a group of roughly 40 young feminists.</p> <p>Kurdish women have engaged in armed resistance for decades, and were instrumental in the demise of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the proud history of resistance to totalitarian regimes, the conference, held in the city of Sulaymaniyah, was a brave move. Of the 300 delegates who packed the auditorium, two-thirds were women; the front row was taken up by male government ministers, including the deputy prime minister, Qubad Talabani. <a href=\"http://cultureproject.org.uk/2016/12/30/an-interview-with-lanja-khawe-one-of-the-cofounders-of-sofia-girls-group/\">Sofia\u2019s founder, Lanja Khawe</a>, opened the event.</p> <p>I had met Khawe the day before to discuss logistics. She was clearly upset when she arrived at the cafe, explaining that one of the speakers, a senior academic, had pulled out because of the \u201cdirection of the event\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey think we are whores because we are feminists\u201d, said Khawe. I had already heard some of the women in the group were scared of being targeted by men in so-called \u201chonour\u201d attacks after speaking out against male violence.</p> <p>Khawe, a 26-year-old lawyer, has been an active feminist for a decade. She has worked with incarcerated sex trafficking victims, and provided pro-bono legal support to women on low incomes experiencing domestic violence.</p> <p>In 2016, she founded the Sofia Society, primarily to promote literacy and raise awareness among women. In 2017, Sofia, active in a number of cities across Kurdistan, ran a social media campaign against sexual harassment , calling on women not to be afraid to share photos of themselves to combat the culture of abuse. The hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/kurdistanwomenpower?src=hashtag_click\">#Kurdistanwomenpower</a> was used by hundreds of women.</p> <p>Violence against women in Kurdistan is <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mec/2018/01/05/gender-equality-in-iraq-and-iraqi-kurdistan/\">pandemic</a>, but \u2013 I am told \u2013 there is little political will, even among senior women in the government, to address it. To maintain independence and freedom of expression, Sofia has chosen not to seek funding from the Kurdish government, political parties or international organisations. The conference was funded by donations.</p> <p>Why was the conference timely? Although a couple of male delegates asked why \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d were being prioritised when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/11/kurdish-civilians-flee-turkish-forces-sustain-bombardment-syria\">Rojava was being bombed</a>, many are aware that sexual violence is an everyday reality for women in the region, including as a weapon of war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"332db1ac6fe964713ed5619600d4328de8e7a16f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/332db1ac6fe964713ed5619600d4328de8e7a16f/0_295_6552_3930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Iraqi Kurdish woman walks past a mural in Arbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Iraqi Kurdish woman walks past a mural in Arbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Safin Hamed/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both the Kurdistan regional government and the UN have poured money into initiatives to reduce sexual violence and honour killing. But the problem, <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/12/iraq-kurdistan-violence-women.html\">according to figures from 2018</a>, seems to be getting worse.</p> <p>In the first 10 months of 2018, sexual violence against women in the Kurdistan region increased, both in public and private settings. A total of 91 women were killed, or killed themselves, and 203 women suffered serious injury through burns. Recorded sexal assault cases numbered 87, and well over 7,000 women disclosed that they had experienced physical violence by men. Legislation on violence against women is inadequate, as is the police response, so only a tiny minority of sexual violence survivors actually report to an official body.</p> <p>The conference broke new ground. For the very first time in Kurdistan, the voices of survivors of sexual violence were heard publicly. As the gathering opened, a screen was erected in the corner of the stage behind which woman after woman, their voices distorted to protect their anonymity, told their stories. One spoke about enduring rape; she ended by saying: \u201cThis man is now in the government, he is a legislator, a lawmaker.\u201d</p> <p>I was there to speak about trafficking of women into the sex trade, which is rife across Iraq and through Kurdistan. There is little provision for the victims, and the one shelter for women rescued from pimping gangs has remained empty. Last year, a senior police officer in Sulaymaniyah gave a statement in which he claimed there were no brothels in the city, and no trafficking. As I told the audience, it took me only 10 minutes to find advertising for escort agencies and brothels only minutes from where the conference was being held.</p> <p>Other presentations focused on domestic violence, femicide and sexual assault. Throughout, the speakers suggested potential remedies, such as new laws, deterrents and punishments for the perpetrators, and better support for the victims. \u201cThe shame and stigma should be where it belongs,\u201d said Mahmoud, \u201con the men responsible and not the women.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/29/worry-trafficked-uk-first-legal-red-light-zone-leeds-holbeck\">'I worry they are trafficked': is the UK's first 'legal' red light zone working? | Julie Bindel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One question for me came from a member of the Iraqi Men\u2019s Association. He appeared quite angered by my suggestion that men have no right to pay for sex and told me: \u201cWe have the right to practise sex. The wives are sexually uneducated. What are we supposed to do?\u201d</p> <p>The majority of comments from the audience were from men. As Khawe said: \u201cWe have a long way to go, but this is a great start.\u201d</p> <p>The next day, I met with Mahmoud and 30 Sophia members in a nearby restaurant to share ideas and contacts for further activism to end male violence. Khawe was jubilant but exhausted, throwing out suggestions to run girls groups in schools, and asking how best to approach sensitive topics with teachers.</p> <p>I left Kurdistan feeling optimistic that this inspiring group of young women could become the future of feminism in the region.</p> <p>As Khawe said: \u201cWe have a long way to go, but this is a great start.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When I received an email from the Kurdish feminist writer and activist Houzan Mahmoud, asking if I would speak at the first conference on sexual violence against women and girls to be held in Iraqi Kurdistan, I could barely contain my excitement. Mahmoud, a campaigner for Kurdish and Iraqi women\u2019s rights \u2013 \u201chonour\u201d killings, the rape and abduction of women in Iraq and the imposition of Islamic sharia law are among the areas she tackles \u2013 was supporting the Sofia Society, a group of roughly 40 young feminists. Kurdish women have engaged in armed resistance for decades, and were instrumental in the demise of Saddam Hussein. Notwithstanding the proud history of resistance to totalitarian regimes, the conference, held in the city of Sulaymaniyah, was a brave move. Of the 300 delegates who packed the auditorium, two-thirds were women; the front row was taken up by male government ministers, including the deputy prime minister, Qubad Talabani. Sofia\u2019s founder, Lanja Khawe, opened the event. I had met Khawe the day before to discuss logistics. She was clearly upset when she arrived at the cafe, explaining that one of the speakers, a senior academic, had pulled out because of the \u201cdirection of the event\u201d. \u201cThey think we are whores because we are feminists\u201d, said Khawe. I had already heard some of the women in the group were scared of being targeted by men in so-called \u201chonour\u201d attacks after speaking out against male violence. Khawe, a 26-year-old lawyer, has been an active feminist for a decade. She has worked with incarcerated sex trafficking victims, and provided pro-bono legal support to women on low incomes experiencing domestic violence. In 2016, she founded the Sofia Society, primarily to promote literacy and raise awareness among women. In 2017, Sofia, active in a number of cities across Kurdistan, ran a social media campaign against sexual harassment , calling on women not to be afraid to share photos of themselves to combat the culture of abuse. The hashtag #Kurdistanwomenpower was used by hundreds of women. Violence against women in Kurdistan is pandemic, but \u2013 I am told \u2013 there is little political will, even among senior women in the government, to address it. To maintain independence and freedom of expression, Sofia has chosen not to seek funding from the Kurdish government, political parties or international organisations. The conference was funded by donations. Why was the conference timely? Although a couple of male delegates asked why \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d were being prioritised when Rojava was being bombed, many are aware that sexual violence is an everyday reality for women in the region, including as a weapon of war. Both the Kurdistan regional government and the UN have poured money into initiatives to reduce sexual violence and honour killing. But the problem, according to figures from 2018, seems to be getting worse. In the first 10 months of 2018, sexual violence against women in the Kurdistan region increased, both in public and private settings. A total of 91 women were killed, or killed themselves, and 203 women suffered serious injury through burns. Recorded sexal assault cases numbered 87, and well over 7,000 women disclosed that they had experienced physical violence by men. Legislation on violence against women is inadequate, as is the police response, so only a tiny minority of sexual violence survivors actually report to an official body. The conference broke new ground. For the very first time in Kurdistan, the voices of survivors of sexual violence were heard publicly. As the gathering opened, a screen was erected in the corner of the stage behind which woman after woman, their voices distorted to protect their anonymity, told their stories. One spoke about enduring rape; she ended by saying: \u201cThis man is now in the government, he is a legislator, a lawmaker.\u201d I was there to speak about trafficking of women into the sex trade, which is rife across Iraq and through Kurdistan. There is little provision for the victims, and the one shelter for women rescued from pimping gangs has remained empty. Last year, a senior police officer in Sulaymaniyah gave a statement in which he claimed there were no brothels in the city, and no trafficking. As I told the audience, it took me only 10 minutes to find advertising for escort agencies and brothels only minutes from where the conference was being held. Other presentations focused on domestic violence, femicide and sexual assault. Throughout, the speakers suggested potential remedies, such as new laws, deterrents and punishments for the perpetrators, and better support for the victims. \u201cThe shame and stigma should be where it belongs,\u201d said Mahmoud, \u201con the men responsible and not the women.\u201d One question for me came from a member of the Iraqi Men\u2019s Association. He appeared quite angered by my suggestion that men have no right to pay for sex and told me: \u201cWe have the right to practise sex. The wives are sexually uneducated. What are we supposed to do?\u201d The majority of comments from the audience were from men. As Khawe said: \u201cWe have a long way to go, but this is a great start.\u201d The next day, I met with Mahmoud and 30 Sophia members in a nearby restaurant to share ideas and contacts for further activism to end male violence. Khawe was jubilant but exhausted, throwing out suggestions to run girls groups in schools, and asking how best to approach sensitive topics with teachers. I left Kurdistan feeling optimistic that this inspiring group of young women could become the future of feminism in the region. As Khawe said: \u201cWe have a long way to go, but this is a great start.\u201d",

It can illuminate where political commentary sometimes falls short. It examines with precision while screaming tabloid headlines cite unnamed sources without question. It aids empathy, and distils emotions in ways that vividly encapsulate a moment in time.</p> <p>When I read Vidyan Ravinthiran\u2019s TS Eliot prize-shortlisted The Million-Petalled Flower of Being Here, a book of sonnets for his wife, I gain a glimpse of the life of a mixed-race couple living in the north, and how it must have felt on that day in 2016, standing at Durham station. \u201cWe glance from face to face / guess how each voted,\u201d he writes, in the poem Brexit, before saying that, \u201cIt seems to me my Facebook friends down south are mad / at finding themselves, all of a sudden, a minority / in their own country\u201d. The morning after the referendum, I awoke to the sound of a woman hollering, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken our country back!\u201d That evening, the poet Anthony Anaxagorou was in an Uber, though there is nothing in his poem of the same title \u2013 from the collection After the Formalities \u2013 itself to suggest the day, we learn it in a footnote. He writes: \u201cto our right / a van pulls up / two men / motion / to lower / windows / in rain / he does / we do / go home / home / go home / laughing / up / a storm / front\u201d. In a 2017 special issue of Poem, edited by Fiona Sampson, Mona Arshi and Aisha Gill, collecting women\u2019s responses to Brexit, I read in One of Every Two how Nazneen Ahmed felt: \u201cI step onto the bus more warily today.

Her poem <a href=\"https://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/assembly-lines-1166\" title=\"\">UnWeather</a> is a response to the referendum result, about language and its origins, how it pilfers and overlaps, \u201cmackled together with flints and flaps\u201d. \u201cEach leaf of English borrowed from / a starry European library of tongues, / library card now revoked,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>\u201cPoetry seemed the only way to explore and comprehend the complexity of Brexit and the referendum result \u2013 but also to process some of the emotions around it \u2013 fear, anger, grief,\u201d Commane tells me. \u201cPoetry is a way of working things out and, because it can contain the kind of contradictions and multiplicities that our more oppositional political and social discourses often can\u2019t, with their binary choices of yes/no, for/against, leave/remain, it\u2019s also space in which language helps us to find a form of truth for ourselves; a way of naming and containing what often feels uncontainable or incomprehensible.\u201d</p> <p>The Brexit debate is one in which we are again and again presented with apparently simple narratives, easy answers to a complex problem. Yet poetry offers no such easy answers, and perhaps slightly paradoxically, that\u2019s why it can be comforting. As Commane suggests, it\u2019s a way of processing, even if we never come to a clear conclusion. In a polemical climate, this is especially appealing.</p> <p>Of course, there is pleasure and catharsis to be found in defiantly political poetry, too, such as <a href=\"https://www.lukewright.co.uk/the-panel-edit/\" title=\"\">Luke Wright\u2019s The Panel</a>, a blistering diatribe written in 2014 that foreshadows Brexit with furious accuracy, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJX5XHnONTI\" title=\"\">Hollie McNish\u2019s Mathematics</a>. Spoken-word poetry lends itself well to politics, and the anger of it can be cathartic. Indeed, a mass sort of catharsis took place at Glastonbury in 2017, when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRULtXn6W0s\" title=\"\">Kate Tempest performed People\u2019s Faces</a> and audience members were moved to tears. \u201cWas that a pivotal historical moment we just went stumbling past? / Well, here we are, dancing in the rumbling dark,\u201d says Tempest. But there is hope there: \u201cI can feel things changing / Even when I\u2019m weak and I\u2019m breaking\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s nearly three and a half years since the referendum on leaving the EU.

When I read Vidyan Ravinthiran\u2019s TS Eliot prize-shortlisted The Million-Petalled Flower of Being Here, a book of sonnets for his wife, I gain a glimpse of the life of a mixed-race couple living in the north, and how it must have felt on that day in 2016, standing at Durham station. \u201cWe glance from face to face / guess how each voted,\u201d he writes, in the poem Brexit, before saying that, \u201cIt seems to me my Facebook friends down south are mad / at finding themselves, all of a sudden, a minority / in their own country\u201d. The morning after the referendum, I awoke to the sound of a woman hollering, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken our country back!\u201d That evening, the poet Anthony Anaxagorou was in an Uber, though there is nothing in his poem of the same title \u2013 from the collection After the Formalities \u2013 itself to suggest the day, we learn it in a footnote. He writes: \u201cto our right / a van pulls up / two men / motion / to lower / windows / in rain / he does / we do / go home / home / go home / laughing / up / a storm / front\u201d. In a 2017 special issue of Poem, edited by Fiona Sampson, Mona Arshi and Aisha Gill, collecting women\u2019s responses to Brexit, I read in One of Every Two how Nazneen Ahmed felt: \u201cI step onto the bus more warily today. I keep my head down. I feel my heart beating double time in my chest.\u201d Poetry sales have been booming of late, aided by new audiences offered up by the internet and its shareability through social media platforms. Small presses are flourishing, spoken-word poetry can go viral. The uncertain times in which we live must surely also be a factor in poetry\u2019s newfound popularity. The Midlands-based poet Jane Commane\u2019s collection, Assembly Lines, tells of life in the post-industrial towns of the Midlands, those so-called left-behind communities. Her poem UnWeather is a response to the referendum result, about language and its origins, how it pilfers and overlaps, \u201cmackled together with flints and flaps\u201d. \u201cEach leaf of English borrowed from / a starry European library of tongues, / library card now revoked,\u201d she writes. \u201cPoetry seemed the only way to explore and comprehend the complexity of Brexit and the referendum result \u2013 but also to process some of the emotions around it \u2013 fear, anger, grief,\u201d Commane tells me. \u201cPoetry is a way of working things out and, because it can contain the kind of contradictions and multiplicities that our more oppositional political and social discourses often can\u2019t, with their binary choices of yes/no, for/against, leave/remain, it\u2019s also space in which language helps us to find a form of truth for ourselves; a way of naming and containing what often feels uncontainable or incomprehensible.\u201d The Brexit debate is one in which we are again and again presented with apparently simple narratives, easy answers to a complex problem. Yet poetry offers no such easy answers, and perhaps slightly paradoxically, that\u2019s why it can be comforting. As Commane suggests, it\u2019s a way of processing, even if we never come to a clear conclusion. In a polemical climate, this is especially appealing. Of course, there is pleasure and catharsis to be found in defiantly political poetry, too, such as Luke Wright\u2019s The Panel, a blistering diatribe written in 2014 that foreshadows Brexit with furious accuracy, or Hollie McNish\u2019s Mathematics. Spoken-word poetry lends itself well to politics, and the anger of it can be cathartic. Indeed, a mass sort of catharsis took place at Glastonbury in 2017, when Kate Tempest performed People\u2019s Faces and audience members were moved to tears. \u201cWas that a pivotal historical moment we just went stumbling past? / Well, here we are, dancing in the rumbling dark,\u201d says Tempest. But there is hope there: \u201cI can feel things changing / Even when I\u2019m weak and I\u2019m breaking\u201d. It\u2019s nearly three and a half years since the referendum on leaving the EU. In that time there has been so much poetry written as a real-time response to breaking news \u2013 the website New Boots and Pantisocracies and Nick Asbury\u2019s Realtime Notes being just two examples of this poem-a-day method. From The Brexit Book of the Dead by Rishi Dastidar to Over Seas, by Ed Lvker, and Great again, our island nation, by Martha Sprackland, Brexit has seen responses by poets from a variety of backgrounds and walks of life, from all over the country and beyond. In her poem, Sprackland writes that \u201cthe pound slumps like a drunk. I\u2019m scared of division, scared of men\u201d. I\u2019ve felt that fear, many of us have, but poetry can be a kind of antidote. \u201cThe country\u2019s / lonely with itself and howls / for something, like a dog gone old / in the head,\u201d writes David Clarke in The Vision of Albion. Poetry is not the solution to that howl, but it helps. \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 8 November 2019 because an earlier version credited only one of the three editors of a 2017 special issue of Poem.

This format requires news stories to be summed up in two- or three-sentence snippets for people who may not be consuming much other news \u2013 removing nuance and rewarding parties with clear, sharp messages. Radio and television stations are subject to strict broadcasting impartiality rules during the election, which Labour believe helped them enormously during the last general election by restricting the ability of the Conservatives to set the agenda.

This passive way of obtaining information means the instant emotional impact of an amusing meme or a shocking headline is likely to spread far wider and faster than any policy-heavy political speech \u2013 which helps explains the potency of an image of Jacob Rees-Mogg reclining on a bench in the House of Commons. This is harder for centralised political media units to control, forcing a change in how they operate. One serving Labour political adviser pointed out that just as the editorial whims of the Sun could dictate the political policy of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour, so the whims of Facebook\u2019s newsfeed algorithm inevitably shapes some of the policies chosen by Corbyn\u2019s Labour. New forms of social media Since the last UK election there has been a massive uptick in the use of WhatsApp groups as a news source. This form of communication is hard for political parties to influence directly, while also allowing disinformation to flourish. Viral news sites The online playing field has also been levelled since 2017. During that snap election a raft of pro-Corbyn websites such as the Canary and Another Angry Voice dominated online debate but they have seen their audiences reduced by changes to Facebook\u2019s algorithm. In the same period many pro-Brexit campaign groups have built up substantial audiences on Facebook. The site is increasingly seen by campaign groups as a way of reaching older, less-engaged voters, with younger voters more likely to use Instagram. At the same time the new Johnson-led government has hired a series of 20-something advisers with intimate knowledge of right-wing blogs and experience of making messages go viral in a world where the battle is to grab attention at all costs. The Times claimed that Downing Street had polled views on issues such as transgender rights \u201cto see whether they can be weaponised against Labour in northern working-class constituencies\u201d. Online political advertising The other, completely distinct, strand of online campaigning is the promotion of paid-for political ads \u2013 largely the preserve of Facebook and Instagram\u2019s combined advertising platform, which attracted \u00a33m of spending in the last election. Tory HQ election planning has been left to Isaac Levido, a protege of long-term Tory adviser Sir Lynton Crosby, who insiders say has inherited a rusty campaign operation from the May era. Levido recently helped to run the successful election campaign for the right-wing coalition in Australia, aided by a relentless focus on message discipline and fake claims about tax rises spread widely on Facebook. Sam Jeffers of transparency group WhoTargetsMe, who is encouraging people to sign up to his service and help his outfit track political Facebook adverts, said the best approach for political parties \u201cis not micro-targeting \u2013 it\u2019s effective messaging, well optimised and repeated ad infinitum\u201d. When Facebook finally released data on Vote Leave\u2019s controversial 2016 campaign it showed that rather than running tens of thousands of micro-targeted adverts as speculated, the successful pro-Brexit campaign spent millions of pounds to promote a relatively small number of core messages on immigration and NHS funding. Craig Elder, who helped pioneer Facebook ad campaigns for the Conservatives in the 2015 general election, said: \u201cIt\u2019s never quite as sophisticated as people think it is. It comes down to the principles of good old-fashioned advertising. When we start to get into the idea of \u2018shadowy mind control with a million data points\u2019 we\u2019re either talking an aspiration or unbelievable bollocks.\u201d He said that Facebook had cracked down on parties using external data sources since the 2017 general election. Instead, the real question was how much parties were willing to commit to online advertising, with hard cash often being the main difference in terms of audience reach. \u201cIt\u2019s more sexy to write about astrophysics and micro-targeting,\u201d he said. \u201cIn reality it\u2019s not much more sophisticated than a Colgate ad \u2013 you need a really great message that connects with people and you need to pay to get it in front of as many people as you can.\u201d However, he insisted no advertising can counteract widespread negative coverage: \u201cIf a major figure from outside politics \u2013 a Stormzy, for example \u2013 is using their huge online reach to speak with an authentic voice and mobilise their followers against you, then that can be worth as much or more than great ads, good targeting and a really big budget. Parties also have to accept that almost all of that will be happening completely outside their control, and it adds a huge degree of unpredictability to the online battle.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 November 2019 to remove a reference to Sean Topham and Ben Guerin.",

I understand there may be exceptional circumstances where there\u2019s a grave risk and you need to do it, but I would expect that number to be much lower than 122.\u201d Voltz said Labor would push for a review of the legislation guiding strip-searches, saying it was not specific enough and that as a result the police interpretation of when a search is justified was \u201cvery loose\u201d. \u201cA review of the act is worthwhile to clarify what the procedures are and what people\u2019s rights are and to ensure no one is over-stepping that,\u201d she said. Under the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act, or Lepra, police in NSW are allowed to conduct a strip-search outside a police station if the \u201cseriousness and urgency of the circumstances\u201d make it necessary. Critics have long argued that \u201cbroadly defined\u201d threshold fails to give police clear guidance on when a strip-search should be carried out. In August, the Redfern Legal Centre released a report with the University of New South Wales which warned imprecise legal thresholds meant unlawful use of the practice is \u201cpotentially widespread\u201d. That fear was borne out last month when the state\u2019s police watchdog, the Law Enforcement and Conduct Commission, held public hearings into the potentially illegal strip-search of a 16-year-old girl at a music festival in 2018. It heard many officers were not aware of their responsibilities under the act, and one officer admitted all 19 searches he conducted at that music festival may have been illegal. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the LECC inquiry that the police involved didn\u2019t understand or know what their responsibilities under the act were and how it should be administered,\u201d Voltz said. \u201cAs a result of that you\u2019ve got these police protocols which are very loose, there are these issues around how the act is being interpreted, things like making people squat during a search, and we need more clarity so that those powers are clearly spelled out.\u201d Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that two 12-year-old girls have been strip-searched by police in NSW in the last three years.

      "body": "<p>Good morning and welcome to the first full day of the official election campaign \u2013 and our first special election edition of the Guardian morning briefing. As we head towards 12 December there will be more and more election news, so the briefing will reflect that. You can consider this your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/07/general-election-sajid-javid-and-john-mcdonnell-come-out-fighting-on-economy-live-news\">jumping off point for our daily live coverage</a>. And we will continue to bring you a taste of the rest of the news from the UK and beyond. </p> \n<h2>What\u2019s going on?</h2> \n<p>The debate about the direction of the Labour party under <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> looks set to kick off again after <strong>Tom Watson </strong>announced last night that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-to-quit-as-labour-deputy-leader-and-stand-down-as-mp\">he will step down </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-to-quit-as-labour-deputy-leader-and-stand-down-as-mp\">as deputy leader</a>. Watson \u2013 who has spent 35 years in full-time politics, and has represented West Bromwich East as its MP since 2001 \u2013 has repeatedly clashed with Corbyn, including over the Labour leader\u2019s Brexit stance and handling of antisemitism. One senior Labour figure said Watson\u2019s announcement had led to \u201ca great sense of desolation and abandonment sweeping the moderates\u201d in the party. Watson insisted his resignation was \u201cpersonal, not political\u201d and said he would \u201cspend this election fighting for brilliant Labour candidates and a better future for our country\u201d. Corbyn thanked Watson, saying: \u201cFew people have given as much to the Labour movement as you have.\u201d For his part Watson says he has a lot of irons in the fire, including training to become a gym instructor and a book about weight loss coming out in January.</p> \n<p><strong>Boris Johnson </strong>has kicked off the Conservative election campaign with a speech in Birmingham that he hopes will give his party some positive momentum after a series of damaging gaffes in recent days. These include Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/rees-mogg-keeps-low-profile-after-grenfell-comments-outrage\">suggestion that victims of the Grenfell Tower fire lacked common sense</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/alun-cairns-welsh-secretary-resigns-from-cabinet-over-trial-allegations\">Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, having to resign</a> over his knowledge of a former aide\u2019s role in allegedly sabotaging a rape trial. Johnson came out swinging at Corbyn, whom he accused of planning tax rises to fund \u201cderanged\u201d nationalism; at parliament, which he said was \u201cparalysed, blocked, generally incapable of digestive function, as an anaconda that has swallowed a tapir\u201d; and without naming him, at Nigel Farage, as the Brexit party leader has refused requests from pro-leave Tories to stand down Brexit party candidates in their seats. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the barricades,\u201d Johnson told supporters.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"630912eb19b108c073f3c65f687a810b774eb226\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/630912eb19b108c073f3c65f687a810b774eb226/0_228_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaks at the Conservative party election launch in Birmingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaks at the Conservative party election launch in Birmingham.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>At a glance</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/lib-dems-plaid-cymru-and-greens-launch-pro-remain-electoral-pact\">have agreed to a plan</a> to step aside for each other in 60 seats in England and Wales, to give a free run to one pro-remain party in each constituency.</p></li> \n <li><p>The Liberal Democrats have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/lib-dems-accused-over-misleading-and-irresponsible-leaflets\">defended themselves against accusations</a> they are distributing \u201cmisleading and irresponsible\u201d election leaflets that misrepresent newspaper reports, including a quote from leader Jo Swinson in the Guardian, as endorsements of the party.</p></li> \n <li><p>Experts have hit out at the government for refusing to publish a report into Russian infiltration of British politics, saying Downing Street is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/no-10-accused-of-ignoring-evidence-of-russian-interference\">ignoring evidence of Russian interference</a> in the Brexit referendum.</p></li> \n <li><p>Tom Watson has been lauded as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-an-mp-at-the-heart-of-labours-key-battles\">\u201cimmovable force of Labour politics\u201d</a> \u2013 see his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-career-in-pictures\">career in pictures here</a>.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>The day ahead</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Sajid Javid and his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/sajid-javid-and-john-mcdonnell-shift-battle-to-economy\">both set to give speeches in the north-west of England</a> this morning.</p></li> \n <li><p>Javid is expected to hammer Labour on the economy, while McDonnell will announce a \u00a3100bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d to \u201crepair the fabric that the Tories have torn apart\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>At 10am the Scottish Liberal Democrats will launch their election campaign.</p></li> \n <li><p>Boris Johnson is on a whirlwind trip around the north-east, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p></li> \n <li><p>Jeremy Corbyn will speak at a rally in Manchester at 7.30pm.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Best of the rest</h2> \n<p>&gt; In the Trump-Ukraine scandal: the US president demanded his Kyiv counterpart \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/06/trump-impeachment-inquiry-ukraine-testimony-bill-taylor\">opening investigations of Biden</a> and 2016 election interference\u201d, a top diplomat has testified.</p> \n<p>&gt; Two ex-Twitter employees have been charged with spying for allegedly obtaining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/06/twitter-spy-saudi-arabia-workers-charged\">account details of critics of the Saudi regime</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning and welcome to the first full day of the official election campaign \u2013 and our first special election edition of the Guardian morning briefing. As we head towards 12 December there will be more and more election news, so the briefing will reflect that. You can consider this your jumping off point for our daily live coverage. And we will continue to bring you a taste of the rest of the news from the UK and beyond. What\u2019s going on? The debate about the direction of the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn looks set to kick off again after Tom Watson announced last night that he will step down as deputy leader. Watson \u2013 who has spent 35 years in full-time politics, and has represented West Bromwich East as its MP since 2001 \u2013 has repeatedly clashed with Corbyn, including over the Labour leader\u2019s Brexit stance and handling of antisemitism. One senior Labour figure said Watson\u2019s announcement had led to \u201ca great sense of desolation and abandonment sweeping the moderates\u201d in the party. Watson insisted his resignation was \u201cpersonal, not political\u201d and said he would \u201cspend this election fighting for brilliant Labour candidates and a better future for our country\u201d. Corbyn thanked Watson, saying: \u201cFew people have given as much to the Labour movement as you have.\u201d For his part Watson says he has a lot of irons in the fire, including training to become a gym instructor and a book about weight loss coming out in January. Boris Johnson has kicked off the Conservative election campaign with a speech in Birmingham that he hopes will give his party some positive momentum after a series of damaging gaffes in recent days. These include Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion that victims of the Grenfell Tower fire lacked common sense and Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, having to resign over his knowledge of a former aide\u2019s role in allegedly sabotaging a rape trial. Johnson came out swinging at Corbyn, whom he accused of planning tax rises to fund \u201cderanged\u201d nationalism; at parliament, which he said was \u201cparalysed, blocked, generally incapable of digestive function, as an anaconda that has swallowed a tapir\u201d; and without naming him, at Nigel Farage, as the Brexit party leader has refused requests from pro-leave Tories to stand down Brexit party candidates in their seats. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the barricades,\u201d Johnson told supporters. At a glance Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens have agreed to a plan to step aside for each other in 60 seats in England and Wales, to give a free run to one pro-remain party in each constituency. The Liberal Democrats have defended themselves against accusations they are distributing \u201cmisleading and irresponsible\u201d election leaflets that misrepresent newspaper reports, including a quote from leader Jo Swinson in the Guardian, as endorsements of the party. Experts have hit out at the government for refusing to publish a report into Russian infiltration of British politics, saying Downing Street is ignoring evidence of Russian interference in the Brexit referendum. Tom Watson has been lauded as an \u201cimmovable force of Labour politics\u201d \u2013 see his career in pictures here. The day ahead Sajid Javid and his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, are both set to give speeches in the north-west of England this morning. Javid is expected to hammer Labour on the economy, while McDonnell will announce a \u00a3100bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d to \u201crepair the fabric that the Tories have torn apart\u201d. At 10am the Scottish Liberal Democrats will launch their election campaign. Boris Johnson is on a whirlwind trip around the north-east, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn will speak at a rally in Manchester at 7.30pm. Best of the rest &gt; In the Trump-Ukraine scandal: the US president demanded his Kyiv counterpart \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference\u201d, a top diplomat has testified. &gt; Two ex-Twitter employees have been charged with spying for allegedly obtaining account details of critics of the Saudi regime. The FBI says targets included Omar Abdulaziz, a peer of Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist killed by the Saudi government. &gt; John Lewis says its trucks will run on carbon-neutral cow manure methane by 2021. Heineken is ditching plastic \u201ctoppers\u201d on multipacks of beer and replacing them with cardboard. \u201cClimate strike\u201d is the Collins Dictionary\u2019s word of the year. Today in Focus podcast: Online dirty tricks of the election The Guardian\u2019s media editor, Jim Waterson, tells Anushka Asthana how political parties are pushing the limits of what is allowed in the unregulated space of social media. Plus: Sabine Rennefanz on the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Lunchtime read: Who is the real Dice Man? A search for the mysterious author of a counterculture classic led to someone else entirely. Or did it? Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re on the hunt for the elusive writer behind a disturbing cult novel. Sport Manchester City held on for a 1-1 draw against Atalanta after an injury to Ederson and a red card to substitute goalkeeper Claudio Bravo forced defender Kyle Walker to go in goal for the final 10 minutes at the San Siro. Elsewhere in the Champions League, two goals from Son Heung-min and one each from Giovani Lo Celso and Christian Eriksen gave Tottenham a comfortable 4-0 victory at Red Star Belgrade, but Arsenal were pegged back in their Europa League clash with Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es following Bruno Duarte\u2019s stoppage-time scissor-kick. Saracens face a \u00a350,000 fine after failing to turn up for the launch of the European Champions Cup in Cardiff where, as holders, they would have had prime billing. England are likely to recall Jonny Bairstow and Chris Jordan to help them save the T20 series against New Zealand in Napier but Tom Banton and Matt Parkinson are set for another chance. Racing\u2019s ruling body is mulling over plans to tighten up its regulation of syndicates, a hot topic in the wake of the drama around the Irish-based Supreme Horse Racing Club, which is unable to run its horses. Nicola Adams, the Yorkshire boxer who has announced her retirement, forged her star quality with a mix of ruthlessness in the ring and kindness and optimism outside it. And Liverpool\u2019s Sadio Man\u00e9 has acknowledged Pep Guardiola\u2019s claim that his diving means the spotlight will be on him against Manchester City on Sunday but admitted he would \u201cdive again\u201d if it resulted in a penalty being awarded. Business After Marks &amp; Spencer reported a slump in clothing sales, our City commentator, Nils Pratley, casts a sceptical eye over the numbers and warns that its chief executive, Steve Rowe, is running out of time to fix the deep-seated problems in the retailer\u2019s fashion offer. On the markets, activity in Asia was subdued overnight as investors awaited more details on a possible US-China trade deal (we\u2019ve heard that one before though). That means the FTSE100 is set to open fairly flat while the pound is on $1.285 and \u20ac1.161. The papers The departure of Labour\u2019s un-Corbynite deputy leader is the splash on the front page of the Guardian, which says the resignation takes place as \u201cCorbyn strengthens grip\u201d over the party ahead of the election. The story also leads the Telegraph \u2013 \u201cWatson quits Commons\u201d \u2013 which says Corbyn\u2019s campaign is at risk of \u201csliding into chaos\u201d if other moderate MPs follow. The Times goes very literal: \u201cWatson quits as deputy leader of Labour party\u201d, and cites his clashes with Corbyn as well as the \u201cVIP sex case fiasco\u201d surrounding the lies of Carl Beech. The i says Labour has been left \u201cstunned as Watson quits\u201d. The Mail calls it all an \u201celection calamity\u201d for Corbyn and says: \u201cThree years of infighting has left Mr Watson isolated as Labour\u2019s last senior moderate.\u201d The Mirror puts \u201cWatson quit shock\u201d in a skybox but its lead story takes a positive line on Labour\u2019s election campaign: \u201cPower to the north\u201d as the shadow treasurer, John McDonnell, pledged to \u201cpump $150bn\u201d into the regions. The FT has \u201cLabour\u2019s vow to take borrowing to \u00a3400bn fires spending battle\u201d. The Express leads with Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign launch entreaty to \u201cCome with us or get horror show\u201d. The line feels dated \u2013 wasn\u2019t Halloween, like, a week ago? Lastly we have the Sun with \u201cKnifemen 0, Gunners 1\u201d with a video still of Arsenal footballer Sead Kola\u0161inac seeing off scooter thugs who were trying to rob him and Mesut \u00d6zil.

      "bodyText": "The Australian Electoral Commission has argued no reasonable voter could have changed their vote as a result of Liberal signs at polling booths that looked like official AEC signs and directed voters that the \u201ccorrect way\u201d to vote was for the Liberal candidate. The federal court, acting as the court of disputed returns, is hearing whether two signs written in traditional and simplified Chinese characters used at polling booths in the electorates of Chisholm and Kooyong at May\u2019s federal election should lead to the election results being voided \u2013 a move which would force treasurer Josh Frydenberg and MP Gladys Liu to a by-election in those seats. The applicants, Kooyong candidate Oliver Yates and climate campaigner Vanessa Garbett, have argued the signs breached section 329(1) of the Electoral Act, which makes it an offence to print material likely to deceive a voter. In previous cases the law has been interpreted narrowly, prohibiting the misleading of voters in relation to the process of casting their vote but not banning otherwise misleading or untruthful material. In court on Wednesday, the Liberal\u2019s acting state director at the time of the election, Simon Frost, admitted the signs in question were designed to look like AEC signage. James Renwick SC, representing the Australian Electoral Commission argued on Thursday that even if the signs looked like AEC signs, people who turn up to vote on election day have some idea of how the voting process in Australia works. A \u201cliterally incredible\u201d sign made to look like the AEC would not, on its own, have been convincing for an ordinary, reasonable voter. \u201cThis is the AEC , an independent, non-partisan body, somehow telling people how to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone knows your vote is your own in a secret ballot.\u201d The AEC has argued the case should be dismissed. Renwick said the proposition put forward in the petition required Australian citizens to believe Australia is a one-party state, and the AEC was telling people to vote for the Liberal Party. Renwick also argued that the number of voters who speak Mandarin or Cantonese but not English in the two electorates was small enough, based on Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, to not have swayed the election in either seat. This was disputed by the counsel for the applicants, Lisa De Ferrari SC, who argued that in the Chisholm election there were just over 500 votes that could have changed the outcome. She said 20% of people in the electorate speak Mandarin and Cantonese, so the upper limit of people who could have been misled by the signs in the electorate was 19,500. This meant that only 3% of those people would need to have been misled in order to change the outcome in Chisholm. In Kooyong, where the percentage of Mandarin and Cantonese speakers sits at 12%, Frydenberg won by more than 5,000 votes. De Ferrari admitted the \u201cmathematics were different\u201d for this electorate. Counsel representing Frydenberg and Liu, Philip Solomon QC, argued there were simply not enough voters that could have been swayed to change the outcome in Kooyong. He argued that instead the case was being pursued for \u201cother reasons\u201d and he would seek to have the case dismissed with costs. Solomon will address the other arguments raised in court on Friday.",

This is clearly aimed at business users \u2013 including people like me \u2013 but it does suggest that Android will ultimately offer the best experience with the whole Microsoft ecosystem, including Windows PCs, software and Azure cloud services. This reduces your problem to picking the best mid-range Android phone.</p> <p>You haven\u2019t given me a number, except to say that \u00a3700 is too much. This puts you out of the iPhone market, where the cheapest system I could recommend \u2013 last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xr\">iPhone XR</a> \u2013 costs \u00a3629. (And I\u2019d rather recommend this year\u2019s almost identical <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11\">iPhone 11</a> with better cameras and a faster processor for an extra \u00a3100.) You may well have paid about half that for your Lumia 820. Thanks to the advances in smartphone technology over the past seven years, you can now buy something better for up to half the price of that.</p> <h2><strong>Android options</strong></h2> <p>Android smartphones run the gamut from cheap and nasty to superb but relatively expensive. While Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 Plus is at or near the top of the tree, the <a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/uk/oneplus-7t-pro\">OnePlus 7T Pro</a> is probably the best value, with 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage for only \u00a3699. For comparison, the similarly-priced iPhone XR has 3GB of memory and 64GB of storage.</p> <p>But you can certainly get something that will meet your needs for about \u00a3200 to \u00a3250, if not less. At that price, you lose some processor speed, fast graphics, storage space, and some screen and camera quality. However, all the major brands I\u2019ve seen have been robust enough, and fast enough, for ordinary purposes.</p> <p>In the mid-range, I tend to lean towards Motorola as a fairly safe bet. I\u2019ve previously recommended various G models, and I currently own and use a special edition dual sim Moto G6 (4GB/64GB), for which I paid \u00a3238. It has since been superseded by various models of the G7 and G8. The <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_g8_plus-9916.php\">Moto G8 Plus</a> was only released on 25 October, so I haven\u2019t seen one, but the latest spec includes a 48 megapixel camera, as well as boring old stuff that I still like: a headphone jack, FM radio, internal SD card slot (up to 500GB) and a reasonably stock version of Android. It may not be the best mid-range smartphone you can buy, but based on my previous experience with the brand, it will be good value at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Motorola-U-Notch-display-speakers-Smartphone/dp/B07YP2W8MS\">\u00a3239.99</a>. Alternatively, you could pick up a single-sim <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/motorola-6-2-Inch-Android-Sim-Free-Smartphone-Black/dp/B07N8LY9BS\">G7 Power</a> (4GB/64GB) \u2013 which appeared earlier this year, and runs the same Android 9 \u2013 for \u00a3159.95. Alternative retailers are, of course, available if you shop around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8bf9a7dfa4d7df5b23d85385079ed89325ab5ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8bf9a7dfa4d7df5b23d85385079ed89325ab5ac/36_0_748_449/500.jpg\" alt=\"Motorola Moto G8 Plus\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Motorola Moto G8 Plus: good value at \u00a3239.99.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Motorola</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of Motorola\u2019s advantages in the UK market is that it has a venerable American brand name.

The version with 4GB/64GB is not such good value at \u00a3259, and the gold-coloured model even worse at \u00a3319.</p> <p>Xiaomi also sells smartphones under the Redmi brand label. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Xiaomi-Redmi-Snapdragon-4000mAh-Black/dp/B07PLXLGJR\">Redmi Note 7</a> is still an option at \u00a3160 (4GB/64GB) or<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Redmi-Note-128GB-Snapdragon-4000mAh/dp/B07PMCT5CZ\"> \u00a3185</a> (4GB/128GB), but the upgraded <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Redmi-Note-6-53inch-45oomAh-Black/dp/B07Y81H95B\">Note 8 Pro</a> was released here in September (\u00a3225).

      "body": "<p>When my friend Chris lost his job a few years back, he became quite depressed and anxious, and so decided to get a pet, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jul/14/when-will-i-be-famous-oscar-the-whippets-bid-for-instagram-fame\">whippet</a> called Edie. Chris looks really cool \u2013 tall and confident, with silver hair \u2013 and so is Edie. I decided to do a day-in-the-life project with them. He works in a call centre, and I spent two months going to his house every week on his day off. Chris made sure to wear the same outfit and Edie would wait at the window for me.</p> <p>I followed them around Sunderland as they did what they would normally do. They went for a walk along the sea, to the shop or the arcade, to the cafe. \u201cI\u2019ve been going to that cafe my whole life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where I used to take dates.\u201d</p> <p>At the shop, he would usually tie Edie up outside. One day he said: \u201cOK, she knows you now. This time I\u2019m going to give you the lead.\u201d I\u2019m tall and thin, and when he came out, he was laughing. \u201cYou look like two whippets together,\u201d he said. I\u2019ve always had cats, but Edie made me want to get a dog.</p> <p>Like almost all of the pictures in the series, this shot was of just a moment. What makes it for me is that it is such a typically British seaside arcade. It is an environment I know well. I\u2019ve long lived in Whitley Bay, in the north of England. And I spent my whole childhood going to stay at my grandmother\u2019s in Aberdeen. She lived on the 18th floor of a tower block \u2013 you could see the sea from it. My mother would take us to the seaside cafes she ate at when she was young. My brother and I would have knickerbocker glories, then go to the arcades. I think that is why ice-cream vans, chintzy rollercoasters, inflatables, vintage cars \u2013 these are always things that catch my eye now.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Chris told Julie the project was called One Man and His Dog \u2013 not One Woman and Two Dogs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This wasn\u2019t the first shoot I\u2019d done with Chris. He\u2019s been in some of my ad campaigns. On the very first one we did, the models thought he was a model too, because of the way he conducts himself. It was a betting advertising campaign, and the creative director wanted British gangster-movie types. \u201cThey need confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to know what they\u2019re doing. We might not get that from the model agency.\u201d When I messaged Chris he said: \u201cI\u2019m a member of that betting agency. I play poker every day.\u201d I guess the slot machines are an extension of his love of betting.</p> <p>Chris doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend at the moment. He\u2019s got Edie now, and says: \u201cI don\u2019t even need a girl.\u201d She has brought happiness back into his life. At one point, I thought he might be in a relationship with his next-door neighbour Julie. She is his best friend and has two grey whippets. Before I did this project, I\u2019d shot the three dogs together once, and when I was going to Chris\u2019s house every week, Julie\u2019s whippets would also always be at the window. I think Julie was quite jealous. She said: \u201cWhy not my dogs?\u201d Chris told her it was because the project is called One Man and His Dog, not One Woman and Two Dogs.</p> <p>I only staged one picture, of a framed photograph of Chris and Edie on the sideboard. He didn\u2019t have a picture of them in his house, and I thought he should. So I went on his Facebook page to look for a suitable photograph, then printed it out and framed it. I brought it round and said: \u201cCan we put it here?\u201d Chris said: \u201cGarrod, that will stay there for ever now.\u201d</p> <p>When the project was finished, I told Chris that I thought we had got enough He said: \u201cDon\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t actually know what I\u2019ll do with my day off now.\u201d I\u2019ve been thinking about making a film version of the project.

So I went on his Facebook page to look for a suitable photograph, then printed it out and framed it. I brought it round and said: \u201cCan we put it here?\u201d Chris said: \u201cGarrod, that will stay there for ever now.\u201d When the project was finished, I told Chris that I thought we had got enough He said: \u201cDon\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t actually know what I\u2019ll do with my day off now.\u201d I\u2019ve been thinking about making a film version of the project. When I messaged him about it, he was like: \u201cYeah, sure. I\u2019ve still got the same clothes.\u201d \u2022 Garrod Kirkwood is a finalist in the Taylor Wessing photographic portrait prize.

Here goes nothing.</p> <h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p><strong><br></strong>I start the week by attending an Extinction Rebellion induction meeting. I have toyed with the idea of joining the movement for months, but put it off because none of my friends are members and the thought of going alone frightens me.</p> <p>In a chilly church hall, I take a seat in a circle of stacking chairs. There is a long pause while I steel myself to turn to the person next to me.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m Sirin.\u201d</p> <p>I start chatting to Ben, who has just moved into the area. He is a friendly bloke with a deep tan and a placid manner. Remembering Pan\u2019s advice, I offer something vulnerable about myself. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to come to these meetings for ages, but none of my friends wanted to come with me.\u201d My anxieties tumble out. \u201cAlso I eat meat and fly, and I\u2019m worried everyone here would judge me.\u201d</p> <p>Ben looks at me kindly. After the meeting, he waves at me from the church steps. I\u2019ll be back, I think.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p><strong><br></strong>This evening I am playing dodgeball with strangers and all I can think about is how much I don\u2019t want to do it. I was abysmal at team sports at school, and the thought of balls ricocheting around me feels like an anxiety dream. After checking the maximum velocity of a dodgeball (70mph), I panic and call Jacob, the Headshot United team coordinator, for some last-minute reassurance.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really bad,\u201d Jacob promises. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost the last nine games. Besides, you can hide at the back. There will be a few people who wear knee pads and stuff like that \u2013 try not to worry about them.\u201d</p> <p>I catch up with Jacob and his teammate, Ed, for a pre-game drink. \u201cSomeone joined us last week and said they didn\u2019t have a good time and wouldn\u2019t be coming back,\u201d says Ed. I gulp.</p> <p>Jacob senses my anxiety. \u201cIf you really are hating it, you don\u2019t have to keep playing,\u201d he says.</p> <p>We head to a nearby school gym. Playing team sports with strangers was exactly like losing my virginity: not memorably awful, but definitely not good. I cringe every time a ball thuds my way and lack the strength to make my throws clear the other side of the court. Obviously, I get hit on the head. \u201cYou took that head shot like an absolute champ,\u201d observes a teammate.</p> <p>While I didn\u2019t enjoy dodgeball \u2013 hated it, if I\u2019m honest \u2013 I loved meeting everyone. After the game (we lost), I hit the pub with Jacob and his teammate Will. \u201cYou\u2019re not the worst newcomer we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Jacob says.</p> <p>He\u2019s definitely lying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0ec9d840f30c8603b2053124dc190cd353d6673\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0ec9d840f30c8603b2053124dc190cd353d6673/0_1762_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sirin, front left, at a Crossfit class, her midweek evening outing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sirin, front left, at a Crossfit class, her midweek evening outing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sirin Kale/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p><strong><br></strong>Today I am meeting up with Emma, whom I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re going to a Crossfit class \u2013 a famously social workout, where high fives, fist bumps and (God forbid) hugs with sweaty strangers are de rigueur.</p> <p>Emma introduces me to Rich, the owner of Crossfit Shapesmiths in south London. \u201cI\u2019M SO HAPPY TO MEET YOU,\u201d Rich bellows at me. \u201cCOME HERE FOR A HUG. COME HERE!\u201d We hug. \u201cHe\u2019s like that with everyone,\u201d Emma says. \u201cHe\u2019s just really happy.\u201d</p> <p>I meet JP, who will be leading the class. The workout flies by. Emma is a sweetheart. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great!\u201d she cheers, as I flub my way through some complicated moves involving a kettlebell. \u201cGood pace!\u201d</p> <p>After the class, JP instructs us \u2013 orders, really \u2013 to high five. Old Sirin would cringe at this enforced bonhomie, but new Sirin is all high fives. I\u2019m just happy I didn\u2019t get hit in the face.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p><strong><br></strong>\u201cWhat is a weed?\u201d asks Cathy, the leader of Waltham Forest\u2019s volunteer gardening group, \u201cIt\u2019s a plant in the wrong place.\u201d</p> <p>The group meets every Thursday morning <a href=\"https://walthamforest.gov.uk/content/volunteer-gardening-lloyd-park\" title=\"\">to tend the grounds</a> behind the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/06/william-morris-gallery-museum-of-year\" title=\"W\">William Morris Gallery</a> in east London. Looking round, I can relate. I have never gardened before and most of the people here are regulars. Being a newbie among outsiders, doing something I have never done before \u2013 not my favourite thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"601cf1dafc973a457c9e84b9ad8fd0d03a81914d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/601cf1dafc973a457c9e84b9ad8fd0d03a81914d/350_705_3655_2193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sirin joined the gardening volunteers at the William Morris Gallery, east London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sirin joined the gardening volunteers at the William Morris Gallery, east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sirin Kale/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My goodness, they are a friendly bunch. We yank out weeds and fling them into a pile. It is a beautiful morning, crisp and clear. I make friends with Judith, who is retired and lives locally. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, making friends in London,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can just walk up to people in the street. They\u2019d think you were a nutter.\u201d</p> <p>After a tea break, I\u2019m promoted to planting. I try not to look at the worms that tumble from my spade. \u201cI just fling the worms away,\u201d says Judith conspiratorially. We tuck the plants into the soil together, like children being put to bed. \u201cYou\u2019ll come back, won\u2019t you?\u201d says Judith.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p><strong><br></strong>I\u2019m flagging. Pan warned me I would be tired and she was right. If my life were a night out, right now I would be sitting in the smoking area, begging a friend to fetch my coat. The last thing I want to do is hang out with a stranger.</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/18/we-just-clicked-why-i-set-out-to-find-a-new-group-of-friends-online\" title=\"b\">Bumble BFF</a>, a friendship app, I start chatting to Radhika, 25, a student from Delhi. We meet up later at an audiovisual exhibition about the natural world. It\u2019s not the most successful meeting. Radhika is lovely, but it\u2019s not the sort of place where you can chat and it\u2019s awkward to be walking in silence with someone you have just met. As a result, Radhika and I never get past first base conversationally, which makes our interaction stilted, like kissing with braces. In the gallery, the sounds of the wilderness are compressed into a bright heartbeat of lasers. Radhika says she was homesick last week \u2013 it was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2019/oct/28/diwali-celebrations-from-edinburgh-to-kathmandu-in-pictures\" title=\"d\">Diwali</a> celebration. A few friends had had a gathering, but it wasn\u2019t the same. I feel guilty for co-opting her into my experiment. Moving to a new place on your own is hard.</p> <p>A lot of my anxiety around socialising is linked to the fact that I often feel responsible for making conversation, as I do today. The encounter was wearing, probably because I already felt drained. After the exhibition, I suggest a drink, but Radhika declines. I\u2019m relieved.</p> <h2><strong>Saturday</strong></h2> <p><strong><br></strong>I wake up with a ball of dread in my stomach that won\u2019t go away . Why? I\u2019m going to a Halloween party tonight, full of people I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019ll be flying solo.</p> <p>As evening approaches, the feeling intensifies. I desperately don\u2019t want to go and find myself tidying drawers and sorting laundry until I can\u2019t put off going any longer.</p> <p>Outside the house, I text Pan for some last-minute support. \u201cARGH I DON\u2019T WANT TO GO TO THIS PARTY ON MY OWN.\u201d She texts back. \u201cTalk to three people and if they suck, you can leave. Also, ask the host to introduce you to some people.\u201d</p> <p>I take a breath and ring the bell.</p> <p>Ordinarily, the hardest part of going to a party alone is walking in, not knowing anyone. In my case, it was realising once through the door that not only did I not know anyone, they were all in fancy dress. Luckily, the host Dan (not his real name) or, rather, Emperor Caligula \u2013 takes me under his wing. He introduces me to Gosia and Ula, sisters from Poland. Pan\u2019s tip to let myself be vulnerable definitely helps: I tell Gosia and Ula about my anxieties and they look after me all evening as carefully as if I were a baby bird.</p> <p>It\u2019s a great party. There is a severed head in the freezer and drinks are served in IV bags \u2013 but I\u2019m so tired after the week\u2019s exertions that I only last a few hours before making my excuses. \u201cYour costume was awful,\u201d Dan says, walking me to the door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7952dde118bbb45c203ab4d0ba7d4ed5c9d66eb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7952dde118bbb45c203ab4d0ba7d4ed5c9d66eb7/404_1121_3032_1819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sirin Kale with Elizabeth, the friend she made on a ramble with a walking group.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sirin with Elizabeth, the friend she made on a ramble with a walking group.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sirin Kale/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sunday</strong></h2> <p><strong><br></strong>I am comfortably the youngest person by a few decades on today\u2019s walk, which is organised by the <a href=\"https://www.ramblers.org.uk/london-strollers\" title=\"\">London Strollers</a>. It\u2019s no bother \u2013 one of the joys of my week of extroversion has been the opportunity to chat to older people.</p> <p>About 30 of us set off on a three-hour walk around north London. Things do not start off well. Although the woman I had been walking with seems friendly initially, she then makes a number of offensive comments. The thought of having to spend the morning listening to her fills me with a crushing ennui. I am already so tired. I don\u2019t think I can bear this.</p> <p>Then Elizabeth comes to my rescue. She is very tall and upright, a headscarf knotted under her chin \u2013 my knight in a green raincoat.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What did I learn? Strangers can come together and share their stories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We talk about everything. How she has just got into football and is learning Italian, which will be her sixth language. Her childhood in Finland, and the 40 years she spent as a nurse. (She retired five years ago, at the age of 70.) She tells me about her husband, a communist, who died. And her children, who also died. And why you should only marry someone with the same political views as yours \u2013 preferably a communist. \u201cSocialists, they sit on the fence,\u201d Elizabeth shrugs, striding up Primrose Hill.</p> <p>I loved meeting Elizabeth. I could have talked to her all day. I take her number and we make loose plans to go to a protest together.</p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s all over</strong></h2> <p><strong><br></strong>So what did I learn from my week of extroversion? That people are kinder than you think and it is often easier to be truthful with strangers. That you should open yourself up to new experiences because the worst that can happen is getting hit in the face with a dodgeball, and that is not so bad. That we are all of us individual moving dots, part of the same involuntary palpitating life, crisscrossing as we walk the streets. It\u2019s nice for the dots to collide sometimes, even for a little while. Strangers can come together and share their stories. We all have a story to tell.</p> <p>I\u2019m still an introvert and I don\u2019t see that changing soon. But perhaps you will see me a bit more from now on. Maybe. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2019 because an earlier version was wrong to describe the University of California research as \u201cthe first study of its kind\u201d.

Playing team sports with strangers was exactly like losing my virginity: not memorably awful, but definitely not good. I cringe every time a ball thuds my way and lack the strength to make my throws clear the other side of the court. Obviously, I get hit on the head. \u201cYou took that head shot like an absolute champ,\u201d observes a teammate. While I didn\u2019t enjoy dodgeball \u2013 hated it, if I\u2019m honest \u2013 I loved meeting everyone. After the game (we lost), I hit the pub with Jacob and his teammate Will. \u201cYou\u2019re not the worst newcomer we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Jacob says. He\u2019s definitely lying. Wednesday Today I am meeting up with Emma, whom I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re going to a Crossfit class \u2013 a famously social workout, where high fives, fist bumps and (God forbid) hugs with sweaty strangers are de rigueur. Emma introduces me to Rich, the owner of Crossfit Shapesmiths in south London. \u201cI\u2019M SO HAPPY TO MEET YOU,\u201d Rich bellows at me. \u201cCOME HERE FOR A HUG. COME HERE!\u201d We hug. \u201cHe\u2019s like that with everyone,\u201d Emma says. \u201cHe\u2019s just really happy.\u201d I meet JP, who will be leading the class. The workout flies by. Emma is a sweetheart. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great!\u201d she cheers, as I flub my way through some complicated moves involving a kettlebell. \u201cGood pace!\u201d After the class, JP instructs us \u2013 orders, really \u2013 to high five. Old Sirin would cringe at this enforced bonhomie, but new Sirin is all high fives. I\u2019m just happy I didn\u2019t get hit in the face. Thursday \u201cWhat is a weed?\u201d asks Cathy, the leader of Waltham Forest\u2019s volunteer gardening group, \u201cIt\u2019s a plant in the wrong place.\u201d The group meets every Thursday morning to tend the grounds behind the William Morris Gallery in east London. Looking round, I can relate. I have never gardened before and most of the people here are regulars. Being a newbie among outsiders, doing something I have never done before \u2013 not my favourite thing. My goodness, they are a friendly bunch. We yank out weeds and fling them into a pile. It is a beautiful morning, crisp and clear. I make friends with Judith, who is retired and lives locally. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, making friends in London,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can just walk up to people in the street. They\u2019d think you were a nutter.\u201d After a tea break, I\u2019m promoted to planting. I try not to look at the worms that tumble from my spade. \u201cI just fling the worms away,\u201d says Judith conspiratorially. We tuck the plants into the soil together, like children being put to bed. \u201cYou\u2019ll come back, won\u2019t you?\u201d says Judith. Friday I\u2019m flagging. Pan warned me I would be tired and she was right. If my life were a night out, right now I would be sitting in the smoking area, begging a friend to fetch my coat. The last thing I want to do is hang out with a stranger. On Bumble BFF, a friendship app, I start chatting to Radhika, 25, a student from Delhi. We meet up later at an audiovisual exhibition about the natural world. It\u2019s not the most successful meeting. Radhika is lovely, but it\u2019s not the sort of place where you can chat and it\u2019s awkward to be walking in silence with someone you have just met. As a result, Radhika and I never get past first base conversationally, which makes our interaction stilted, like kissing with braces. In the gallery, the sounds of the wilderness are compressed into a bright heartbeat of lasers. Radhika says she was homesick last week \u2013 it was the Diwali celebration. A few friends had had a gathering, but it wasn\u2019t the same. I feel guilty for co-opting her into my experiment. Moving to a new place on your own is hard. A lot of my anxiety around socialising is linked to the fact that I often feel responsible for making conversation, as I do today. The encounter was wearing, probably because I already felt drained. After the exhibition, I suggest a drink, but Radhika declines. I\u2019m relieved. Saturday I wake up with a ball of dread in my stomach that won\u2019t go away . Why? I\u2019m going to a Halloween party tonight, full of people I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019ll be flying solo. As evening approaches, the feeling intensifies. I desperately don\u2019t want to go and find myself tidying drawers and sorting laundry until I can\u2019t put off going any longer. Outside the house, I text Pan for some last-minute support. \u201cARGH I DON\u2019T WANT TO GO TO THIS PARTY ON MY OWN.\u201d She texts back. \u201cTalk to three people and if they suck, you can leave. Also, ask the host to introduce you to some people.\u201d I take a breath and ring the bell. Ordinarily, the hardest part of going to a party alone is walking in, not knowing anyone. In my case, it was realising once through the door that not only did I not know anyone, they were all in fancy dress. Luckily, the host Dan (not his real name) or, rather, Emperor Caligula \u2013 takes me under his wing. He introduces me to Gosia and Ula, sisters from Poland. Pan\u2019s tip to let myself be vulnerable definitely helps: I tell Gosia and Ula about my anxieties and they look after me all evening as carefully as if I were a baby bird. It\u2019s a great party. There is a severed head in the freezer and drinks are served in IV bags \u2013 but I\u2019m so tired after the week\u2019s exertions that I only last a few hours before making my excuses. \u201cYour costume was awful,\u201d Dan says, walking me to the door. Sunday I am comfortably the youngest person by a few decades on today\u2019s walk, which is organised by the London Strollers. It\u2019s no bother \u2013 one of the joys of my week of extroversion has been the opportunity to chat to older people. About 30 of us set off on a three-hour walk around north London. Things do not start off well. Although the woman I had been walking with seems friendly initially, she then makes a number of offensive comments. The thought of having to spend the morning listening to her fills me with a crushing ennui. I am already so tired. I don\u2019t think I can bear this. Then Elizabeth comes to my rescue. She is very tall and upright, a headscarf knotted under her chin \u2013 my knight in a green raincoat. We talk about everything. How she has just got into football and is learning Italian, which will be her sixth language. Her childhood in Finland, and the 40 years she spent as a nurse. (She retired five years ago, at the age of 70.) She tells me about her husband, a communist, who died. And her children, who also died. And why you should only marry someone with the same political views as yours \u2013 preferably a communist. \u201cSocialists, they sit on the fence,\u201d Elizabeth shrugs, striding up Primrose Hill. I loved meeting Elizabeth. I could have talked to her all day. I take her number and we make loose plans to go to a protest together. It\u2019s all over So what did I learn from my week of extroversion? That people are kinder than you think and it is often easier to be truthful with strangers. That you should open yourself up to new experiences because the worst that can happen is getting hit in the face with a dodgeball, and that is not so bad. That we are all of us individual moving dots, part of the same involuntary palpitating life, crisscrossing as we walk the streets. It\u2019s nice for the dots to collide sometimes, even for a little while. Strangers can come together and share their stories. We all have a story to tell. I\u2019m still an introvert and I don\u2019t see that changing soon. But perhaps you will see me a bit more from now on. Maybe. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2019 because an earlier version was wrong to describe the University of California research as \u201cthe first study of its kind\u201d.

      "body": "<p> University lecturers are giving students five minutes at the start of their lectures to register to vote as a nationwide campaign gets under way to ensure that students\u2019 voices are heard in the forthcoming general election.</p> <p>The move was condemned by some on social media as \u201cbrainwashing\u201d, but according to the universities\u2019 regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), institutions now have a duty to facilitate the electoral registration of students.</p> <p>Dan Elphick, a music lecturer, was among those to flag up his efforts to encourage student votes, when he said he was setting aside five minutes of his lecture time to allow students to register online, adding: \u201cI see this as being a vital part of their education.\u201d</p> <p>The initiative has been supported by the University College Union (UCU), which represents university workers, and is being replicated by lecturers elsewhere in the country before the 26 November deadline for registration.</p> <p>The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that some lecturers have taken the initiative and devoted a few minutes of their lessons to reminding students how to get registered, and we would encourage others who can to do the same.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important that students\u2019 voices are heard in the upcoming general election, and UCU has been working closely with the National Union of Students to explore how we can support students in colleges and universities to register to vote.\u201d</p> <p>There are concerns that the date of the general election, which coincides with the end of term and the start of the Christmas holiday, could diminish the student vote as many head home. Some students are confused about whether to register at home or at university. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/how-do-i-register-to-vote-in-the-12-december-2019-general-election\">they can register at both</a>, although must vote only once.</p> <p>All parties will be watching the student vote closely. During the 2017 election, a number of seats appeared to have been swung by students, including Canterbury, where a well-organised student vote resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/09/canterbury-tale-single-mum-becomes-towns-first-ever-labour-mp\">Labour winning</a> the seat with a 20% swing.</p> <p>As well as the NUS and UCU, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MakeTheVoterPledge&amp;src=hashtag_click\">#MakeTheVoterPledge</a> campaign has been working to ensure that universities fulfil their duties to encourage students to register, highlighting the fact that, while 96% of over 65-year-olds are registered to vote, one in three young people are not.</p> <p>Elphick\u2019s initiative was quickly picked up by other university staff, who have either already taken similar action or plan to. \u201cI gave students five minutes at the start of the lecture and I gave them the [voter registration] link,\u201d he said later. \u201cI explained a bit about the rules, about who can vote. Their reaction was positive.\u201d Since then Elphick has added the link to his email signature and plans to give brief reminders in future. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose five minutes of every lecture.\u201d</p> <p>Following the introduction of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017, the onus is now on universities and colleges in England to enable the electoral registration of students as a condition of their registration with the OfS.</p> <p>Jisc, which develops digital services for the higher, further education and skills sectors, recently launched a <a href=\"https://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/student-voter-registration-service-gains-its-1000th-sign-up-01-oct-2019\">student voter registration service</a>.

      "bodyText": "University lecturers are giving students five minutes at the start of their lectures to register to vote as a nationwide campaign gets under way to ensure that students\u2019 voices are heard in the forthcoming general election. The move was condemned by some on social media as \u201cbrainwashing\u201d, but according to the universities\u2019 regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), institutions now have a duty to facilitate the electoral registration of students. Dan Elphick, a music lecturer, was among those to flag up his efforts to encourage student votes, when he said he was setting aside five minutes of his lecture time to allow students to register online, adding: \u201cI see this as being a vital part of their education.\u201d The initiative has been supported by the University College Union (UCU), which represents university workers, and is being replicated by lecturers elsewhere in the country before the 26 November deadline for registration. The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that some lecturers have taken the initiative and devoted a few minutes of their lessons to reminding students how to get registered, and we would encourage others who can to do the same. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that students\u2019 voices are heard in the upcoming general election, and UCU has been working closely with the National Union of Students to explore how we can support students in colleges and universities to register to vote.\u201d There are concerns that the date of the general election, which coincides with the end of term and the start of the Christmas holiday, could diminish the student vote as many head home. Some students are confused about whether to register at home or at university. In fact, they can register at both, although must vote only once. All parties will be watching the student vote closely. During the 2017 election, a number of seats appeared to have been swung by students, including Canterbury, where a well-organised student vote resulted in Labour winning the seat with a 20% swing. As well as the NUS and UCU, a #MakeTheVoterPledge campaign has been working to ensure that universities fulfil their duties to encourage students to register, highlighting the fact that, while 96% of over 65-year-olds are registered to vote, one in three young people are not. Elphick\u2019s initiative was quickly picked up by other university staff, who have either already taken similar action or plan to. \u201cI gave students five minutes at the start of the lecture and I gave them the [voter registration] link,\u201d he said later. \u201cI explained a bit about the rules, about who can vote. Their reaction was positive.\u201d Since then Elphick has added the link to his email signature and plans to give brief reminders in future. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose five minutes of every lecture.\u201d Following the introduction of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017, the onus is now on universities and colleges in England to enable the electoral registration of students as a condition of their registration with the OfS. Jisc, which develops digital services for the higher, further education and skills sectors, recently launched a student voter registration service. With students\u2019 consent, the service collects essential information at the time of university enrolment and automatically transfers it to electoral registrars at local authorities. So far, 2,000 students at 22 universities and one further education college have signed up. Dr Paul Greatrix, a registrar at the University of Nottingham, said: \u201cEnabling student voter registration has been a significant challenge for many years. Now that all universities in England have a legal obligation to help enable students to get on to the electoral register, every institution will want to do this, as quickly and securely as possible.\u201d Meanwhile, a poll of students by YouthSight on behalf of the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) suggests Brexit will be a key factor when students make up their minds at the general election, with 74% of the view that the country was wrong to vote to leave the EU. The overwhelming majority of those polled want a say on the final Brexit deal via another referendum (70%), and if there were another referendum, almost three-quarters (73%) would vote remain. Most say Brexit could affect how they vote, with 29% saying it will \u201cstrongly impact\u201d their voting choice; a further 42% say Brexit will affect their vote \u201cto some extent\u201d, and 53% are willing to vote tactically over Brexit.

It tells the story of 16-year-old Jenny being dazzled by the 30-something David, who deftly tricks Jenny into believing he\u2019s a single and honorable man through increasingly lavish gifts. The director Lone Scherfig and the writer Nick Hornby delicately explore many of the issues in play, from David\u2019s predatory actions, to issues of class, to the changing roles and expectations of women during the 1960s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/17/saddest-movie-scenes-paddington-toy-story\">'I completely lost it': the movie scenes that made our writers weep</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An Education is well done because it\u2019s a breakup film on several levels: between Jenny and her family, Jenny and David, and then Jenny and the person she believes she wants to be. College is difficult and frustrating, and coming from suburbia, Jenny sees her future as uncertain and dark. David, with his trips to Paris and sophisticated friends, embodies an easy out for Jenny, so she abandons all other relationships and drops out of school for him. As a child, she doesn\u2019t notice until it\u2019s almost too late that David is an emotionally stunted manchild, a negligent father, and a con artist to boot. It\u2019s such a heartbreaking discovery to watch, and was all the more painful to see as a teen still trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.</p> <p>Many tears are shed, but ultimately I love An Education because it\u2019s an uplifting film: Jenny redoes her last year, goes to Oxford and ultimately is able to look back on her time with that creepy man as educational rather than traumatizing. <em>GS</em></p> <h2>(500) Days of Summer</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fL94BTrFhs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-fL94BTrFhs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The relationship comedy-drama (500) Days of Summer, starring Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a breakup story with something of Nick Hornby or Woody Allen, told out of narrative order by the lovelorn Tom (Levitt), as he obsessively recounts the various 500 days of his failed, unhappy relationship with a beautiful young woman called Summer (Deschanel). It was an original script by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber, who went on to adapt The Fault In Our Stars. Looking back, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/03/500-days-of-summer-review\">I see that I didn\u2019t like it too much at the time</a>.</p> <p>But I\u2019ve found myself semi-accidentally and then deliberately catching it on TV over the years, and I\u2019ve seen how ungenerous I was. It is a really fervent, and even devastating story of male heartbreak, encapsulated by the now legendary \u201csplit-screen\u201d sequence showing Tom\u2019s Expectations versus Reality, as he shows up to a post-breakup party thrown by Summer. On the left side of the screen, we see his fantasies that their old magic will somehow kick in and they will get back together, on the right, we see the agonising reality of her distant, polite greetings to someone who is now in the friend zone. These scenes unfold in parallel and then gradually diverge in a way which is excruciating. I can\u2019t believe there is anyone who hasn\u2019t hopefully, pathetically shown up to a party to which they have been diplomatically invited by someone who\u2019s dumped them \u2013 invited, in fact, with the specific purpose of subsuming them back into the platonic category of \u201cfriendship\u201d. But the rejectee will always agonisingly hope-against-hope that something might still happen. 500 Days Of Summer isn\u2019t a masterpiece but it\u2019s got the authentic vinegar taste of male romantic sadness. My one quarrel is that the woman with whom Tom then finds happiness is called Autumn. Surely that should be Spring? <em>PB</em></p> <h2>Happy Together</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec3ba35d384ff938496135abde50b3157c31d176\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3ba35d384ff938496135abde50b3157c31d176/0_0_5141_3425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The films of Wong Kar-wai are made out of sighs; the contented swoon of a new infatuation, the panting gasp of overheating pleasure, the defeated exhalation that\u2019s all one can manage when an emotional weight is pressing down on their chest. His cinema understands all expressions of passion, whether filtered through love or lust or pain, to come from the same naked need for human connection. My favorite work from the Chinese master focuses on a corollary idea, that the vulnerability required of that connection can make us guarded, which in turn perverts affection into vindictiveness and trust into self-destructive obsession. Wong makes the daring suggestion, a conclusion far too uncommon in western romance films, that breaking up can be its own gesture of devotion.</p> <p>A gay couple (Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-wai, the latter delivering what is in this writer\u2019s opinion one of the greatest performances ever committed to celluloid) go to Buenos Aires to break up their toxic on-again-off-again routine, only to split without enough money to return to Asia. Their ensuing attempts to build lives separate of one another, many of them failed, clarify the unique terms of a relationship that thrives on dysfunction and recreational cruelty. The same things keeping them together \u2013 a codependency bridging the gap between neediness and the need to be needed \u2013 make it impossible for them to last. And with ravishing colors courtesy of the cinematographer Christopher Doyle, the lush Argentinian scenery refracts their overgrown, untamed feelings back at them. <em>CB</em></p> <h2>Brokeback Mountain</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVK6yLqY54w\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KVK6yLqY54w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I didn\u2019t watch Brokeback Mountain as an emerging-from-the-closet teenager, even though it felt like required viewing. I was interested in \u201cedgier\u201d stuff at the time (like Maurice and Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n) and thought the film would be overly sentimental. Thank God I held off. Because Brokeback Mountain is a film best appreciated by those familiar with heartbreak.</p> <p>I watched it for the first time last year, in my mid-twenties, and found myself deeply moved by the star-crossed-lovers and their poignant breakup because, even while hurling curse words and threats at each other, the two men are still in love. \u201cWe could\u2019ve had a real good life together,\u201d Jack shouts at the top of his lungs, his lips quivering. \u201cHad a place of our own.\u201d</p> <p>I love the grounded specificity of Jack\u2019s \u201chappily-ever-after.\u201d How \u2013 in the midst of calling it quits \u2013 Jack paints a world where he and Ennis have a ranch and live in domestic bliss. As a queer person, I can easily connect with this kind of fantasy-building. Imagining how easier life would be if the pressures of society weren\u2019t so great.</p> <p>Brokeback Mountain is a product of its time. Hollywood\u2019s queer representation skewed towards melancholy back then \u2013 a reflection of the scant rights and protections the LGBTQ community had in America. Today, queer cinema is finally beginning to provide some happy endings (think: Love, Simon and God\u2019s Own Country). Which is important for a slew of reasons. But I like to watch Brokeback Mountain every now and then when I need a reminder that, not too long ago, our love stories too often ended in heartbreak. <em>AW</em></p> <h2>The War of the Roses</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b675bb7b11d813d71de4262e40136795ff66b7e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b675bb7b11d813d71de4262e40136795ff66b7e4/0_99_3160_1896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At the tail end of 1989, mere weeks away from a new decade, audiences were gifted with an unusual Christmas present: the violent, foul-mouthed destruction of a much-loved movie couple. In hit screwball adventures Romancing the Stone and Jewel of the Nile, Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas quipped and kissed their way in and and out of PG-level jeopardy but in The War of the Roses, the danger wasn\u2019t in the jungle or the desert but it was in the home and, most disturbingly, in each other.</p> <p>It\u2019s a relentlessly, audaciously nasty little film wrapped up in glossy packaging with a deceptively sprightly score, fooling you into briefly forgetting just how mean-spirited the whole thing is. We\u2019re shown how an annoyingly perfect, somewhat smug, married couple is torn apart, not by infidelity or abuse, but by growing, seething resentment which finally boils to the surface in the most hysterically, horribly funny manner. After Douglas\u2019 preening lawyer survives what he thinks is a heart attack, Turner\u2019s exhausted housewife tells him the whole debacle made her imagine what life would be like with him dead and, to his disgust, it made her feel happy and free. She tells him: \u201cWhen I watch you eat. When I see you asleep. When I look at you lately, I just want to smash your face in.\u201d He dares her to do it. She does. And then the gloves are really off.</p> <p>He destroys her shoes, she locks him in the sauna, he pisses on her food, she ruins his car and they continue to verbally and physically abuse each other until a final brutal showdown ending with them both dead after falling from a chandelier mid-fight. For a moment, we\u2019re fooled into thinking the film is softening as a dying husband lays a hand on his dying wife but as the music swells and we think she\u2019s reaching to hold him back, instead she pushes it off. It remains one of the most staggeringly sour endings to a studio comedy I\u2019ve ever seen and one that I can\u2019t even imagine making it to the big screen now.</p> <p>For me, the single, never-married product of divorced parents, there\u2019s always been something grimly compelling about watching a marriage fall apart on such a grandiose and grotesque stage, no holds barred, played for sadistic laughs. Maybe it\u2019s the savage, if exaggerated, honesty of it I always admired, that underneath the civility of married life, there are two people quietly waiting to piss all over the other one\u2019s dinner. <em>BL</em></p> <h2>Like Crazy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"649b2827f0b2091aef1190cacafa2299c978c042\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/649b2827f0b2091aef1190cacafa2299c978c042/0_89_5113_3335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Like Crazy documents the mostly long-distance love between Anna (Felicity Jones) and Jacob (Anton Yelchin) that withers under the pressures of time and 6,000 miles (Jacob based in LA, Anna confined by an overstayed visa to the UK). While doing press for the film, the director Drake Doremus said the actors were given an emotional outline of the characters, and the actors filled the rest in, improvising how they\u2019d imagine their characters would fall in love, then fall apart. I can count on my fingers the number of movies that have made me actually cry, and perhaps this is why Like Crazy is one of them: it captures exactly the spontaneity of a relationship\u2019s growth and decay \u2013 in particular, the magnetic pull of phone as a portal both treasured and loathed, the gap between where your mind is and where you are, the realization that someone\u2019s life has gone on without you. (It did not help that I watched it in light of Yelchin\u2019s devastating accidental death at age 27).</p> <p>At the end, Anna and Jacob stand together in the shower, embracing, finally getting what they wanted only to doubt that want in the first place. They look at each other and say nothing, but I heard: you don\u2019t know this person anymore. Maybe you never really did. It\u2019s not a breakup scene, per se, but their unguardedness is broken. The last shot lingers on Jacob\u2019s face in the shower, haunted not by Anna\u2019s absence but her presence, and processing one of the most unsettling experiences I know \u2013 the feeling of your old certainty about someone crumbling into doubt, and realizing your own sparks can fade. <em>AH</em></p> <h2>Le Chat</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umr709DJPOg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Umr709DJPOg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The breakups that break my heart are the ones that don\u2019t involve a break at all. No dramatic exits, just the misery of a relationship\u2019s long-drawn-out demise. That\u2019s the painful case in Pierre Granier-Deferre\u2019s melancholic 1971 movie Le Chat. It stars two magnificent actors: Simone Signoret and Jean Gabin, who would have made a sizzling on-screen couple once, smouldering across the age-gap. Here, in a film made towards the end of both their careers, they give electric performances as people trapped in a relationship that has run out of love. Married for more than 25 years and now retired, they live separately but together, sharing a house in a city district that is being razed for redevelopment. Nothing stands around here but their funny little home, just as nothing exists of their marriage but their shared address.</p> <p>Perhaps they were always an unlikely pair, a typesetter and a circus star, but once upon a time in a flashback Julien and Cl\u00e9mence loved each other. And then one day he didn\u2019t any more, so now Cl\u00e9mence is miserable. They\u2019re cruel to each other, in petty ways, and sometimes she drinks too much and flies into a rage, but otherwise they pass their days eating, reading and sleeping in each other\u2019s stifling presence, in a bitter silence made up of all the sentences left unsaid \u2013 words of recrimination or regret, or \u201cI\u2019m leaving\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t go\u201d. The only messages that get through are notes on scraps of paper, like the one passed day after day from Julien to Cl\u00e9mence that reads: \u201cLe chat?\u201d. Because if it\u2019s awful enough to watch these two people suffering, it\u2019s nothing to what happens to Julien\u2019s poor cat. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Starship Troopers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fe3e1f3603dd1eef0352a8f0ed8ff4f2b521bdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fe3e1f3603dd1eef0352a8f0ed8ff4f2b521bdb/0_0_4068_2441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I can\u2019t say I\u2019m a particular fan of movie breakups: they\u2019re miserable enough to endure in real life without having to see them projected on the big screen. But I always admired the way Denise Richards dumped Casper Van Dien in Starship Troopers \u2013 via interplanetary video message, the sci-fi equivalent of Daniel Day Lewis\u2019 fax to Isabelle Adjani.</p> <p>Recollect the scene, if you will. Casper \u2013 or Johnny Rico, as this blond alpha male is called \u2013 receives a much anticipated missive from the lovely Carmen; she, being a thousand times smarter than him, is on her way to becoming a military pilot, while he is stuck with the grunts in the infantry. So, while all Rico\u2019s squadmates are leering over his shoulder, Carmen gives him the old dagger in the heart: \u201cI\u2019m gonna go career\u201d. Her job comes first. That\u2019s one in the eye for the perfectly-chiselled schlub.</p> <p>But this breakup is a bit more than simple teen-movie trauma. Starship Troopers is one of the all time great satires, and this is just part of it. Johnny Rico, the Buenos Aires-dwelling ubermensch, might be a superman on the football field but outside school he\u2019s the opposite of a high flyer. Getting dumped by Carmen is just the start: he messes up his command, gets mercilessly flogged and is reported dead after a disastrous mission against the alien Bugs.

      "bodyText": "An Education I watched An Education right as I was entering college while also developing an interest in cinema, and I found it to be such a beautiful, disturbing and devastating film that spoke to a lot of what I was feeling at the time. It tells the story of 16-year-old Jenny being dazzled by the 30-something David, who deftly tricks Jenny into believing he\u2019s a single and honorable man through increasingly lavish gifts. The director Lone Scherfig and the writer Nick Hornby delicately explore many of the issues in play, from David\u2019s predatory actions, to issues of class, to the changing roles and expectations of women during the 1960s. An Education is well done because it\u2019s a breakup film on several levels: between Jenny and her family, Jenny and David, and then Jenny and the person she believes she wants to be. College is difficult and frustrating, and coming from suburbia, Jenny sees her future as uncertain and dark. David, with his trips to Paris and sophisticated friends, embodies an easy out for Jenny, so she abandons all other relationships and drops out of school for him. As a child, she doesn\u2019t notice until it\u2019s almost too late that David is an emotionally stunted manchild, a negligent father, and a con artist to boot. It\u2019s such a heartbreaking discovery to watch, and was all the more painful to see as a teen still trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Many tears are shed, but ultimately I love An Education because it\u2019s an uplifting film: Jenny redoes her last year, goes to Oxford and ultimately is able to look back on her time with that creepy man as educational rather than traumatizing. GS (500) Days of Summer The relationship comedy-drama (500) Days of Summer, starring Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a breakup story with something of Nick Hornby or Woody Allen, told out of narrative order by the lovelorn Tom (Levitt), as he obsessively recounts the various 500 days of his failed, unhappy relationship with a beautiful young woman called Summer (Deschanel). It was an original script by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber, who went on to adapt The Fault In Our Stars. Looking back, I see that I didn\u2019t like it too much at the time. But I\u2019ve found myself semi-accidentally and then deliberately catching it on TV over the years, and I\u2019ve seen how ungenerous I was. It is a really fervent, and even devastating story of male heartbreak, encapsulated by the now legendary \u201csplit-screen\u201d sequence showing Tom\u2019s Expectations versus Reality, as he shows up to a post-breakup party thrown by Summer. On the left side of the screen, we see his fantasies that their old magic will somehow kick in and they will get back together, on the right, we see the agonising reality of her distant, polite greetings to someone who is now in the friend zone. These scenes unfold in parallel and then gradually diverge in a way which is excruciating. I can\u2019t believe there is anyone who hasn\u2019t hopefully, pathetically shown up to a party to which they have been diplomatically invited by someone who\u2019s dumped them \u2013 invited, in fact, with the specific purpose of subsuming them back into the platonic category of \u201cfriendship\u201d. But the rejectee will always agonisingly hope-against-hope that something might still happen. 500 Days Of Summer isn\u2019t a masterpiece but it\u2019s got the authentic vinegar taste of male romantic sadness. My one quarrel is that the woman with whom Tom then finds happiness is called Autumn. Surely that should be Spring? PB Happy Together The films of Wong Kar-wai are made out of sighs; the contented swoon of a new infatuation, the panting gasp of overheating pleasure, the defeated exhalation that\u2019s all one can manage when an emotional weight is pressing down on their chest. His cinema understands all expressions of passion, whether filtered through love or lust or pain, to come from the same naked need for human connection. My favorite work from the Chinese master focuses on a corollary idea, that the vulnerability required of that connection can make us guarded, which in turn perverts affection into vindictiveness and trust into self-destructive obsession. Wong makes the daring suggestion, a conclusion far too uncommon in western romance films, that breaking up can be its own gesture of devotion. A gay couple (Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-wai, the latter delivering what is in this writer\u2019s opinion one of the greatest performances ever committed to celluloid) go to Buenos Aires to break up their toxic on-again-off-again routine, only to split without enough money to return to Asia. Their ensuing attempts to build lives separate of one another, many of them failed, clarify the unique terms of a relationship that thrives on dysfunction and recreational cruelty. The same things keeping them together \u2013 a codependency bridging the gap between neediness and the need to be needed \u2013 make it impossible for them to last. And with ravishing colors courtesy of the cinematographer Christopher Doyle, the lush Argentinian scenery refracts their overgrown, untamed feelings back at them. CB Brokeback Mountain I didn\u2019t watch Brokeback Mountain as an emerging-from-the-closet teenager, even though it felt like required viewing. I was interested in \u201cedgier\u201d stuff at the time (like Maurice and Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n) and thought the film would be overly sentimental. Thank God I held off. Because Brokeback Mountain is a film best appreciated by those familiar with heartbreak. I watched it for the first time last year, in my mid-twenties, and found myself deeply moved by the star-crossed-lovers and their poignant breakup because, even while hurling curse words and threats at each other, the two men are still in love. \u201cWe could\u2019ve had a real good life together,\u201d Jack shouts at the top of his lungs, his lips quivering. \u201cHad a place of our own.\u201d I love the grounded specificity of Jack\u2019s \u201chappily-ever-after.\u201d How \u2013 in the midst of calling it quits \u2013 Jack paints a world where he and Ennis have a ranch and live in domestic bliss. As a queer person, I can easily connect with this kind of fantasy-building. Imagining how easier life would be if the pressures of society weren\u2019t so great. Brokeback Mountain is a product of its time. Hollywood\u2019s queer representation skewed towards melancholy back then \u2013 a reflection of the scant rights and protections the LGBTQ community had in America. Today, queer cinema is finally beginning to provide some happy endings (think: Love, Simon and God\u2019s Own Country). Which is important for a slew of reasons. But I like to watch Brokeback Mountain every now and then when I need a reminder that, not too long ago, our love stories too often ended in heartbreak. AW The War of the Roses At the tail end of 1989, mere weeks away from a new decade, audiences were gifted with an unusual Christmas present: the violent, foul-mouthed destruction of a much-loved movie couple. In hit screwball adventures Romancing the Stone and Jewel of the Nile, Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas quipped and kissed their way in and and out of PG-level jeopardy but in The War of the Roses, the danger wasn\u2019t in the jungle or the desert but it was in the home and, most disturbingly, in each other. It\u2019s a relentlessly, audaciously nasty little film wrapped up in glossy packaging with a deceptively sprightly score, fooling you into briefly forgetting just how mean-spirited the whole thing is. We\u2019re shown how an annoyingly perfect, somewhat smug, married couple is torn apart, not by infidelity or abuse, but by growing, seething resentment which finally boils to the surface in the most hysterically, horribly funny manner. After Douglas\u2019 preening lawyer survives what he thinks is a heart attack, Turner\u2019s exhausted housewife tells him the whole debacle made her imagine what life would be like with him dead and, to his disgust, it made her feel happy and free. She tells him: \u201cWhen I watch you eat. When I see you asleep. When I look at you lately, I just want to smash your face in.\u201d He dares her to do it. She does. And then the gloves are really off. He destroys her shoes, she locks him in the sauna, he pisses on her food, she ruins his car and they continue to verbally and physically abuse each other until a final brutal showdown ending with them both dead after falling from a chandelier mid-fight. For a moment, we\u2019re fooled into thinking the film is softening as a dying husband lays a hand on his dying wife but as the music swells and we think she\u2019s reaching to hold him back, instead she pushes it off. It remains one of the most staggeringly sour endings to a studio comedy I\u2019ve ever seen and one that I can\u2019t even imagine making it to the big screen now. For me, the single, never-married product of divorced parents, there\u2019s always been something grimly compelling about watching a marriage fall apart on such a grandiose and grotesque stage, no holds barred, played for sadistic laughs. Maybe it\u2019s the savage, if exaggerated, honesty of it I always admired, that underneath the civility of married life, there are two people quietly waiting to piss all over the other one\u2019s dinner. BL Like Crazy Like Crazy documents the mostly long-distance love between Anna (Felicity Jones) and Jacob (Anton Yelchin) that withers under the pressures of time and 6,000 miles (Jacob based in LA, Anna confined by an overstayed visa to the UK). While doing press for the film, the director Drake Doremus said the actors were given an emotional outline of the characters, and the actors filled the rest in, improvising how they\u2019d imagine their characters would fall in love, then fall apart. I can count on my fingers the number of movies that have made me actually cry, and perhaps this is why Like Crazy is one of them: it captures exactly the spontaneity of a relationship\u2019s growth and decay \u2013 in particular, the magnetic pull of phone as a portal both treasured and loathed, the gap between where your mind is and where you are, the realization that someone\u2019s life has gone on without you. (It did not help that I watched it in light of Yelchin\u2019s devastating accidental death at age 27). At the end, Anna and Jacob stand together in the shower, embracing, finally getting what they wanted only to doubt that want in the first place. They look at each other and say nothing, but I heard: you don\u2019t know this person anymore. Maybe you never really did. It\u2019s not a breakup scene, per se, but their unguardedness is broken. The last shot lingers on Jacob\u2019s face in the shower, haunted not by Anna\u2019s absence but her presence, and processing one of the most unsettling experiences I know \u2013 the feeling of your old certainty about someone crumbling into doubt, and realizing your own sparks can fade. AH Le Chat The breakups that break my heart are the ones that don\u2019t involve a break at all. No dramatic exits, just the misery of a relationship\u2019s long-drawn-out demise. That\u2019s the painful case in Pierre Granier-Deferre\u2019s melancholic 1971 movie Le Chat. It stars two magnificent actors: Simone Signoret and Jean Gabin, who would have made a sizzling on-screen couple once, smouldering across the age-gap. Here, in a film made towards the end of both their careers, they give electric performances as people trapped in a relationship that has run out of love. Married for more than 25 years and now retired, they live separately but together, sharing a house in a city district that is being razed for redevelopment. Nothing stands around here but their funny little home, just as nothing exists of their marriage but their shared address. Perhaps they were always an unlikely pair, a typesetter and a circus star, but once upon a time in a flashback Julien and Cl\u00e9mence loved each other. And then one day he didn\u2019t any more, so now Cl\u00e9mence is miserable. They\u2019re cruel to each other, in petty ways, and sometimes she drinks too much and flies into a rage, but otherwise they pass their days eating, reading and sleeping in each other\u2019s stifling presence, in a bitter silence made up of all the sentences left unsaid \u2013 words of recrimination or regret, or \u201cI\u2019m leaving\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t go\u201d. The only messages that get through are notes on scraps of paper, like the one passed day after day from Julien to Cl\u00e9mence that reads: \u201cLe chat?\u201d. Because if it\u2019s awful enough to watch these two people suffering, it\u2019s nothing to what happens to Julien\u2019s poor cat. PH Starship Troopers I can\u2019t say I\u2019m a particular fan of movie breakups: they\u2019re miserable enough to endure in real life without having to see them projected on the big screen. But I always admired the way Denise Richards dumped Casper Van Dien in Starship Troopers \u2013 via interplanetary video message, the sci-fi equivalent of Daniel Day Lewis\u2019 fax to Isabelle Adjani. Recollect the scene, if you will. Casper \u2013 or Johnny Rico, as this blond alpha male is called \u2013 receives a much anticipated missive from the lovely Carmen; she, being a thousand times smarter than him, is on her way to becoming a military pilot, while he is stuck with the grunts in the infantry. So, while all Rico\u2019s squadmates are leering over his shoulder, Carmen gives him the old dagger in the heart: \u201cI\u2019m gonna go career\u201d. Her job comes first. That\u2019s one in the eye for the perfectly-chiselled schlub. But this breakup is a bit more than simple teen-movie trauma. Starship Troopers is one of the all time great satires, and this is just part of it. Johnny Rico, the Buenos Aires-dwelling ubermensch, might be a superman on the football field but outside school he\u2019s the opposite of a high flyer. Getting dumped by Carmen is just the start: he messes up his command, gets mercilessly flogged and is reported dead after a disastrous mission against the alien Bugs. Carmen\u2019s progress is equally questionable: she makes the grade professionally, but the man she dumped Rico for gets his brains sucked out by a revolting giant insect in front of her. You win some, you lose some. AP Blue is the Warmest Color Have there ever been quite so many tears in an on-screen breakup before? \u201cTears\u201d is putting it delicately, in fact. Really, it\u2019s the streams of snot running down the blotchy, swollen face of then-19-year-old actor Adele Exarchopoulos that give the climactic separation in Abdellatif Kechiche\u2019s three-hour lesbian coming-of-age romance a particular kind of brutal, wrenching authenticity. Nobody cries prettily in a breakup; rare is the film that admits as much. Still, the stakes in this breakup are higher than most. Radiant blue-haired artist Emma (Lea Seydoux) hasn\u2019t just been Adele\u2019s first girlfriend, but her guide into a new sexuality and a new self, from teenage uncertainty into assured womanhood: her memories of life before Emma are memories of another life entirely, one she never wants back. That kind of severance more than merits a bit of snot. But it gets better, as these things tend to do.

GL Casablanca Much like when the kids say \u201cbad\u201d they mean \u201cgood,\u201d when Humphrey Bogart says \u201cI\u2019m no good at being noble\u201d what he means is \u201cstand back, world, I\u2019m about to be extremely good at being noble.\u201d Hollywood lore tells us that Casablanca was well into production before the last scene was written.

JH Hannah and Her Sisters Annie Hall is Woody Allen\u2019s great breakup movie. Manhattan his prickliest; Crimes and Misdemeanors the one in which the dumping has the direst fallout. It would have been apt to choose that film for this feature, as Noah Baumbach riffs off it in While We\u2019re Young \u2013 plus its fabulously crass turn from Alan Alda, who\u2019s also in Marriage Story. But I\u2019m going for the Allen film I most frequently revisit, one which is really a series of breakups and hookups, bookended \u2013 and sandwich-filled \u2013 by three Thanksgiving parties, with plenty of flashbacks for added narrative zip. The biggest split is the one in which the viewer would assume they\u2019d have the least investment, because you\u2019ve been encouraged to eyeroll at its casualty. Lee (Barbara Hershey, incredibly raw and luminous throughout) has spent her first hotel room afternoon with Elliot, the besotted accountant played by Michael Caine and \u2013 unhappily, he says \u2013 still married to her sister, Hannah (Mia Farrow). Lee returns to the loft she shares with Frederick (Max von Sydow), an intolerant and intellectually superior artist many years her elder. He tells her about a Holocaust documentary he\u2019s been watching, in a long monologue von Sydow wholly inhabits, despite it being pure Allen at his most miserablist. Suffocated, Lee says she needs to move out, that that was always inevitable. Frederick guesses the truth \u2013 or part of it, at least. And he\u2019s wracked: with grief, with anger at her, and most of all frustration at himself. It\u2019s two long takes, with one discreet edit. And it\u2019s just virtuosic. The odious snob becomes a sympathetic victim. Lee\u2019s reasons, even without Elliot, are completely sound, yet for the first time, you sense her decision might not be right. Even the most ploddingly obvious breakups can come suddenly; the viewer is slapped with this truth almost as hard as Frederick. Hannah and Her Sisters is a movie of extraordinarily acute emotional intelligence, especially about female feelings. It\u2019s also one of Allen\u2019s warmest and funniest. This scene is sober, perfect and unshakable. CS",

When Millane walked away from the table, the accused could be seen picking up her handbag and looking through its contents.</p> \n<p>The last footage of Millane alive was captured by a CCTV camera in the CityLife hotel at 9.41pm, where she entered the accused\u2019s hotel room, on the third floor.</p> \n<p>The accused, who has pleaded not guilty to murder, closely watched the CCTV footage from the dock on Thursday, his face largely impassive.</p> \n<p>The defence lawyer Ian Brookie said the footage appeared to show \u201cthe pair were getting along very well\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clear they were holding hands as they walked,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Brookie took Detective Adam Bicknell, the officer in charge of CCTV acquisition, through a list of drinks the couple consumed on the night, which totalled more than 25 between them.</p> \n<p>Ashcroft said that while Millane had been active on dating apps Tinder and Bumble while in the UK, her \u201coutgoing, happy\u201d friend viewed sex as an intimate act, and took, if anything, a conservative approach to it.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolice have asked me if Grace ever spoke to me about BDSM or any aspect of it and she has not.\u201d</p> \n<p>The court also heard that at 6am on 2 December, 12 hours after meeting Millane, the accused googled \u201crigor mortis\u201d, \u201cduffel bags with wheels\u201d, \u201cflesh-eating birds\u201d and \u201care there vultures in New Zealand\u201d.

Ameena Ashcroft, a friend of Millane from Lincoln university, was messaging Millane throughout the date, and told the court alarm bells rang when she described her date as \u201can oil manager\u201d who lived in a hotel. \u201cI was a bit concerned but I didn\u2019t show Grace that I was,\u201d Ashcroft said in a statement that was read out in court by the prosecution. \u201cI thought something seemed out of place.\u201d However, Ashcroft said she was tired from travelling and didn\u2019t want to over-react. The friends messaged back and forth sporadically while Millane and the accused, whose name has been suppressed, visited various bars and restaurants. Millane told Ashcroft that the accused was coming to London next year. Ashcroft said in her statement: \u201cI sensed Grace was having a good time and she seemed to be drunk and really enjoying herself. \u201cI do not think Grace had any concerns for her safety when I was in contact with her.\u201d At one point, Millane, from Wickford in Essex, messaged Ashcroft: \u201cI click with him so well,\u201d and, \u201cI will let you know what happens tomorrow\u201d. Earlier, Millane\u2019s parents, David and Gillian, were in court to watch extensive CCTV footage showing their daughter leaving the backpacker hostel she was staying at and strolling along Federal Street in central Auckland. Just before 6pm on 1 Decembershe met the 27-year-old New Zealand man who is now accused of murdering her by strangulation. They met outside the Sky City building in the city centre before going for drinks at Andy\u2019s Burger Bar. At 7.16pm, the pair walked to the Mexican Cafe, and together drank two jugs of margarita and one of sangria, which the accused paid for. In the CCTV footage, Millane appeared relaxed. Around 8.30pm the couple walked to the Bluestone Room, across the road from CityLife hotel where Millane later died, and the pair ordered more drinks and sat together at a table in the corner kissing repeatedly, with the accused hooking his arm around Millane\u2019s neck and repeatedly drawing her close. When Millane walked away from the table, the accused could be seen picking up her handbag and looking through its contents. The last footage of Millane alive was captured by a CCTV camera in the CityLife hotel at 9.41pm, where she entered the accused\u2019s hotel room, on the third floor. The accused, who has pleaded not guilty to murder, closely watched the CCTV footage from the dock on Thursday, his face largely impassive. The defence lawyer Ian Brookie said the footage appeared to show \u201cthe pair were getting along very well\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clear they were holding hands as they walked,\u201d he said. Brookie took Detective Adam Bicknell, the officer in charge of CCTV acquisition, through a list of drinks the couple consumed on the night, which totalled more than 25 between them. Ashcroft said that while Millane had been active on dating apps Tinder and Bumble while in the UK, her \u201coutgoing, happy\u201d friend viewed sex as an intimate act, and took, if anything, a conservative approach to it. \u201cPolice have asked me if Grace ever spoke to me about BDSM or any aspect of it and she has not.\u201d The court also heard that at 6am on 2 December, 12 hours after meeting Millane, the accused googled \u201crigor mortis\u201d, \u201cduffel bags with wheels\u201d, \u201cflesh-eating birds\u201d and \u201care there vultures in New Zealand\u201d. He also researched industrial-strength carpet cleaners, car-hire, and beaches close to Auckland. Millane\u2019s mother left the courtroom when Detective Samuel Luker, of Auckland\u2019s major crime team, described the images the accused had taken of her daughter after she died. On Wednesday, the jury of seven men and five women was asked to decide whether Millane was murdered by her date after the pair went to his apartment, or whether she died by accident during consensual sex. Millane\u2019s disappearance and news of her death generated a national outpouring of grief, vigils around New Zealand, and a national discussion about violence against women. The trial due to last at least four weeks.",

If you are, you know my type: when a group full of friends is playfully teasing each other, I\u2019m the one laughing a little bit too loudly, eyes brimming with tears.</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s my over-sensitivity, or the fact I spent my childhood in Canada, where I never noticed these dynamics (compared to Australia, where my Aussie relatives would regularly take the piss out of me while my face flushed), but I\u2019ve always been bad at it. Growing up, I never <em>understood it</em>.</p> <p>I\u2019m not the only one, either, a recent study showed that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/i-wish-you-were-murdered-some-students-dont-know-the-difference-between-bullying-and-banter-124272\">48%</a> of Australian students felt harmed by verbal \u201cjokes\u201d (also referred to as \u201cpeer aggression\u201d).

Well, we have memes now | James Colley</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>So when does banter become bullying?</strong></h2> <p>Unsurprisingly, there is no clear line. The word \u201cbanter\u201d is tossed around on dating profiles as a desirable trait and crops up everywhere from friendship groups to sporting teams. Earlier this year, Australian cricket captain Justin Langer <a href=\"https://www.cricket.com.au/news/third-test-sledging-australia-england-headingley-jofra-archer-joe-denly-tim-paine-matthew-wade/2019-08-30\">said</a> \u201cIf I play Uno with my daughter there\u2019s lots of banter. We sort of sledge each other but we don\u2019t abuse each other.\u201d</p> <p>A father and daughter teasing one another over a card game is fun. In a workplace, of course, things become murkier. And nobody wants to be a buzzkill. Lawyer and manager of a commercial law firm Lisa Klug alludes to the grey area of joking in the workplace, saying <a href=\"https://www.worklogic.com.au/resources/newsletters/workplace-culture/borderline-bullying-banter/\">intention is irrelevant</a> if someone is deemed to have been bullied. She notes the Australian guidelines in each state that highlight when behaviour becomes bullying (some examples of behaviours crossing the line include pranks, humiliation through sarcasm, cruel nicknames, teasing).</p> <p>Sledging, ribbing, teasing \u2013 these are all subjective terms. And while it may be slightly more black and white in a workplace, it\u2019s still murky. One person\u2019s banter is another person\u2019s bullying. As adults, we hopefully become aware of the difference between a social and professional environment. But when you\u2019re a kid at school, that\u2019s years away, and the school ground is your entire world.</p> <h2><strong>How can teenagers \u2013 or super sensitive people like me \u2013 </strong><strong> navigate this dynamic?</strong></h2> <p>I threw a few questions to writer and comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/james-colley\">James Colley</a> to get the viewpoint of a Professional Funny Man (\u2122). James agreed that it\u2019s not easy to draw a line between shitty comments and \u201cmucking around\u201d, but \u201cjust because it isn\u2019t easy doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important,\u201d he told me. From a stand-up\u2019s point of view, \u201ca good comedian in any sense can read their audience and if the bit you are doing is purely for your own joy and not for theirs then it\u2019s no longer a good bit.\u201d</p> <p>For non-professionals, if this kind of communication doesn\u2019t come naturally, like anything \u2013 practice makes perfect. James tells me his humour came from being a defence mechanism (hard same).</p> <p>\u201cLearning the difference between a good laugh and a bad laugh takes time and it takes self-reflection. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today were I not standing on a pile of regret.\u201d Cheers to that!</p> <p>Despite my fragile skin, I can\u2019t deny that playfully insulting \u2013 or being insulted by \u2013 someone is a great way to bond. When done correctly, it\u2019s fun</p> <h2><strong>I</strong><strong> finally understand</strong><strong> banter \u2026</strong> <strong>13 years after graduating high school</strong></h2> <p>I recently realised my friends at work <em>were</em> my friends when we could take the piss out of one another. It\u2019s the sort of conversation I couldn\u2019t transpose verbatim because it would make us look barbaric. I started to, but nothing ruins a joke faster than earnest analysis, and besides \u2013 who has the word count to explain why someone dry-retching when I mention I\u2019m bisexual is so funny?</p> <p>Maybe growing up is part of it, not necessarily ageing, but reaching a stage where you know who you are and can therefore take yourself less seriously. I\u2019m no longer insecure about my sexuality, so can joke about it. Perhaps for some lucky young people they reach this stage of self-discovery at school, for others (like me) it\u2019s a lot later.</p> <p>Enjoying banter doesn\u2019t mean everything is a joke, either. We all know the feeling of someone dismissing an offensive remark as \u201chaving a laugh\u201d \u2013 to summarise, it sucks. Whether it\u2019s a stand-up\u2019s punchline or friend\u2019s off-hand comment, these things <em>can</em> hurt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/15/rees-moggs-dim-brand-banter-entertains-no-one-but-himself\">Rees-Mogg's dim brand of banter entertains no one but himself | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Ultimately, there are a few things at play</strong></h2> <p>Empathy, sense of self, context. Reading cues from other people and knowing when to apologise are key components to being a decent human. All these concepts are generally easier to navigate within friendships \u2013 is this why banter works so well with mates?</p> <p>James agrees that familiarity is part of what makes good banter <em>good</em>, but that it doesn\u2019t all boil down to friendship. \u201cFamiliarity helps, for sure. There\u2019s an element of \u2018woah, we don\u2019t know each other like that\u2019 when it\u2019s a stranger. I think what\u2019s most important is that it\u2019s fun for both parties.\u201d</p> <p>And if you\u2019re the only one laughing ... \u201cWhen it\u2019s one-sided, I don\u2019t think it is banter. It may disguise itself as such but it\u2019s destructive.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Deirdre Fidge is a writer whose work has appeared on ABC News, SBS, the Sydney Morning Herald, Frankie magazine and television\u2019s Get Krackin\u2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve never been good at banter. If you are, you know my type: when a group full of friends is playfully teasing each other, I\u2019m the one laughing a little bit too loudly, eyes brimming with tears. Maybe it\u2019s my over-sensitivity, or the fact I spent my childhood in Canada, where I never noticed these dynamics (compared to Australia, where my Aussie relatives would regularly take the piss out of me while my face flushed), but I\u2019ve always been bad at it. Growing up, I never understood it. I\u2019m not the only one, either, a recent study showed that 48% of Australian students felt harmed by verbal \u201cjokes\u201d (also referred to as \u201cpeer aggression\u201d). Conversely, these comments were experienced by others but dismissed as \u201cfun, joking around or banter\u201d. So when does banter become bullying? Unsurprisingly, there is no clear line. The word \u201cbanter\u201d is tossed around on dating profiles as a desirable trait and crops up everywhere from friendship groups to sporting teams. Earlier this year, Australian cricket captain Justin Langer said \u201cIf I play Uno with my daughter there\u2019s lots of banter. We sort of sledge each other but we don\u2019t abuse each other.\u201d A father and daughter teasing one another over a card game is fun. In a workplace, of course, things become murkier. And nobody wants to be a buzzkill. Lawyer and manager of a commercial law firm Lisa Klug alludes to the grey area of joking in the workplace, saying intention is irrelevant if someone is deemed to have been bullied. She notes the Australian guidelines in each state that highlight when behaviour becomes bullying (some examples of behaviours crossing the line include pranks, humiliation through sarcasm, cruel nicknames, teasing). Sledging, ribbing, teasing \u2013 these are all subjective terms. And while it may be slightly more black and white in a workplace, it\u2019s still murky. One person\u2019s banter is another person\u2019s bullying. As adults, we hopefully become aware of the difference between a social and professional environment. But when you\u2019re a kid at school, that\u2019s years away, and the school ground is your entire world. How can teenagers \u2013 or super sensitive people like me \u2013 navigate this dynamic? I threw a few questions to writer and comedian James Colley to get the viewpoint of a Professional Funny Man (\u2122). James agreed that it\u2019s not easy to draw a line between shitty comments and \u201cmucking around\u201d, but \u201cjust because it isn\u2019t easy doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important,\u201d he told me. From a stand-up\u2019s point of view, \u201ca good comedian in any sense can read their audience and if the bit you are doing is purely for your own joy and not for theirs then it\u2019s no longer a good bit.\u201d For non-professionals, if this kind of communication doesn\u2019t come naturally, like anything \u2013 practice makes perfect. James tells me his humour came from being a defence mechanism (hard same). \u201cLearning the difference between a good laugh and a bad laugh takes time and it takes self-reflection. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today were I not standing on a pile of regret.\u201d Cheers to that! Despite my fragile skin, I can\u2019t deny that playfully insulting \u2013 or being insulted by \u2013 someone is a great way to bond. When done correctly, it\u2019s fun I finally understand banter \u2026 13 years after graduating high school I recently realised my friends at work were my friends when we could take the piss out of one another. It\u2019s the sort of conversation I couldn\u2019t transpose verbatim because it would make us look barbaric. I started to, but nothing ruins a joke faster than earnest analysis, and besides \u2013 who has the word count to explain why someone dry-retching when I mention I\u2019m bisexual is so funny? Maybe growing up is part of it, not necessarily ageing, but reaching a stage where you know who you are and can therefore take yourself less seriously. I\u2019m no longer insecure about my sexuality, so can joke about it. Perhaps for some lucky young people they reach this stage of self-discovery at school, for others (like me) it\u2019s a lot later. Enjoying banter doesn\u2019t mean everything is a joke, either. We all know the feeling of someone dismissing an offensive remark as \u201chaving a laugh\u201d \u2013 to summarise, it sucks. Whether it\u2019s a stand-up\u2019s punchline or friend\u2019s off-hand comment, these things can hurt. Ultimately, there are a few things at play Empathy, sense of self, context. Reading cues from other people and knowing when to apologise are key components to being a decent human. All these concepts are generally easier to navigate within friendships \u2013 is this why banter works so well with mates? James agrees that familiarity is part of what makes good banter good, but that it doesn\u2019t all boil down to friendship. \u201cFamiliarity helps, for sure. There\u2019s an element of \u2018woah, we don\u2019t know each other like that\u2019 when it\u2019s a stranger. I think what\u2019s most important is that it\u2019s fun for both parties.\u201d And if you\u2019re the only one laughing ... \u201cWhen it\u2019s one-sided, I don\u2019t think it is banter. It may disguise itself as such but it\u2019s destructive.\u201d \u2022 Deirdre Fidge is a writer whose work has appeared on ABC News, SBS, the Sydney Morning Herald, Frankie magazine and television\u2019s Get Krackin\u2019",

      "bodyText": "A Seattle city council race between socialist Kshama Sawant and business-backed Egan Orion that saw unprecedented financial contributions from Amazon and some of its top executives was too close to call on Wednesday \u2013 although Orion was ahead in early counting. The tech giant, which is headquartered in the city, funneled $1.5m into the local city council elections by way of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce\u2019s political action committee, which backed Orion and six other candidates considered to be business-friendly. In 2015, the tech corporation and its employees only contributed about $130,000 to the city council candidates, according to the New York Times. But despite the incredible amount of money contributed to the races by Amazon, there is no sign that the candidates endorsed by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Pac, the Amazon-backed political action committee, will come away with a landslide victory. With more than half of Seattle\u2019s ballots counted, incumbent council member Sawant trailed Orion by about eight percentage points. But given that later voters in the city often lean far left, it remained difficult to predict which candidate would ultimately prevail. The results in other city council districts also remain uncertain on Wednesday: Phil Tavel, Heidi Wills and Mark Solomon, candidates who were all endorsed by the Amazon-backed Pac, trailed their opponents by at least a few percentage points (Solomon is behind by about 12 percentage points). While some candidates endorsed by the Pac, including Alex Pedersen and Debora Juarez have a substantial lead, Jim Pugel is ahead of his opponent by less than one percentage point. Orion said he was excited about the initial results and while he thought the funds from Amazon may have had a very minor impact, he considered them unnecessary. \u201cFrom my perspective, I think that the Amazon money was a big distraction when we were trying to make our closing arguments with voters,\u201d said Orion. Other locally based corporations, including Boeing and Microsoft, also contributed to Orion\u2019s campaign. \u201cWe have run a historic grassroots campaign, with working people, community members rejecting Amazon and billionaires\u2019 attempt to buy this election, and that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to win every battle against the billionaires,\u201d said Sawant. \u201cWhat matters is the political clarity that the billionaires are not on our side and that this is going to be a struggle.\u201d At a time when many Seattleites are already critical of Amazon\u2019s influence in the city \u2013 with many pointing to the role it has played in Seattle\u2019s rising cost of living and growing income inequality \u2013 the contributions left an unsavory taste in some residents\u2019 mouths. Sarah Champernowne, 29, a tech worker in Seattle who is a strong supporter of Sawant, said she was concerned about the corporation contributing this type of money in the election. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a democratic process and it\u2019s not a democratic process when Amazon can contribute that much to basically a small election,\u201d she said. Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative party and former tech worker, has long been a fierce critic of big business and its influence on the city. After winning a council seat six years ago and becoming the first socialist on the Seattle city council in almost 100 years, she soon helped lead the push to bump the city\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour (a first for a major US city).

      "bodyText": "Native forest logging will be phased out in Victoria by 2030 and logging of old growth forests will cease immediately under a plan to transition the state\u2019s timber industry. Announcing the plan on Thursday, the Andrews government said it would provide $120m in financial assistance to the sector, which has been under increasing pressure in recent years. The government will extend existing forestry agreements until 2024, after which native timber supply will be reduced before ending in 2030. The industry will be transitioned to plantation-based supply. The premier, Daniel Andrews, said an immediate halt to the logging of old growth forests would protect about 90,000 hectares. The government says it will also protect another 96,000 hectares of Victorian forest from logging in order to preserve habitat for the greater glider, which is listed as vulnerable under Australian environment law, and other threatened species. The $120m package for workers will include money for training programs, employment assistance and top-ups to redundancy payments. \u201cThis industry is going through a transition. It means it\u2019s not good enough for us to merely cross our fingers and hope for the best. We need a plan to support workers and support jobs,\u201d Andrews said. The state\u2019s timber sector has been under growing pressure in recent years due to declining sustainable timber supply. Environment groups have opposed the continued logging of native forests, which has destroyed habitat for native species including Victoria\u2019s faunal emblem, the critically endangered Leadbeater\u2019s possum. VicForests would have lost money for the past three years were it not for skyrocketing payments from the government not to log areas where the Leadbeater\u2019s possum is found, the company\u2019s annual reports show. VicForests declared a profit before tax of $4m in the 2018-19 financial year but would have made a loss of almost $7m if it were not for $11m in government payments not to log possum habitat. The possum subsidy was almost double the $5.5m in taxpayer\u2019s money handed over the previous year. And last year\u2019s handout reflects an almost tenfold growth from the $1.3m contribution in 2015, the year VicForests first started accounting for payments under the possum program. Thursday\u2019s announcement will be met with opposition from the industry. The Australia Forest Products Association said it would lead to \u201cthe loss of thousands of jobs and the withdrawal of key investment in many regional and rural centres across the state\u201d. \u201cThe Andrews Government has also seriously underestimated the pride most Australians, including those in our cities, have in our primary industry sector,\u201d the association\u2019s chief executive, Ross Hampton, said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Environment groups say the plan is a welcome first step but the end of native forest logging should come sooner than 2030. The Wilderness Society\u2019s Victorian campaigns manager, Amelia Young, said the transition plan was a step towards bringing forest management into line with community expectations and supporting regional workers through a period of \u201cinevitable change\u201d. \u201cFor too long, Victoria\u2019s native forests have been badly managed and overlogged,\u201d she said. \u201cThe industry\u2019s future is in plantations and recycled fibre, which is where security lies for the 1,000 workers remaining in the industry. We welcome the government\u2019s long-overdue acknowledgement of this,\u201d she said. She said the Andrews government should put in place immediate protection for the forests that would now be exempt from logging. The Australian Conservation Foundation said an immediate end to old growth logging would protect some of Victoria\u2019s most spectacular and intact forests and the exemption for 96,000 hectares for the greater glider was also good news. But Jess Abrahams, a nature campaigner at the ACF, said ending native forest logging in 2030 \u201cis just too slow for the critically endangered Leadbeater\u2019s possum, which is on the brink of extinction\u201d. \u201cThe transition, and any payouts, must be fully locked in and bedded down to prevent a future government trying to bring a zombie native forest logging industry back to life,\u201d he added. Victoria\u2019s announcement stands in contrast to logging that persists in New South Wales and Queensland. The Queensland government has allowed the timber industry to log thousands of hectares of forest in Noosa that had been set aside for a national park. In New South Wales, there have been calls to open the Murray Valley national park to logging and the government has been looking at remapping old growth forest to potentially open up new areas to industry. The Goongerah Environment Centre and Friends of the Earth said they needed to see more details and maps of the government\u2019s proposal. \u201c(The environment minister Lily) D\u2019Ambrosio is to be congratulated on her work to secure protection for an additional 90,000 hectares of mapped old growth forest, however clarification about where these forests are located and how this policy will be implemented is urgently need,\u201d a spokesman, Ed Hill, said.",

Elizabeth Warren to Bill Gates: \u2018I\u2019m always happy to meet with people\u2019 At the New York Times DealBook conference, the world\u2019s second wealthiest man said he\u2019s doesn\u2019t agree with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s enthusiasm for breaking up big tech companies \u201cI\u2019m super biased,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Microsoft should be broken up,\u201d Gates said, adding that he wouldn\u2019t \u201cwish that on anyone.\u201d Gates didn\u2019t say who he\u2019d vote for if it came down to Warren and Donald Trump, \u201cI hope the more professional candidate is an electable candidate,\u201d he said. He also said he wasn\u2019t sure if Warren, whose entire brand centers on her enthusiams for taxing the wealthy, would \u201ceven be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.\u201d To that last question at least, Warren has responded: \u201cI\u2019m always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d love to explain exactly how much you\u2019d pay under my wealth tax. (I promise it\u2019s not $100 billion.)\u201d Gates had mentioned that he\u2019s happy to $20bn, but maybe not $100bn. House Democrats have pulled their subpoena for testimony from Charles Kupperman, a former Trump administration national security official. Kupperman filed a lawsuit asking a judge to help resolve conflicting orders from Congressional leaders, who wanted him to testify in the impeachment inquiry, and the White House, which wanted him to skip testifying, citing executive privilege. House layers withdrew their subpoena looking to avoid a delay the impeachment hearings. More context from the Washington Post: Instead, the House said that in the interest if speed, it would look to the outcome of another case that is further along in judicial proceedings \u2014 that involving a subpoena to former White House counsel Donald McGahn. That case raises similar issues of whether the White House can bar high-ranking administration officials from testifying. In the McGahn case, a different judge at the same courthouse in Washington heard oral arguments last week and has said she was likely7 to issue an opinion before the end of November. Leon had set oral arguments in the Kupperman lawsuit for Dec. 10. Democrats will no longer host their 6th presidential debate at UCLA Due to a dispute between the University of California, Los Angeles and a local labor union, the Democrats will no longer hold their 6th presidential debate there. \u201cIn response to concerns raised by the local organized labor community in Los Angeles, we have asked our media partners to seek an alternative site for the December debate,\u201d Democratic National Committee senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said in an emailed statement. HuffPost first reported the news. Labor union AFSCME 3299, sent a letter to at least six of the candidates asking them to refrain from speaking on University of California campuses The labor group has accused the school administration of outsourcing jobs and breaking state labor laws. The university has denied that it has broken the law. The DNC has yet to announce a new location for the debates scheduled for December 19. Federal prosecutors in San Francisco have charged two former Twitter employees and a Saudi national with a plot to provide information about Twitter users to the Saudi government. The Guardian\u2019s Kari Paul reports: A complaint unsealed on Wednesday in US district court in San Francisco detailed a coordinated effort by Saudi officials to recruit employees at the social media giant to look up the private data of thousands of Twitter accounts. One of the former Twitter employees, Ahmad Abouammo, was arrested on Tuesday on charges of spying and falsifying an invoice to obstruct an FBI investigation. He is a US citizen. The other former employee, a Saudi citizen named Ali Alzabarah, was accused of accessing the personal information of more than 6,000 Twitter accounts in 2015 on behalf of Saudi Arabia. Alzabarah accessed accounts of a number of prominent government critics including that of Omar Abdulaziz, a prominent journalist with more than 1 million followers who was close to late Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi, a US citizen, was killed by the Saudi government last year. The US justice department also alleged that the employees \u2013 whose jobs did not require access to Twitter users\u2019 private information \u2013 were rewarded with a designer watch and tens of thousands of dollars funneled into secret bank accounts. The former attorney general that earned Donald Trump\u2019s ire for recusing himself from Russia probe is planning to enter the Alabama senate race, according to reports. He\u2019ll be running for his former senate seat, which is occupied for two decades, from 1997 to 2017. Sessions would have to face-off against opponents in the Alabama GOP primaries and against Trump, doesn\u2019t seem to have forgiven Sessions. More context, from the AP: Sessions is expected to announce his candidacy Thursday. The two-decade senator\u2019s entry into the race upends the 2020 Republican primary, which has a crowded field competing to challenge Democratic Sen. Doug Jones for the once reliably red seat. The decision comes after months of speculation that Sessions might seek a return to the Senate. Sessions was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, and the two supported similar policies on immigration and law enforcement. But Sessions\u2019 recusal from the Russia inquiry prompted blistering public criticism from Trump, who eventually asked him to resign. Despite the repeated attacks, Sessions has remained a Trump loyalist who continues to back the president\u2019s policies. In a speech last month at a Republican Party fundraiser in Huntsville, Sessions reiterated his support for Trump even as he joked about life after being \u201cfired\u201d from a job. Sessions praised Trump\u2019s effort on trade, immigration and foreign policy. \u201cThat\u2019s why I supported him and why I still do support him,\u201d Sessions told the crowd of about 500. \u201cHe is relentlessly and actually honoring the promises he made to the American people.\u201d Kentucky\u2019s Republican Gov. Matt Bevin is asking officials to double check the results of Tuesday\u2019s gubernatorial election. Tallies last night put Democrat Andy Beshear ahead Bevin by just over 5,000 votes. Bevin wants officials to recheck and recanvass of the voting machines and absentee ballots. He cited \u201cirregularities\u201d but didn\u2019t provide any other details to journalists at a press conference. Bevin\u2019s campaign manager said, in a statement: \u201cThe people of Kentucky deserve a fair and honest election. With reports of irregularities, we are exercising the right to ensure that every lawful vote was counted.\u201d Beshear has claimed victory and has indicated he\u2019ll soon be naming members of his cabinet as he transitions to take the governor\u2019s seat. But Bevin has refused to concede. Recanvassing rarely yields different results. Rudy Giuliani, who is not just a lawyer, but the president\u2019s lawyer, has recruited three attorneys to represent him, as New York federal prosecutors look into his business dealings. It doesn\u2019t suggest Giuliani has that much confidence in his own law skills, but anyway it\u2019s ok because according to Giuliani: \u201cThe evidence, when revealed fully, will show that this present farce is as much a frame-up and hoax as Russian collusion, maybe worse, and will prove the President is innocent.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian officials, including efforts to seek the removal of the US ambassador, have become entangled in the ongoing impeachment inquiry. It seems Elizabeth Warren has lost that important Bill Gates demographic: Ps: regarding Warren sitting down \u201cwith someone who has as much money as he has\u201d... Gates is the second richest person in the world. Here\u2019s a stock statement from Amy Klobuchar\u2019s campaign manager on her making the December debate. (By achieving 5% in a poll which had a margin of error of plus/minus 4.5%): Today, Senator Klobuchar qualified for the December debate. Amy looks forward to sharing her optimistic agenda on stage and showing once again how she will be the President for not half of America, but all of America. Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic frontrunner in Iowa, according to a new Quinnipiac poll, with Joe Biden in fourth place in the second poll in less than a week. Warren was at 20% in the poll, released on Wednesday, with Buttigieg second on 19% and Sanders in third place with 17%. The poll had an error margin of 4.5%. Biden was the choice of just 15% of respondents \u2013 unwelcome news for the former vice-president after a New York Times/Siena College poll also found him in fourth place on November 1. That survey also found Warren in the lead. Amy Klobuchar was at 5%, which qualifies her for the December Democrat debate, while Tulsi Gabbard got 4%, meaning she makes the stage in November. Turkey\u2019s president Tayyip Erdogan will visit the White House next week, Donald Trump has announced. Erdogan, who has been widely condemned by the international community after launching a bloody assault on Kurdish forces in Syria, will travel to Washington on Wednesday, November 13. By a quirk of fate \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 the high profile visit will coincide with the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry. Turkey\u2019s assault on Kurdish fighters in northern Syria \u2013 which came after Trump abruptly pulled out US forces \u2013 has been roundly criticized, including by a number of Republicans. The Kurds had been crucial allies to the US in the fight against Isis. In October the House of Representatives, including a majority of Republicans, voted overwhelmingly to condemn Trump for the troop withdrawal. \u2022There was a direct quid pro between the release of US military aid to Ukraine and a Ukrainian investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden, according to a transcript of the testimony by Bill Taylor, the US\u2019s top diplomat in Ukraine. \u2022Taylor told the House he had a \u201cclear understanding security assistance money would not come until the President [of Ukraine] committed to pursue the investigation\u201d. His account matches that of others who have testified in the impeachment inquiry. \u2022Taylor\u2019s testimony also supported accounts of a backchannel of communication between the White House and Ukraine. Taylor alleged that Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer, was keen for Volodymyr Zelenskiy to \u201csay out loud\u201d he would investigate the Bidens. \u2022Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, said Taylor\u2019s testimony \u201creveals how, through a shadow foreign policy channel, Trump withheld military assistance and a White House meeting from Ukraine until Ukrainian officials agreed to announce investigations to help Trump politically\u201d. Bill Taylor sent reams of information, including text messages, WhatsApp messages, and handwritten notes, to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in an attempt to draw attention to the withholding of US assistance to Ukraine, Taylor testified. According to three House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry, the State Department then refused to hand that over to investigators. Taylor said that he sent a cable to Pompeo \u2013 at the suggestion of since-fired national security advisor John Bolton \u2013 about \u201csecurity assistance\u201d to Ukraine. Included in that cable, Taylor said, were texts he exchanged with US ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and US special representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker: texts where Taylor asked whether the US paying military aid to Ukraine was dependent on Ukraine investigating the Bidens. Taylor said the cable also included WhatsApp messages and handwritten, \u201ccareful notes\u201d. In a document of excerpts of Taylor\u2019s testimony, the House committees on Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs noted: \u201cThe State Department refused to produce to the Committees documents that Ambassador Taylor provided to the Department.\u201d This is the take from Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee: No word from the White House yet. In his testimony before the House, Bill Taylor said the idea \u201cto get [Ukraine] President Zelensky to say out loud he\u2019s going to investigate Burisma and 2016 election\u201d came from Rudy Giuliani, acting on behalf of Donald Trump. (Thanks to Politico reporter Kyle Cheney for the screengrab): Here is a key exchange from the released transcript, where Bill Taylor, the US\u2019s top diplomat in Ukraine, describes how US military assistance funding was linked to a Ukrainian investigation of the Bidens. Asked about whether the unfreezing of military aid to Ukraine depended on an investigation, Taylor said: \u201cThat was my clear understanding, security assistance money would not come until the President [of Ukraine] committed to pursue the investigation.\u201d Here\u2019s the extract from the transcript. (Taylor is answering, House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff is the questioner): Q: And when you say that, this was the first time I heard that the security assistance\u2014not just the White House meeting\u2014was conditioned on the investigation, when you talk about conditioned, did you mean that if they didn\u2019t do this, the investigations, they weren\u2019t going to get that, the meeting and the military assistance? A: That was my clear understanding, security assistance money would not come until the President [of Ukraine] committed to pursue the investigation. Q: So if they don\u2019t do this, they are not going to get that was your understanding? A: Yes, sir. Q: Are you aware that quid pro quo literally means this for that? A: I am. The House has released the transcript of US diplomat Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony in the impeachment inquiry. The transcript describes the existence of a parallel foreign policy approach to Ukraine, and supports the testimony of others that there was a direct quid pro quo in Trump\u2019s demand that Ukraine investigate the Bidens. The transcript can be read in full here. Key excerpts from the transcript can be read here. During Taylor\u2019s hearing, he told the House there was a clear connection between the Trump administration releasing funding to Ukraine, and Ukraine investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. \u201cThat was my clear understanding, security assistance money would not come until the president [of Ukraine] committed to pursue the investigation,\u201d Taylor said. In a statement Rep Adam Schiff, Rep Eliot Engel and Rep Carolyn Maloney, the chairs of investigating committees, said: \u201cThe testimony of Ambassador Taylor\u2014a West Point graduate, Vietnam veteran, and nonpartisan diplomat \u2014 shows how President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine and conditioned its release, as well as a vital White House meeting, on the President of Ukraine publicly announcing investigations into debunked conspiracy theories involving the Bidens and the 2016 election.\u201d A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed health care providers to refuse to take part in procedures on religious grounds. The rule, which had not yet gone into effect, would have let clinicians object to providing abortions and other services that conflict with their moral and religious beliefs. The decision came after 19 states, the District of Columbia, three local governments, health organizations and others sued the US Department of Health and Human Services. \u2022Public impeachment hearings will begin next week, Adam Schiff announced. Bill Taylor, the US\u2019s top diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state, will testify on Wednesday. Marie Yovanovitch will appear on Friday. \u2022The trial of Roger Stone, Donald Trump\u2019s longtime advisor, is underway in DC. Stone is accused of obstructing justice, witness tampering, and lying under oath. The charges stem from Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. \u2022Elizabeth Warren received a boost when Rep Ayanna Pressley, a high-profile member of \u201cThe Squad\u201d endorsed her for president. In a video message, Pressley said Warren\u2019s plans are \u201cabout power, who has it, who refuses to let it go, and who deserves more of it\u201d. \u2022Donald Trump\u2019s EU envoy \u201cfabricated\u201d parts of his testimony in the impeachment inquiry, according to a lawyer for Fiona Hill, a former White House expert on Russia. Hill\u2019s lawyer said Gordon Sondland invented a number of coffee meetings. Sondland changed other parts of his testimony on Tuesday. The prosecution is presenting opening arguments the Roger Stone trial in Washington DC \u2013 laying out a clear timeline regarding Stone\u2019s actions, the publication of emails aiming to hurt the campaign of Hillary Clinton, and Stone\u2019s alleged lying under oath to a congressional committee. \u201cWe are here today because one man obstructed Congress\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election,\u201d prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky told the jury. Zelinsky also said that Steve Bannon would be called to appear in court. \u201cRoger Stone started bragging that he was in touch with WikiLeaks,\u201d Zelinsky said. \u201cDonald Trump was running for president of the United States against Hillary Clinton and the defendant thought those emails would help his friend, Trump, and hurt Clinton.\u201d Zelinsky is arguing that Stone, after repeatedly saying he was speaking to Wikileaks, later sought to \u201ccover up\u201d his efforts. \u201cRoger Stone repeatedly lied under oath to a congressional committee and then tampered with a witness to cover up his tracks.\u201d Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley has broken with The Squad... to endorse Elizabeth Warren for president. Pressley\u2019s close House allies Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have all endorsed Bernie Sanders, but Pressley announced she would back Warren in a Twitter video this afternoon. Pressley, like Warren, represents Massachusetts, and is now set to join Warren on the campaign trail on Thursday. \u201cYou\u2019ve all heard about the senator\u2019s plans but here\u2019s the thing: The plans are about power, who has it, who refuses to let it go, and who deserves more of it. For Elizabeth and for me power belongs in the hands of the people,\u201d Pressley said. \u201cThat\u2019s why she\u2019s fighting for fundamental change that restores power to those who\u2019ve been left behind, and centers those who\u2019ve never had access to it in the first place.\u201d Reuters is reporting that a meeting between Donald Trump and China\u2019s Xi Jinping to sign an interim trade deal could be delayed until December \u201cas discussions continue over terms and venue.\u201d US stock markets have hit record highs on suggestions that a trade deal is imminent, something Trump has been boasting about this week. They are now slipping back into the red. Donald Trump will travel to New York City next week, to kick off the city\u2019s Veterans Day Parade. According to the White House, Trump will offer a tribute to veterans at the opening ceremony of Monday\u2019s 100th annual parade. Trump has been roundly booed in larger cities recently \u2013 see the Washington Nationals-Houston Astros game \u2013 and he is far from popular in NYC. The president might see the Veterans Day ceremony as safer territory. But who knows. According to the White House, Trump will offer remarks then lay a wreath at the Eternal Light memorial in Madison Square Park. The trial of Roger Stone, a longtime advisor to Donald Trump, began this morning in Washington DC \u2013 a trial resulting from charges in Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Stone has pleaded not guilty to charges of obstructing justice and witness tampering. He is also accused of lying to the US House of Representatives Intelligence Committee about the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to obtain emails hacked by Russia, which were published by the Wikileaks website. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith \u2013 @SmithInAmerica \u2013 will be reporting and tweeting from court throughout the day. The open hearings that Adam Schiff will be closely watched and could be incredibly revealing. Bill Taylor\u2019s behind-closed-doors testimony was particularly damning. Taylor testified that Trump explicitly put pressure on Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden. Taylor became the US\u2019s top diplomat in Ukraine after Marie Yovanovitch was removed. The Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding and Julian Borger reported that Taylor found in Ukraine: It was clear that Trump wanted Zelenskiy to \u201cinvestigate\u201d two things. One was the conspiracy theory that Ukraine colluded with Hillary Clinton in 2016 to help her win the presidential election. The other was Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden \u2013 son of Joe Biden \u2013 had served on the board. The allegation, subsequently found to be untrue, was that Joe Biden had put pressure on the previous government of Petro Poroshenko to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma, in order to help his son. Taylor said Giuliani was behind the \u201cirregular policy channel\u201d and that Trump would only meet with Zelenskiy if the Ukrainian president carried out these investigations. There was an explicit quid pro quo, Taylor suggested. Open impeachment hearings will begin on Wednesday November 13, Adam Schiff has announced. Bill Taylor, the US\u2019s top diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state, will testify first. Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch is due to appear on Friday November 15. It seems flipping off Donald Trump is quite a successful campaign strategy: the woman who lost her job after famously giving Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade the middle finger in 2017 won a local government seat in Virginia last night. Virginia Democrats are \u201cpromising swift action\u201d on a host of liberal policy proposals after sweeping the state\u2019s legislature, according to AP. Democrats took control of the state House and Senate \u2013 they already had Ralph Northam in place as governor \u2013 on Tuesday night, and will now push through gun restrictions and raise the minimum wage. From AP: Northam said at a cabinet meeting Wednesday morning that he\u2019s going to push for the same gun safety laws he proposed at a special session earlier this year called in response to a mass shooting in Virginia Beach. [Democrats] have also promised to approve the Equal Rights Amendment, making Virginia the final state needed for possible passage of the gender equality measure. Tulsi Gabbard has repeatedly said she won\u2019t run as a third party candidate if (when) she fails to win the Democratic nomination. That hasn\u2019t failed to stop chatter about her potentially going rogue, however... chatter that Democrats appear keen to shut down: The speculation about Gabbard running as a third party candidate is fueled in part by her unconventional fanbase, described by the New York Times as \u201can unconventional mix of anti-interventionist progressives, libertarians, contrarian culture-war skeptics, white nationalists and conspiracy theorists\u201d. But Gabbard could also be becoming disillusioned with aspects the Democratic party. Gabbard recently claimed that Hillary Clinton said she was being \u201cgroomed by the Russian government\u201d. Clinton didn\u2019t actually say that, but it riled up Gabbard nonetheless. Yesterday Gordon Sondland changed his impeachment inquiry testimony to confirm that the US president offered Ukraine a quid pro quo to investigate a political rival. Now, it seems there are other aspects of Sondland\u2019s original testimony that might not have been entirely correct. The Democratic presidential candidates are out in force today... Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang are in New Hampshire, Joe Biden is in Washington, DC, and Tom Steyer is doing something in Wisconsin. Here\u2019s Klobuchar getting herself on the ballot in New Hampshire yesterday: (And here is Tulsi Gabbard doing exactly the same thing yesterday.) Donald Trump, true to form, is insisting that the devastating Republican loss in the Kentucky governor\u2019s election had nothing to do with him. Early this morning Trump claimed Matt Bevin, the Republican incumbent in Kentucky, \u201cpicked up at least 15 points in last days\u201d due to Trump\u2019s appearance at a rally with Bevin. The polls suggest otherwise, however. According to a survey by Trafalgar Group, Bevin was actually five points ahead at the beginning of November \u2013 before Trump\u2019s rally. Make of that what you will. (And don\u2019t forget that Trump himself said on Monday that defeat for Bevin: \u201csends a really bad message\u201d.) Meanwhile Trump, a man who famously managed to lose $1bn in less than 10 years, has also been tweeting out some financial advice. David Hale is presumably being sworn in right about now. According to the AP report, Hale will tell Adam Schiff et al more about the circumstances behind Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch being hung out to dry after she was targeted by Giuliani and other Trump allies. In her own testimony, released on Monday, Yovanovitch revealed her \u201cshock\u201d upon learning that Rudy Giuliani was running a shadow foreign policy that involved attacks on her reputation. When she reached out to the State Department to ask for some defense against smears against her, none was forthcoming. Hale will apparently say that Pompeo worried defending Yovanovitch could lead to further delays in releasing military aid to Ukraine \u2013 and that the State Department \u201cworried about the reaction from Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, also one of the strongest advocates for removing the ambassador\u201d. Good morning! And welcome to live coverage of the day\u2019s political news. \u2022The State Department\u2019s third-ranking official will tell Congress today that political considerations were behind the agency\u2019s refusal to defend former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. According to Associated Press, David Hale will testify that Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, decided that defending Yovanovitch would hamper efforts to free up US military funding to Ukraine. \u2022Hale\u2019s behind-closed-doors appearance on Capitol Hill comes as more testimony could be released in the impeachment inquiry: potentially that of Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top Russia advisor. \u2022Meanwhile, Mike Pompeo, who is increasingly getting drawn into all this, is in Germany at a to meet with leaders on the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. With him on the plane: State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, who was subpoenaed to give testimony today. So it looks like that won\u2019t happen. \u2022This all comes against a backdrop of a strong Tuesday night for Democrats, of course. The party won control of Virginia for the first time in a generation after turning the state legislature blue yesterday, while the Democratic candidate for governor of Kentucky also claimed victory. \u2022Trump will be hoping to combat those losses when he holds a campaign rally in Louisiana tonight with Eddie Rispone, the Republican running in the state\u2019s upcoming governor\u2019s election.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s main electricity grid was briefly powered by 50% renewable energy this week in a new milestone that experts say will become increasingly normal. Data on the sources of power in the National Electricity Market showed that at 11.50am on Wednesday, renewables were providing 50.2% of the power to Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia \u2013 the five states served by the market. Rooftop solar was providing 23.7% of all the power demand, followed by wind at 15.7%, large-scale solar with 8.8% and hydro at 1.9%. At the same time, coal was still the largest provider of electricity on the grid, with power stations fed with black coal generating 35.7% and brown coal plants at 13.5%. First reported on RenewEconomy, the milestone was spotted using an online tool called OpenNEM that monitors the grid in real-time using data from the Australian Energy Market Operator. Dylan McConnell, of the University of Melbourne\u2019s Climate and Energy College and who helped develop the tool, said: \u201cWe will start to see this happening more frequently. It was just a snapshot in time, but it\u2019s indicative of an underlying trend in the system.\u201d Renewables maintained the 50% mark for only about 10 minutes and over the entire day contributed 31.2% of the electricity used across the five states. McConnell said spring months have generally been times of high renewables output, when demand was not being driven either by customers wanting to heat or cool homes. A continuous rollout of rooftop solar electricity was a key driver, McConnell said. The milestone reflects a rapid acceleration on renewable energy deployment across Australia in recent years that has seen record-breaking levels of investment. In 2018, a report from the Clean Energy Regulator has shown more than 2m small solar systems were installed, next to 3.5 gigawatts of large renewables projects accredited against Australia\u2019s 2020 renewable energy target. The report said Australia was now ahead of schedule in meeting the large-scale target of 33,000 gigawatt hours of renewables generation by 2020. Other analysts say that clean energy could make-up 35% of Australia\u2019s electricity needs within two years. Kane Thornton, chief executive of the renewable energy industry\u2019s Clean Energy Council, said: \u201cIt is a fantastic achievement to have more than half of the National Electricity Market powered by renewable energy, and it\u2019s worth celebrating. \u201cA decade from now it will be completely normal as more renewable energy and storage projects are built to replace retiring coal-fired power stations. \u201cAt the beginning of the decade South Australia\u2019s power system ran on more than 50 per cent wind and solar for the first time, but today it happens all the time. \u201cRenewables and storage can do everything our old coal plants can do, just cheaper, cleaner and more reliably.\u201d",

Carroll\u2019s statement, emailed to police across the state on Wednesday night, was made ahead of hearings by the Crime and Corruption Commission into public-sector data misuse and several high-profile cases that have highlighted the extent of the problem. The commission will begin hearing public evidence on Monday. The process is expected to lay bare the extent of a situation described by civil liberties groups as a systemic problem that had caused the public to lose trust in police. Carroll\u2019s email appears to be an attempt to underscore police efforts to acknowledge and manage the problem before the hearings begin. She said two formal commissioner\u2019s directives were issued to all members of the Queensland Police Service (QPS) in March 2016 and December 2018 in relation to use of information systems without an official purpose. \u201cDespite these two directives, a small number of current and former members have failed to comply with these directives,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cEach of these individuals have faced criminal and/or disciplinary action for accessing and misusing information stored within QPS computer systems. The actions of these individuals have brought our organisation into disrepute and, in some respects, overshadowed the outstanding and important community work performed by members on a daily basis throughout the state. \u201cMy message to all members is clear: accessing QPS confidential information without a purpose related to your official duties is both a criminal offence and misconduct.

This year the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal found the police service was liable for breaching the privacy of a domestic violence victim, Julie*, whose details were leaked by a police officer to her former partner. In that case, tribunal member Susan Gardiner made scathing findings about police data practices, and found that the service had breached two of the state\u2019s information privacy principles. Gardiner found police had no systematic auditing process for regulating how officers used or misused the data of citizens, and said she could not be satisfied the QPS took all reasonable measures to prevent the unauthorised use of the QPrime system. \u201cThe evidence before me is the QPS had no systematic auditing procedures of access to the QPrime system \u2013 even for at-risk groups such as domestic violence victims,\u201d the judgment said. \u201cIt simply relied on a complaint or an incident to highlight a breach.

      "bodyText": "Manchester City could be without Ederson for the match at Liverpool on Sunday because of a muscular problem that forced the goalkeeper off at half-time of the 1-1 draw with Atalanta on Wednesday. The Brazilian limped away from the stadium after the match. Pep Guardiola said he did not know if Ederson will recover but claimed no concern regarding having to start Claudio Bravo if required against the Premier League leaders at Anfield. \u201cHe\u2019s an incredible, experienced professional,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIf Ederson is ready, he is going to play. If not we will play Claudio. We trust him. Why should I doubt any players I have in my squad?\u201d Guardiola offered the stance despite Bravo\u2019s misjudgment causing his 81st-minute red card, as he rushed out and brought down Josip Ilicic. This was the second sending off in the Chilean\u2019s City career, the first coming for handling outside the area against Barcelona three years ago. Regarding Ederson\u2019s prospective fitness, Guardiola said: \u201cIt is a muscular problem \u2013 not big, it was a risk, he didn\u2019t feel comfortable and that\u2019s why we decided to make a substitution.\u201d The manager indicated the thigh area as being the region of Ederson\u2019s problem. \u201cHe\u2019s strong and we\u2019ll try with him but we won\u2019t take a risk but we\u2019ll see tomorrow.\u201d Bravo\u2019s previous league start was at Southampton in May 2018 in what was a dead game as City were already champions. Kyle Walker, brought on for Riyad Mahrez, replaced Bravo in goal. Guardiola said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t think before but Xabi Mancisidor [City\u2019s goalkeeping coach] suggested him, for his courage and he\u2019s quick. He went in and it was just one shot on target [from a Ruslan Malinovskiy free-kick]. Congratulations to him for his courage, the desire to help the team.\u201d Walker, who occasionally joins in goalkeeping training, said: \u201cDid I volunteer? It was a little bit of both. Sometimes I criticise our goalkeepers for not catching the ball in training but as I found tonight sometimes you have to take two touches.\u201d The last remark referred to him requiring two gathers of Malinovskiy\u2019s late free\u2011kick. City require one point to confirm qualification to the Champions League knockout round. After Raheem Sterling\u2019s seventh-minute opener, Gabriel Jesus missed a penalty near half-time, before Mario Pasalic\u2019s equaliser following the interval.",

The 16-month IISS study called Iran\u2019s Networks of Influence claims these networks are more important to Iranian power than either its ballistic missile program, putative nuclear plans or its conventional military forces. Overall, conventional military balance is still in favour of the US and its allies in the region, the report concludes, but the balance of effective force is now in Iran\u2019s favour.

Iran\u2019s rocket, anti-tank and missile inventory, and 25,000 reservists given to Hezbollah have made the Lebanese group an expeditionary force in its own right. Hezbollah, now the largest party in parliament, has grown because of a weak state lacking legitimacy, a mostly homogenised Shia community, a sectarian distribution of power that allows a united sect to block policy-making and the threat of Israel. Countering Iranian influence requires not only local responses but also an understanding of its sovereign capability as a whole, which has become the cornerstone of the regime\u2019s regional security strategy. The report warns against simplistic labelling the third parties as \u201cproxies\u201d, pointing out Tehran does not expect an economic return from its partners, but \u2013 on the contrary \u2013 finances them.

      "bodyText": "In a year when global protests over the climate crisis were staged from Afghanistan to Vietnam, Extinction Rebellion demonstrations stopped traffic in major cities and Greta Thunberg called for young people to skip school to fight political inaction, \u201cclimate strike\u201d has been named Collins Dictionary\u2019s 2019 word of the year. Each year, the dictionary\u2019s lexicographers monitor a 9.5bn word corpus and make a list of 10 new and notable terms. One of these is crowned the word of the year. Climate strike\u2019s definition is \u201ca form of protest in which people absent themselves from education or work in order to join demonstrations demanding action to counter climate change.\u201d The first use of the expression was registered in 2015, when a mass demonstration took place during the UN climate change conference in Paris. However, the phrase only took off in late 2018, when the young Swedish activist Thunberg\u2019s decision to skip school on Fridays in order to protest in front of the national parliament made headlines around the world. In September 2019, an estimated six million people joined the worldwide climate strike, also known as the Global Week for Future. Collins lexicographers noticed a hundredfold increase in the use of climate strike in 2019, the largest of any word on their list. Helen Newstead, Collins\u2019 language content consultant, said: \u201cClimate strikes can often divide opinion, but they have been inescapable this last year and have even driven a former word of the year \u2013 Brexit \u2013 from the top of the news agenda, if only for a short time.\u201d The choice shows a trend of new environment-related terms, after 2018\u2019s word of the year, \u201csingle-use\u201d, which refers to plastic products made to be used once only. There were other climate-related contenders this year, including \u201crewilding\u201d, meaning \u201cthe practice of returning areas of land to a wild state\u201d, and \u201chopepunk\u201d, a noun that has been used to describe \u201ca literary and artistic movement that celebrates the pursuit of positive aims in the face of adversity\u201d. Words selected over the last six years have been increasingly political. Where words such as \u201cgeek\u201d, \u201cphotobomb\u201d and \u201cbinge-watching\u201d were once defining new vocabulary, more recent selections include \u201cBrexit\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d. This year, Collins has launched a \u201cBrexicon\u201d: defining words relating to the Brexit process, including \u201cBrexiteer\u201d, \u201ccakeism\u201d, \u201cflextension\u201d and \u201cprorogue\u201d. \u201cThe dictionary has no opinion on Brexit, other than to say it has been quite generous in its gifts to the English language, as well as inspiring the use of many old-fashioned expletives,\u201d said Newstead. \u201cIt seems an age since we had more light-hearted words of the year \u2026 the politically charged atmosphere of recent years is clearly driving our language, bringing new words to the fore and giving new meanings and nuance to older ones,\u201d she added.",

      "bodyText": "Primary schoolchildren should spend at least one hour a day learning and playing in wild places to help improve their wellbeing and confidence, a leading conservation organisation has said. The Wildlife Trusts, which represents 46 local organisations and 2,300 nature reserves in the UK, has called on the next government to create a network of wild spaces where young people are free to climb trees, learn about wildlife and connect with the natural world while at school. Outdoor teaching in the UK should be used to help children develop a personal connection with nature and pursue their own passions, whether it be searching for frog spawn, building dens or climbing trees, according the the organisation. The recommendations follow a study for the trust by the Institute of Education, part of University College London (UCL), which found strong positive benefits for the self-worth and confidence of primary schoolchildren after taking part in activities in wild places. The conservation organisation said an hour a day outdoors for all British children aged four to 11 would help re-establish the connection between young people and nature in the UK. In 2015, a YouGov survey for the trust found less than one in 10 British children have access to natural areas compared to 40% of adults when they were younger. Only half of children said their school had an outdoor nature area, 37% had never seen a hedgehog and most children surveyed had never found frog spawn in a pond. For the study, UCL researchers found the overwhelming majority of children surveyed had learned something about the natural world, felt more confident and had better relationships with their classmates after spending time outdoors. The academics surveyed 451 children in 12 areas across England before and after participating in activities ran by a wildlife trust like identifying plants and trees, also interviewing teachers and Wildlife Trust educators. Of the children interviewed, 79% said the experience could help their school work, 84% felt they were capable of doing new things and 79% reported feeling more confident. Nigel Doar, the Wildlife Trusts\u2019 director of strategy, said: \u201cThis research shows that children experience profound and diverse benefits through regular contact with nature.

Only 10% were confident that treatment would follow.</p> <p>Many previous reports from parliamentary inquiries, thinktanks and mental health charities have shown CAMHS services often in effect ration care, restricting treatment to only the most unwell, in order to manage the demand.</p> <p>The findings of the survey, carried out for the charity YoungMinds, have prompted concerns because of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/17/mental-health-young-people-england-crisis-point-teacher-school-leader-survey\">sharp increase</a> in mental health problems among children and young people, which experts have linked to exam stress, social media, body image issues and the effects of dysfunctional backgrounds.</p> <p>Nine in 10 GPs have seen a rise in the past three years in the number of young people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/22/what-is-happening-with-childrens-mental-health\">seeking support</a> for mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, the survey found. But at the same time, few think a referral to CAMHS will lead to the young person receiving help.</p> <p>Emma Thomas, chief executive of YoungMinds, said: \u201cAs these worrying results show, GPs are on the frontline when it comes to mental health. But too often they don\u2019t believe that there is good enough early support in their community.</p> <p>\u201cThat leaves them grappling with the difficult choice of trying to help young people themselves, or referring them to mental health services, even when those services are overstretched.</p> <p>\u201cThis means many young people either receive support from GPs who have the best of intentions but may not feel equipped to provide the right help, or face long waiting times for specialist services, which may then turn them away because of high thresholds for treatment.\u201d</p> <p>Most GPs feel ill-prepared to help the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/18/one-in-three-young-people-suffering-mental-health-troubles-survey-finds\">growing number</a> of under-18s with mental health problems. One in five of those surveyed said they had received enough training to handle mental health issues in young people, but 59% disagreed.</p> <p>Almost half of the GPs said they often acted beyond their competency by supporting young people with mental health problems.</p> <p>One GP told YoungMinds: \u201cMental health is a specialist area, often beyond the scope of a GP, and the resulting rising demand for mental health services is often not being met. In my area, CAMHS is very good for those with severe needs, but they have much less provision for low-intensity services.\u201d</p> <p>NHS figures show <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/find-data-and-publications/supplementary-information/2019-supplementary-information-files/waiting-times-for-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-services-2018---2019-additional-statistics\">average waiting times</a> to access CAMHS in England have fallen slightly, from 57 days in 2017-18 to 53 days last year. However, that does not include under-18s who were referred but still waiting at the end of the year to hear from the NHS as to when they would be seen.</p> <p>The number of young people <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/find-data-and-publications/supplementary-information/2019-supplementary-information-files/waiting-times-for-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-services-2018---2019-additional-statistics\">referred to CAMHS</a> rose by 18% from 343,386 in 2017-18 to 405,479 in 2018-19.</p> <p>Experts believe this dramatic increase is linked to improved data collection and young people\u2019s greater willingness to seek help for their problems, as well as a rising prevalence of mental ill-health.</p> <p>The survey also found that 77% of GPs think there is too little support in the community, such as youth clubs, local charities and drop-in centres, for young people who are struggling mentally. Only 8% believe there is enough.</p> <p>Improving services for children and young people with mental health problems in England is a key priority in the <a href=\"https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/\">NHS long-term plan</a> and an extra 150-180 inpatient beds are being created for the most seriously ill.</p> <p>NHS England did not comment, blaming the rules governing purdah in pre-general election periods.

      "bodyText": "Troubled teenagers seeking urgent help from NHS mental health services are being denied treatment or facing months of delays, GPs have said. Three in four family doctors do not believe under-18s they refer to child and adolescent mental health services will end up being treated, research shows. In a survey of 1,008 GPs across the UK, 76% said they did not usually feel confident a young person they referred to CAMHS would receive treatment for their illness. Only 10% were confident that treatment would follow. Many previous reports from parliamentary inquiries, thinktanks and mental health charities have shown CAMHS services often in effect ration care, restricting treatment to only the most unwell, in order to manage the demand. The findings of the survey, carried out for the charity YoungMinds, have prompted concerns because of the sharp increase in mental health problems among children and young people, which experts have linked to exam stress, social media, body image issues and the effects of dysfunctional backgrounds. Nine in 10 GPs have seen a rise in the past three years in the number of young people seeking support for mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, the survey found. But at the same time, few think a referral to CAMHS will lead to the young person receiving help. Emma Thomas, chief executive of YoungMinds, said: \u201cAs these worrying results show, GPs are on the frontline when it comes to mental health. But too often they don\u2019t believe that there is good enough early support in their community. \u201cThat leaves them grappling with the difficult choice of trying to help young people themselves, or referring them to mental health services, even when those services are overstretched. \u201cThis means many young people either receive support from GPs who have the best of intentions but may not feel equipped to provide the right help, or face long waiting times for specialist services, which may then turn them away because of high thresholds for treatment.\u201d Most GPs feel ill-prepared to help the growing number of under-18s with mental health problems. One in five of those surveyed said they had received enough training to handle mental health issues in young people, but 59% disagreed. Almost half of the GPs said they often acted beyond their competency by supporting young people with mental health problems. One GP told YoungMinds: \u201cMental health is a specialist area, often beyond the scope of a GP, and the resulting rising demand for mental health services is often not being met. In my area, CAMHS is very good for those with severe needs, but they have much less provision for low-intensity services.\u201d NHS figures show average waiting times to access CAMHS in England have fallen slightly, from 57 days in 2017-18 to 53 days last year. However, that does not include under-18s who were referred but still waiting at the end of the year to hear from the NHS as to when they would be seen. The number of young people referred to CAMHS rose by 18% from 343,386 in 2017-18 to 405,479 in 2018-19. Experts believe this dramatic increase is linked to improved data collection and young people\u2019s greater willingness to seek help for their problems, as well as a rising prevalence of mental ill-health. The survey also found that 77% of GPs think there is too little support in the community, such as youth clubs, local charities and drop-in centres, for young people who are struggling mentally. Only 8% believe there is enough. Improving services for children and young people with mental health problems in England is a key priority in the NHS long-term plan and an extra 150-180 inpatient beds are being created for the most seriously ill. NHS England did not comment, blaming the rules governing purdah in pre-general election periods. The Conservative party did not respond to a request for comment.",

Look to the lessons of history: they\u2019ll ruin our finances, raise your taxes and saddle the next generation with debt,\u201d Javid will say. \u201cEvery single Labour government has left our country\u2019s economy in a mess.\u201d The chancellor will also accuse McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn of being the \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d of economic policy \u2013 comparing them to parents who refuse to have their children inoculated against illnesses. \u201cNot only did they reject the treatment needed to heal our economy and get the deficit down by four-fifths, they now want to take every step imaginable to make the country sick and unhealthy again,\u201d he will say. But McDonnell will insist his social transformation fund, alongside a \u00a3250bn green transformation fund, to be spent over the next decade, is necessary to put the UK back on its feet, and prepare for the climate crisis. \u201cSpent over the first five years of our Labour government, the social transformation fund will begin the urgent task of repairing our social fabric that the Tories have torn apart. A hundred and fifty billion pounds to replace, upgrade and expand our schools, hospitals, care homes and council houses. To deal with the human emergency which the Tories have created, alongside the climate emergency,\u201d he will say. Labour has not yet spelled out how it will pay for its policy pledges, though it has insisted they will be fully funded \u2013 and that it will publish a separate costings document, as it did in 2017. Labour\u2019s approach to the wealthy has already featured heavily in the early days of the campaign. In an election rally in Telford, Shropshire, on Wednesday, eight miles from where he grew up, Corbyn said a Labour majority government would \u201cchase down\u201d those who attempt a \u201cclever wheeze\u201d with their tax. His comments come after Boris Johnson said in the Telegraph that Corbyn would slap new taxes on people of all income levels \u2013 not just billionaires \u2013 and that the party \u201cviscerally detests\u201d those who have a profit motive. Corbyn said: \u201cMy personal views on billionaires is that they\u2019ve obviously got a great deal of money therefore they are in a very strong position to pay a lot more tax. \u201cSo our tax plans will affect the richest 5% of our society. We will be chasing down tax evasion, tax avoidance and tax havens because at the end of the day if you\u2019re doing some very clever wheeze, which somehow or other is avoiding your levels of taxation, you should be paying. Go further away [and] what happens then? You\u2019ve got an underfunded school, hospital and public services as a whole.\u201d Corbyn and McDonnell will unveil Labour\u2019s election bus at Liverpool Docks on Thursday. Emblazoned with the slogan, \u201cIt\u2019s Time for Real Change\u201d, it will tour marginal constituencies across the country.",
