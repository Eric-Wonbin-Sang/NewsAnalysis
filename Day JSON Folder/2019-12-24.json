      "bodyText": "A mass exodus of civilians from the last rebel-held stronghold in Syria has begun as thousands of people flee towards the Turkish border in the face of a fierce new military assault by Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies. As many as 30,000 people have left the area around the town of Maarat al-Numan after four days of airstrikes and heavy shelling paved the way for Syrian government troops to push deeper into north-western Idlib province. Maarat al-Numan sits on the strategic M5 highway, which Assad is determined to capture in order to reopen the route linking the capital, Damascus, with the city of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest. Military activity over the last few days has meant the road \u2013 the major escape route for civilians fleeing north \u2013 has also become a hazardous option. Attacks continued on Tuesday despite a supposed humanitarian pause in fighting. Those who can afford fuel have been fleeing in cars, motorbikes and flatbed trucks, often taking no more than what they can carry. \u201cThe warplanes were targeting the M5 with missiles and heavy machine guns the whole way. I don\u2019t know how we made it alive, we are so lucky,\u201d said Ammar Karkas, 29, a father of two who left Maarat al-Numan on Monday. \u201cTwo cars carrying displaced people just 2km behind us were targeted and five people were burnt alive. If we\u2019d been a little bit later we would have been killed in the same airstrike.\u201d Monitors and witnesses said at least 12 civilians have been killed on the road this week as Russian and Syrian air force jets have targeted civilian convoys. The new fighting comes despite a September agreement by the leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran to recommit to de-escalation efforts in the area. At least 100 people have been killed since the ground offensive began last week, including five children who died after missiles hit a school sheltering displaced people in the village of Jobas on Tuesday. Maarat al-Numan, an important early centre of Syria\u2019s 2011 revolution, now resembles a ghost town, resident Rami al-Maari said. The town is expected to fall to the regime imminently. \u201cLast night in my neighbourhood an airstrike destroyed 20 houses. The shelling is continuous. They want to kill civilians or force them to leave,\u201d the 23-year-old said. \u201cMy family don\u2019t want to leave our house to go live in terrible conditions in a camp on the border. But if the soldiers get any closer we will have to leave because we are wanted by the regime and we are afraid of being arrested. In both scenarios we are dead.\u201d A bombing campaign since April has killed more than 1,400 people and sent almost 1 million fleeing to the Turkish border. Thousands are now struggling in makeshift accommodation in the winter conditions as fuel shortages threaten medical care and push up prices of food and transport. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has said the border will remain shut, warning that his country, already home to 4 million Syrians, will not be able to absorb new refugees. Aid agencies have repeatedly warned that attacking Idlib puts the lives of 3 million civilians in danger and could trigger the worst humanitarian disaster of the almost nine-year war to date. Originally home to about 1 million people, the province\u2019s population has been swollen with civilians displaced by fighting elsewhere in the country. A ceasefire deal brokered by Russia and Turkey last year unravelled after the hardline Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) wrested control of the area from more moderate rebel groups in January. In the new, wide ground offensive, the regime has quickly advanced from the south and east towards Maarat al-Numan, capturing more than 40 villages and hamlets, sources on both sides said. Syrian government forces are now about 4km outside the town and have surrounded a Turkish observation post near the village of Surman \u2013 one of 12 installed last year as part of the ceasefire agreement. \u201cThe situation in Maaret al-Numan is indescribable: the city is witnessing the biggest mass displacement in this area since the beginning of the revolution,\u201d said Mustafa al-Ghareeb, spokesperson for the town\u2019s civil defence centre. \u201cWe are working around the clock rescuing civilians trapped under the debris, but also helping move people out of the city. We\u2019ve appealed to people who own cars or vans in neighbouring areas to come help move civilians fleeing the bombing. There are still hundreds of families at risk.\u201d The UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has expressed alarm at the escalation in fighting, which adds to threats to vital cross-border aid to Idlib after the security council was unable to overcome Russian and Chinese objections to an existing aid delivery programme in a vote last week. \u201cThe UN urges all parties to ensure the protection of civilians, and to allow sustained and unhindered access by all humanitarian parties to provide life-saving assistance to all in need,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Dujarric, Guterres\u2019s spokesman.",

      "bodyText": "Boom! America\u2019s Nasdaq index has closed at a new all-time high, as the 2019 bull market continues its run. The tech-focused Nasdaq index ended today\u2019s truncated session some 7 points higher at 8,952. That\u2019s a new closing high, as the fabled Santa Rally does the business again. That matches London\u2019s FTSE 250, which shimmied to a record high a few hours ago in a pre-Christmas present to shareholders. However the Dow dipped by 0.1%, amid worried about what \u2018Christmas present\u2019 North Korea might be sending America\u2019s way. The big picture is that Wall Street has notched up its best year since 2013, with the Dow up 22% this year and the Nasdaq up a staggering 34%. That\u2019s partly because stocks suffered a ghastly slump a year ago, and have been recovering since. Wall Street traders are now heading off. so we should too. Thanks for reading and commenting, have a lovely festive break, and see you soon. GW Wall Street is looking rather subdued, as traders get their final orders in before Christmas. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 23 points or 0.1% to 28,526, having hit record highs (again) on Monday. It\u2019s a 1pm finish (6pm UK time), so there\u2019s still time for some drama. Perhaps the Santa Rally might make a late appearance, as we saw in London today? Uber\u2019s shares have risen 1.3% following news of Travis Kalanick\u2019s departure from its board. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives reckons it will help CEO Dara Khosrowshahi to lift Uber\u2019s fortunes, after posting hefty losses this year. He told clients (via Marketwatch): \u201cGiven the pace of his insider sales and other initiatives he has on the horizon, it makes sense for Uber and Kalanick to go their separate ways at this time as it would be a distraction in our opinion if he remained in the Board room going forward. \u201cMany investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror as the overhang from the lockup has been a lingering cloud over the Uber name over the past few months. Some late news from Uber: Travis Kalanick, co-founder of the ride-sharing company, is quitting its board and sold all shares. Announcing Kalanick\u2019s departure, Uber says he will leave the board on departure from the board will be effective on 31 December 31 (a week today). In a statement, Kalanick says: \u201cAt the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits.\u201d Uber floated on the stock market in May; shares are down 34% each, making it one of the flops of the year. Kalanick\u2019s tenure as CEO ended in June 2017, when he was forced to resign after a damning exposure of Uber\u2019s culture, and claims he had ignored reports of sexual harassment. A quick update: Wall Street opened higher, as the recent stock rally continued to push shares up. But it then faltered, as traders worried about tensions with North Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un yesterday caused alarm, when he warned America to expect a\u201cChristmas gift\u201d. Donald Trump has now brushed this aside, telling reporters the United States would \u201cdeal with it very successfully\u201d and that perhaps it would be a \u201cnice present\u201d. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll find out what the surprise is and we\u2019ll deal with it very successfully. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Time for a quick recap, as City traders dash home for Christmas (or possibly to the shops for a last-minute gift). The traditional Santa Rally has lifted stocks across Europe today, on the final session before the Christmas holidays. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index, made up of medium-sized firms, jumped 0.6% to a new all-time peak. It is now firmly on track for its best year since 2013, having rallied strongly since the UK election. There was also a small gain on the blue-chip FTSE 100, which nudged a five-month high (in a very quiet day\u2019s trading). European stocks also struck a new peak (although some were already closed). Analysts cited trade war optimism, and the prospect of more loose monetary policy in 2020, for the revival. 2019 has been a good year for stocks, with some indices up over 20% (recovering from a slump in autumn 2018). The gold price has also pushed higher, hitting a six-week peak today. That may show some investors are taking defensive positions, in case 2020 brings more turbulence (likely, with a US presidential election, and Brexit, on the calendar). Sterling, though, is hovering at its lowest levels in three weeks as traders worry that the UK and EU won\u2019t agree a free trade deal by December 2020. The prospect of a Phase One trade deal between the US and China may have lifted markets this year....but there\u2019s less optimism that a fuller deal will emerge soon. As Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank told clients: \u201cThere are few reasons to believe that optimism about a broader or \u2018Phase 2\u2019 could emerge in the near term.\u201d Fox Business\u2019s Maria Bartiromo points out that trillions of dollars have been added to stock values this year: Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index has surged by 25% this year, while the bigger FTSE 100 has gained 13%. That puts the FTSE 250 among the best-performing indices, while the 100 is one of the laggards. Forex.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada has sent this chart over, showing how stock markets around the world have rallied in 2019. Razaqzada sums up the year: At the top of the tree is the Nasdaq 100 and at the bottom is Spain\u2019s Ibex and UK\u2019s FTSE 100 among major global indices. Stocks have rallied across the board in 2019, even if there were turbulences along the way as investors worried over Brexit and the damaging trade war between the US and China, among other things. But as optimism grew that the world\u2019s largest economies were agreeing to a phase one trade deal, stocks pushed higher \u2013 especially in the US. Tepid economic growth in Europe kept the gains in check for indices in this continent. But this lack of economic growth and non-existent inflationary pressures meant investors were confident that the major central banks were not going to exit zero or negative interest rate policy, and QE, any time soon. They therefore saw the higher-yielding equities as one of the most attractive assets again, causing global stock markets to rise sharply. But as the central bank balance sheet grows ever larger, the withdrawal of such liquidity is a major concern that could come back to haunt stocks at some point down the line. The FTSE 100 had a more muted day. It gained just 8 points, to finish at a five-month high of 7632. Lloyds Banking Group ended the day as the top rise, up nearly 2%, with distribution firm Bunzl (1.6%) and chemicals firm Croda (+1.5%) close behind. The UK stock market is now closed until Friday, giving investors a break from trading. But while trading floors will be quiet, the Internet will be fizzling as UK shoppers look for bargains. Analysts predict that more than \u00a31bn will be spent online tomorrow, as the traditional festive sales get underway. Shipping firm Clarkson led the FTSE 250 rally, finishing 3.5% higher. Housebuilder Redrow gained 2.8%, amid hopes that the housing market might pick up next year Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 has closed at an all-time high, as traders down tools for Christmas. The index of medium-sized companies, including many domestic stocks, has closed 137 points higher at 21,981 points. That\u2019s a gain of 0.6% today, lifting the index above the levels struck after this month\u2019s general election. Nearly every sector rallied, led by energy (+1.5%), healthcare (+1.1%) and miners (+1.1%). Trading was undeniably thin, but this still suggests the City is hopeful that this year\u2019s rally will continue into 2020. The FTSE 250 is seen as a better barometer of the UK economy than the bigger FTSE 100 (which contains more multinational firms). Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 also enjoyed a late surge, and was at record levels as it entered the closing auction..... Here\u2019s Edward Moya of trading firm OANDA on the Santa Rally: Markets officially entered holiday as trading volumes remain very thin and as Wall Street prepares to take the rest of the week off. The Santa rally starts today and if it delivers its typical holiday rally, could produce a 1.3% gain over the next seven trading days. This Christmas Eve will not mimic last year, when we saw US stocks collapse with the S&amp;P 500 falling into bear market territory. This holiday period should be rather calm as trade updates appear very constructive as we near the finalization of the phase-one trade deal next month. The reason we won\u2019t see a repeat of last year is because there are no fears of any of the major central banks tightening policy anytime soon. The playbook for 2020 will be for stocks to rise higher as markets firmly believe the Fed will be on hold, credit markets are healthy, the consumer is strong and some of the key headwinds in 2019 are becoming tailwinds. As if by magic, European stock markets are rallying. The Stoxx 600 index of Europe\u2019s largest companies is now up 0.2%, and just hit a new all-time high. Looks like the Santa Rally is real after all, kids! Russia\u2019s stock market is one of the better performers today. The RTS index has risen by 0.3%, or 4 points, to 1,539. Energy giant Gazprom is among the risers, after raising $13bn of funds to build a new gas plant. The rouble is also strengthening, up 0.3% to 62.06 to the US dollar. That\u2019s nearly its best level of the year, boosted by foreign companies buying roubles to pay tax bills. Santa is also giving the Madrid stock market the cold shoulder today. Spain\u2019s IBEX 35 index has dipped by 22 points, or 0.2%, to 9,637 -- one of the few European markets actually open today. France\u2019s CAC is very slightly higher. With an hour\u2019s trading to go, the FTSE 100 is just hanging onto a five-month high. It\u2019s up 6 points at 7630. Distribution firm Bunzl is now the top riser, up 1,7%, with Ocado close behind (now up 1.6%). Sterling isn\u2019t feeling much Christmas cheer today. The pound is hovering at at three-week low against the US dollar today, at $1.293, as traders fear more Brexit turmoil in 2020. That\u2019s quite a decline in the last 10 days. Sterling hit $1.35, its highest since May 2018, when Boris Johnson won the general election. But the prospect of a bruising battle with the EU over a future trade deal is now puling the pound down. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says the market\u2019s post-election hopes turn into apprehension. Many investors supported Sterling in the immediate aftermath of the election, driving it beyond $1.35, in the hope that a comfortable conservative majority would allow for a more constructive stance from Boris Johnson, in relation to the negotiation of a trade deal with the EU and of course the extension of the transition period. However, the current prevailing market sentiment points at fears, that ultimately, come December 31st 2020, we may still be facing the scenario of an abrupt exit from the EU, without a trade deal; this is why the Pound is declining, as a new sense of reality slowly sinks in. China\u2019s stock market had a good day, with the CSI 300 index closing 0.7% higher. Stocks rallied after vice-premier Li Keqiang suggested China\u2019s key interest rates could be cut to stimulate the economy. Beijing\u2019s plan to cut tariffs on 850 products next month also cheered traders. But there\u2019s also anxiety about whether the trade war with America will cool next year. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s Kit Juckes suspects the tensions could rumble on in 2020, as taking a tough line with Beijing could play well with US voters. Speaking on Bloomberg TV this morning, Juckes said that unless Donald Trump gets a \u201cfantastic trade deal\u201d, the president will be tempted to \u201ckeep fighting the good fight for the American worker\u201d. Like King Wenceslas trudging through the snow, the FTSE 250 index is marching slowly higher today. The index of medium-size listed companies is up 30 points, or 0.13% at 21,872 today, close to last week\u2019s record high. Heat treatment firm Bodycote is among the risers, after announcing a deal this morning. It has acquired US rival Ellison Surface Technologies for $200m. This will create \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest providers of thermal spray and engineered coating surface technology services to the aerospace industry.\u201d The jump in the gold price shows that investors are trying to preserve capital in case of turbulence next year, says Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at XM. He writes: Some headlines overnight that North Korea is thinking about developing new weapons may have helped the move, but the real catalyst is likely that portfolio managers are increasing their defensive exposure. After such a strong year, when almost every single asset class was up double digits, this is probably a prudent time to \u2018play some defense\u2019 and hedge your risk heading into 2020, especially with gold prices trading at a minor discount relative to recent months. Online grocery business Ocado is the top riser in London this morning, up 2.5%. It could prove to be one of this year\u2019s Christmas winners, having been bombarded with orders. Last week Ocado\u2019s CEO, Melanie Smith, emailed customers warning that their systems were creaking under the strain. Apparently, Ocado\u2019s website and app had been \u201coverwhelmed by festive shoppers\u201d adding more items to their orders (fortunately for me, the ever-efficient Mrs W had organised our delivery already). Smith recommended editing orders before 6pm, as: Our customers\u2019 love for great food and drink this Christmas is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before. The Santa Rally is a long-established City tradition. The idea is that stocks typically rise during the final few trading days of December, and the start of the New Year. There\u2019s not much sign of it today, though. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is up, but just 4 points higher at 7627. That means it could hit a new 5-month closing high at lunchtime today. France\u2019s CAC 40 is equally becalmed, up 2 points at 6,031, while Germany and Italy are closed today. Perhaps traders weren\u2019t good enough this year (surely not?!). Or maybe Santa came early - the Footsie did gain 41 points yesterday in a pre-Christmas rally. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, reckons gold and silver prices could both keep rallying in 2020. He suspects precious metal prices are \u2018breaking out\u2019 of their previous trading range. Partly that\u2019s thanks to central banks - whose loose monetary policy has driven asset prices up. But increased demand, perhaps from China, is another factor. He writes: First and foremost, the negative relationship between gold and the S&amp;P 500 has been broken down over the past few years with both assets moving higher in 2016, 2017 and now 2019, and falling in 2018. Undoubtedly this is, at least in part, because central bank liquidity is finding its way not just in stocks, but other markets too, such as property and gold. Fund managers making profit from their long US equity holdings would be reinvesting in other parts of their portfolios when they rebalance them. This obviously includes safe-haven gold for many money managers. As I have said before, a trade deal between the US and China may be good news for risk assets (and it has), but it is not necessarily bad news for haven gold. After all, rising optimism over a trade deal has helped the yuan strengthen slightly, making gold relatively less expensive in yuan terms. With China being one of if not the largest gold consumer, this implies increased demand from this important market, especially ahead of the Lunar New Year when gift jewellery purchases tend to rise. Gold has actually enjoyed its best year since 2010. Bullion is up 17% since the start of this year, from $1,265/ounce on January 1 to $1,451 today. Many other assets have had a strong 12 months too -- with some stock markets up 20%. But gold\u2019s strength reflects caution about the world economy and geopolitics. As the Wall Street Journal puts it: \u201cThe fact that investors are still holding a decent chunk of gold gives you a good feeling as to how they are literally hedging their bets,\u201d said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for State Street STT 0.28% Global Advisors in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \u201cGold is definitely not looking like a bad place to store some value or have a hedge.\u201d Gold prices have kept climbing in recent weeks even though improving economic data and President Trump\u2019s provisional trade deal with China have pushed U.S. stocks to a series of all-time highs. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes has also risen, from 1.778% at the end of November to 1.934% Monday. Higher bond yields typically make gold, which pays no interest, less attractive for investors to own. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat....but trading volumes will be rather thin today. It\u2019s the final session before the holiday break. Many City workers have knocked off for the holidays, but some hardy souls have still braved the cold and damp. And they\u2019ve pushed the gold price up to its highest level since November, as worries about the trade war resurface. Yesterday China boosted the markets by announcing plans to cut tariffs on 850 products. That cheered some investors, sending Wall Street to a new record high. But there\u2019s still no sign of the fabled Phase One trade deal with the US being signed, let alone a more comprehensive agreement. So, two thousand years after the Christmas Story, wise (or nervous) men and women are putting their faith in gold. This has lifted the price of an ounce of bullion to $1,491 this morning, up $6, to its highest level since early November. As Stephen Innes, strategist at Axitrader puts it: We are still not 100% clear if the \u2018phase one\u2019 deal will go through or not, it has not been signed yet. We then pivot to \u2018phase two\u2019....that suggests you need some gold, because we don\u2019t know what the next phase is all about, how contentious of a deal that is going to be. The US-China trade war has loomed over the financial markets throughout 2018. Bad for growth, but possibly good for Donald Trump\u2019s re-election prospects? David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The ever evolving trade story has been great for President Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign. The achievement of securing phase one of the deal sent US stock markets to record highs, and collecting tariffs has been a nice boost to the governments\u2019 coffers. Farmers in the US can look forward to see demand for their goods increase next year as China has committed to ramp up purchases. The trade story is far from over so Mr Trump can continue the battle next year, and as long as it doesn\u2019t impact US growth, it should play well with voters. The unemployment rate in the US recently fell to a fifty year low, average earnings are conformably above the CPI rate, and the growth achieved in the third-quarter exceeded the second-quarter so the Donald is going into 2020 with a strong score card. The European markets could be as flat as a festive blini (delicious with a dollop of creme fraiche and some smoked salmon) today. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has just opened unchanged at yesterday\u2019s five-month high, as investors wonder what 2020 has in store... The agenda 12.30pm: London stock market closes for Christmas",

      "bodyText": "As the area burned across Australia this fire season pushes beyond five million hectares, an area larger than many countries, stories of destruction have become depressingly familiar. At the time of writing, nine people have been killed. Balmoral, in the New South Wales southern highlands, is the latest community affected in a state where up to 1,000 homes have been destroyed. A third of the vineyard area and dozens of homes were razed in the Adelaide Hills. It is too early for a thorough examination of the impact on wildlife, including the many threatened species in the fires\u2019 path. Does this qualify as unprecedented? Plenty of experts say yes, but not all politicians and newspaper columnists are convinced. Last week the acting prime minister, Michael McCormack, assured the nation that \u201cwe\u2019ve had these smoke hazes before. We\u2019ve had bushfires before.\u201d After returning from Hawaii, Scott Morrison, acknowledged the fires were severe, but also adopted a familiar line: Australia has always had bushfires. That\u2019s true. But a key question is whether it has always had bushfires like this. Who says the bushfires are unprecedented? The firefighting agency in the state worst affected, for starters. The NSW Rural Fire Service says the scale of what has burned in that state is unprecedented at this point of the fire season. By Monday, 3.41 million hectares had burned. \u201cTo put it in perspective, in the past few years we have had a total area burned for the whole season of about 280,000 hectares,\u201d RFS spokeswoman Angela Burford said. A slightly larger area burned across the 1974 calendar year, but those fires were of an entirely different nature: above-average rainfall before the fire season meant fuel in the outback was unusually plentiful, and fire burned through well-grown grasslands in the state\u2019s far west. By comparison, this year\u2019s fires are further east, where people live, and have been fuelled by a vast bank of dry fuel following the country\u2019s record-breaking drought. Soil moisture is at historic lows in some areas, and rainfall in the first eight months of the year was the lowest on record in the northern tablelands and Queensland\u2019s southern downs. What do scientists say? David Bowman, director of The Fire Centre at the University of Tasmania, says the most striking thing about this fire season is the continent-scale nature of the threat. The damage in each state is explained here. \u201cThe geographic range, and the fact it is occurring all at once, is what makes it unprecedented,\u201d Bowman says. \u201cThere has never been a situation where there has been a fire from southern Queensland, right through NSW, into Gippsland, in the Adelaide Hills, near Perth and on the east coast of Tasmania.\u201d He says one of the less explored issues, though it has begun to receive some attention in recent days, is the economic impact of having prolonged fires that affect so many Australians. \u201cYou can\u2019t properly run an economy when you get a third to a half of the population affected by smoke, and the media completely focused on fires,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not quite certain why anybody would want to be claiming fires have been like this before. It\u2019s concerning as it is a barrier to adaptation. To deal with these sort of fires the first step is to acknowledge the scale of the problem.\u201d Ross Bradstock, from the University of Wollongong\u2019s Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, points to the Gospers Mountain fire, which started in a lightning strike north-west of Sydney in late October and has now burned about 500,000 hectares, as evidence of how this season differs from what has come before. The fire has now combined with others on the NSW Central Coast to create a mega-blaze, but Bradstock says it was almost certainly the largest single ignition-point forest fire recorded in Australia and, for mid-latitude forests, possibly the world. He says it is bigger than any in California and Mediterranean Europe. A large fire in those conditions is usually about 100,000 hectares. \u201cWe can find no evidence of forest fires of that size anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just don\u2019t see fires of this size in these parts of the world because you do not usually get the extreme dryness and unrelenting nature of the weather.\u201d Two months in, Bradstock says the Gospers Mountain is a monster, \u201cjust unimaginably big\u201d and near impossible to contain unless there is substantial rain. Have the areas destroyed this year burned before? Some certainly have, but this season has also seen the loss of rainforests, wet eucalypt forests, dried-out swamps and banana plantations that do not usually burn because they are too wet. Damage to the Gondwana rainforests in 40 reserves between Brisbane and Newcastle prompted the Unesco world heritage centre to last month express their concern to Australian authorities. The reserves include the largest areas of subtropical rainforest on the planet, some warm temperate rainforest and nearly all the world\u2019s Antarctic beech cool temperate rainforest. They are considered a living link to the vegetation that covered the southern supercontinent Gondwana before it broke up about 180m years ago. There are also fears critically endangered Wollemi pines have burned in the fires tearing through the Blue Mountains. They were thought extinct until discovered by bushwalkers in 1994. Their whereabouts had been kept secret from the public to keep them safe. What about the smoke? Authorities say the smoke that has smothered Sydney, Canberra and other centres and towns in recent weeks has produced pollution up to 11 times greater than the hazardous level for human health. In Sydney, the air pollution has been hazardous for at least 30 days. NSW\u2019s director of environmental health, Richard Broome, last week told reporters the state was enduring \u201can unprecedented emergency from a smoke point of view\u201d. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen conditions like this in Sydney, certainly in anyone\u2019s memory that I\u2019ve spoken to,\u201d he said. Broome said there is early evidence that the number of people turning up at hospital emergency departments needing help is higher than usual. Dr Kate Charlesworth, a fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, said there was no safe level of air pollution, and that the most vulnerable in the community \u2013 babies, children, the elderly and people with pre-existing disease \u2013 were the most likely to be affected. What role does climate change play? The explanation should be familiar by now: greenhouse gas emissions do not cause bushfires, but they play a demonstrated role in increasing average and particularly extreme temperatures and contribute to the extraordinarily dry conditions afflicting eastern Australia. Scientists cite the near absolute lack of moisture in the landscape as a key reason the fires have been so severe. Multiple studies, here and overseas, have found the climate crisis is lengthening the fire season. In the past, the season started in spring in NSW before moving south to Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania in the new year. Just as Australia\u2019s fire season is more overlapping with that in California, making resource-sharing more difficult, it is also running simultaneously across the country. Among other issues, that is putting greater strain on volunteer firefighting brigades. It is an issue that firefighters and some experts say the country needs to acknowledge and address. The Morrison government appeared to make an initial, qualified step in this direction on Christmas Eve. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 January 2020 to augment the brief description of the 1974 fires.",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison wanted three things for Christmas: to stop doctors deciding on the medical treatment refugees receive, to reduce the power of workers to organise for better wages and to make sure Australia could cheat on its global climate crisis exams. He\u2019s locked in two out of three gifts \u2013 with medevac laws overturned and climate talks in Madrid frustrated \u2013 and returned to Santa\u2019s lap hoping he can convince Pauline Hanson to have a change of heart on the ensuring integrity bill over the holiday break. There\u2019s precious little Christmas spirit evident in the government\u2019s agenda \u2013 no spirit of solidarity with the volunteer firefighters and their families who \u201cwant to be there\u201d risking their lives for their communities; no spirit of generosity for people seeking asylum who\u2019ve been cut off from income and housing support; and no spirit of charity for elderly Australians spending Christmas waiting for a meaningful response to the crisis in aged care. What spirit, then, is this government possessed by? Could it be the Holy Spirit proclaimed in Pentecostal and other conservative churches that Morrison has been so careful to court in the second draft of the religious discrimination bill? The spirit of aspiration that he believes is the essence of \u201cquiet Australians\u201d is certainly present in the such congregations \u2013 the often mentioned \u201cprosperity doctrine\u201d is a Pentecostal version of this. Whatever phrase best describes this theology, the foundational idea was that if a loving God is on your side, that God wouldn\u2019t want you poor, oppressed and insecure. Over time, as this concept was infected by capitalist individualism and the free market was conflated with an old-fashioned Protestant work ethic, religious conservatives bought the idea that aspirational freedom was found in a government that leaves everyone to their own devices \u2013 that is, if you trust God, work hard and adhere to the right moral code, then success is on its way. Morrison has been very clever at telling this story for a secular audience \u2013 he imagines an Australia where anyone who has a go, gets a go. Where jobs are available for anyone who wants one badly enough; where not only God but the government is on your side and where drought, fires and climate catastrophe will all be alleviated through a mixture of thoughts, prayers and righteous endeavour. Newspoll results suggest that Morrison has landed on a spiel that describes an Australia most people want \u2013 and obscures the truth that none of his policies will help create it. The Christmas Myefo budget update reveals a sluggish economy, flatlining wage growth and higher than anticipated unemployment. Our standard of living is in decline. We head into summer surrounded by the fury of an environment responding to decades of neglect. People on Newstart are told that alleviating their suffering is not a budget priority; through the smoke, those experiencing discrimination because of their diverse sexuality or gender see the prime minister announcing that protecting the right to be a jerk in the name of religion is more important than protecting their rights to medical care, employment and freedom from harm. There are no plans to address the climate crisis or the lack of water in the Murray Darling Basin \u2013 and the government has doubled down on its refusal to allow refugees stranded in offshore limbo to be resettled in New Zealand. The spirit of Christmas absent; the spirit of aspiration crushed. Throw in the Morrison government\u2019s long determination to grow its coffers via the impersonal, inaccurate and illegal robodebt scheme, and reluctance to return money wrongly repaid, we come to this conclusion: the Liberal-National government is simply mean-spirited. Under this regime, a valid Christmas wish list for Australians could include these miracles: an unspent budget surplus somehow improves the lot of working people; \u201ccarryover credits\u201d have a meaningful mitigating relationship to climate devastation; or that the true spirit of Christmas overwhelms our prime minister as he ponders the baby in a manger at a church service this week. As pastor John Martin says: \u201cIf your Christianity makes emperors feel comfortable and oppressed people feel unsafe, it\u2019s time for a grand reversal.\u201d Waking up to such a grand reversal this Christmas would be a transformative gift to our nation.

      "body": "<h2>Arsenal \u2013 Aaron Ramsey</h2> <p>It took the midfielder over a year to recover from the injury he suffered in a tackle from Stoke\u2019s Ryan Shawcross in February 2010 but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s patience with the Welshman was ultimately rewarded with more than 350 games and 65 goals, two of which were winners in FA Cup finals \u2013 against Hull in 2014 and Chelsea in 2017. The way Ramsey was allowed to leave last summer rankles among Arsenal fans but he eclipses Laurent Koscielny as the club\u2019s best performer of the decade. <strong>Paul Chronnell</strong></p> <h2>Aston Villa \u2013 Brad Friedel</h2> <p>The goalkeeper was likened to Superman by Gordon Strachan after a superlative performance for Blackburn and he continued to avoid kryptonite after moving to Villa in 2008. Friedel proved to be a rock-like presence behind Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s defence and while he only played one year for Villa this decade \u2013 he joined Tottenham in June 2011 \u2013 his service was immense. In a game at Manchester United in February 2011, Friedel also became the club\u2019s oldest player at the age of 39 years and 259 days. <strong>Ian Malin</strong></p> <h2>Bournemouth \u2013 Steve Cook</h2> <p>Perhaps the best \u00a3170,000 Bournemouth have ever spent. The defender has racked up more than 300 appearances since turning a loan deal from Brighton into a permanent move seven years ago, when the club were 10th in League One. Cook, who cut his teeth in non-league football, has been the epitome of consistency and a cornerstone of Bournemouth\u2019s extraordinary rise to the Premier League under Eddie Howe. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <h2>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion \u2013 Lewis Dunk</h2> <p>A difficult decision but, in the end, Dunk gets the nods over Bruno. As the song says, the 28-year-old defender has been with Brighton from Withdean to Wembley having been born in the town, attended secondary school there and spent his youth career at the club, signing his first professional contract with Brighton in 2010. Dunk, named captain by current manager Graham Potter, is fearless, great in the air and even chips in with a few goals \u2013 in 2014-15 he was Brighton\u2019s top scorer. <strong>Stephanie Fincham</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63d7d1fa086cffc7e63b2ad0e84724bc07f2aab6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63d7d1fa086cffc7e63b2ad0e84724bc07f2aab6/0_0_4108_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s Lewis Dunk (right) celebrates scoring his side\u2019s second goal with teammate Anthony Knockaert during the Championship match at Fulham in January 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion\u2019s Lewis Dunk (right) celebrates scoring his side\u2019s second goal with teammate Anthony Knockaert during the Championship match at Fulham in January 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Mercer/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Burnley \u2013 Ashley Barnes</h2> <p>Barnes has come to epitomise Burnley in his seven seasons at Turf Moor. The 30-year-old striker has played in all five Premier League campaigns under Sean Dyche, growing in stature and scoring more often with each one. The former west country journeyman is now an established top-flight performer and while his style might not be the prettiest, he, like the club itself, is persistent, effective and awkward to play against. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> <h2>Chelsea \u2013 Eden Hazard</h2> <p>Forget about the last decade, the Belgian is one of the greatest players ever seen at Stamford Bridge. His creative genius brought him plenty of individual accolades during his seven years in England and he proved an inspirational figure during Chelsea\u2019s title triumphs of 2015 and 2017, under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Antonio Conte respectively. No doubt, Premier League defenders were relieved when Hazard left last summer to join Real Madrid. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <h2>Crystal Palace \u2013 Wilfried Zaha</h2> <p>Only Julian Speroni even comes close to matching the impact of the player who grew up a stone\u2019s throw from Selhurst Park. Having made his debut for Palace in March 2010, Zaha has racked up almost 300 appearances for the club \u2013 having briefly flown the nest to Manchester United as Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s last signing there \u2013 and without him the south Londoners would never have played a record seven straight top-flight campaigns. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <h2>Everton \u2013 Seamus Coleman</h2> <p>A \u00a360,000 purchase from Sligo Rovers in January 2009 and Everton and Republic of Ireland captain today. A humble, dignified and proud figure who developed into one of the finest full-backs in the Premier League over the course of the decade (Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka have played more matches for Everton than Coleman but were already regulars before his arrival) and he epitomises the kind of spirit, and signing, the club desperately need to find again. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <h2>Leicester City \u2013 Jamie Vardy</h2> <p>From a goalscoring debut against Torquay United to match-winning performances in the Premier League and Champions League, Vardy has done it all with Leicester, mostly with a lovable snarl. The striker could have followed Riyad Mahrez and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 out the door after spearheading the title triumph in 2016 but he stayed and is now leading another charge for glory. Leicester fans love him, England fans miss him, and Premier League defenders will have a party when Vardy retires. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <h2>Liverpool \u2013 Luis Su\u00e1rez</h2> <p>A troubling figure, and not a member of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s golden generation, but no player lit up Liverpool this decade quite like Su\u00e1rez. There were the moments \u2013 the shot against Arsenal, the goal against Newcastle, the goals against Norwich \u2013 as well as the relentless work-rate and desire, all of which combined in the 2013-14 season as the Uruguayan led Brendan Rodgers\u2019s men on their thrilling and ultimately doomed title charge. The most talented player in Liverpool\u2019s history? Quite possibly. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p> <h2>Manchester City \u2013 David Silva</h2> <p>The Spaniard will depart the Etihad Stadium next summer after a decade of midfield play that has been akin to Picasso in his cubist period: a one-off exhibition of unique artistry. Silva is peerless and has been fundamental to the success City have enjoyed during his time at the club, most notably their four Premier League titles. Now aged 33 it is no surprise Silva\u2019s powers have been on the wane this season and, as a result, so too have City\u2019s fortunes. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <h2>Manchester United \u2013 David de Gea</h2> <p>De Gea was United\u2019s No 1 goalkeeper in their 2012-2013 title-winning campaign \u2013 the second and final occasion the club were crowned champions this decade \u2013 and in the seven years since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club the Spaniard has been the sole world-class presence at Old Trafford. In the fog of disarray that has so often occurred in front of him, De Gea has proven to be - the odd dip in form aside - a beacon of excellence. <strong>JJ</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0e548599fcc4f3129fa0698cc112735820e3370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0e548599fcc4f3129fa0698cc112735820e3370/176_178_2965_2051/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David de Gea of Manchester United saves a penalty during the Champions League match against CSKA Moscow in October 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David de Gea of Manchester United saves a penalty during the Champions League match against CSKA Moscow in October 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Newcastle United \u2013 Cheick Tiot\u00e9</h2> <p>For a time Tiot\u00e9 \u2013 who tragically died at the age of 30 following a cardiac arrest sufferered while training with Beijing Enterprises \u2013 was the most uncompromising holding midfielder in England. The Ivorian began his seven-year stint on Tyneside in 2010 and will always be remembered for his stunning 25-yard equalising volley in the 4-4 draw with Arsenal in February 2011. His midfield partnership with Yohan Cabaye was also integral to Newcastle\u2019s fifth-place finish in 2011-12. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <h2>Norwich City \u2013 Wesley Hoolahan</h2> <p>Known to Norwich fans as \u2018Wessi\u2019, Hoolahan was an integral part of three promotions and four Premier League seasons. More importantly, he set the tone. Norwich have been up and down a lot during the past 10 years but they have settled on a style of play that values short passing, technique and brains above brawn. The diminutive Irishman embodied all of those qualities during his time at Carrow Road and earned a testimonial, too. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <h2>Sheffield United \u2013 Billy Sharp</h2> <p>Sharp technically started the decade as a United player, albeit transfer listed and on loan at Doncaster as his second spell at the club fizzled out. He left. Again. He came back. Again. He made his third debut for the club in the 4-0 defeat at Gillingham with which United opened the 2015-16 League One season and two promotions and 90 goals later (for a club total of over 100), the 33-year-old striker is a bona fide Blades legend. <strong>John Ashdown</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ad8189e173e191de04884178700242432fbf134\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ad8189e173e191de04884178700242432fbf134/0_0_1776_1268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billy Sharp of Sheffield United scores to make it 3-1 against Wigan Athletic in their Championship match at Bramall Lane in October 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheffield United striker Billy Sharp scores to make it 3-1 against Wigan Athletic in their Championship match at Bramall Lane in October 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Southampton \u2013 Rickie Lambert</h2> <p>After five unforgettable years and 117 goals, Lambert left Southampton a hero. He initially joined the club in League One as a serial goalscorer with Bristol Rovers and fired them to the Championship and the Premier League, form which earned the striker a call-up to the England squad at the age of 31 and, in 2014, a move to boyhood club Liverpool, where things did not work out. Lambert retired two years ago after spells at West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff City. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <h2>Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 Harry Kane</h2> <p>Kane brings the romance and the connection with the Tottenham fanbase; he brings a work ethic that demands more of himself and those around him every day and, above all, he brings goals \u2013 over 170 of them since his debut for Spurs in August 2011, following a loan spell at Leyton Orient. Luka Modric and Gareth Bale were joys to watch for Spurs at the start of the decade but make no mistake \u2013 Kane is the symbol of the club. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> <h2>Watford \u2013 Troy Deeney</h2> <p>This has unquestionably been the Deeney decade. The forward has been at Watford for all but the first six months of it, and though initially underwhelming \u2013 his first season saw 17 league starts and just two goals \u2013 he has grown enormously as a player and as a person, with the team\u2019s travails during his three-month injury absence this season demonstrating the captain\u2019s continued importance as its spiritual figurehead. <strong>Simon Burnton</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efade3196b204293c49814b5199768b171244c7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efade3196b204293c49814b5199768b171244c7d/0_0_4536_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watford\u2019s Troy Deeney celebrates scoring his team\u2019s second goal against Crystal Palace in February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watford\u2019s Troy Deeney celebrates scoring his team\u2019s second goal against Crystal Palace in February 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>West Ham United \u2013 Dimitri Payet</h2> <p>It ended in tears but there was nothing quite like it when Payet was in the mood. Signed for \u00a310m from Marseille in June 2015, the Frenchman\u2019s flicks, tricks and free-kicks were the undisputed highlight of West Ham\u2019s final season at Upton Park. His skill was unrivalled and he managed an unforgettable solo goal against Middlesbrough before returning to Marseille in protracted manner in January 2017. <strong>JS</strong></p> <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers \u2013 Matt Doherty</h2> <p>No player better embodies Wolves\u2019s rise than the Irishman, who was not even a regular first-team player for Bohemians before joining the club for \u00a380,000 in the summer of 2010. After a couple of loan stints, Doherty has soared to every challenge, progressing from League One through the Championship and into the Premier League and the Europa League, where the 27-year-old is now one of the best wing-backs in the business. <strong>PD</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Arsenal \u2013 Aaron Ramsey It took the midfielder over a year to recover from the injury he suffered in a tackle from Stoke\u2019s Ryan Shawcross in February 2010 but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s patience with the Welshman was ultimately rewarded with more than 350 games and 65 goals, two of which were winners in FA Cup finals \u2013 against Hull in 2014 and Chelsea in 2017. The way Ramsey was allowed to leave last summer rankles among Arsenal fans but he eclipses Laurent Koscielny as the club\u2019s best performer of the decade. Paul Chronnell Aston Villa \u2013 Brad Friedel The goalkeeper was likened to Superman by Gordon Strachan after a superlative performance for Blackburn and he continued to avoid kryptonite after moving to Villa in 2008. Friedel proved to be a rock-like presence behind Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s defence and while he only played one year for Villa this decade \u2013 he joined Tottenham in June 2011 \u2013 his service was immense. In a game at Manchester United in February 2011, Friedel also became the club\u2019s oldest player at the age of 39 years and 259 days. Ian Malin Bournemouth \u2013 Steve Cook Perhaps the best \u00a3170,000 Bournemouth have ever spent. The defender has racked up more than 300 appearances since turning a loan deal from Brighton into a permanent move seven years ago, when the club were 10th in League One. Cook, who cut his teeth in non-league football, has been the epitome of consistency and a cornerstone of Bournemouth\u2019s extraordinary rise to the Premier League under Eddie Howe. Ben Fisher Brighton &amp; Hove Albion \u2013 Lewis Dunk A difficult decision but, in the end, Dunk gets the nods over Bruno.

      "bodyText": "The Dutch describe Advent as de donkere dagen voor Kerstmis. It means the dark days before Christmas and, for Sunderland, they can never have felt shorter or bleaker. The winter solstice may just have passed, leaving the earth starting to tilt towards the sun once again but, at the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light, there can be no guarantees that spring will bring a rebirth of warmth and brightness. Sunderland are preparing for Bolton\u2019s Boxing Day visit sitting almost as low in League One as the winter sun which, on Monday, struggled to break through the December gloom to shine weakly on what remains their top-end Premier League-class training facility, the Academy of Light. Phil Parkinson\u2019s side are 13th \u2013 the lowest position in their sometimes illustrious history \u2013 with the manager deemed under pressure barely two months after succeeding Jack Ross. If it seemed dubious at the time, hindsight has made the decision to sack Ross, with the team sixth in the table and within touching distance of the automatic promotion places, look increasingly poor and panicky. The problem was that the intelligent, talented Scot \u2013 who was swiftly snapped up by Hibernian \u2013 had narrowly missed out on taking Sunderland to the Championship last season and fears of another failure perhaps clouded the judgment of the owner, Stewart Donald. Parkinson has a decent body of work behind him, doing very good jobs at assorted clubs including Bradford \u2013 remember that wonderful run to the League Cup final? \u2013 and Bolton, but he tends to start slowly and Sunderland are a club in a desperate hurry to return to the Premier League. Right now football\u2019s promised land looks an awfully long way away and, with Donald having recently taken a \u00a39m loan from FFP \u2013 a company consisting of a small group of American investors with close links to Michael Dell, of Dell computers \u2013 the future is shrouded in uncertainty. Should Donald fail to repay that loan, FFP would take charge of a club which, not so long ago, was put on the market for \u00a3170m by its former owner, the American billionaire Ellis Short. While this could be a very good thing \u2013 if Dell were to get involved Sunderland would gain heavyweight financial muscle \u2013 nothing is guaranteed. After all, the training ground is in the upmarket Cleadon area of Sunderland and occupies precisely the sort of invitingly large site which property developers would relish turning into expensive luxury homes. Meanwhile the team itself has turned distinctly downmarket. A recent picture of two players, the former Celtic winger Aiden McGeady \u2013 since transfer-listed and working with the under-23s following a \u201ctraining ground incident\u201d \u2013 and Chris Maguire tucking into a post-match meal at a McDonald\u2019s on the way back from a 1-0 defeat at Gillingham appeared emblematic of plummeting standards. So far Parkinson has presided over only two wins and has, damningly, said: \u201cIs it the greatest dressing room I\u2019ve been part of? Probably not.\u201d Following a disappointing 1-1 home draw with Blackpool this month, Parkinson swerved post-match media duties, claiming \u201che needed a break\u201d but he was back facing the microphones and endeavouring to be as upbeat as possible on Monday. \u201cThis is a critical period for us,\u201d said Parkinson, reminding everyone that his side are only six points off a play-off place. \u201cIn the next block of four games we have to aim to get back into the top six or pretty close to it.\u201d Flags at the Stadium of Light have been fluttering at half-mast since Friday when Billy Hughes, a vital attacking spark in Sunderland\u2019s 1973 FA Cup-winning team, died at the age of 70 and a minute\u2019s silence will precede kick-off against Bolton. The crowd is likely to be significantly down on this time last year when a 46,039 gathering shattered the League One attendance record by filling the stadium for a 1-0 Boxing Day win against Bradford. Back then Sunderland seemed set fair for automatic promotion with Josh Maja scoring freely but the January transfer window saw the young striker sold to Bordeaux and the team\u2019s fortunes have never properly recovered. Despite a tight budget, Parkinson hopes to redress the balance next month. \u201cI know what I need to be successful,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m working hard to get this team into a position where we can challenge.

      "bodyText": "The embattled US aircraft maker Boeing has reportedly sent US regulators \u201ctroubling communications\u201d related to the development of the 737 MAX \u2013 on the same day that the CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, was forced to step aside. According to a senior Boeing executive, the documents include new messages from Mark Forkner, a senior company test pilot who complained of \u201cegregious\u201d erratic behavior in flight simulator tests of Boeing\u2019s MCAS anti-stall system, and referred to \u201cJedi mind tricks\u201d to persuade regulators to approve the plane. The executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Seattle Times that the Forkner communications contain the same kind of \u201ctrash talking\u201d about Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) regulators as the earlier messages released in October. The release is likely to deepen the sense of crisis enveloping Boeing, which has taken more than $8bn in costs and lost more than 20% of its market value since the 737 variant was grounded in March following two crashes. Last week, the company said it would temporarily halt production of the troubled jet. Forkner, meanwhile, has reportedly hired his own criminal defense lawyers and invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination to avoid turning over records to the US Department of Justice, which has opened a criminal inquiry into the company\u2019s handling of the 737 Max\u2019s development. It was Forkner who requested that information about MCAS be omitted from flight manuals and pilot training, rendering the pilots of both the doomed Lion Air and Ethiopian flights helpless when the system kicked in, pushing the plane\u2019s nose down repeatedly until they ultimately lost control. But the timing of the latest information release is likely to increase anger surrounding Boeing\u2019s handling of the crisis, even as a new CEO, David Calhoun, takes the reins early next year. In a statement released on Monday, Boeing said that under the \u201cnew leadership\u201d, Boeing \u201cwill operate with a renewed commitment to full transparency, including effective and proactive communication with the FAA, other global regulators and its customers\u201d. But the latest drop of documents could complicate those intentions, and further challenge its relationship with regulators. The aerospace giant already angered the FAA by failing to turn over the Forkner messages for eight months because of the criminal investigation into how the plane was originally approved for service. \u201cThe FAA is also disappointed that Boeing did not bring this document to our attention immediately upon its discovery,\u201d the regulator said in a statement on 18 October. The regulator was also reportedly further vexed by Muilenburg\u2019s predictions that the 737 Max would imminently be cleared to return to service, which it regarded as placing pressure on the agency to approve Boeing\u2019s MCAS software fix even as it was taking a hit to its reputation for being too cozy with the plane maker. Last month, Muilenburg was reportedly called to a meeting in Washington with the FAA administrator, Steve Dickson, and dressed down for applying perceived pressure on the regulator. An internal FAA memo written by Dickson and reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, said the FAA would not work to any schedule. Separately, it signaled it would not allow the Max to fly again until 2020. Muilenburg\u2019s efforts to take responsibility for the 737 debacle, and to apologize for its tragic consequences, fell flat with lawmakers, the public and grieving families, costing him his job. During congressional testimony, Muilenburg offered muddled responses to lawmaker\u2019s demands for clarity on the development and approval of the 737 Max, and why it had not been immediately grounded after the first crash in Indonesia. \u201cYou\u2019re not trying to Jedi mind-trick us here today on this committee?\u201d the Democrat Dina Titus challenged. Still, Muilenburg, 55, is in line to receive $26.5m in cash and stock as part of his exit package. His payout could reach as high as $58.5m, depending on how it is structured, according to an SEC filing, including a pension of $807,000 annually and Boeing stock worth another $13.3m. In a statement on Monday, Boeing\u2019s board said it had decided that \u201ca change in leadership\u201d was necessary to restore confidence. But it chose not to fire the executive, allowing him to keep his pay package and saving Boeing from the impression its most senior executive had done something wrong. But according to subsequent reports, it was not just the handling of 737 Max crisis or squabbles with the FAA that ultimately doomed Muilenburg. Last week, a high-profile launch of Boeing\u2019s space capsule went awry.",

      "bodyText": "An inquiry being co-led by Ed Miliband of Labour\u2019s election campaign is in danger of drawing the wrong conclusions by failing to listen to the people who refused to vote for the party, the potential leadership candidate Lisa Nandy has said. Nandy said the review set up by a group called Labour Together was adopting a misguided approach by being based too much in Westminster. Miliband, who lost to David Cameron in 2015, is among those involved in the review, which will include interviewing all 59 MPs who lost their seats during the crumbling of Labour\u2019s \u201cred wall\u201d of constituencies in the north of England, the Midlands and Wales. But Nandy said it was most important for the party to listen to the voters who had left the party over the years. \u201cI have to be honest, I didn\u2019t know anything about this review until two days ago,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday. \u201cAnd if the lesson drawn from this election is, a review can be drawn up in a meeting room in Westminster without any reference to the two parts of the Labour movement \u2013 our councillor base and trade union base \u2013 that were probably the reason we didn\u2019t have a worse result, I just don\u2019t think that people are drawing the right lessons at all. \u201cWe need to be out in places like Ashfield, listening to people like the ex-miner I met yesterday, not sitting in meeting rooms in Westminster trying to debate this out amongst ourselves with the help of a few thinktanks. \u201cI just think the approach is wrong.\u201d The Wigan MP, who is conducting her own visits to constituencies that Labour lost, said a phrase that kept recurring was \u201cLabour\u2019s not for us any more\u201d. Nandy said she spent Monday knocking on doors in Ashfield, and found trust in Labour was the main issue. The backbencher said: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about the role of Jeremy Corbyn in this election campaign. \u201cBut there was just a general sense that at the top of the Labour party we don\u2019t speak for people like them any more, a sense we don\u2019t have skin in the game, that we\u2019re not rooted in those communities, and we\u2019re just not like them, and we don\u2019t come very often to just ask people what they think and to listen to what they\u2019ve got to say. \u201cWe often come in and tell them that we\u2019ve got all the answers and we can fix it, and what people told us loud and clear in this election campaign is: \u2018You\u2019re just not listening.\u2019\u201d Nandy said crime was the \u201cgreat unspoken issue\u201d of the election campaign, with many communities facing problems with drugs and antisocial behaviour, while police and council resources had been cut by the Tories in government. Nandy is considered a potential candidate on the soft left of the party and last week she criticised the party\u2019s shift to supporting a second referendum. She is likely to go up against Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who both pushed for a position in favour of a second referendum. Two other leading candidates are Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is supported by the Corbynite wing of the party, and Clive Lewis, a candidate on the pro-European left. Jess Phillips, the backbencher and women\u2019s rights campaigner, is also expected to stand. Following Nandy\u2019s intervention, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, defended the decision to allow Miliband to be involved in the inquiry. He said the former party leader \u201cis one of many people who should be properly examining why we lost\u201d, even though Miliband oversaw a major defeat himself. Khan, who served in Miliband\u2019s shadow cabinet, said: \u201cI\u2019m fed up with losing. I don\u2019t believe in heroic failure, we\u2019ve lost four general elections now in a row. \u201cI want the next leader to unite our party, unite our country, unite those who voted leave with those who voted remain, unite the north with the south, the old with the young. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s important not just Ed Miliband but many others look at why we lost and learn the right lessons.\u201d Khan also said the next Labour leader should not be chosen on the basis of their gender or the location of their constituency, amid calls from some for Corbyn\u2019s successor to be a woman and from the north or Midlands to help Labour win back its heartlands that turned Tory. Without backing any candidate, he said: \u201cI think the idea that the next Labour leader should be chosen on the geography of their seat or their gender is wrong. I want to see the Labour leader chosen on the ideas he or she has, on their vision for our country and a proper analysis of why we lost.\u201d",

Telling the story of a Tokyo cop, Kenzo Mori (Takehiro Hira), sent to London in search of his lost gangster brother, and co-starring the drily excellent Kelly Macdonald as a London-based cop and Will Sharpe as an Anglo-Japanese gay rent boy, Giri/Haji kept you watching because you had absolutely no idea in which direction it was headed but were very willing to find out. As well as the development of the emotionally torn Mori, exquisite touches included the use of animation as a means of exposition \u2013 a method also used in 2018\u2019s Black Earth Rising.

He told the BBC: \u201cThere are some very simple things you have to do: you have to have a credible leader, you have to be credible when it comes to the economy and security, you have to have a manifesto programme that is credible and speaks about the challenges that the country faces. Those are the things we didn\u2019t do in the most recent general election.\u201d Asked whether Corbyn\u2019s advisers, Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy, should also go, he said: \u201cYes I think we need a clean break, we need a new leadership team, a new leader, new people coming into the shadow cabinet, new advisers in the leader\u2019s office: A clean break with the past and a fresh start.\u201d Jarvis said he had been physically confronted by angry former Labour voters many times during the campaign who did not feel the party represented them any more. He said he wanted to reflect over Christmas on what role he should play in Labour\u2019s future.",

Taxpayers paid out $115m to Donald Trump so he could play golf at his own resorts. And Amazon didn\u2019t just pay zero in federal taxes on $11bn in profits \u2013 taxpayers gifted the corporation $129,000,000 in rebates. That\u2019s enough to pay for CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019s three apartments in Manhattan, including a penthouse, that cost him $80m. And what about government generosity for those who actually need help? Tax dollars are somehow much harder to come by when they\u2019re not going to handouts for the rich. The average person in poverty, struggling to put food on the table, gets about $134 a month in nutrition assistance. Now, just in time for the holidays, Trump has finalized the first of three policies that will make this disparity even more obscene. Two years after passing a $1.5tn tax giveaway to the wealthiest Americans and large corporations, the Trump administration plans to strip 3.7 million people of their nutrition benefits. The administration\u2019s first step is to kick 700,000 adults off of nutrition assistance as they struggle to find work. The second step: trying to punish families who have high childcare and housing costs. And third, they want to hurt families who already are making difficult choices between food or heat. Together, the three proposals will cut billions of dollars from one of our nation\u2019s leading anti-poverty programs. Meanwhile, the Republican tax scam is working exactly as planned. Today, the richest 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than any group in America \u2013 including the poor. Nearly 100 of the top Fortune 500 companies now pay nothing in taxes. This is what oligarchy looks like: Trump\u2019s appetite to shower the ultra-wealthy with corporate welfare is endless \u2013 and so is his administration\u2019s willingness to assault our nation\u2019s most vulnerable and hungriest families. Republicans defend this by saying that keeping people hungry will make them work harder. But we know this is just about cruelty. We know that withholding food from needy people who are underemployed only deepens the crisis of poverty in America. Some states will be hit harder than others. Vermont could see a 30% cut to benefits, and one in five low-income people who rely on nutrition assistance could no longer be eligible to participate. In Michigan, about one in seven would be kicked off food aid, with an estimated 15% cut in benefits. This is absolutely devastating. It goes without saying that we must fight as hard as we can against the Trump administration\u2019s savage attack on nutrition assistance. But we need to go beyond that. We must demand that the ultra-wealthy finally start paying their fair share so we can dramatically expand nutrition support. In the richest country in the history of the world, we have a moral obligation to eradicate the hunger that more than 37 million of our fellow Americans suffer every day. We can start by increasing nutrition assistance by $47 per person per month \u2013 that is the shortfall between what low-income people need to prepare adequate meals and what they get in benefits. We should also significantly increase the income threshold for this program, so everyone who needs help gets it. We must also guarantee that all schoolchildren get free breakfast and lunch at every public school in America. And we should also lift the onerous conditions on what people can buy with nutrition assistance. One Vermonter shared how, in the cold winter months, she wished she could buy her children a hot-roasted chicken from the store, because she had no access to an oven. Under the current program, she can only buy the day-old cold roasted chicken. Multiple Michigan families have similar stories to share. These are the kinds of requirements that force poor people to jump through humiliating hoops but they accomplish nothing in the fight to end hunger. This holiday season, we should work in our communities to make sure our most vulnerable neighbors are taken care of and do not go hungry. But we must also be prepared to mobilize millions of people to defeat the Trump administration\u2019s latest attack on the poor \u2013 the same way we came together to block Republicans\u2019 attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and kick 32 million Americans off their health insurance. Defending already inadequate benefits is not enough. Ultimately, we must make a choice as a society: will we tolerate the insatiable greed and cruelty of the billionaire class, whose control over our political system lets them take food out of the mouths of hungry school kids? Or do we build a humane, equitable society that ends poverty, hunger, and homelessness \u2013 and allows everyone to live with dignity? As the new year approaches, let us commit to fighting for a government and an economy that works for the overwhelming majority of the people. That is how we will make food security a human right in America. Bernie Sanders serves Vermont in the United States Senate.

      "body": "<p>Beneath the surface disorder of modern British politics, there are steadier patterns to be found. One of them is so regular, and so central to the workings of the whole system, that it\u2019s rarely noticed, let alone challenged.</p> <p>This pattern is hugely to the advantage of the Conservatives. Here\u2019s how it works. When the Tories are in power, as they have been for 27 of the last 40 years, they often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/16/strong-economy-tories-weak-labour\" title=\"\">struggle to govern effectively</a>. An election follows. The Tories run a negative campaign, drawing attention away from their own failures and ineptitude to the potential problems of a Labour government. To the surprise of some, the Tories win: either decisively or just well enough to stay in office. They announce that they will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-pledges-to-prioritise-nhs-after-election-victory\" title=\"\">govern differently </a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/election-in-the-media-evasion-lies-good-journalism-is-all-we-have\" title=\"\">this time</a>. Much of the media <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/election-in-the-media-evasion-lies-good-journalism-is-all-we-have\" title=\"\">believes them</a>. The Tories struggle in government once again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Faith in their credentials helps win tight elections. That they always find a way to rule is a self-fulfilling prophecy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Boris Johnson has already been through all these stages except the last one \u2013 and with a large majority, the temporary momentum that always follows a Queen\u2019s speech and the UK\u2019s scheduled exit from the EU next month to dangle before their supporters, the Conservatives will probably be able to enjoy promising things, rather than having to deliver them, for a while yet. This is Johnson\u2019s favourite and most effective political mode. \u201cGovernment will now engage flat-out on a programme of change for the better,\u201d he pledged, with characteristic energy and vagueness, during the debate on the Queen\u2019s speech. \u201cA new golden age for this United Kingdom is now within reach.\u201d</p> <p>In one sense, the Tories have earned this easy phase with their handsome election victory. In a democracy, why shouldn\u2019t a re-elected government enjoy a honeymoon, when journalists and voters give them the benefit of the doubt ? Yet <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/1219797/Boris-Johnson-brexit-golden-age\" title=\"\">the credulity</a> with which the promises of this and other returning Conservative administrations have been greeted, often by commentators who only weeks earlier were castigating the same ministers for their incompetence, suggests something more political is going on. There is damaging deference towards them \u2013 an unstated but widely held assumption that they shouldn\u2019t be judged too exactingly by their record in office.</p> <p>The Labour party receives the opposite treatment. Even mistakes it made in government decades ago, in an entirely different political and economic context \u2013 such as failing to control the then powerful unions during the winter of discontent \u2013 are widely taken as warnings about how it would govern next time.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/19/labour-tories-opposition-power\" title=\"\">Sometimes</a>, the deference shown towards the Tories comes from left-of-centre journalists and reflects a pessimism that the Tories are, despite all their flaws, Britain\u2019s natural ruling class. And sometimes it comes from the right and reflects an optimism that the Tories, however often they have disappointed and compromised in the past, always have the potential to rediscover their true path. \u201cPolitics has been transformed in a week,\u201d declared the Daily Telegraph giddily after the election. \u201cSuddenly they seem like a whole new party.\u201d</p> <p>Either way, the media\u2019s impulse to take incoming Tory premiers at their word echoes the inclination of many voters to trust Tory governments to be financially prudent, streetwise on foreign policy, and generally competent and stable \u2013 despite all evidence to the contrary. This misplaced confidence is particularly helpful to the current, broad-brush generation of Conservative politicians, who are better at rhetoric and election slogans than the detailed, patient work of improving the economy or the state.</p> <p>This faith in the Conservatives\u2019 governing credentials helps them win tight elections. The idea that they will always find new ways to rule becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <p>Yet many Tories who have actually been in government are much less sure about their party\u2019s aptitude for it. The memoirs of even the most confident and successful Conservative figures, such as Margaret Thatcher, are riddled with moments of self-doubt, frustration and sometimes outright panic while in office. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11174772/Sir-John-Hoskyns-obituary.html\" title=\"\">John Hoskyns</a>, a radical early Thatcherite who was the first head of her Downing Street policy unit, described the experience of government as like \u201ctrying to pitch a tent in the middle of a landslide\u201d.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/oct/15/politicalbooks.politics\" title=\"\">reviewers of such books</a> <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/book-review-noblesse-with-a-latitude-problem-diaries-alan-clark-weidenfeld-nicolson-20-pounds-1491146.html?amp\" title=\"\">tend to focus</a> on the anecdotes about backstabbing and leadership coups \u2013 material suggesting that while the Conservatives might be a nasty lot, they are also assertive and pragmatic. Meanwhile, serialisations in the rightwing press are little more than descriptions of Tory triumphs. Thus the party\u2019s aura of invincibility remains intact.</p> <p>This overestimation of the Conservatives\u2019 capabilities is especially galling now, when we have a prime minister whose record of keeping promises and enacting major reforms is almost nonexistent. As mayor of London from 2008 to 2016, Johnson neglected the capital\u2019s acute <a href=\"https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/fact-check-did-boris-johnson-massively-outbuild-labour-as-london-mayor-64282\" title=\"\">housing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/17/boris-johnson-held-back-negative-findings-of-air-pollution-report\" title=\"\">air-quality</a> crises, in favour of a little-used cable car across the Thames and the unbuilt airport scheme, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/18/boris-island-airport-what-where\" title=\"\">Boris island</a>\u201d.

And as prime minister so far, for all his electoral success, he has seemed just as casual about the business of government, giving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/06/boris-johnson-twilight-zone-police-escort-conservatives\" title=\"\">vague, incoherent speeches</a>, and sometimes appearing unable to understand or explain his own policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/24/lurch-right-britain-special-europe-authoritarian\">With its lurch to the right, Britain is no longer special in Europe | Stefan Bielik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the premier who is now expected to solve two huge problems: implementing Brexit and reviving swathes of northern England that have been declining for decades, and where the Tories have not, until now, been popular for almost a century. Meanwhile the government\u2019s finances are deteriorating, Britain\u2019s economic growth is slowing and a recession may be imminent. It could be the hardest set of challenges faced by a new government since the 70s.</p> <p>Johnson may learn to be more conscientious. Unexpected talents may emerge from a cabinet seemingly made up of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41853561\" title=\"\">fanatics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">chancers</a>. Dominic Cummings may metamorphose from a sly campaign strategist into someone who can reinvent the British state.</p> <p>But don\u2019t hold your breath.

Then as now, many observers thought they saw a potent new Conservatism crystallising. But it was a mirage.</p> <p>In truth, the Tories find governing grumpy old Britain \u2013 let alone reforming it \u2013 as difficult as Labour do. But if we don\u2019t stop being mesmerised by them, they will carry on ruling us most of the time. And perhaps we\u2019ll deserve it.</p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist and author of Promised You a Miracle: Why 1980-82 Made Modern Britain</p>",

      "bodyText": "Beneath the surface disorder of modern British politics, there are steadier patterns to be found. One of them is so regular, and so central to the workings of the whole system, that it\u2019s rarely noticed, let alone challenged. This pattern is hugely to the advantage of the Conservatives. Here\u2019s how it works. When the Tories are in power, as they have been for 27 of the last 40 years, they often struggle to govern effectively. An election follows. The Tories run a negative campaign, drawing attention away from their own failures and ineptitude to the potential problems of a Labour government. To the surprise of some, the Tories win: either decisively or just well enough to stay in office. They announce that they will govern differently this time. Much of the media believes them. The Tories struggle in government once again. Boris Johnson has already been through all these stages except the last one \u2013 and with a large majority, the temporary momentum that always follows a Queen\u2019s speech and the UK\u2019s scheduled exit from the EU next month to dangle before their supporters, the Conservatives will probably be able to enjoy promising things, rather than having to deliver them, for a while yet. This is Johnson\u2019s favourite and most effective political mode. \u201cGovernment will now engage flat-out on a programme of change for the better,\u201d he pledged, with characteristic energy and vagueness, during the debate on the Queen\u2019s speech. \u201cA new golden age for this United Kingdom is now within reach.\u201d In one sense, the Tories have earned this easy phase with their handsome election victory. In a democracy, why shouldn\u2019t a re-elected government enjoy a honeymoon, when journalists and voters give them the benefit of the doubt ? Yet the credulity with which the promises of this and other returning Conservative administrations have been greeted, often by commentators who only weeks earlier were castigating the same ministers for their incompetence, suggests something more political is going on. There is damaging deference towards them \u2013 an unstated but widely held assumption that they shouldn\u2019t be judged too exactingly by their record in office. The Labour party receives the opposite treatment. Even mistakes it made in government decades ago, in an entirely different political and economic context \u2013 such as failing to control the then powerful unions during the winter of discontent \u2013 are widely taken as warnings about how it would govern next time. Sometimes, the deference shown towards the Tories comes from left-of-centre journalists and reflects a pessimism that the Tories are, despite all their flaws, Britain\u2019s natural ruling class. And sometimes it comes from the right and reflects an optimism that the Tories, however often they have disappointed and compromised in the past, always have the potential to rediscover their true path. \u201cPolitics has been transformed in a week,\u201d declared the Daily Telegraph giddily after the election. \u201cSuddenly they seem like a whole new party.\u201d Either way, the media\u2019s impulse to take incoming Tory premiers at their word echoes the inclination of many voters to trust Tory governments to be financially prudent, streetwise on foreign policy, and generally competent and stable \u2013 despite all evidence to the contrary. This misplaced confidence is particularly helpful to the current, broad-brush generation of Conservative politicians, who are better at rhetoric and election slogans than the detailed, patient work of improving the economy or the state. This faith in the Conservatives\u2019 governing credentials helps them win tight elections. The idea that they will always find new ways to rule becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Yet many Tories who have actually been in government are much less sure about their party\u2019s aptitude for it. The memoirs of even the most confident and successful Conservative figures, such as Margaret Thatcher, are riddled with moments of self-doubt, frustration and sometimes outright panic while in office. John Hoskyns, a radical early Thatcherite who was the first head of her Downing Street policy unit, described the experience of government as like \u201ctrying to pitch a tent in the middle of a landslide\u201d. But reviewers of such books tend to focus on the anecdotes about backstabbing and leadership coups \u2013 material suggesting that while the Conservatives might be a nasty lot, they are also assertive and pragmatic. Meanwhile, serialisations in the rightwing press are little more than descriptions of Tory triumphs. Thus the party\u2019s aura of invincibility remains intact. This overestimation of the Conservatives\u2019 capabilities is especially galling now, when we have a prime minister whose record of keeping promises and enacting major reforms is almost nonexistent. As mayor of London from 2008 to 2016, Johnson neglected the capital\u2019s acute housing and air-quality crises, in favour of a little-used cable car across the Thames and the unbuilt airport scheme, \u201cBoris island\u201d. As foreign secretary from 2016 to 2018, he was widely considered one of the most clumsy and ineffective ever to hold office. And as prime minister so far, for all his electoral success, he has seemed just as casual about the business of government, giving vague, incoherent speeches, and sometimes appearing unable to understand or explain his own policies. This is the premier who is now expected to solve two huge problems: implementing Brexit and reviving swathes of northern England that have been declining for decades, and where the Tories have not, until now, been popular for almost a century. Meanwhile the government\u2019s finances are deteriorating, Britain\u2019s economic growth is slowing and a recession may be imminent. It could be the hardest set of challenges faced by a new government since the 70s. Johnson may learn to be more conscientious. Unexpected talents may emerge from a cabinet seemingly made up of fanatics and chancers. Dominic Cummings may metamorphose from a sly campaign strategist into someone who can reinvent the British state. But don\u2019t hold your breath. Only three years ago, in her first speech as prime minister, Theresa May promised \u201cto make Britain a country that works for everyone\u201d, almost exactly as Johnson is doing now. Then as now, many observers thought they saw a potent new Conservatism crystallising. But it was a mirage. In truth, the Tories find governing grumpy old Britain \u2013 let alone reforming it \u2013 as difficult as Labour do. But if we don\u2019t stop being mesmerised by them, they will carry on ruling us most of the time. And perhaps we\u2019ll deserve it. \u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist and author of Promised You a Miracle: Why 1980-82 Made Modern Britain",

      "body": "<p>For me, Christmas was always complicated. As a child, it was joyful, yet tinged with something bittersweet. On the one hand, there was my Scottish mother, who went all-out for tradition. She eagerly collected festive ornaments and planned menus from her beloved Supercook magazines. She would take us to the Walrus and the Carpenter, a traditional toy store on Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow, the memory of which still elicits wistful sighs from Glaswegians of a certain age.</p> <p>On the other hand, there was my Bengali father. He was a reluctant participant in our Christmas extravaganza. It puzzled me that he couldn\u2019t answer the most basic questions. Dasher, Dancer, Prancer \u2026 and then? He would smile sadly. \u201cI\u2019m not too sure.\u201d How could anyone not know that? He seemed far more interested in an elephant called Ganesh who didn\u2019t have to be put back in his box when the decorations came down.</p> <p>His ambivalence intrigued me because it was so out of character. Normally, he quietly enjoyed life \u2013 food, wine, music and hospitality. To five-year-old me, the idea that someone might not love Christmas was radical and worth filing away for future reference. It was years before I realised that, even though he obeyed Mum\u2019s orders to leave out Irn-Bru and carrots for the reindeer, my father\u2019s own childhood had been a Santa-free zone. I was dimly aware of the Bengali equivalent to Christmas, Durga Puja, of course, which celebrates the victory of the Hindu goddess Durga over the demon king Mahishasura. Every September or October, airmail parcels would arrive, and ambitious plans were hatched to acquire syrupy cottage-cheese dumplings \u2013 called <em>rasgulla</em> \u2013 from Ambala Sweet Centre in London. But for me this was an addition to 25 December, not a substitution.</p> <p>Matters were further complicated by my father\u2019s job. After going to medical school in Kolkata, he had got a posting as a junior doctor at a hospital in Glasgow, where he met my mother, a nurse. He often had to work on Christmas Day, which would make Mum cross, although it wasn\u2019t easy to take the moral high ground when competing with people who had acute liver failure. (She had given up work after having children.) My sister and I were largely oblivious to this tension, thrilled to go to work with Dad and see actual Santa visiting sick children on the wards.</p> <p>As the years went by, though, my father began to embrace Christmas. He was promoted to consultant, so he didn\u2019t have to work on the day. He would still mutter about the salmonella risk whenever Mum talked turkey. And he would skulk off to another room to listen to Miles Davis when the Christmas Eve carol service came on the telly. But he would happily return to pour the sherry and open presents with the rest of us at midnight. Everyone was joyful. Everyone except me, by then a teenager. Somehow, the more Dad engaged with Christmas, the more I morphed into the Grinch. It was as if festive malaise was one of the infectious diseases he specialised in \u2013 I had caught a terminal case, while he had gone on to make a full recovery.</p> <p>Things were probably exacerbated in adulthood by the fact that not-so-fabulous events had a habit of happening to me at Christmas: losing a job, a brutal breakup, a health emergency. But as my droll mother once remarked: \u201cYou can\u2019t blame Christmas for these things \u2013 it\u2019s not Christmas\u2019s fault.\u201d It was as if Christmas was a person she had to loyally stick up for. My symptoms worsened \u2013 Christmas songs set my teeth on edge, and I\u2019d long given up on sending cards or putting up decorations.</p> <p>But then, one day everything changed. In October 2012, after a brief but complicated bout of pneumonia, my father died. Although he was 79, he had been in good health; nothing could have prepared us for such a loss. My mother was inconsolable. We all were. I have no recollection whatsoever of Christmas that year, except that it was the worst of my life.</p> <p>In the months that followed, I fell into a state of limbo, as if one of the main characters had left the stage, and we were waiting for his return. Everything felt weirdly muted. Slowly, I drifted into that dark alley of loss where you feel guilty about enjoying yourself when the person you love is gone.</p> <p>During that period, one of the only things that kept me sane was weekly choir practice. I had joined the year before Dad died and it had been a source of immense support while coping with grief. However, as anyone who has ever been in a choir can attest, Christmas is non-negotiable. A carol concert in Trafalgar Square was the last bloody thing I needed. But it was in aid of Shelter and the choir was short of altos.</p> <p>So I dragged myself out on that freezing night. It\u2019s hard to fully express what happened next, but I would describe it as an epiphany. I started off standing under that ridiculous 20-metre (65ft) Christmas tree, grumpily \u201cding-donging\u201d through Carol of the Bells. I looked out across the square. The lights were sparkling; London had never looked so beautiful. I had totally lost my place on the sheet music, so I started dancing and ad-libbing. By the Jingle Bell Rock finale, I was laughing and doing jazz hands, carrying on like the naughty 15-year-old chorister I had been at school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7274c439787eafdbb28dc92fb4a2f05e6bdebda6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7274c439787eafdbb28dc92fb4a2f05e6bdebda6/0_349_720_900/400.jpg\" alt=\"Anita Chaudhuri (foreground on the right) at the carol concert.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anita Chaudhuri (foreground on the right) at the carol concert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Anita Chaudhuri</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Afterwards, everyone headed off to the pub, but I lingered, still mesmerised by the tree. It was then that a woman approached me. \u201cHi,\u201d she faltered. \u201cYou were wonderful up there \u2013 I wanted to thank you.\u201d I made a joke about how we didn\u2019t sound as out of tune as normal, but she shook her head. \u201cNo, I wanted to thank <em>you</em>.\u201d I couldn\u2019t think what she meant. \u201cThings aren\u2019t so good for me at the moment,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>I scrutinised her more closely. The author Joan Didion wrote, in The Year of Magical Thinking, about how bereaved people can identify one another: \u201cPeople who have recently lost someone have a certain look, recognisable maybe only to those who have seen that look on their own faces. I have noticed it on my face and I notice it now on others.\u201d</p> <p>Yet what I saw in the woman\u2019s watery blue eyes was not altogether familiar. There was grief, yes, but there was a sense of something darker; a shipwreck. It dawned on me then that while I missed my father intensely, the loss had come after 48 years of his devoted attention. I didn\u2019t need to hear this stranger\u2019s story to intuit she hadn\u2019t had that; what I\u2019d had was a rare gift. Because of it, I would find my way back to myself; indeed, the process was already in motion. Not everyone was that lucky.</p> <p>But the woman was still talking. \u201cSeeing you up there having such a good time, it made me realise I\u2019ve forgotten how to enjoy myself.\u201d She made a show of jazz hands: \u201cI\u2019m going to remember to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Six years on, I am the one buying wrapping paper in July and making my own Christmas cards. It might sound strange, but that generous conversation somehow gave me permission to get back to the serious business of enjoying life \u2013 and Christmas. Not only was it what my father would have wanted, but doing so could have a positive impact on others \u2013 even perfect strangers.</p>",

In a wild world, there\u2019s no feeling like watching talent explode, all wide-eyed, grateful and disbelieving.</p> <p>Mason Greenwood is none of these things, a child who scores goals like a man. Often young players snatch at chances, lost in the supermarket trying six different finishes at once. But Greenwood handles things differently, blessed with a clear mind and the resting heart rate of a table.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/24/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-admits-manchester-united-are-behind-in-their-development-football\">Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r admits Manchester United are behind in their development</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These may seem ridiculous words to write about someone who has accomplished so little. But they are considerably less ridiculous than Greenwood\u2019s ability. </p> <p>When we encounter new things we naturally assess them relative to old things, and Greenwood\u2019s points of comparison are obvious. Aesthetically he is most similar to Robin van Persie: smooth, lean, precise and controlled \u2013 but with a right foot as definitive as his left.</p> <p>Strategically, though, he more closely resembles Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r: able to get a shot away \u2013 and on target \u2013 in almost any circumstance.

      "bodyText": "Watching a teenager make their name is a moving, affirming experience, equal parts empathy and envy: if you\u2019re young you want to be young and good, and if you\u2019re old \u2026 you still want to be to be young and good. In a wild world, there\u2019s no feeling like watching talent explode, all wide-eyed, grateful and disbelieving. Mason Greenwood is none of these things, a child who scores goals like a man. Often young players snatch at chances, lost in the supermarket trying six different finishes at once. But Greenwood handles things differently, blessed with a clear mind and the resting heart rate of a table. These may seem ridiculous words to write about someone who has accomplished so little. But they are considerably less ridiculous than Greenwood\u2019s ability. When we encounter new things we naturally assess them relative to old things, and Greenwood\u2019s points of comparison are obvious. Aesthetically he is most similar to Robin van Persie: smooth, lean, precise and controlled \u2013 but with a right foot as definitive as his left. Strategically, though, he more closely resembles Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r: able to get a shot away \u2013 and on target \u2013 in almost any circumstance. Against AZ Alkmaar and Everton, Greenwood\u2019s excellent goals bore a hallmark of his boss: shaping for the far post before dragging a finish back towards the near \u2013 through the legs of a defender used as a screen. Neither strike was particularly powerful and both passed close to the keeper, but timing and disguise ensured that neither effort was remotely saveable. And elementally Greenwood is most reminiscent of Paul Scholes: though he does a very different job, his style is underpinned by the principle of only ever attempting what is feasible.

Though it made sense that Greenwood began the season as a substitute, it was odd that, with Anthony Martial injured and United struggling to score, he was picked to start only two cup games. But he still managed beautifully taken goals against Astana and Rochdale, and in 893 minutes now has seven \u2013 plus two assists. The xG model calculates that there was only an 11.41% chance of him taking as many opportunities as he has done, and no number can describe the expertise of those finishes.

      "body": "<p>At the end of last year, Teresa Xu visited a hospital in Beijing to discuss options for freezing her eggs. The doctor said she could not help Xu, a single woman, because it went against regulations. Then she gave the 31-year-old some sisterly advice: hurry up, get married and have children now.</p> <p>Xu was shocked and disappointed. \u201cI had no way to express my anger,\u201d she said. She felt like she was being treated like a wayward child. \u201cLike I was an intruder, delaying other couples \u2026 like my demands were too much. I felt powerless and depressed.\u201d</p> <p>After a few months, Xu decided to push back. On Monday, she took the Beijing Obstetrics and Gynaecology hospital to court in what is the first case of its kind in China. She alleges that the hospital, by refusing to freeze her eggs, violated her personal rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/02/chinas-lost-little-emperors-how-the-one-child-policy-will-haunt-the-nation-for-decades\">China\u2019s lost little emperors... how the \u2018one-child policy\u2019 will haunt the country for decades | Mei Fong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Xu\u2019s case has prompted a nationwide debate about the reproductive rights of single women in China, where women are increasingly marrying later or not at all.</p> <p>After decades of restricting many families to only one child, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/02/china-population-control-two-child-policy\">China now allows all couples to have two children</a>, but the loosened restrictions do not apply to single women. According to Chinese health regulations on human assisted reproduction, only married couples are eligible for such services, which include access to sperm banks as well as freezing one\u2019s eggs.</p> <p>Single women typically go overseas for the procedure, which costs between $10,000 and $18,000. Others use underground agents. Ctrip, a Chinese travel booking website, last year began offering some of its employees financial aid to travel overseas to freeze their eggs.</p> <p>But Xu did not want to go abroad to seek what she sees as a basic right. Before going to Beijing Obstetrics and Gynaecology hospital, Xu was refused by at least three other hospitals. Her lawsuit was also turned down three times.</p> <p>\u201cWhether I choose to have a child or not, I should have the right to choose,\u201d she said. \u201cMany women don\u2019t know that they can freeze their eggs. When their own childbearing pressure and workplace pressure overlap, they may not know there is a way to solve the problem.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the time, they choose having a child under great pressure. When they choose their career they bear a lot of criticism from society and their family.\u201d</p> <p>News of Xu\u2019s lawsuit has spread quickly across Chinese media. When she went to the first hearing of her case on Monday, to be continued in the new year, she was surrounded by Chinese reporters. By the next day, a hashtag related to her case had almost 9 million views and thousands of comments on Weibo.</p> <p>Many questioned why single men were able to freeze their sperm without question. Married women must also show documentation of their marriage and proof of their eligibility to give birth under family planning rules. According to local media, some hospitals require women to have their husband\u2019s consent.</p> <p>\u201cThis is gender inequality,\u201d one user on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site, said. \u201cThe freedom of birth is the most basic right of women,\u201d another wrote.

      "bodyText": "At the end of last year, Teresa Xu visited a hospital in Beijing to discuss options for freezing her eggs. The doctor said she could not help Xu, a single woman, because it went against regulations. Then she gave the 31-year-old some sisterly advice: hurry up, get married and have children now. Xu was shocked and disappointed. \u201cI had no way to express my anger,\u201d she said. She felt like she was being treated like a wayward child. \u201cLike I was an intruder, delaying other couples \u2026 like my demands were too much. I felt powerless and depressed.\u201d After a few months, Xu decided to push back. On Monday, she took the Beijing Obstetrics and Gynaecology hospital to court in what is the first case of its kind in China. She alleges that the hospital, by refusing to freeze her eggs, violated her personal rights. Xu\u2019s case has prompted a nationwide debate about the reproductive rights of single women in China, where women are increasingly marrying later or not at all. After decades of restricting many families to only one child, China now allows all couples to have two children, but the loosened restrictions do not apply to single women. According to Chinese health regulations on human assisted reproduction, only married couples are eligible for such services, which include access to sperm banks as well as freezing one\u2019s eggs. Single women typically go overseas for the procedure, which costs between $10,000 and $18,000. Others use underground agents. Ctrip, a Chinese travel booking website, last year began offering some of its employees financial aid to travel overseas to freeze their eggs. But Xu did not want to go abroad to seek what she sees as a basic right. Before going to Beijing Obstetrics and Gynaecology hospital, Xu was refused by at least three other hospitals. Her lawsuit was also turned down three times. \u201cWhether I choose to have a child or not, I should have the right to choose,\u201d she said. \u201cMany women don\u2019t know that they can freeze their eggs. When their own childbearing pressure and workplace pressure overlap, they may not know there is a way to solve the problem. \u201cMost of the time, they choose having a child under great pressure. When they choose their career they bear a lot of criticism from society and their family.\u201d News of Xu\u2019s lawsuit has spread quickly across Chinese media. When she went to the first hearing of her case on Monday, to be continued in the new year, she was surrounded by Chinese reporters. By the next day, a hashtag related to her case had almost 9 million views and thousands of comments on Weibo. Many questioned why single men were able to freeze their sperm without question. Married women must also show documentation of their marriage and proof of their eligibility to give birth under family planning rules. According to local media, some hospitals require women to have their husband\u2019s consent. \u201cThis is gender inequality,\u201d one user on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site, said. \u201cThe freedom of birth is the most basic right of women,\u201d another wrote. A prominent columnist, Hong Huang wrote on her Weibo account: \u201cSupport single women freezing their eggs.\u201d Legal experts and advocates say they do not have high hopes Xu will win her lawsuit but the publicity and fact her case was accepted by the courts is already a win. \u201cThere has never been this much attention to this issue,\u201d said Dong Xiaoying, an activist based in Guangzhou who has been pushing to overturn the prohibition on single women receiving reproductive assistance. \u201cI think it\u2019s great progress. No matter the result, it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she said. Xu\u2019s lawsuit has also inspired criticism. During her hearing, a lawyer for the hospital defended the policy saying that allowing single women to freeze their eggs would further delay childbirth, contributing to China\u2019s already low birthrate, or increase the age gap between parents and children. Xu says she realises that Chinese women face an uphill battle, after decades of restrictive family planning policies. Still, she is encouraged by the women who have got in touch to say they identify with her situation. \u201cSo many things are suppressed. People can\u2019t feel, can\u2019t imagine and don\u2019t realise what personal freedoms women can have,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope we can create a new model or image of single women who want to have children.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

We saw the film yesterday and love the film now! Superb choreography, terrific sets and some wonderful singing especially from Jennifer Hudson. The critics are not always right! <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/136845144\">Snowpenguin</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018It was so bad I still feel shame when I look my cat in the eyes\u2019</h2> <p>An already weak musical became even weaker with this adaptation. The entire movie is spent trying to stay awake through boring scenes ploughing through a boring story, sung by bad singers. There is one good song, which is the only reason the movie deserves a one star review rather than a zero. It was so bad I still feel shame when I look my cat in the eyes. <strong>Christoffer Oqvist, 24, Burton-upon-Trent</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Weird storyline but the songs are just brilliant\u2019</h2> <p>I enjoyed the film and would give it 3/5 stars. I grew up with dance classes every weekend and have lovely memories of performing Cats in our annual show. It of course is a weird storyline, but the songs are just brilliant. So in terms of being adapted to a movie I knew in part I would love it. However, I was disappointed with the CGI which at times looked really fake and unnecessary. You have incredible dancers that need no CGI as evidenced when you watch the stage show, often less is more. I do feel it is a great cast and already have the soundtrack on repeat. <strong>Hazel, 37, Bristol</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m planning on going to see it again\u2019</h2> <p>From the first moment this film had me hooked. Beautifully shot and delightful in every way. Francesca Hayward is stunning but for me the stand out performance is by Jennifer Hudson, heart wrenching and magnificent. I am already planning to go and see it again. I cannot understand the bad reviews at all, I cannot see anywhere that it could be improved. <strong>Amanda Clabon, 60, Hertfordshire</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018It was positively jaw-dropping\u2019</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s precisely because of articles and reviews like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/20/cats-the-fur-the-tails-judi-denchs-cannibal-coat-discuss-the-film-with-spoilers\">this one</a> that I decided I just had to see Cats. Surely it couldn\u2019t be that bad, could it? It was positively jaw-dropping, particularly the scene with the mice children and Rebel Wilson scarfing down the tap dancing cockroaches. In other words, it\u2019s the must-see movie of the season. The theatre was packed. Where did they go right? <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/136841777\">Cardinal</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018Astonishingly ill-conceived mind fart\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Astonishingly ill-conceived mind fart. These \u2018cats\u2019 try so hard to be sexy but fail. They come across as merely perverse. The body dysmorphia is stunningly wrong and at one point James Corden receives a blow to the nether regions and registers discomfort. This is odd because there is nothing \u2018down there\u2019 for either gender in this achingly weird film. That struck the perfect low note for me. <strong>Colin Young, 58, London</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Can\u2019t believe the negative publicity\u2019</h2> <p>Brilliant, colourful, superb costumes, CGI, and cat movements were excellent. Great adaptation to film. We really enjoyed it and can\u2019t believe the negative publicity it has been given. It helped knowing the poems and still believe the West end show is better, however a great film and would thoroughly recommend people go and make their own judgement. <strong>Angela Nutt, 55, New Forest</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018You need to get over the furry nudity, but it\u2019s ace!\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve just been to see it and I LOVED it. There I said it. I loved the singing (all top notch), I loved the choreography and I really loved Jennifer Hudson singing memory \u2013 she is amazing. I don\u2019t know why everyone is acting perplexed about plot and believability, it was mental when it was a poem and it was bonkers when made into a musical and it is still deranged as a movie \u2013 but that\u2019s part of the joy and eccentricity of it. There is a lot of CGI overkill which is wasted when you\u2019ve got good performers anyway, and you need to get over the furry nudity, but it\u2019s ace! <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/136835809\">rloliver1792</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018Rebel Wilson\u2019s crutch inducing scene was an anti-climax\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I could have done without watching this. Ian McKellen\u2019s attempt to groan a painful meow and his milk licking scene was bad enough but Rebel Wilson\u2019s crutch inducing scene was an anti-climax. The scene where the human cockroaches were swallowed alive was just distasteful and Idris Elba looked weird, not wonderful. Having said all that my wife loved it! She said it was touching, beautiful and moving! Well, at least one of us enjoyed it. I\u2019ll just have to erase it from my \u2018memory\u2019. <strong>Hola Garip, 58, London</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I will buy the movie to keep and watch over and over again\u2019</h2> <p>I thought it was one of the best pieces of ballet I\u2019ve seen in a long time. The costumes were fantastic; the way the dancers imitated the feline movements of a cat was awesome. The emotions were so believable and I was mesmerised from beginning to end. So much so that I will buy the movie to keep and watch over and over again. <strong>Pamela Cobley, 82, Wales</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s a bit like Marmite\u2019</strong></h2> <p>After reading through so many negative reviews my 11-year-old daughter and I were unsure what to expect when we bravely went to see the film. We are already fans \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it three times in the theatre. I thought the music in the film was well done, I enjoyed the characterisation which was given more focus than in the theatre. The musical has never really had much of a storyline but it did have a bit more in the film. I didn\u2019t like the use of CGI in some dance moves but enjoyed the choreography of Skimbleshanks and watching ballet star Francesca Hayward as Victoria. I think it\u2019s a bit like Marmite and if you are already not a fan then this probably won\u2019t massively change your mind but we enjoyed watching it. <strong>Clare Barnett, 41, Warwickshire</strong></p>",

Pamela Cobley, 82, Wales \u2018It\u2019s a bit like Marmite\u2019 After reading through so many negative reviews my 11-year-old daughter and I were unsure what to expect when we bravely went to see the film. We are already fans \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it three times in the theatre. I thought the music in the film was well done, I enjoyed the characterisation which was given more focus than in the theatre. The musical has never really had much of a storyline but it did have a bit more in the film. I didn\u2019t like the use of CGI in some dance moves but enjoyed the choreography of Skimbleshanks and watching ballet star Francesca Hayward as Victoria. I think it\u2019s a bit like Marmite and if you are already not a fan then this probably won\u2019t massively change your mind but we enjoyed watching it. Clare Barnett, 41, Warwickshire",

      "bodyText": "The cheeky fire-starters at Eight by Eight magazine knew exactly what they were doing when they waited six whole months until the business end of the Women\u2019s World Cup to publish the interview with Megan Rapinoe they had recorded in January. At least as much as the impish American midfielder knew what she was provoking when asked whether the US women\u2019s national soccer team she captains intended to visit Donald Trump if they managed the exceedingly rare feat of repeating as world champions. \u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House,\u201d Rapinoe flatly stated. \u201cNo fucking way will we be invited to the White House.\u201d The release of the Rapinoe interview during the last week of June was a journalistic depth charge timed for maximum impact. The USA women, who had only just outrun an early-tournament controversy where they had become perhaps the first team in World Cup history to come under criticism for scoring too many goals (yes, really), were one day removed from seeing off Spain to set up a blockbuster quarter-final with the hosts, France, when the teaser clip dropped and went viral. Trump, an instinctive counter-puncher who never met a spotlight he didn\u2019t try to hijack, fired back the next day with a warning to Rapinoe to not \u201cdisrespect\u201d her country: \u201cWomen\u2019s soccer player, @meganrapino, just stated that she is \u2018not going to the F \u2026 ing White House if we win\u2019. Other than the NBA \u2026 teams love coming to the White House. I am a big fan of the American Team, and Women\u2019s Soccer, but Megan should WIN first before she TALKS!\u201d Nothing about the presidential riposte came as a surprise, least of all the lie that he likes soccer or that he initially addressed it to the wrong Megan Rapinoe. Ever since he seized on Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protest against police violence as a wellspring of easy political points, Trump has regularly co-opted sport as not merely a proxy battle in the culture wars but a primary theatre. Suddenly Rapinoe and co were no longer solely up against the growing cluster of European powers that have closed the competitive gap over the past decade, but what seemed like the entire American right. Rapinoe was openly backed by her teammates as the back-and-forth with Trump came to overshadow the team\u2019s looming showdown with a hotly tipped France side eager to knock the Americans off their perch. Alex Morgan also made it known she wouldn\u2019t go to the White House, while Ali Krieger threw her support behind Rapinoe, saying Trump was angered by women he \u201ccannot control or grope\u201d and decrying what she described as the administration\u2019s \u201cfight against LGBTQ+ citizens, immigrants &amp; our most vulnerable\u201d. But Rapinoe, a lesbian with a taste for the fight whose unapologetic political views have made her a lightning rod for conservatives, was always the primary target, with more skin in the game than anyone else. Not that she would have it any other way. The rest is history. The purple-haired talisman, who turned 34 during the tournament, bounced back from a somewhat ponderous showing in group play to score pivotal goals in three of her side\u2019s final four matches, earning the Golden Boot as the tournament\u2019s top scorer and the Golden Ball as the best overall player, while helping the US become the third country to defend successfully a World Cup, men\u2019s or women\u2019s, since the second world war. Even after the USA returned home after defeating the Netherlands for their record fourth world title, Rapinoe\u2019s right-wing critics redoubled in volume and numbers \u2013 no doubt irked by the pictures beamed around the globe of fronting a ticker-tape parade in lower Manhattan with the World Cup trophy in one hand and a bottle of Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame in the other. The Fox News anchor Howard Kurtz accused Rapinoe of using her platform \u201cto mar or spoil or tar what could have been this great unifying victory\u201d, while the conservative pundit Ben Shapiro said the midfielder was getting lucrative contracts only because she\u2019s an \u201coutspoken lesbian\u201d who just happens to be good at soccer. Piers Morgan, who had previously hit out at Rapinoe\u2019s statuesque pose after the second of her two goals to beat France, called her unbearable, while the Fox News host Jesse Watters decried her \u201cunpatriotic\u201d behaviour, saying it undermined the team\u2019s campaign for equal pay. Sebastian Gorka, a former White House aide, invoked Rapinoe (\u201cthis woman who dyes her hair, who thinks she\u2019s a big warrior\u201d) to allege the US team were out \u201cto destroy everything that is wholesome in our country and in our Judeo-Christian civilisation\u201d. Everything about Rapinoe \u2013 the flamboyant hairstyle, the victory pose that launched a thousand memes, the unrepentant egotism \u2013 makes them angry. She was the first white athlete to take a knee during the Star-Spangled Banner in solidarity with Kaepernick and the Black Lives Matter movement in 2016, and drew criticism for standing with her hands at her sides during the World Cup while representing the US on a global stage. She has consistently spoken up for LGBT rights and has also been one of the faces of a gender-discrimination complaint filed by a group of US women\u2019s players alleging they are paid less than their male counterparts. Not since Kaepernick has a single athlete made them so uncomfortable. But not unlike the exiled former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, she has compelled the country to engage in conversations once considered forbidden in public square \u2013 turning the afterglow of her team\u2019s championship on vital matters of LGBTQ rights as well as racial and gender equality. And no, she never made it to the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone on the team has any interest in lending the platform that we\u2019ve worked so hard to build and the things that we fight for and the way that we live our life,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper during the team\u2019s extended victory lap. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we want that to be co-opted or corrupted by this administration.\u201d When asked whether she had a message for Trump, she took a breath, broke the fourth wall and spoke: \u201cYour message is excluding people. You\u2019re excluding me, you\u2019re excluding people that look like me, you\u2019re excluding people of colour, you\u2019re excluding Americans that maybe support you.\u201d She went on: \u201cI think that we need to have a reckoning with the message that you have and what you\u2019re saying about \u2018Make America great again\u2019. I think that you\u2019re harking back to an era that was not great for everyone. It might have been great for a few people. Maybe America is great for a few people right now. But it\u2019s not great for enough Americans.\u201d Win before you talk? No problem. And by taking the fight to enemies foreign and domestic, our purple-haired champion and voice of the disenfranchised ensured the Summer of Rapinoe will be long remembered.",

Those winds blow around all of us now and Luiselli isn\u2019t afraid of clouding our judgment or causing confusion.

In the inevitable, wide-ranging assessment of what this all means, at least this can be defined as a reference point for decades and generations to come.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"7dcd9bfc28d85608f8804723caa0768b4467e1a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dcd9bfc28d85608f8804723caa0768b4467e1a8/0_0_2243_3100/724.jpg\" alt=\"Guinea-Bissau\u2019s Braima Suncar Dabo helps Aruba\u2019s Jonathan Busby to the finish in the men\u2019s 5000m heats during the World Athletics Championships at the Khalifa Stadium in Doha, Qatar.\" width=\"724\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guinea-Bissau\u2019s Braima Suncar Dabo helps Aruba\u2019s Jonathan Busby to the finish in the men\u2019s 5,000m heats during the World Athletics Championships at the Khalifa Stadium in Doha, Qatar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I started counting my steps and my head was gone, I think I lost sight in one eye.

      "body": "<p>The 2010s end, like they began, with India top of the world rankings and in between 598 players, from Varun Aaron to Zulqarnain Haider, have played 431 Tests in 171 series. Here is our Test team of the decade, picked by a panel of 10 Guardian journalists: Vic Marks, Ali Martin, Rob Smyth, Tim de Lisle, Emma John, Tanya Aldred, Geoff Lemon, Adam Collins, Jonathan Liew and Andy Bull.</p> <h2>Openers</h2> <p><strong>Alastair Cook</strong></p> <p>England\u2019s rock. Cook played more innings, faced more balls and scored more runs in Test cricket than anyone this decade. If you sat down to watch every last little bit of his batting it would take 18 days of 24/7 viewing. But even more than that, in an era when teams found it harder than ever to win away from home, Cook was the key player in England\u2019s greatest series victories, in Australia 2010\u201111, when he made 766 runs, and in India 2012-13, when he made 562. By then, inevitably, he had been made England captain, a job that taxed his bottomless reserves of strength, stamina and endurance.</p> <p><strong>David Warner</strong></p> <p>The Oscar Madison of our odd couple of openers. If Cook was one of the last of the old breed of Test match batsmen, Warner was one of the first of the new. He had hardly played 10 first-class games but more than 100 T20 matches when he made his Test debut. It didn\u2019t matter. He carried his bat for 123 in his second Test. Since then, well \u2026 it has been complicated. Some of the judges explicitly ruled him out on the grounds that they still hadn\u2019t forgiven him for his role <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/27/cricket-australia-coach-darren-lehmann-remain-job-smith-warner-bancroft-exiled-ball-tampering\" title=\"\">in the ball-tampering scandal at Cape Town</a>, but more reckoned the ups outnumbered the downs.</p> <p><strong>Runners-up: </strong>Chris Gayle, Brendon McCullum.</p> <h2>Middle order</h2> <p><strong>Kane Williamson</strong> </p> <p>Our captain, on the grounds that he has managed to wring so much out of such modest resources (he has taken his team to second in the world rankings this year) and for the way he and his side carried themselves in the minutes after the World Cup final. He began the decade by scoring a century on debut, against India in Ahmedabad. Before long people were saying he might become New Zealand\u2019s greatest batsman, and before long he had. Williamson has scored hundreds against every team, in all sorts of conditions, on every continent, in every country except one, and he has done it without sending so much as a single tweet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd52348d5830f17351c6f82248d7b86317d46371\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd52348d5830f17351c6f82248d7b86317d46371/0_139_3293_1975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kane Williamson is regarded as New Zealand\u2019s finest batsman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kane Williamson is regarded as New Zealand\u2019s finest batsman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Virat Kohli</strong></p> <p>The very model of a modern cricketer and the most influential player in the world. A man of boundless ambition, he doesn\u2019t just lead India by example, but epitome. Before Kohli, India had four great Test batsmen and it sometimes feels as though he stole the best and brightest bits of each of them \u2013 Sourav Ganguly\u2019s fire, Sachin Tendulkar\u2019s dedication, Virender Sehwag\u2019s swagger, VVS Laxman\u2019s grace \u2013 and bound them all together into something stronger, fiercer, less forgiving. Under Kohli, India have become one of the fittest, sharpest and most hostile sides around. So long as they have him, India will never be underdogs again. The cricketer of the decade.</p> <p><strong>Steve Smith</strong></p> <p>It is an old story, but worth repeating. Like Williamson, Smith made his Test debut back in 2010, only he was batting No 9 in the second innings, and bowling his pug-ugly leg-spin. Ten years later he has transformed himself into the greatest Test batsman of his age, a man who, at his best, people will readily compare to Don Bradman without blushing. By the tail-end of the decade, old bowlers around the world were still telling themselves, and everyone else, that they knew how to get around his Heath Robinson technique. His contemporaries had given up kidding themselves.</p> <p><strong>Runners-up:</strong> Kumar Sangakkara, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq. </p> <h2>Wicketkeeper</h2> <p><strong>AB de Villiers </strong></p> <p>In the 16 years he has been playing he has shown he can do pretty much anything he turns his mind to. Here he is in as wicketkeeper, a job he did, on and off, in the first half of the decade. He gave it up because he said it was all too much, but, curiously, he was a better batsman when he was doubling up. His batting average as a wicketkeeper this decade is just under 60, which (ridiculously) is half as good again as anyone else. He seems to be so gifted that his own boredom with it all is the only thing that can get the better of him.</p> <p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Mushfiqur Rahim.</p> <h2>All-rounder</h2> <p><strong>Ben Stokes</strong></p> <p>The old measure of what makes an all-rounder, stacking up averages, doesn\u2019t really work for Stokes, you do not measure him in numbers but moments, matches and memories. He is a human highlights reel, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/17/australia-win-the-ashes-third-test\" title=\"\">his defiant 120 at the Waca</a>, England\u2019s one century in a whitewash, through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/03/ben-stokes-south-africa-england-jonny-bairstow\" title=\"\">his rollocking 258 at Cape Town</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/25/australia-ashes-england-third-test-ben-stokes-sensational\" title=\"\">that 135</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/25/australia-ashes-england-third-test-ben-stokes-sensational\" title=\"\"> at Headingley</a>, from his miraculous diving catch to dismiss Adam Voges at Trent Bridge to his marathon spells, the swing, the short balls. This team could really do with a second spinner in this position, but no one is going to begrudge his inclusion.</p> <p><strong>Runner-up: </strong>Shakib Al Hasan.</p> <h2>Spinner</h2> <p><strong>Ravi Ashwin</strong></p> <p>A tricky pick this one between Ashwin, Nathan Lyon and Rangana Herath. Ashwin\u2019s wickets have come a little cheaper, and more frequently, than either of his rivals and if he has struggled to figure out how to bowl in Australia and South Africa, his wickets have been one of the key factors in India\u2019s remarkable run at home, where they have lost one series out of 19. Ashwin has pushed spin bowling on too, has developed his own style which isn\u2019t exactly orthodox, but doesn\u2019t depend on the doosra, either. Which is why, unlike his rivals, he has succeeded in all three formats.</p> <p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Nathan Lyon.</p> <h2>Fast bowlers</h2> <p><strong>Mitchell Johnson</strong></p> <p>The one wide-open spot in the XI, Johnson won it because of the number of traumatised England fans among the selectors. Much as they would like to try and forget it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/11/ashes-2013-14-mitchell-johnson-fast-bowling-ogre\" title=\"\">Johnson will always be remembered for </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/11/ashes-2013-14-mitchell-johnson-fast-bowling-ogre\" title=\"\">37 wickets he took in the 2013-14 Ashes</a>, when he single-handedly dismantled a team who were sure they had what it took to win there. It was one of the most unremittingly hostile performances by any fast bowler, too quick and too sharp for some of the best batsmen of the era. By the time he was done with them, England were in disarray.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59f0cb1e3ab8373e786db3cd0ba212a7dfcede40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59f0cb1e3ab8373e786db3cd0ba212a7dfcede40/27_235_3134_1881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mitchell Johnson was a terrfying opponent for England in 2013-14.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell Johnson was a terrfying opponent for England in 2013-14.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Dale Steyn</strong></p> <p>The finest fast bowler of his generation. It is strange to remember, now, that around the beginning of the decade everyone was worried about the decline of fast bowling. Steyn was the exception all along, the one man who, all through those barren years, stood comparison with greatest quicks of the 1980s and 1990s. Steyn has ripped through every team at one time or another and he has taken five cheap wickets in an innings against every side he has played against. It was only at the end of the decade, when injuries finally began to catch up with him, that his form fell away.</p> <p><strong>Jimmy Anderson</strong></p> <p>The only player in the XI who was playing Test cricket before the decade started and will still be playing it after it is finished. Anderson has done it by transforming himself from a real daisy of an English swinger (some days he does, some days he doesn\u2019t) into a man who has the tricks and skills, knowledge and understanding to succeed everywhere he plays. He has taken his wickets in Australia, India, Sri Lanka and in England, where batsmen grope after him like little kids trying to find the lady under the cups. He is as good as unplayable.</p> <p><strong>Runners-up:</strong> Vernon Philander, Mitchell Starc, Kagiso Rabada.</p> <p><em><strong>This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

Openers Alastair Cook England\u2019s rock. Cook played more innings, faced more balls and scored more runs in Test cricket than anyone this decade. If you sat down to watch every last little bit of his batting it would take 18 days of 24/7 viewing. But even more than that, in an era when teams found it harder than ever to win away from home, Cook was the key player in England\u2019s greatest series victories, in Australia 2010\u201111, when he made 766 runs, and in India 2012-13, when he made 562. By then, inevitably, he had been made England captain, a job that taxed his bottomless reserves of strength, stamina and endurance. David Warner The Oscar Madison of our odd couple of openers. If Cook was one of the last of the old breed of Test match batsmen, Warner was one of the first of the new. He had hardly played 10 first-class games but more than 100 T20 matches when he made his Test debut. It didn\u2019t matter. He carried his bat for 123 in his second Test. Since then, well \u2026 it has been complicated. Some of the judges explicitly ruled him out on the grounds that they still hadn\u2019t forgiven him for his role in the ball-tampering scandal at Cape Town, but more reckoned the ups outnumbered the downs. Runners-up: Chris Gayle, Brendon McCullum. Middle order Kane Williamson Our captain, on the grounds that he has managed to wring so much out of such modest resources (he has taken his team to second in the world rankings this year) and for the way he and his side carried themselves in the minutes after the World Cup final. He began the decade by scoring a century on debut, against India in Ahmedabad. Before long people were saying he might become New Zealand\u2019s greatest batsman, and before long he had. Williamson has scored hundreds against every team, in all sorts of conditions, on every continent, in every country except one, and he has done it without sending so much as a single tweet. Virat Kohli The very model of a modern cricketer and the most influential player in the world. A man of boundless ambition, he doesn\u2019t just lead India by example, but epitome. Before Kohli, India had four great Test batsmen and it sometimes feels as though he stole the best and brightest bits of each of them \u2013 Sourav Ganguly\u2019s fire, Sachin Tendulkar\u2019s dedication, Virender Sehwag\u2019s swagger, VVS Laxman\u2019s grace \u2013 and bound them all together into something stronger, fiercer, less forgiving. Under Kohli, India have become one of the fittest, sharpest and most hostile sides around. So long as they have him, India will never be underdogs again. The cricketer of the decade. Steve Smith It is an old story, but worth repeating. Like Williamson, Smith made his Test debut back in 2010, only he was batting No 9 in the second innings, and bowling his pug-ugly leg-spin. Ten years later he has transformed himself into the greatest Test batsman of his age, a man who, at his best, people will readily compare to Don Bradman without blushing. By the tail-end of the decade, old bowlers around the world were still telling themselves, and everyone else, that they knew how to get around his Heath Robinson technique. His contemporaries had given up kidding themselves. Runners-up: Kumar Sangakkara, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq. Wicketkeeper AB de Villiers In the 16 years he has been playing he has shown he can do pretty much anything he turns his mind to. Here he is in as wicketkeeper, a job he did, on and off, in the first half of the decade. He gave it up because he said it was all too much, but, curiously, he was a better batsman when he was doubling up. His batting average as a wicketkeeper this decade is just under 60, which (ridiculously) is half as good again as anyone else. He seems to be so gifted that his own boredom with it all is the only thing that can get the better of him. Runner-up: Mushfiqur Rahim. All-rounder Ben Stokes The old measure of what makes an all-rounder, stacking up averages, doesn\u2019t really work for Stokes, you do not measure him in numbers but moments, matches and memories. He is a human highlights reel, from his defiant 120 at the Waca, England\u2019s one century in a whitewash, through his rollocking 258 at Cape Town, to that 135 at Headingley, from his miraculous diving catch to dismiss Adam Voges at Trent Bridge to his marathon spells, the swing, the short balls. This team could really do with a second spinner in this position, but no one is going to begrudge his inclusion. Runner-up: Shakib Al Hasan. Spinner Ravi Ashwin A tricky pick this one between Ashwin, Nathan Lyon and Rangana Herath. Ashwin\u2019s wickets have come a little cheaper, and more frequently, than either of his rivals and if he has struggled to figure out how to bowl in Australia and South Africa, his wickets have been one of the key factors in India\u2019s remarkable run at home, where they have lost one series out of 19. Ashwin has pushed spin bowling on too, has developed his own style which isn\u2019t exactly orthodox, but doesn\u2019t depend on the doosra, either. Which is why, unlike his rivals, he has succeeded in all three formats. Runner-up: Nathan Lyon. Fast bowlers Mitchell Johnson The one wide-open spot in the XI, Johnson won it because of the number of traumatised England fans among the selectors. Much as they would like to try and forget it, Johnson will always be remembered for 37 wickets he took in the 2013-14 Ashes, when he single-handedly dismantled a team who were sure they had what it took to win there. It was one of the most unremittingly hostile performances by any fast bowler, too quick and too sharp for some of the best batsmen of the era. By the time he was done with them, England were in disarray. Dale Steyn The finest fast bowler of his generation. It is strange to remember, now, that around the beginning of the decade everyone was worried about the decline of fast bowling. Steyn was the exception all along, the one man who, all through those barren years, stood comparison with greatest quicks of the 1980s and 1990s. Steyn has ripped through every team at one time or another and he has taken five cheap wickets in an innings against every side he has played against. It was only at the end of the decade, when injuries finally began to catch up with him, that his form fell away. Jimmy Anderson The only player in the XI who was playing Test cricket before the decade started and will still be playing it after it is finished. Anderson has done it by transforming himself from a real daisy of an English swinger (some days he does, some days he doesn\u2019t) into a man who has the tricks and skills, knowledge and understanding to succeed everywhere he plays. He has taken his wickets in Australia, India, Sri Lanka and in England, where batsmen grope after him like little kids trying to find the lady under the cups. He is as good as unplayable. Runners-up: Vernon Philander, Mitchell Starc, Kagiso Rabada. This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email. The Spin.

Because God knows, the reaction to satire by people who are politically opposed to the satirist is just more entrenched than ever. They are enraged by satire. And I think it\u2019s an interesting truism that fascists hate satire. They are incredibly paranoid about being laughed at.\u201d</p> <p>Lithgow admits that this was the marketing strategy behind <em>Dumpty</em>. \u201cWe were all secretly hoping that Trump would tweet about <em>Dumpty</em>, but maybe he\u2019s got too much on his mind,\u201d he says. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d get any of the jokes.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Top Trumps</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bb4f0a7e76102535a7520363cd853ff9566a1e9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb4f0a7e76102535a7520363cd853ff9566a1e9b/0_0_335_499/335.jpg\" alt=\"A Ladybird Book About Donald Trump\" width=\"335\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>A Ladybird Book About Donald Trump</strong></h2> <p><em>by Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris (Michael Joseph)<br></em>The 35th entry in the deathless Ladybirds for Grown-Ups series is purely about Trump, as evidenced from the great big orange on the cover.

      "body": "<p>It was around my son\u2019s second winter on this earth, and that stressful time known as the run-up to Christmas, that I really knew. He was autistic. My boy, who loved to flip anything on wheels belly-up so he could watch them spin, his little fat hand expertly rolling them faster. My boy, who spoke in long, elaborate phrases, many of them lifted verbatim from his favourite books and TV shows. My boy, who appeared not to notice other toddlers passing in buggies, but was mesmerised by carpet fluff, sirens, the moon. My boy, who cared not one fig for Santa, but who, when we dragged the tree into the house, shedding the customary trail of needles and pine perfume, rubbed up against it like a cat, embraced it as if it were a long-lost friend who had come for tea.</p> <p>Autistic children hate Christmas, or so I thought. It\u2019s the sensory overload. The unwieldy family visits seasoned with \u201cmelancholysteria\u201d (a festive hybrid of emotions that tastes like purple Quality Streets, hungover Victoria Wood specials and childhood) when everyone is wearing silly hats and (mostly, surely, please God) trying their best. It\u2019s the bewildering demand to sit at the table for hours and consume 5,000 calories of enormo-bird and suspicious items collectively known as trimmings. It\u2019s the hell on earth otherwise known as the Christmas market.</p> <p>But maybe that was me, not my son.</p> <p>It turns out that many things I thought about autism were twaddle. It wasn\u2019t that my son hated Christmas: it was that he cared deeply about certain aspects of it, while others aroused zero interest or induced abject horror. Which is not far off how many of us feel about this got-to-be-most-wonderful time of the year. One Damascene moment came at the Edinburgh Christmas market, possibly as I was exchanging many pounds for a tiny tankard of mulled wine (plus extra for tankard insurance in case I nicked it; there\u2019s the spirit of the Christmas market right there). This was during the bizarre period in the era of parenting your first baby when you don\u2019t know what the hell you are doing, end up doing what you think you should be doing and then spend the whole time thinking: \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d Well, my son responded to the sights, sounds, smells, lights, queues and endless wooden-arts-and-crafts stalls as if he were my daemon. He screamed. Tears poured from his eyes like fake snow from the tinsel-wrapped dome on George Street. He smashed his head off the back of his buggy over and over again. We left immediately. We have never been back.</p> <p>Children change everything, even more so when they have additional needs. So along with real life, Christmas was changed for good. And I was changed, too. The next year, I wasn\u2019t disappointed that my son wasn\u2019t harassing me for presents for weeks on end. I knew him, and us, better. There was less fear and more delight. I remember on the way home from nursery one December day, my son pointed at a small plastic fish in a charity-shop window. In the next window, I showed him a Christmas tree, and, in a phase when he was obsessed with defining things negatively, according to his own idiosyncratic system of what they were not, he replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not a fish!\u201d For at least two more years, every time we saw a Christmas tree one of us would say: \u201cIt\u2019s not a fish!\u201d and fall about laughing. I know, the levels of you-had-to-be-there are off the scale, but this is the way with autism. It\u2019s hard to explain, and highly specific. The point is, even with all the challenges \u2013 and there are many \u2013 if you just open the door of your mind to autism, the world is reborn. And it\u2019s incredible.</p> <p>Some years on, with an autism diagnosis, another child and a few more Decembers under our belt, Christmas has evolved. There are no visits to meet Santa in his grotto, no dragging the kids around the shops, no big pub lunches with friends and their children. Instead, there is walking in quiet, thickly frosted nature. Low-key visits with those who love and understand us. Differently tailored but fundamentally similar experiences for our autistic son and neurotypical daughter.</p> <p>On the day itself, while we eat Christmas dinner, our son will roam around, working his way through his usual fare of chicken dippers, cheese, apple slices, yoghurt and red fruit. The presents will be opened over many days in a kind of slow travel of present-giving and will be geared towards his special interests, not what we think he may or, worse, should like. One year, he was obsessed with traffic lights and asked for \u201cthe green man\u201d, which took some work. This year, latex gloves are a big thing and his face when opening a bumper box of them will be priceless. Every year, without fail, he asks for a <a href=\"https://bearnibbles.co.uk/our-products/yoyos\" title=\"\">Yoyo</a>, one of those 60p rolls crafted out of pressed fruit and middle-class aspiration, and it never disappoints. And every year, long after my son has moved on to the next obsession, I still pass a Christmas tree, think: \u201cIt\u2019s not a fish!\u201d and smile.</p>",

One Damascene moment came at the Edinburgh Christmas market, possibly as I was exchanging many pounds for a tiny tankard of mulled wine (plus extra for tankard insurance in case I nicked it; there\u2019s the spirit of the Christmas market right there). This was during the bizarre period in the era of parenting your first baby when you don\u2019t know what the hell you are doing, end up doing what you think you should be doing and then spend the whole time thinking: \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d Well, my son responded to the sights, sounds, smells, lights, queues and endless wooden-arts-and-crafts stalls as if he were my daemon. He screamed. Tears poured from his eyes like fake snow from the tinsel-wrapped dome on George Street. He smashed his head off the back of his buggy over and over again. We left immediately. We have never been back. Children change everything, even more so when they have additional needs. So along with real life, Christmas was changed for good. And I was changed, too. The next year, I wasn\u2019t disappointed that my son wasn\u2019t harassing me for presents for weeks on end. I knew him, and us, better. There was less fear and more delight. I remember on the way home from nursery one December day, my son pointed at a small plastic fish in a charity-shop window. In the next window, I showed him a Christmas tree, and, in a phase when he was obsessed with defining things negatively, according to his own idiosyncratic system of what they were not, he replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not a fish!\u201d For at least two more years, every time we saw a Christmas tree one of us would say: \u201cIt\u2019s not a fish!\u201d and fall about laughing. I know, the levels of you-had-to-be-there are off the scale, but this is the way with autism. It\u2019s hard to explain, and highly specific. The point is, even with all the challenges \u2013 and there are many \u2013 if you just open the door of your mind to autism, the world is reborn. And it\u2019s incredible. Some years on, with an autism diagnosis, another child and a few more Decembers under our belt, Christmas has evolved. There are no visits to meet Santa in his grotto, no dragging the kids around the shops, no big pub lunches with friends and their children. Instead, there is walking in quiet, thickly frosted nature. Low-key visits with those who love and understand us. Differently tailored but fundamentally similar experiences for our autistic son and neurotypical daughter. On the day itself, while we eat Christmas dinner, our son will roam around, working his way through his usual fare of chicken dippers, cheese, apple slices, yoghurt and red fruit. The presents will be opened over many days in a kind of slow travel of present-giving and will be geared towards his special interests, not what we think he may or, worse, should like. One year, he was obsessed with traffic lights and asked for \u201cthe green man\u201d, which took some work. This year, latex gloves are a big thing and his face when opening a bumper box of them will be priceless. Every year, without fail, he asks for a Yoyo, one of those 60p rolls crafted out of pressed fruit and middle-class aspiration, and it never disappoints. And every year, long after my son has moved on to the next obsession, I still pass a Christmas tree, think: \u201cIt\u2019s not a fish!\u201d and smile.",

      "bodyText": "London is expected to co-host the next stage of post-Brexit negotiations with Brussels in a symbolic shift marking the UK\u2019s position outside the EU after 31 January. The most likely location for the talks involving teams led by Michel Barnier for the EU and a yet-to-be-identified minister for the British government is the Cabinet Office in Whitehall. Brussels took centre stage over the past three years as the UK remained an EU member state. The EU\u2019s control over press conferences at the European commission\u2019s Berlaymont headquarters irritated the former Brexit secretary David Davis, who avoided visiting due to Barnier\u2019s tendency to monopolise media coverage. With the UK negotiating as a \u201cthird country\u201d, the rules are due to change. For 11 months after withdrawal on 31 January, the UK will stay in the EU\u2019s single market and customs union. But it will no longer be a member state and officials in Brussels expect the location of the talks to be split. The shift is expected to be confirmed in \u201ctalks about talks\u201d due between the UK and EU negotiators in February, sources said. A government spokesman said: \u201cThe political declaration makes clear that the UK and EU have to jointly agree the scheduling of talks. More details will be set out in due course.\u201d Negotiations on the future relationship are expected to start in earnest in early March. EU member states are due to adopt their negotiating position on issues such as trade in goods, fisheries, security and level playing field demands on 25 February after the publication of a draft paper in the first week of the month. A leaked diplomatic note seen by the Guardian said: \u201cThe mandate will contain no surprises and will be based on the political declaration. \u201cTopics such as fisheries or a level playing field will be discussed [internally] in January. These discussions will be based on slide presentations from the European commission instead of official drafts. That should give a sense of the sensitivities of member countries and make progress easier.\u201d There is no expectation that the 11-month transition period will be extended beyond the end of 2020. An EU official said: \u201cThe member states have been told it is not happening.\u201d But the June summit of EU leaders \u2013 without UK involvement \u2013 is expected to be a pivotal point in the negotiations and will signal whether hope remains of securing at least a \u201cbare bones\u201d deal on trade, fishing rights and security by the end of the year. On trade in goods, the EU\u2019s negotiating position is yet to be finalised, with seminars for diplomats organised from 8 January up to the end of the month. But the level playing field demands in the 2018 Irish protocol, which would have tied the UK to the EU\u2019s customs union, are seen as a baseline below which Brussels will not go. Theresa May had committed the UK to dynamically aligning with future EU changes to competition and state aid rules in the \u201cIrish backstop\u201d. The commitment on environmental protections and social and labour standards was to not lower them. Sources suggested the French government might seek to toughen the demands further during internal EU discussions in February. \u201cThe French said at the time that they negotiated the Irish backstop and its provisions in the name of peace, and that this would be different,\u201d said one EU source. \u201cThe aim in February will be to have everyone owning the strategy.\u201d An EU source said: \u201cThe issue is not whether the UK will seek to undercut the EU but whether they could, and therefore it holds us back in our own policymaking. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d Suggestions from Whitehall that the UK would accept tariffs on some goods as the price for diverging from EU standards have concerned officials in Brussels. \u201cIf we start talking about tariffs, there is no chance of a trade deal by the end of the year, as it becomes a very complicated discussion among the member states,\u201d one source said. A major strand of the talks is expected to be related to security issues. \u201cHow do we extradite someone, for example?\u201d asked one EU source. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the European arrest warrant, but we need something between that and nothing. It has to be there \u2013 it would be unforgivable if it was not. \u201cThere also needs to be agreement on sanctions. You can just coordinate, with the UK tagging on to EU decisions, but that makes sanctions less likely to be supported in the courts. You need a formal agreement.\u201d On fisheries, the political declaration obliges the EU and the UK to make \u201cbest endeavours\u201d to agree on future access to British waters by 1 July, but Brussels sources are sceptical as to whether such a deal can be struck in that time. \u201cWithout an agreement on fish, there will not be a deal \u2013 the price for a trade deal is the level playing field demands and fishing rights,\u201d said an EU source. \u201cBut in reality, we don\u2019t have to agree it by the summer, just the end of the year.\u201d Gerard van Balsfoort, the chair of the European Fisheries Alliance, a lobby group representing the fishing fleets of the member states most affected by Brexit, said there needed to be certainty each year on the allocation. \u201cOf course, if the UK is outside the EU, it will have their own fisheries policy and they will be an independent coastal state, and everything will not remain the same,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the real issue with fisheries is where can you fish, and how much.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rob-delaney\" title=\"\">Rob Delaney</a> was asked to suggest a list of people he might like to speak to for this issue, it was short. It said simply: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sally-wainwright\" title=\"\">Sally Wainwright</a>. Delaney, who grew up in Boston and moved to the UK five years ago, came to fame as a Twitter wit, after years as a standup comedian. Along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sharon-horgan\" title=\"\">Sharon Horgan</a>, he then created, wrote and starred in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/08/catastrophe-sharon-horgan-rob-delaney-season-four-review\" title=\"\">Catastrophe</a> for Channel 4, lauded as one of the best original comedies of the last decade. This year it ended, after four seasons.</p> <p>A former London bus driver, Wainwright has written and created some of the best dramas of the last two decades, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/happy-valley\" title=\"\">Happy Valley</a> and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/29/last-tango-in-halifax-homeland-review\" title=\"\"> Last Tango In Halifax</a>, to this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/08/gentleman-jack-is-a-true-tv-marvel-romantic-raw-and-totally-radical\" title=\"\">Gentleman Jack</a>. She has just been honoured with the <a href=\"https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/people/freedom-of-halifax-for-gentleman-jack-writer-sally-wainwright-1-10093973\" title=\"\">freedom of the borough of Calderdale</a>, the area in which she grew up, which means she is allowed to walk her sheep through Halifax (she does not keep sheep).</p> <p>Delaney and Wainwright meet on a dark, late\u2011November afternoon. Wainwright lives in Oxfordshire, but has been in London for meetings. Delaney has been swimming with his wife in a local lido. \u201cI do that to impress her, because she\u2019s a killer cold-water swimmer,\u201d he says. Listening to them talk is like sitting in on a screenwriting masterclass, but they want to talk about each other\u2019s lives, too. Three days earlier, Delaney had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/23/actor-rob-delaney-praises-nhs-as-pinnacle-of-human-achievement\" title=\"\">shared a video on</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/23/actor-rob-delaney-praises-nhs-as-pinnacle-of-human-achievement\" title=\"\"> Twitter</a> in praise of the NHS, relating his family\u2019s experience of the care they received when his son Henry was diagnosed with the brain tumour that eventually killed him. Already, the clip has been viewed many millions of times. \u201cIt\u2019s made me think I probably am going to vote Labour,\u201d Wainwright tells him. \u201cI am undecided, but that\u2019s the biggest thing that\u2019s made me think that\u2019s the way I\u2019m going to go.\u201d Delaney thanks her. \u201cI\u2019m a loudmouth who\u2019s on TV blathering on about all kinds of nonsense, but since I did have a mouthpiece, I wanted to say: we can afford to take care of people,\u201d he says.</p> <p><strong>Rob Delaney</strong> My wife and I have watched a lot of your programmes. Not all of them \u2013 you\u2019re married and you have children, and you know you can\u2019t watch all the television there is to watch. But we make Sally Wainwright television a priority. So thank you for agreeing to speak with me.</p> <p><strong>Sally Wainwright</strong> Thanks for asking me.</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> I thought this might make you laugh.

He could have had a tantrum, which is a fine thing to do in grief. It touched us deeply that he took some feelings he was having and turned them into something with some artistic skill and care, and shared it with us.

But what was also fun was weaving some laughs out of that and putting some funny stuff in there.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> How do you and Sharon work together? Do you sit together and work it all out, or do you go away and do it separately? Do you improvise?</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> We will talk, then transcribe, then read out loud, because our fear is that we might sound like a television show, where you watch and you\u2019re like, well, that\u2019s clever. That\u2019s a creative sin. You have to sound like human speech. So we vastly prefer to be in the same room, so we can sound off each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a3f77b5b365689972e5c414b1a56277a85cac78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3f77b5b365689972e5c414b1a56277a85cac78/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor, comedian and writer Rob Delaney with TV writer, producer and director Sally Wainwright\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>SW</strong> Do you ever argue, or disagree about how a line will work, or what the funny bit actually is, as opposed to the bit that makes it not funny?</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> Yes. And that\u2019s fine. Because we both knew the other one had the show\u2019s best interests at heart, so there was no wrong decision. If someone felt really passionate about it, then the other person would yield or, since the disagreements were not too frequent, shoot both and let somebody else decide.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> And because you call yourselves Rob and Sharon as characters\u2026</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> [Laughs] That was a mistake.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> Was it? The reason it feels so real is because you think, oh, that\u2019s what they\u2019re really like, and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve used their names.</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> We just did that as placeholders when we were writing because we couldn\u2019t think of any names. Then the network said, we\u2019d prefer you kept it as Rob and Sharon. We were happy to let them have little decisions like that. Sometimes you hear writers complain about notes, and the fact is that some notes are good. We were going to leap right to them being married by the end of the first episode. And I remember Channel 4 saying, what if you showed us getting to know them? That wound up being the whole first series.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> It\u2019s such a simple idea, I think that\u2019s why it works so well. I\u2019m shit with notes, I hate them. My first draft is always my last draft, as far as I\u2019m concerned. [Laughs] No, occasionally you get a good note. It\u2019s good to know when to listen and it\u2019s good to know when to fight back.</p> <p><strong>RD </strong>Of course. I imagine you\u2019re pretty good at that by this point.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> I am. [Laughs]</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> Would you be able to drive a Routemaster bus right now? Is that the one you drove?</p> <p><strong>SW </strong>It\u2019s been a while. I might need to practise a bit. They\u2019re quite tough to drive, the old Routemasters \u2013 not like they are now. There\u2019s power assist and stuff. The old Routemasters, you used to have to stand up in your seat to pull them around a corner. I often see a bus and think, could I still do that?</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> I used to drive a water taxi in Boston, where I grew up. We were closer to a big harbour than either Boston or Gloucester, Massachusetts, where the two coastguard outposts were, so we could often respond to emergencies faster than they could. We would go out in storms and help save people, and stabilise them until the coastguard got there. Honestly, with all the horrible jobs I\u2019ve had, in between that one that I loved, and this one that I love, it\u2019s the only one I still daydream about.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> I have recurring nightmares about being a bus driver. It\u2019s more about being off route and not knowing how to get back on route. If I\u2019ve got stress going on in my life, my brain goes off route.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With standup there's nothing to hide behind. You're telling somebody your dirtiest, rottenest, most perverse secrets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>RD</strong> Could you tell me about your writing day?</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> It evolves all the time. I get up at 4am most days. I think that\u2019s because I concentrate best then. By 9 o\u2019clock, in an ideal world, I\u2019ve done five hours\u2019 work, but that doesn\u2019t always happen. I\u2019m going through a patch at the moment where I really can\u2019t concentrate, which is bad. So I\u2019m trying to write one episode a month [of the second series of Gentleman Jack]. It\u2019s just the nature of it, there\u2019s so much research involved. It\u2019s not like Happy Valley, where I\u2019m just making it all up, or Last Tango. There\u2019s a ridiculous amount of reading involved. You know we get paid silly money in this industry, and it\u2019s the first job I\u2019ve done where I actually feel like I\u2019m earning it. It\u2019s tough, but I love it. I feel so lucky that I\u2019m the person who got hold of this story.</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> Well, you are, and so are we. I did a Makaton bedtime story. It\u2019s not quite a language, but it\u2019s a communication technology for kids and adults with certain disabilities, and we used it with my son Henry. He had a tracheotomy, and when you\u2019re that young, if you have a tracheotomy, you can\u2019t speak, so he had to learn Makaton from a young age.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> I\u2019ve not heard of that before.</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> I was asked to do a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWLB8ZPLF4\" title=\"\">CBeebies bedtime story</a> and I said I\u2019d like to do it in Makaton. It was so great to do Makaton with Henry, and now we\u2019re doing it with our new baby, who\u2019s 15 months and a wild animal. Our wildest yet. Oh God, such a tornado.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> Can you tell jokes in Makaton?</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> Have I tried to be funny in Makaton? No, I haven\u2019t. Will I tonight with my son? Yes.</p> <p>So you started directing with Happy Valley. You seem to have taken to it. There\u2019s no looking back?</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to. It just takes so much time. It\u2019s balancing that desire to direct with reducing the amount of output, which is difficult. I really want to get back to Happy Valley. I\u2019ve got to take a back seat with directing, I think, but I\u2019m not quite reconciled to that yet. It\u2019s tricky. Are you directed when you do standup, or do you work it all out yourself?</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> That\u2019s the great thing about standup \u2013 you\u2019re the writer, director, producer, stage manager, the whole thing, so that\u2019s quite liberating.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> I always admire standup comedians. I\u2019d love to write about one. It\u2019s such an unusual thing to do; it\u2019s so exposing. I don\u2019t think writing drama is exposing, because nobody knows who I am. Nobody knows what I look like.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41de07ffa0100144c1115449d78428b62bf63964\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41de07ffa0100144c1115449d78428b62bf63964/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor, comedian and writer Rob Delaney with TV writer, producer and director Sally Wainwright\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>RD</strong> Some of the sex murders in the second season of Happy Valley are clearly some of the things you\u2019ve either witnessed or done.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> [Laughs] It\u2019s interesting how many people have said to me, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019ve got a sick mind.\u201d I don\u2019t think I have. I can hide behind the fact that it\u2019s just fantasy. With the standup, there\u2019s nothing to hide behind. That\u2019s what I find awesome. You\u2019re performing this stuff that is presumably actually about you. Even if it isn\u2019t, if it works, it should feel like it. It\u2019s like you\u2019re telling somebody your dirtiest, rottenest, most perverse secrets. Then if they don\u2019t respond, which clearly they do to you\u2026</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> It\u2019s crushing. It\u2019s a weird thing. There\u2019s got to be some sort of kink in your head that makes you want to do it. So many things are daring. A lot of people look at what we do and think that it\u2019s very risky. Which it is. The success rate is low. We don\u2019t usually think that way, because it\u2019s what we want to do. Yet I do flip out whenever I see a new restaurant open on a high street. I\u2019m like, do they have any idea how hard it is? I get really nervous for them. So I\u2019m still human about other people\u2019s risks, but for me I\u2019m like, yeah, screw it, take that risk.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> How old were you when you started doing standup?</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> When I started doing it all the time, I was 27. So a little later than some folks. At 27, it was now or never. Coming into the public eye, I\u2019m glad for myself that that happened after I was married. I mean, no one knew who I was until I was married, two kids, sober for many years. I wouldn\u2019t want to be bouncing around the entertainment world with any drink or drug problem. It\u2019s nice to know who you are before other people, who aren\u2019t your intimates, begin to think they know who you are.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a question I have: is there any stuff out there that you\u2019d like to write in the style of?</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> I think I do it all the time, consciously and subconsciously, if I see a good show on telly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/nurse-jackie\" title=\"\">Nurse Jackie</a> had a massive effect on me. I think I wrote Happy Valley because I wanted to write my own Nurse Jackie.</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> I think young writers should pay attention to that. To admire, or allow yourself to be influenced, is so absolutely artistically valid. OK, thus ends the lesson.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> Have you got other TV shows that you\u2019re developing?</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> I\u2019m writing a pilot right now, and I won\u2019t say anything about it. Sorry. [Laughs] But I\u2019m having fun. I\u2019m just about to dive into the first draft.</p> <p><strong>SW</strong> Is it a comedy? Or are you not allowed to say?</p> <p><strong>RD</strong> It\u2019s funny, but is it a comedy? I don\u2019t know if it is. But is there funny in it? Yeah.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Rob Delaney was asked to suggest a list of people he might like to speak to for this issue, it was short. It said simply: Sally Wainwright. Delaney, who grew up in Boston and moved to the UK five years ago, came to fame as a Twitter wit, after years as a standup comedian. Along with Sharon Horgan, he then created, wrote and starred in Catastrophe for Channel 4, lauded as one of the best original comedies of the last decade. This year it ended, after four seasons. A former London bus driver, Wainwright has written and created some of the best dramas of the last two decades, from Happy Valley and Last Tango In Halifax, to this year\u2019s Gentleman Jack. She has just been honoured with the freedom of the borough of Calderdale, the area in which she grew up, which means she is allowed to walk her sheep through Halifax (she does not keep sheep). Delaney and Wainwright meet on a dark, late\u2011November afternoon. Wainwright lives in Oxfordshire, but has been in London for meetings. Delaney has been swimming with his wife in a local lido. \u201cI do that to impress her, because she\u2019s a killer cold-water swimmer,\u201d he says. Listening to them talk is like sitting in on a screenwriting masterclass, but they want to talk about each other\u2019s lives, too. Three days earlier, Delaney had shared a video on Twitter in praise of the NHS, relating his family\u2019s experience of the care they received when his son Henry was diagnosed with the brain tumour that eventually killed him. Already, the clip has been viewed many millions of times. \u201cIt\u2019s made me think I probably am going to vote Labour,\u201d Wainwright tells him. \u201cI am undecided, but that\u2019s the biggest thing that\u2019s made me think that\u2019s the way I\u2019m going to go.\u201d Delaney thanks her. \u201cI\u2019m a loudmouth who\u2019s on TV blathering on about all kinds of nonsense, but since I did have a mouthpiece, I wanted to say: we can afford to take care of people,\u201d he says. Rob Delaney My wife and I have watched a lot of your programmes. Not all of them \u2013 you\u2019re married and you have children, and you know you can\u2019t watch all the television there is to watch. But we make Sally Wainwright television a priority. So thank you for agreeing to speak with me. Sally Wainwright Thanks for asking me. RD I thought this might make you laugh. We\u2019d watched Gentleman Jack, Happy Valley and To Walk Invisible, and then we were moving on to Last Tango In Halifax and, by mistake, we watched one of the Christmas specials first. SW [Laughs] That would be a mistake, on many levels. RD I was thinking, this is so bold of her, to assume in the pilot episode that we can follow all these threads, but by God, it is possible.

RD We will talk, then transcribe, then read out loud, because our fear is that we might sound like a television show, where you watch and you\u2019re like, well, that\u2019s clever. That\u2019s a creative sin. You have to sound like human speech. So we vastly prefer to be in the same room, so we can sound off each other. SW Do you ever argue, or disagree about how a line will work, or what the funny bit actually is, as opposed to the bit that makes it not funny? RD Yes. And that\u2019s fine. Because we both knew the other one had the show\u2019s best interests at heart, so there was no wrong decision. If someone felt really passionate about it, then the other person would yield or, since the disagreements were not too frequent, shoot both and let somebody else decide. SW And because you call yourselves Rob and Sharon as characters\u2026 RD [Laughs] That was a mistake. SW Was it? The reason it feels so real is because you think, oh, that\u2019s what they\u2019re really like, and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve used their names. RD We just did that as placeholders when we were writing because we couldn\u2019t think of any names. Then the network said, we\u2019d prefer you kept it as Rob and Sharon. We were happy to let them have little decisions like that. Sometimes you hear writers complain about notes, and the fact is that some notes are good. We were going to leap right to them being married by the end of the first episode. And I remember Channel 4 saying, what if you showed us getting to know them? That wound up being the whole first series. SW It\u2019s such a simple idea, I think that\u2019s why it works so well. I\u2019m shit with notes, I hate them. My first draft is always my last draft, as far as I\u2019m concerned. [Laughs] No, occasionally you get a good note. It\u2019s good to know when to listen and it\u2019s good to know when to fight back. RD Of course. I imagine you\u2019re pretty good at that by this point. SW I am. [Laughs] RD Would you be able to drive a Routemaster bus right now? Is that the one you drove? SW It\u2019s been a while. I might need to practise a bit. They\u2019re quite tough to drive, the old Routemasters \u2013 not like they are now. There\u2019s power assist and stuff. The old Routemasters, you used to have to stand up in your seat to pull them around a corner. I often see a bus and think, could I still do that? RD I used to drive a water taxi in Boston, where I grew up. We were closer to a big harbour than either Boston or Gloucester, Massachusetts, where the two coastguard outposts were, so we could often respond to emergencies faster than they could. We would go out in storms and help save people, and stabilise them until the coastguard got there. Honestly, with all the horrible jobs I\u2019ve had, in between that one that I loved, and this one that I love, it\u2019s the only one I still daydream about. SW I have recurring nightmares about being a bus driver. It\u2019s more about being off route and not knowing how to get back on route. If I\u2019ve got stress going on in my life, my brain goes off route. RD Could you tell me about your writing day? SW It evolves all the time. I get up at 4am most days. I think that\u2019s because I concentrate best then. By 9 o\u2019clock, in an ideal world, I\u2019ve done five hours\u2019 work, but that doesn\u2019t always happen. I\u2019m going through a patch at the moment where I really can\u2019t concentrate, which is bad. So I\u2019m trying to write one episode a month [of the second series of Gentleman Jack]. It\u2019s just the nature of it, there\u2019s so much research involved. It\u2019s not like Happy Valley, where I\u2019m just making it all up, or Last Tango. There\u2019s a ridiculous amount of reading involved. You know we get paid silly money in this industry, and it\u2019s the first job I\u2019ve done where I actually feel like I\u2019m earning it. It\u2019s tough, but I love it. I feel so lucky that I\u2019m the person who got hold of this story. RD Well, you are, and so are we. I did a Makaton bedtime story. It\u2019s not quite a language, but it\u2019s a communication technology for kids and adults with certain disabilities, and we used it with my son Henry. He had a tracheotomy, and when you\u2019re that young, if you have a tracheotomy, you can\u2019t speak, so he had to learn Makaton from a young age. SW I\u2019ve not heard of that before. RD I was asked to do a CBeebies bedtime story and I said I\u2019d like to do it in Makaton. It was so great to do Makaton with Henry, and now we\u2019re doing it with our new baby, who\u2019s 15 months and a wild animal. Our wildest yet. Oh God, such a tornado. SW Can you tell jokes in Makaton? RD Have I tried to be funny in Makaton? No, I haven\u2019t. Will I tonight with my son? Yes. So you started directing with Happy Valley. You seem to have taken to it. There\u2019s no looking back? SW I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to. It just takes so much time. It\u2019s balancing that desire to direct with reducing the amount of output, which is difficult. I really want to get back to Happy Valley. I\u2019ve got to take a back seat with directing, I think, but I\u2019m not quite reconciled to that yet. It\u2019s tricky. Are you directed when you do standup, or do you work it all out yourself? RD That\u2019s the great thing about standup \u2013 you\u2019re the writer, director, producer, stage manager, the whole thing, so that\u2019s quite liberating. SW I always admire standup comedians. I\u2019d love to write about one. It\u2019s such an unusual thing to do; it\u2019s so exposing. I don\u2019t think writing drama is exposing, because nobody knows who I am. Nobody knows what I look like. RD Some of the sex murders in the second season of Happy Valley are clearly some of the things you\u2019ve either witnessed or done. SW [Laughs] It\u2019s interesting how many people have said to me, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019ve got a sick mind.\u201d I don\u2019t think I have. I can hide behind the fact that it\u2019s just fantasy. With the standup, there\u2019s nothing to hide behind. That\u2019s what I find awesome. You\u2019re performing this stuff that is presumably actually about you. Even if it isn\u2019t, if it works, it should feel like it. It\u2019s like you\u2019re telling somebody your dirtiest, rottenest, most perverse secrets. Then if they don\u2019t respond, which clearly they do to you\u2026 RD It\u2019s crushing. It\u2019s a weird thing. There\u2019s got to be some sort of kink in your head that makes you want to do it. So many things are daring. A lot of people look at what we do and think that it\u2019s very risky. Which it is. The success rate is low. We don\u2019t usually think that way, because it\u2019s what we want to do. Yet I do flip out whenever I see a new restaurant open on a high street. I\u2019m like, do they have any idea how hard it is? I get really nervous for them. So I\u2019m still human about other people\u2019s risks, but for me I\u2019m like, yeah, screw it, take that risk. SW How old were you when you started doing standup? RD When I started doing it all the time, I was 27. So a little later than some folks. At 27, it was now or never. Coming into the public eye, I\u2019m glad for myself that that happened after I was married. I mean, no one knew who I was until I was married, two kids, sober for many years. I wouldn\u2019t want to be bouncing around the entertainment world with any drink or drug problem. It\u2019s nice to know who you are before other people, who aren\u2019t your intimates, begin to think they know who you are. Here\u2019s a question I have: is there any stuff out there that you\u2019d like to write in the style of? SW I think I do it all the time, consciously and subconsciously, if I see a good show on telly. Nurse Jackie had a massive effect on me. I think I wrote Happy Valley because I wanted to write my own Nurse Jackie. RD I think young writers should pay attention to that. To admire, or allow yourself to be influenced, is so absolutely artistically valid. OK, thus ends the lesson. SW Have you got other TV shows that you\u2019re developing? RD I\u2019m writing a pilot right now, and I won\u2019t say anything about it. Sorry. [Laughs] But I\u2019m having fun. I\u2019m just about to dive into the first draft. SW Is it a comedy? Or are you not allowed to say? RD It\u2019s funny, but is it a comedy? I don\u2019t know if it is. But is there funny in it? Yeah. \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Once the disbelief lifted, he went to the Middle East with his clients, and met a friend of the king\u2019s on the return flight to New York, during which an opportunity to advise on a digital strategy for Jordan presented itself. \u201cThe goal was to bridge the digital communities of Amman and Los Angeles,\u201d he says.</p> <p>A consulting contract was agreed and Angelson, whose background also included digital technology, was enlisted.

Fox and Angelson then headed off to Jordan and the newly opened Azraq refugee camp. Conditions were bleak - there was no electricity and little water for the estimated 10,000 inhabitants. The mood, however, was quickly lifted. One by one, children of all ages queued up to receive the jerseys and greeted Fox and Angelson with warm hugs and handshakes. \u201cEric and I were so moved,\u201d says Fox.</p> <p>This, however, was just the start. The contract to build a digital bridge between the US and Jordan was canceled, as Isis\u2019s brutal stranglehold on the region grew. But the football connection was forged and the pair wanted to do more to help the refugees they had met.</p> <p>That opportunity quickly repeated itself, thanks to a chance meeting at a conference in Los Angeles run by <a href=\"https://jusoorsyria.com/\">Jusoor</a>, an organization that helps Syrian youth with education. \u201cOur strategy was simple; talk to everyone,\u201d says Fox. \u201cWe explained to some of the attendees we had just been to Azraq to distribute jerseys and were now trying to figure out a way to send some more. This man looked at us and said, \u2018I\u2019ll ship them for you - for free.\u2019 I was blown away.\u201d</p> <p>The man was Fadi Ghandour, who founded Aramex, one of the biggest shipping companies in the Middle East and North Africa. To date, 15,000 shirts have been sent.</p> <p>Fox and Angelson\u2019s knack for connecting with the right people continued. When they were in Jordan, via the Royal Film Commission, Fox and Angelson were introduced to the king\u2019s brother - Prince Ali bin al Hussein, who headed the Jordan Soccer Federation and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/15/prince-ali-bin-al-hussain-fifa-presidency-sepp-blatter\">also ran for Fifa presidency in 2015</a>. Prince Ali\u2019s offer to waive customs charges for any shipments was a massive moment for Fox, who was funding JerseyEX out of his own pocket. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done this without him and Fadi,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Fox then met Richard Walden, founder of <a href=\"http://www.opusa.org/\">Operation USA</a>, which collects items to be offered in disaster zones. Hollywood legend Julie Andrews is a spokesperson for them \u2013 and they, by sheer chance, had thousands of extra jerseys in a warehouse. Fox took them all. The next development came through another unlikely source.</p> <p>\u201cI got a call from [humanitarian organization] <a href=\"https://www.worldvision.org/\">World Vision</a> asking to donate 400 jerseys to reward children for a hygiene-education program in partnership with Sesame Street,\u201d says Fox. \u201cI said yes, but then we never heard back, so I said \u2018I\u2019ll do it myself.\u2019 Then, I had an epiphany \u2013 if jerseys can give children a moment of joy, then football can be used to motivate these kids to change their lives and take control of their future.\u201d</p> <p>Fox was inspired but desperate for celebrity endorsement to fast-track his efforts through a video campaign. Luckily, Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United were in LA during the summer of 2018.</p> <p>\u201cDortmund were training [at the University of California, Los Angeles], but the session was closed,\u201d recalls Fox. \u201cThen, I saw [former NBA star] Steve Nash whom I had represented for his first Nike contract 20 or so years ago. He was with Christian Pulisic, and when I shouted my name to him, he couldn\u2019t believe it. He got me over the barrier and I managed to shoot a video with Christian.\u201d</p> <p>The theme of the seven-second video - and subsequent clips created with Manchester United duo Scott McTominay and Axel Tuanzebe - was simple: players pointed out the importance of washing hands before eating. More videos were filmed in Jordan by Widad Shafakoj, a brilliant director found in Amman, featuring their women\u2019s World Cup team. That led to a partnership with USA for UNHCR and that, says Fox, \u201cgave me some serious credibility.\u201d</p> <p>The next logical step was to get soap to the refugees. A deal was struck to buy soap from the Zarqa Life Center, a community safe haven for women and children affected by war, who make and sell the product to support themselves. A second contract was agreed with soap makers at Za\u2019atari refugee camp. A further donation came from Trinitae, a high-end Jordanian soap company. During their last trip in August, Fox and Angelson distributed over 2,000 bars in Za\u2019atari and Azraq. Fox even created a catchy football chant that the refugee children in Azraq sang on the pitch.</p> <p>So what does the future hold? The dream is to work with clubs and players to create football-centric media with life-affirming messages. Fox also wants to partner with a soap company to generate revenue to continue to support UNHCR and help his program. For every bar sold, another bar is donated to a refugee family.</p> <p>\u201cThe true potential of the sport is found not on the pitch, but in the lives of millions of children who watch it and play it every day,\u201d concludes Fox. \u201cThe beautiful game can produce some beautiful messaging, even if it\u2019s only seven seconds long.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s always good to step back from the situation to refrain from focusing on the negatives and remember the business strategy and the reason why decisions are made. Empathise with internal decision makers: this can be challenging when working across multiple teams, but it\u2019s helpful to chat with decision makers as often as you can. Some of the most important conversations and brainstorming moments can flow from having an unexpected chat with someone on the staircase, rather than a booked workshop session or meeting. Be pragmatic: there are times when we make space for big thinking and ideation, but sometimes we need to meet tight deadlines to support the business strategy. When our cross-functional teams need to deliver products under pressure, we need to support them. Embracing the constraints and being realistic about what we can and cannot do can make the design process complex, but really exciting. Conclusion The Guardian is a great place to work as a UX-er, we have access to a lab full of amazing technology and a good level of autonomy to do our work and experiment with new design and research methods. We have supportive colleagues and teams of enthusiastic people who truly want to make a difference in the lives of our readers.",

A question I wanted to put to you: would you consider, would the government consider the purchase of some more of these Canadian heavy water-bombing planes? </p> <p>I\u2019m imagining if we could get, I don\u2019t know, three or four, I know they\u2019re expensive, and put them in a place like Edinburgh. They could service us and NSW and Victoria. Is that sort of something you would consider?</p> <p><strong>Prime minister: </strong>Well, we take our advice from the fire chiefs about how we put together the aerial firefighting fleet. There are 144 aircraft that are part of that, that are being deployed all around the country. And they make decisions and make recommendations about whether things should be leased and purchased and all of that. </p> <p>So we\u2019re always open to all the advice and recommendations they make. In fact, we just put an extra <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/12/bushfires-coalition-responds-to-calls-for-more-water-bombers-with-11m-aerial-firefighting-boost\">$11m into that fleet</a> just recently and that comes to the top of the $15m that we put in together with the other states and territories. So we\u2019re very open to all the recommendations and have moved very quickly, I think, to act on those when they\u2019re made. So that\u2019s really the answer. </p> <p>I mean, if they think that\u2019s the way to handle it then I\u2019m sure that they will recommend that. But they look at these things very carefully and, you know, the costs and how they can best apply the resources to get the most out there and up in the air and used in their firefighting efforts.</p> <p><strong>Pilkington</strong><strong>: </strong>We\u2019re talking to prime minister Scott Morrison here in Adelaide on the way up to Lobethal, to the Adelaide Hills. Prime minister, what about the suggestion that premier Marshall made, that perhaps there could be a discount available for volunteer firefighters not having to pay a service levy? And would the federal government look at some sort of recompense to the volunteer firefighters?</p> <p><strong>Prime minister: </strong>Well, the Country Firefighting Association and others have been pretty clear about these sort of things. I mean, oftentimes when you talk to those directly involved here, they typically want and ask, you know, things like additional facilities in their state and things like this. So it really is about how you set the priorities of where you put things. </p> <p>And, look, after these fires, like there is after every fire, there is a full review and in March, when the premiers meet, we\u2019ll be looking at a whole range of recommendations that even now are being prepared and have been prepared since the ministers were meeting some weeks ago. There is a very big nationally coordinated effort that goes into all of this. It happens 365 days a year, not just when fires are burning. And Emergency Management Australia, headed up by Rob Cameron and the home affairs department, they do this all the time, working very closely with the state and territories who are responsible for the operations and the fire services and the SESs and all of these which deploy in these circumstances. So we\u2019re always open to ways that things can be done better. </p> <p>But I can assure everyone in South Australia, as I can all around the country, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/23/relief-and-anger-in-balmoral-the-bushfire-village-that-ran-out-of-water\">this is the best-resourced</a>, best-coordinated fire response of anywhere in the world.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-24T02:36:12.424Z\">at 2.36am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e0172288f08c3972263fcc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-24T02:15:05.793Z\">2.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BOM_au/status/1209279314065313794\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What will the weather bring you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChristmasDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ChristmasDay</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoxingDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BoxingDay</a> ?

Like much of the area affected by the Green Wattle Creek fire, it\u2019s in Taylor\u2019s electorate of Hume.</p> <p>The Mercury reported that Gupta would donate $250,000 to the local community at the reopening today. </p> <p>But environmental groups have criticised Taylor for attending the reopening of a coalmine while his electorate was battling unprecedented bushfires.</p> <p>Here\u2019s <strong>Andrew Bray</strong>, national director of the Australian Wind Alliance:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is deeply ironic that while renewable energy is the only part of the economy delivering sustained emissions reductions, the minister for emissions reduction has chosen to double down on coal, the primary driver of emissions increases. At a time when homes and lives have been lost to the devastating climate-fuelled bushfires in his own backyard, this stunt comes across as some kind of sick joke.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bray said Taylor had not attended the opening of any of the three windfarms that began operation in his electorate since he became an MP. There are six windfarms in Hume employing 62 people, Bray said, and windfarm construction will create 420 jobs over the next two years. Simec Coal Tahmoor employs 400 people. </p> <p><strong>Jamie Hanson</strong>, the head of campaigns for Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said Taylor was \u201cmisreading\u201d the public mood.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Morrison government\u2019s misreading of the mood remains astonishing. We are living through national trauma \u2013 and their response was first a jaunt to Hawaii, and now the weird sight of Angus Taylor reopening a coalmine in the literal midst of this climate emergency. </p> </blockquote> <p>He continued:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Good firefighting and luck ensured that the community dodged a bullet with Tahmoor \u2013 if it had burned, the Picton and Campbelltown areas may have been polluted with the toxic pollution for weeks from burning coal, including carbon monoxide, toxic fine particles and mercury. </p> </blockquote> <p>Unlike the Hazelwood coalmine which caught alight in bushfires in Victoria in 2014, Tahmoor is an underground mine. That doesn\u2019t mean it was not at risk of catching fire, but the risk is not the same. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-24T00:54:38.122Z\">at 12.54am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e014a8b8f085eda5c10d13e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-23T23:20:42.955Z\">11.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I hope Dean and his small furry friend are doing well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Em___/status/1208990117852893190\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My cousin Dean has been a firefighter for over 17 years.

He says compensating volunteer firefighters is a \u201ccommonsense\u201d issue. </p> <p>He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve spoken to the volunteer firefighters and there is not one of them that I have spoken to who hasn\u2019t said that some form of compensation is required. Not one.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Rural Fire Service commissioner, <strong>Shane Fitzimmons</strong>, has reportedly ruled out compensation for volunteer firefighters. Albanese said he had \u201cno criticism of the extraordinary job\u201d that Fitzimmons does, but that compensating volunteer firefighters was \u201ccommon sense\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If someone has not had an income for a period of months because they have been fighting fires \u2013 and we met someone in Bilpin who had been fighting fires since September, every day \u2013 people who don\u2019t have an income for a period of three months, it is unsustainable. Common sense tells you that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Albanese said he wasn\u2019t proposing a particular model for that compensation. It could be federal compensation like that provided to army reservists, or one-off payments, or compensation for those who have to close small businesses. \u201cI\u2019m trying to give the government some flexibility,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But he said the bushfire crisis was not \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and may require an extraordinary response.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The people I\u2019ve spoken to who have decades of experience are saying that they\u2019ve never seen anything like this.

That would be a very difficult thing to do.</p> </blockquote> <p>Elliot says volunteer firefighters are motivated by protecting their community above all else \u2014 which is true. The debate about compensation is, I think, whether it is reasonable to continue to ask volunteers to sacrifice so much \u2014 weeks of their time, weeks of their income, potentially their lives \u2014 while bushfire conditions worsen each year under global heating. </p> <p>At the moment the public discussion about how best to support volunteer firefighters is being conducted largely in the absence of the firefighters themselves, who are busy actively fighting fires. The question of what volunteer firefighters want and need is probably best answered by the volunteer brigade members themselves, don\u2019t you think?</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-23T22:09:49.180Z\">at 10.09pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e01350f8f085eda5c10d108\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-23T21:47:38.115Z\">9.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> is in South Australia today and will be visiting communities affected by the catastrophic bushfires there, which burned through 47,000 hectares and destroyed 87 houses. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-23T22:08:30.725Z\">at 10.08pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e01326a8f08c3972263fba6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-23T21:43:00.019Z\">9.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our photographer-at-large <strong>Mike Bowers </strong>was in Balmoral yesterday and captured some of the devastation in the town that was among the worst hit by the Green Wattle Creek fire in the southern highlands. </p> <p>Reporters <strong>Michael McGowan</strong> and <strong>Helen Davidson</strong> have been in Balmoral over the past few days.

      "bodyText": "And with that, we will leave you for today. Our thoughts are with everyone who is being affected by this unfolding tragedy. Thank you for following along today, we hope it was useful and informative. Wishing you all a happy and safe Christmas. Let\u2019s go over what happened today. The NSW RFS confirmed 873 homes and 2048 outbuildings were destroyed and 353 were damaged since Thursday. Another 100 homes are believed to be lost, but the RFS is yet to finalise assessments. The Morrison government announced that public servants taking leave to fight fires would be given four weeks\u2019 paid leave. A total of 86 fires were still burning through NSW as conditions improved, but crews are preparing for dangerous weather later this week. And it was confirmed that the total area burned in bushfires across Australia since spring is 5m hectares. Scott Morrison has certainly been out and about since he arrived back from his much-maligned holiday in Hawaii. He has since apologised for the trip and, as promised, hit the ground running. A count of the media alerts blasted out from the PM\u2019s office suggests he\u2019s done at least 13 official visits \u2013 across NSW and SA \u2013 since his first at 8am on Sunday to the NSW RFS headquarters. In NSW, the PM has also visited the evacuation centre at Mudgee and Picton and local RFS teams at Cudgegon and Ilford. In South Australia, Morrison met fire crews at Mt Barker and Woodside, where he also visited fire-damaged properties. Still, one firefighter interviewed by Channel Seven was not satisfied by the PM\u2019s visit. A final thought: while the PM was away, his deputy, Michael McCormack, was asked by the media why he had mostly remained in Wagga Wagga. He replied: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get in the way of these professional people doing their job. I\u2019m doing what I can from where I am ... I\u2019ve already been there this week.\u201d Clearly his boss now disagrees. Let\u2019s take a look at the top temperatures from each state and territory today. I\u2019ve taken these figures from the Bureau of Meteorology. Remember that WA is three hours behind the east coast. New South Wales: 42.9C at Smithville Victoria: 37.3C at Yarrawonga Queensland: 49.3 at Birdsville Western Australia: 47.2C at Telfer South Australia: 48C at Oodnadatta Tasmania: 25.7C at Scotts Peak Northern Territory: 47.1C at Jervois and Yulara. ACT: 29.2C at Tuggeranong The scale of the destruction left by the Cudlee Creek fires in the Adelaide Hills has come into greater focus as the tally for the number of livestock killed in the blaze was released this afternoon. The Department of Primary Industries and Regions SA (Pirsa) is currently taking stock of the damage in the wake of the fire, which consumed 25,000ha in a rich agricultural region that contains a third of the region\u2019s wine industry. While no firm figures are available on the loss to the wine industry, early surveys of the 537 properties within the area registered as having livestock present put the number of animals killed in the blaze at 2,700 as of this afternoon. This includes 2635 sheep, 139 cattle, 15 chicken and a horse. In a statement, the state controller for agricultural and animal services (Savem), Mehdi Doroudi, said that number was expected to rise as the initial assessments were finalised. Livestock owners who need an urgent assessment of lost livestock can contact the department through its hotline on 1800 255 556. Bushfire-related advice for caring for stock can be found on Pirsa\u2019s website. For help with injured or stray wildlife or companion animals, people are urged to get in touch with Savem on 8297 2299. This season\u2019s devastating bushfires have not stopped volunteer firefighters in Avoca Beach continuing their Christmas Eve tradition of bringing Santa to the streets of the suburb on the NSW central coast, throwing lollies to kids as they go. The crews have just returned from fighting the fire in Mount Victoria, in the Blue Mountains, and before that the Three Mile blaze, which became part of the megafire north of Sydney. They have also been collecting donations for the families of the two firefighters \u2013 Geoffrey Keaton and Andrew O\u2019Dwyer \u2013 who died in Buxton last week. The Bom says there will be extreme heatwave conditions for much of the country, starting from Saturday. This is a touching piece by Jessica Friedmann about how Braidwood, a town along the Kings Highway, has been impacted by the fires. Once nicknamed \u201cDeadwood\u201d, the town has been rejuvenated in recent years. Now, the closure of the highway has starved businesses of the passing trade they rely on. Anthony Albanese has issued this statement in response to the government\u2019s announcement that volunteer firefighters who work in the public service will get paid leave. Labor welcomes Scott Morrison\u2019s decision to provide additional support for volunteer firefighters on the frontline \u2013 something he has repeatedly claimed is unnecessary. It\u2019s good that federal public servants will receive the same conditions currently enjoyed by army reservists, but many volunteer firefighters will not be assisted by this decision. Many private-sector workers, self-employed workers, contractors and family business owners have been fighting fires, not just for days or weeks but for months. These firefighters have to pay bills and put food on the table for their families. No firefighter should have to choose between continuing to serve their community with courage and distinction and being able to provide the essentials of life. There is a precedent for providing support for volunteer firefighters. The Keating Government did it in 1994. Firefighters deserve our respect. They also deserve our support. This issue was urgent when Labor called on the prime minister to act in mid-November. With fires raging across the country, it is now more urgent than ever. Mr Morrison has consistently underestimated the scale of this year\u2019s bushfire crisis and has repeatedly asserted that resources are adequate. He has refused to bring forward a meeting of state and territory leaders. He has also refused to review his government\u2019s inadequate climate policies. Clearly there is more to be done and we urge the prime minister to investigate all options as this national crisis deepens with more dangerous weeks ahead. Let\u2019s hope this continues and extends out to where it\u2019s most needed, although authorities have said they aren\u2019t expecting the level of rainfall needed. Here\u2019s an interesting story from Yahoo Finance, which reports a surge in interest from Australians wanting to become volunteer firefighters. A NSW RFS spokesperson told Yahoo Finance: \u201cWe have seen a significant increase in the number of people enquiring about how to join the NSW RFS on our website. \u201cWe have received around 10,000 website enquiries since 1 July 2019. For the whole of FY18/19 we received 3,140.\u201d Google searches asking \u201chow to become a volunteer firefighter\u201d are at their highest level since 2004 \u2013 higher than during the 2009 Black Saturday figures, Yahoo reports. Hi everyone, this is Luke Henriques-Gomes, taking over from Helen Davidson. Thanks for all your work, Helen. I\u2019ll be with you through to the evening. If you want to bring anything to my attention, you can email me at luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or contact me on Twitter (@lukehgomes). As Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis continues, millions of hectares have been lost, with a tragic impact on wildlife and flora. Among the destruction, the efforts of volunteer firefighters, residents and animal rescuers have stood out, with small acts of heroism that have saved many animal lives. A few have become emblematic images of this year\u2019s terrible fire season. Naaman Zhou tells us about a few of them. There are pictures. A dire water situation compounded by bushfires and drought has prompted Auckland-based NRL team the Warriors to help rebuild the northern NSW town of Tenterfield. Warriors chief executive Cameron George, who grew up around two hours from the town, says he is heartbroken to hear stories from friends needing to boil water three times before they can drink it. The boil-water alert from the Tenterfield Shire Council was removed on Monday after residents spent since October 4 taking the precaution as ash deposits made their way into the dam, which is at an alarming low level. \u201cIt\u2019s going from bad to worse,\u201d George told AAP. \u201cThe challenges they are facing are heartbreaking, especially at a time of year when everyone should be able to relax a little bit.\u201d George has put in place a unique plan with the help of Tenterfield mayor Peter Petty, adopting the town for the year with the hopes of having a long-lasting impact on the community as it recovers. Next year the Warriors will work with the town\u2019s business chamber to help get local businesses back on their feet with expert mentoring through their sponsorship database. Players and club legends will visit schools, community events, host charity nights, as well as attending junior and senior games of the town\u2019s rugby league club, the Tenterfield Tigers. George is also hoping to coordinate a donation to the town. Mayor Petty will visit Auckland on January 20 to finalise the plans and speak to players about the impact they can have on local residents. George expects players will be moved by the realisation of how lucky they are to live in New Zealand and will be quick to help. \u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate the water situation, we don\u2019t experience that stuff in New Zealand, we\u2019re so lucky,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen players are able to have a shower after training and a couple of bottles of water, in Tenterfield they would have had to boil that water three times because it\u2019s so contaminated, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to drink as much.\u201d He now suggests that concerns over longer fire seasons, fatigued fire fighters, and calls for systemic change, are coming from Twitter and that government policy will not be set by social media. \u201cThere are always lots of experts when any of these things happen, but I can tell you as the prime minister and as the premier was telling you, the experts are the ones who have command responsibilities,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cYou just don\u2019t run out of a press conference and make something up because you think that it is going to give you a headline. What you do is you do the careful work to actually deliver the response and deliver the support that is absolutely necessary.\u201d Just to be clear, when Morrison says he is listening to the experts, it\u2019s not these ones: Morrison is asked about volunteer firefighters who have taken out loans to stay financially afloat. He says it\u2019s a matter for the state governments, that he doesn\u2019t want to do kneejerk responses, and it hasn\u2019t been raised with him. \u201cIf there are any urgent issues in relation to [that issue], then that, I am confident, if it were considered to be a priority of those agencies in relation to the firefighting effort, it would be elevated. And it would be recommended. That is not what is taking place. So I\u2019m going to continue to follow the lead of the priorities that are being set by those who are tasked and have the responsibility of fighting the fires. That\u2019s who I\u2019m listening to.\u201d \u201cAnd as much as I empathise with those who are going through economic hardship as they fight these fires, at the same time, I\u2019m going to listen to the experts that we\u2019ve entrusted with responsibility of fighting and commanding those forces.\u201d He\u2019s asked about reports of looting and scammers: \u201cI think they\u2019re scum. It makes me sick,\u201d says Morrison. \u201cAnd you know, in these fires, we have seen the best of Australia. The overwhelming story of these fires is the best of Australians in their response. But in some cases, we\u2019ve seen some ugly stuff, and they should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d Morrison says the cost of the public service leave will be absorbed by the agencies, and there will be no additional net cost. Morrison: \u201cThe other thing which we\u2019ve done in the last 24 hours after consulting commissioners and state premiers, where I\u2019ve had that direct interaction, is to ensure that our ADF is taking a more forward-leaning and proactive approach with response centres like we have here, like in Mount Barker and anywhere else in the country.\u201d \u201cThey have been there already, from up in Caloundra where I was, all the way through since September. \u201cJust this week, we saw amazing support provided by the ADF rescuing people there down there in the south coast of New South Wales in Nerriga. \u201cIn the chopper that I was in yesterday as I flew across the scorched earth of the BlueMountains, they were showing me where they were airlifting and dropping people into those places to fight those fires over the last week or so. So the ADF is very much involved and they\u2019re leaning in.\u201d Scott Morrison has announced that public servants taking leave to fight fires will have additional paid leave. He is setting a \u201cminimum standard of four weeks\u201d, beginning from today. He says he\u2019s directed all commonwealth public service leaders to permanently offer at least 20 working days of paid leave, with more as needed, for people volunteering to fight fires. Some public sector workers who are fighting the fires already have paid leave, but this will bring it all into line with defence force reservists. \u201cWe\u2019re helping get more boots on the ground and giving people who\u2019ve been out there for weeks some relief,\u201d Morrison said in a press release. \u201cWith bushfire seasons starting earlier, one of the things I\u2019ve heard on the ground is that some people are dipping into their other leave entitlements to stay out there battling blazes.\u201d Which is what people have been saying for weeks now. He\u2019s talking about this announcement at the press conference in South Australia. \u201cThis will enable them to be able to commit more time in their brigades, and relieve, particularly those in small and regional towns, that draw the volunteers from their own self-employed arrangements or small businesses for whom the continued support to have their volunteers out fighting fires and not working in their businesses is becoming very strained. And I would be calling on, as we\u2019ve been in contact today with some of the large companies, for them to also work with us on this.\u201d Morrison is giving thanks to the 1,500 South Australian firefighters who have come to NSW to help with the bushfire crisis there. \u201cParticularly even now, when you\u2019re facing your own challenges here.\u201d He says the NSW fires have been \u201cobviously terrible, but it\u2019s not the only place that has had fires\u201d. \u201cThere are fires here in South Australia. There are fires in Victoria. There are fires in Queensland. And I want to also commend the premiers of all of those states, as well as in New South Wales, for the tremendous job that they\u2019re doing in leading the operational response.\u201d \u201cOut in the Lobethal village tonight, there will be the usual Christmas lights spectacular despite all of this, as a sign of both defiance to the disaster that they\u2019ve lived through, but also, I think, as a way of bringing the community together in a very special way. It is Christmas Eve after all, and kids - Santa will find you, whether there\u2019s been a bushfire or not.\u201d South Australian premier, Steve Marshall, and Morrison are holding a press conference now. Marshall says there has been \u201coverwhelming generosity\u201d from the community to the Cudlee Creek bushfire appeal. They\u2019ve been visiting communities affected and \u201cat every single opportunity [Morrison] has been able to ask questions about exactly what is going on here\u201d, says Marshall. He says the support from the federal government has come \u201cin record time\u201d. \u201cThis is a team effort, a community effort to support people in these tough times.\u201d Disappointing news from the ABC, which reports there are some alleged instances of scammers and looters taking advantage of the bushfire crisis. According to South Australia Police, fire victims have reported receiving phone calls claiming to be from banks looking to pass on disaster relief funds. The fraudulent callers have asked for the victims\u2019 bank details, and have also targeted members of the public outside the bushfire regions. It follows anecdotal reports of looting in bushfire zones, and police have urged anyone contacted by scammers to notify them. It\u2019s going to be a long conversation once the fire season is over, but there is already a lot of talk about resourcing. For what it\u2019s worth, in reporting from different firegrounds, I\u2019ve found opinions differ from place to place, and brigade to brigade. But there\u2019s no question that donations and fundraising form a large part of the supply. The RFS supplies the necessary equipment. But this social media post from a Northern Beaches brigade sent to Bilpin on Saturday, shows what crews can do with the extra \u2013 in this case an iPad and topographical maps funded through donations. \u201cVideo is from last night after the southerly change impacted the Bilpin area, navigating into an isolated property off Bells Line of Road which was under threat with persons in place. The use of the iPad and Topo maps proving very helpful in locating isolated properties (purchased via brigade fundraising).\u201d The Law Society and the Legal Services Commission of South Australia is reminding people in the state that there is free legal advice available for those affected by the bushfire disaster. The Law Society maintains a register of lawyers who have volunteered to be on hand to provide free legal assistance to victims of disasters. For more information please contact disaster.planning@lawsocietysa.asn.au. For urgent legal advice and information please contact the Legal Services Commission which operates a free telephone advisory service on weekdays between 9am \u2013 4.30pm (excluding Public Holidays) on 1300 366 424. Morrison appeared on South Australia\u2019s 5AA radio this morning where he was asked by host Tony Pilkington about firefighting resources and compensation. The short version is Morrison was asked whether the government should be funding the stuff that people are telling them needs to be funded, and the answer was that if people tell the government something needs to be funded, they will look at funding it. Which seems to be answering a question about an actual occurrence as though it was a question about a hypothetical, but maybe I\u2019m getting a bit cynical in my search for some concrete plans laid out in a well-structured sentence. Anyway, they\u2019ll talk about it at the Coag meeting in March apparently. Here\u2019s the long version, courtesy of the prime minister\u2019s office: Pilkington: Prime minister, I\u2019m not going to bore you to death and our listening audience with questions that you\u2019ve been asked a million times since you\u2019ve got back. A question I wanted to put to you: would you consider, would the government consider the purchase of some more of these Canadian heavy water-bombing planes? I\u2019m imagining if we could get, I don\u2019t know, three or four, I know they\u2019re expensive, and put them in a place like Edinburgh. They could service us and NSW and Victoria. Is that sort of something you would consider? Prime minister: Well, we take our advice from the fire chiefs about how we put together the aerial firefighting fleet. There are 144 aircraft that are part of that, that are being deployed all around the country. And they make decisions and make recommendations about whether things should be leased and purchased and all of that. So we\u2019re always open to all the advice and recommendations they make. In fact, we just put an extra $11m into that fleet just recently and that comes to the top of the $15m that we put in together with the other states and territories. So we\u2019re very open to all the recommendations and have moved very quickly, I think, to act on those when they\u2019re made. So that\u2019s really the answer. I mean, if they think that\u2019s the way to handle it then I\u2019m sure that they will recommend that. But they look at these things very carefully and, you know, the costs and how they can best apply the resources to get the most out there and up in the air and used in their firefighting efforts. Pilkington: We\u2019re talking to prime minister Scott Morrison here in Adelaide on the way up to Lobethal, to the Adelaide Hills. Prime minister, what about the suggestion that premier Marshall made, that perhaps there could be a discount available for volunteer firefighters not having to pay a service levy? And would the federal government look at some sort of recompense to the volunteer firefighters? Prime minister: Well, the Country Firefighting Association and others have been pretty clear about these sort of things. I mean, oftentimes when you talk to those directly involved here, they typically want and ask, you know, things like additional facilities in their state and things like this. So it really is about how you set the priorities of where you put things. And, look, after these fires, like there is after every fire, there is a full review and in March, when the premiers meet, we\u2019ll be looking at a whole range of recommendations that even now are being prepared and have been prepared since the ministers were meeting some weeks ago. There is a very big nationally coordinated effort that goes into all of this. It happens 365 days a year, not just when fires are burning. And Emergency Management Australia, headed up by Rob Cameron and the home affairs department, they do this all the time, working very closely with the state and territories who are responsible for the operations and the fire services and the SESs and all of these which deploy in these circumstances. So we\u2019re always open to ways that things can be done better. But I can assure everyone in South Australia, as I can all around the country, that this is the best-resourced, best-coordinated fire response of anywhere in the world. Western Australia has offered a slight revision to the total number of hectares burned in WA since the start of November. Yesterday the rough figure, not including all fires managed by the local government bush fire brigades, was 374,000ha. Today those local government figures have been counted, and the total is 1.2m.That brings the total area burned in bushfires across Australia since spring to about five million hectares. That\u2019s about the same size as Costa Rica. The reason for the different figures is this: in Western Australia, management of bushfires is split between Parks, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES), and the local government run volunteer bushfire brigades. The latter do not always immediately report in the size of their fires to DFES, and in the Kimberley, fires can get quite big. Someone at DFES did the math for us overnight. The Kerry Ridge fire, on the north-west edge of the Mount Gospers and joined to the Oaky Creek and Paddock Run fires, has been upgraded to watch and act with activity increasing in Nullo Mountain. \u201cThe fire continues to burn on multiple fronts in the Wollemi national park, Putty state forest, Coricudgy state forest and Nullo Mountain state forest,\u201d says the RFS. \u201cFirefighters supported by heavy plant and water-bombing aircraft continue working to establish containment lines.\u201d People in Nullo Mountain, Olinda and Bogee to the west, Howes Valley, Appletree Flat, and Doyles Creek to the east, and Widden, Baerami, Baerami Creek, and Martindale to the north, are warned to monitor conditions and know what they\u2019ll do if the fire threatens. There is \u201coverwhelming support\u201d from the community, says Balmoral RFS volunteer Andrew Johnston, in this emotional interview with Nine News. \u201cWe just tried so hard to save people\u2019s homes. You can see in the shed we\u2019ve got everything in the shed for everyone ... for people who lost their homes. It\u2019s just awesome, the community spirit, the Aussie spirit all around.\u201d If you are wondering how you can help, here is a short guide. A lot of individual RFS brigades also have more specific information on their Facebook pages. Hello, this is Helen Davidson taking over the blog from Calla Wahlquist. Prime minister Scott Morrison will be addressing media from South Australia soon. In the meantime, here is a round up of what fire authorities expect to happen next, state by state. More than four million hectares of Australia have burned and nine people have died since September in the \u201cunprecedented\u201d start to the summer fire season. Emergency Victoria has issued an updated watch-and-act alert for the Marthavale-Barmouth Spur fire at Tambo Crossing. The Great Alpine Road \u2013 the only way in and out without going around the mountain \u2013 remains closed between Ensay and Bruthen and there is heavy smoke throughout Tambo Valley. The fire is being monitored through aerial patrols and ground crews are in the area, though as reported earlier they are not attacking the fire directly because it is too dangerous to send crews into that terrain. Residents are warned that their water supply \u201cmay become contaminated with debris, ash, soot, fire retardant or dead animals\u201d, which is unpleasant. While we wait for Scott Morrison to address the media in South Australia, where he is visiting properties including a winery impacted by the Cudlee Creek fire, and a church that is holding a donation drive for affected families, here is an aerial view of the damage. Here\u2019s an extended clip of the \u2018not my prime minister\u2019 exchange And it does seem that Jacqui was simply correcting Scott Morrison as to her citizenship. If you\u2019re going camping between Christmas and New Year, Forest Fire Management Victoria, which handles all bushfires on public land, has provided a guide to safe camp fire management. Remember: if there is a total fire ban you cannot light a campfire. Dr Geoff Goldrick, a scientist, educator and volunteer firefighter, has written a critique of Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201cmarketing strategy of a boldfaced lie\u201d on Australia\u2019s emissions reduction efforts. He writes: We know that Morrison\u2019s patronising response to this catastrophe only confirms that he doesn\u2019t understand the question Australia is asking. Australians aren\u2019t asking for miracles \u2013 we\u2019re begging for leadership. We are begging for leadership on the national stage. This must start with an honest acknowledgement of the problem. An unqualified admission that we are facing a climate crisis and that we must act. Federal energy minister Angus Taylor will attend the reopening of the Tahmoor coalmine with Sanjeev Gupta today, the Illawara Mercury reports. Simec Coal Tahmoor, bought by Gupta\u2019s GFC Alliance in 2018, was evacuated on Thursday as the Green Wattle Creek fire approached Bargo. Like much of the area affected by the Green Wattle Creek fire, it\u2019s in Taylor\u2019s electorate of Hume. The Mercury reported that Gupta would donate $250,000 to the local community at the reopening today. But environmental groups have criticised Taylor for attending the reopening of a coalmine while his electorate was battling unprecedented bushfires. Here\u2019s Andrew Bray, national director of the Australian Wind Alliance: It is deeply ironic that while renewable energy is the only part of the economy delivering sustained emissions reductions, the minister for emissions reduction has chosen to double down on coal, the primary driver of emissions increases. At a time when homes and lives have been lost to the devastating climate-fuelled bushfires in his own backyard, this stunt comes across as some kind of sick joke. Bray said Taylor had not attended the opening of any of the three windfarms that began operation in his electorate since he became an MP. There are six windfarms in Hume employing 62 people, Bray said, and windfarm construction will create 420 jobs over the next two years. Simec Coal Tahmoor employs 400 people. Jamie Hanson, the head of campaigns for Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said Taylor was \u201cmisreading\u201d the public mood. The Morrison government\u2019s misreading of the mood remains astonishing. We are living through national trauma \u2013 and their response was first a jaunt to Hawaii, and now the weird sight of Angus Taylor reopening a coalmine in the literal midst of this climate emergency. He continued: Good firefighting and luck ensured that the community dodged a bullet with Tahmoor \u2013 if it had burned, the Picton and Campbelltown areas may have been polluted with the toxic pollution for weeks from burning coal, including carbon monoxide, toxic fine particles and mercury. Unlike the Hazelwood coalmine which caught alight in bushfires in Victoria in 2014, Tahmoor is an underground mine. That doesn\u2019t mean it was not at risk of catching fire, but the risk is not the same. I hope Dean and his small furry friend are doing well. The top five Australian Twitter trends are critical of Scott Morrison. Even Morrison\u2019s former colleagues are joining in. Scott Morrison has responded to Jacqui, the woman from the RFS operations centre in Mudgee yesterday, who responded to being introduced to the PM yesterday by saying, \u201cHe\u2019s not my prime minister.\u201d Apparently, this is simply an issue of citizenship \u2013 Jacqui is British, the prime minister said on Twitter today. Move along folks, nothing to see here. Not sure Morrison\u2019s clarification will help. Jacqui and #NotMyPrimeMinister are the top two trending topics on Twitter in Australia this morning. Our photo editor Jessica Hromas was near Bilpin in areas affected by the Gospers Mountain megafire on Saturday. We have updated our map showing the scale of the bushfire crisis in NSW and Queensland. The total area burned in the two states is now 3.65m hectares. Anthony Albanese is speaking to reporters in the Blue Mountains now. He says compensating volunteer firefighters is a \u201ccommonsense\u201d issue. He said: I\u2019ve spoken to the volunteer firefighters and there is not one of them that I have spoken to who hasn\u2019t said that some form of compensation is required. Not one. The Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzimmons, has reportedly ruled out compensation for volunteer firefighters. Albanese said he had \u201cno criticism of the extraordinary job\u201d that Fitzimmons does, but that compensating volunteer firefighters was \u201ccommon sense\u201d. If someone has not had an income for a period of months because they have been fighting fires \u2013 and we met someone in Bilpin who had been fighting fires since September, every day \u2013 people who don\u2019t have an income for a period of three months, it is unsustainable. Common sense tells you that. Albanese said he wasn\u2019t proposing a particular model for that compensation. It could be federal compensation like that provided to army reservists, or one-off payments, or compensation for those who have to close small businesses. \u201cI\u2019m trying to give the government some flexibility,\u201d he said. But he said the bushfire crisis was not \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and may require an extraordinary response. The people I\u2019ve spoken to who have decades of experience are saying that they\u2019ve never seen anything like this. There are record numbers of homes have been lost. There have been lives that have been lost. This is a crisis. It requires an appropriate response. While Scott Morrison is in South Australia today, Anthony Albanese is still in the Blue Mountains. He is expected to talk to media shortly. The minister in charge of the bushfire crisis in NSW, the emergency services minister, David Elliot, has reportedly told the Australian that a proposal by Labor that volunteer firefighters should be paid for their time would undermine volunteer ethos and potentially undermine firefighting efforts \u2014 because the Rural Fire Service could never afford to pay all of its 70,000 volunteer members. Said Elliot: Anyone who is arguing we have to pay them doesn\u2019t understand the ethos of the volunteer in this country. Elliot said there was \u201cno evidence that volunteers join up for the money\u201d, which is correct but as there is not, and has never been, any money on offer I am not sure how far that takes us. This next point probably takes us further: If we pay one volunteer emergency services organisation we are going to have to pay them all. That would be a very difficult thing to do. Elliot says volunteer firefighters are motivated by protecting their community above all else \u2014 which is true. The debate about compensation is, I think, whether it is reasonable to continue to ask volunteers to sacrifice so much \u2014 weeks of their time, weeks of their income, potentially their lives \u2014 while bushfire conditions worsen each year under global heating. At the moment the public discussion about how best to support volunteer firefighters is being conducted largely in the absence of the firefighters themselves, who are busy actively fighting fires. The question of what volunteer firefighters want and need is probably best answered by the volunteer brigade members themselves, don\u2019t you think? Scott Morrison is in South Australia today and will be visiting communities affected by the catastrophic bushfires there, which burned through 47,000 hectares and destroyed 87 houses. Our photographer-at-large Mike Bowers was in Balmoral yesterday and captured some of the devastation in the town that was among the worst hit by the Green Wattle Creek fire in the southern highlands. Reporters Michael McGowan and Helen Davidson have been in Balmoral over the past few days. They spoke to survivors including Steve Harrison, a 67-year-old potter who described climbing into a \u201ccoffin-sized\u201d makeshift kiln when the fire approached. It was eerie. The light was this metallic, luminous glow. Burning leaves were falling around me. The smoke was so thick I could hardly breathe. I just watched it as it came over me. I was shit scared. I thought, \u2018This is how I die.\u2019 I spoke too soon. The CFS has just issued a watch and act alert for the Cudlee Creek fire in South Australia. Only one fire at watch and act There is only one fire at watch and act level in south-eastern Australia this morning. That\u2019s the 54,000-hectare Marthavale \u2013 Barmouth Spur bushfire in east Gippsland, about 200km east of Melbourne. A watch and act alert remains in place for Tambo Crossing and there is a community meeting scheduled for 10am in the Omeo memorial hall. The Great Alpine Road \u2014 the main road in and out of the region \u2014 remains closed between Ensay and Bruthen, a 54km stretch across Tambo Crossing and Mount Elizabeth. Most of the alternative routes are unsealed roads or 4WD tracks and they have also been closed. Power outages cut NBN-connected phones and internet services, but as of 7am this morning that power should be restored. I spoke to Luke Hegarty from the Victorian State Control Centre about this fire yesterday. He said the conditions were too dangerous for firefighters to tackle the blaze head on. It\u2019s in very dry, very mountainous, very heavily forested country, and it is spreading even on days like today, where fire conditions are low to moderate. He said: Fuels are incredibly dry. The spread of some of these fires over the past couple of days with really light winds and winds from the south is creating a challenge for us. It\u2019s just really unusual that the fuels are that dry that the normal behaviour that we would expect to see in terms of the spread of these fires is not happening. Five other fires are at advice level in Victoria, four are at advice level in South Australia, and three are at advice level in Queensland. New South Wales still has more than 50 fires at advice level. The fires of most concern over the past few days \u2013 Gospers Mountain in the Blue Mountains and Green Wattle Creek fire in the southern highlands \u2013 will be subject to backburning today. More than 4 million hectares of Australia has burned since the start of spring, according to figures collated by Guardian Australia. That figure is likely to increase \u2014 not just because we have three months to go in the southern fire season, but because the split between state-run and local government-run firefighting forces in WA means the figure from that state is incomplete. Debate about whether volunteer firefighters should be compensated, and what form any compensation should take, is continuing today. Labor is pushing the debate and it has the support of the volunteer firefighters\u2019 association, but Scott Morrison yesterday ruled out making a \u201cknee-jerk\u201d response. Some employees, like public servants, get paid leave for their volunteer bushfire duties but not everyone is in that position. Volunteer firefighters often pay out of pocket for better respiratory protection, fuel to drive to and from the fire ground, and other expenses, the NSW Volunteer Fire Fighters Association president, Mick Holton, told Radio National on Tuesday. They are out there chewing smoke. It\u2019s all very well for the prime minister to say they have got what they need \u2014 I am sure the air was pretty good in Hawaii. And as we begin our live coverage of the bushfire crisis, my colleague Josh Taylor reports that the Department of Home Affairs warned minister Peter Dutton in May that Australia faced more frequent and severe heatwaves and bushfires, and that \u201cwithout effective action more Australians\u2019 livelihoods will be impacted by disasters into the future and the cost of those disasters will continue to grow\u201d.",

Strong felt it was important for the story that Kendall should not be terrible at rapping, even if the rap itself is painful. \u201cWe did a table read in Glasgow, where we were shooting, and in the script Jesse [Armstrong] had just written: \u2018Kendall does a rap.\u2019 It was one lyric, and it was very corny, you know, like \u2018Kick it MC\u2019, and I thought: \u2018Oh God, we can\u2019t possibly do this,\u2019\u201d he recalls. He and Armstrong, Succession\u2019s creator and showrunner, decided that it, in order for it to work, the rap had to be halfway decent.</p> <p>Armstrong showed Strong a clip the model Heidi Klum had posted to Instagram of the oil heir Mike Hess <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BI0n0LxDY_p/\" title=\"\">rapping at his 30th birthday party with Nelly</a>. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty fucking good, and Jesse said: \u2018That\u2019s what I want us to do. It should be earnest, he should be actually committed to it and he should be pretty good.\u2019\u201d They asked Nicholas Britell, who composed the show\u2019s much-admired theme music, to come up with a beat and write the lyrics, and Strong spent a day wandering around Glasgow with his headphones on, perfecting the rap.</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest, I remember waking up that day and just not knowing what was going to come out of me, and if I\u2019d be able to do it or pull it off.\u201d Rest assured, he pulled it off. \u201cSo it was fun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29187f19dd5f5e56d724602ab7cb23b5d9bdaa90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29187f19dd5f5e56d724602ab7cb23b5d9bdaa90/155_0_2079_1248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cringe-inducing rap that launched a thousand Halloween outfits.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">L to the O G ... the rap that launched a thousand Halloween outfits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Succession</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the episode aired, there was a surprising new entry to the Halloween costume canon. People kept sending Strong pictures of people wearing the LOG50 baseball shirt that Kendall had revealed underneath his tuxedo. That was Strong\u2019s idea \u2013 he sketched it out on a piece of hotel notepaper after studying videos of rappers to work out what to do with his hands. \u201cThen, all of a sudden in New York, there were hundreds of people walking around in those jerseys. That was really wild for me.\u201d</p> <p>Strong is calling from the US, where he is currently shooting Aaron Sorkin\u2019s latest movie, The Trial of the Chicago 7. \u201cI have a giant, wild beard and a different voice,\u201d he explains, half-apologetically. He is the kind of actor who likes to fully immerse himself in his characters. Time spent as Kendall, who has to make his way through a cut-throat corporate world while navigating his own complicity in some of the Roy family\u2019s darkest deeds, can be taxing. After season one finished, Strong, who is from Boston, moved to Denmark. \u201cI immediately decamped to Copenhagen, where my wife\u2019s family is, and we had a baby. I had to insulate myself from any response to the show.\u201d</p> <p>He need not have been concerned. When Succession began in the summer of 2018, it was well-received, but a slow burn, picking up heat as it progressed. Viewers introduced to the brilliant horrors of the Roys \u2013 who took inspiration from a number of real-life family empires, including the Redstones, the majority shareholders of ViacomCBS, and the Murdochs, owners of News Corp \u2013 were soon hooked. By the time season two arrived a year later, it was being hailed as one of the best dramas on TV. Armstrong, who had previously co-created Peep Show and Fresh Meat with Sam Bain, won an Emmy for best writing on a drama series and had his acceptance speech censored when he made a gag about the amount of British winners. (\u201cMaybe you should have a think about those immigration restrictions on shithole countries,\u201d he joked.) A rabid online fandom vigorously deconstructed the show\u2019s pivotal scenes after each episode aired, and the memes began to spread. Someone made a video of Kermit the Frog dancing to the theme tune. A Buzzfeed quiz allowed you to work out which character you would be (me = Marcia). Succession had officially blown up.</p> <p>Strong puts the show\u2019s success down to Armstrong. \u201cAll of the credit is due to Jesse and his group of writers, and their little squalid room in Brixton where they cook all this stuff up,\u201d he says. Just before the first season began filming, Strong visited Brixton, and found a wall covered in note cards, plotting out the story. \u201cAll I remember is that there was one card which became prescient: Kendall wins but loses.\u201d The reverse was true of the second season, which came to an epic conclusion when Kendall finally rose up against his father, with bombastic timing, publicly blaming him for a disastrous corporate cover-up, potentially ending his father\u2019s reign and career. Having previously failed to depose the king, thanks to distractions such as manslaughter and cocaine relapses, Kendall finally stuck the knife in. Strong knew the big betrayal was coming from the start of season two. \u201cI knew that Kendall was going to be in a submissive, deadened, subjugated place, inwardly collapsed and sort of frozen,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I knew the final scene of the season was going to be a reversal, turning the tables against my father.\u201d</p> <p>Succession is brilliant at cooking up moments of operatic grandeur, but even by its own standards, the season two finale was immaculate. Naturally, fans debated the last scene, in which Logan witnesses his son\u2019s betrayal, and twists his face into a hint of a chilling smile. Did it mean that Logan had engineered this all along? Or was he impressed that his son had finally become as ruthless as him? \u201cReally? There\u2019s been debate?\u201d says Strong. Politely and apologetically (\u201cI\u2019m not being cheeky\u201d), he says he\u2019d rather not offer his own opinion on what it meant, because he feels that everything is there, in the scene. \u201cBut, of course, it is an act of strength, of defiance, of ruthlessness that is of the kind that probably [Kendall\u2019s] father has wished to engender in him his whole life.\u201d He also knows what has to happen next. \u201cWe\u2019re probably going to go to war with each other, on some scale.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDQTc-9kM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6dUDQTc-9kM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Kendall first tried to topple his father halfway through season one, when he attempted to force a vote of no confidence in Logan.

      "bodyText": "It was the best of times \u2013 for treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Liberal MP Gladys Liu. It was the worst of times \u2013 for former acting Victorian Liberal director, and now Frydenberg staffer, Simon Frost. There will be no byelections in Kooyong and Chisholm \u2013 because the federal court has ruled there was \u201cno real chance\u201d that Chinese-language signs, designed to look as though they were the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s, changed the election result. But Frost is facing the prospect of a declaration he committed an illegal practice by authorising misleading corflutes which used the AEC purple and white colour scheme to tell voters the \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cright\u201d way to vote was to put 1 next to the Liberal candidate. A breach of section 329 of the Electoral Act could result in referral to the director of public prosecutions for prosecution of an offence punishable by up to six months in prison, or a fine of $1,200 or both. The court found that Frost authorised the corflutes which \u201cwere likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote\u201d. \u201cIn our view, the corflutes are properly read, not as encouragement to vote 1 Liberal, but as a statement first, that to vote correctly (that is validly), one must vote 1 Liberal and, secondly, that there was an official instruction of the AEC that electors must cast their votes as indicated,\u201d the three justices of the federal court said. Frost gets one last chance to avoid this outcome. The justices noted that Frost gave evidence at the hearing but was not \u201cpersonally represented\u201d. So before the court issues a direction to inform the registrar of the high court \u201cof any finding of an illegal practice \u2026 by him at least in respect of the characterisation of the corflutes\u201d \u2013 it gave Frost an opportunity to put submissions \u201cas to why such a direction should not be made\u201d. The extraordinary Christmas Eve judgment with a new due date for submissions (7 February, 2020) is sure to leave Frost in a less-than-festive mood over the holiday season. Regardless of the outcome in the new year, the judgment should be a moment for political parties to stop and reflect on the arms race of misinformation in electoral campaigning. At the 2016 election Labor used text messages from Medicare to warn voters that \u201ctime was running out\u201d to save public health insurance \u2013 which resulted in new legislation banning impersonation of a commonwealth entity. At the 2019 election, the Victorian Liberal Party deployed the signs, which Frost conceded under cross-examination were designed to convey the impression that they were AEC corflutes. The signs were authorised (in fine print) by Frost on behalf of the Liberals \u2013 enough to avoid a case under the new \u201cMediscare\u201d laws, but not enough to put them beyond the reach of the \u201cmisleading and deceptive\u201d provisions of the Electoral Act. There are other sharp practices in politics that have to be cleaned up \u2013 including fake how-to-vote cards like those in Dickson which encouraged minor party and independent voters to put Peter Dutton ahead of Labor. But the lesson from Tuesday\u2019s judgment is that pushing the envelope in search of electoral advantage can be a crime. One final thought on this chapter of the Chinese language sign saga: why on earth did the AEC not just stand on the sidelines instead of actively intervening on behalf of the political party which the court has found tried to mislead voters? On election day, the AEC relied on a narrow interpretation of the law: that it only bans misleading voters on the process of voting, not the formation of their political judgment. The AEC thought the corflutes did not meet this higher bar \u2013 the court disagreed. But so overzealous was the AEC in protecting this initial judgment, it asked the court to throw out the case before the hearing on the basis the challengers had not found any voters who said they changed their votes as a result of the signs. Kooyong independent Oliver Yates and fellow challenger Vanessa Garbett get some vindication from Tuesday\u2019s judgment, while the AEC\u2019s record was to fight against a legal case that could expand its role in fighting misinformation and \u2013 in this case \u2013 protect its own reputation for independence. The case did not achieve the improbable victory that could imperil the Morrison government\u2019s majority through two byelections. But it was not a clean bill of health for Australian politics, the conduct of the Liberal Party and the AEC. Let\u2019s hope the new year brings to politics a renewed focus on the formation of voters\u2019 judgment \u2013 the marketplace of ideas \u2013 and not the arms race of dirty tricks.",

While she hasn\u2019t achieved everything she set out to do \u2013 far from it \u2013 allies and rivals agree that Ocasio-Cortez has upended Democratic politics, pushing the party inexorably to the left. And all before her 30th birthday, which she celebrated in October. \u201cHer presence in Congress has been seismic,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, a progressive political organization that recruited Ocasio-Cortez to run for office. \u201cShe has changed the whole ecosystem and expanded the idea of what\u2019s possible in the minds of voters. That kind of change is on a scale that\u2019s almost immeasurable.\u201d Few knew her name before the evening of 26 June 2018, when she stunned the political establishment \u2013 and herself \u2013 by soundly defeating Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent and the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House. Now she\u2019s known universally by her initials: AOC. In the year since her arrival on Capitol Hill, Ocasio-Cortez has convinced every major 2020 presidential candidate to support her Green New Deal, galvanized opposition to a deal with Amazon in New York and turned a tedious congressional hearing on money in politics into must-see TV. Last cycle, she raised more money than any other House Democrat, including Pelosi. And across the country, waves of Democratic insurgents are challenging long-serving incumbents in what has been called the \u201cAOC effect\u201d. \u201cShe\u2019s gotten a lot done by challenging the status quo \u2013 by taking on politics as usual in Washington,\u201d said Caroline Fredrickson, the president emerita of the American Constitution Society and author of the upcoming book The AOC Way. Fredrickson says Ocasio-Cortez has defied long-standing expectations about how young women, and especially women of color, behave in the corridors of power. At the same time she\u2019s surprised critics who once dismissed her as merely a \u201cbright and shiny new object\u201d. \u201cA lot of people expected a show pony. But it turns out she\u2019s a workhorse,\u201d Fredrickson said, pointing to her skillful questioning of witnesses during congressional hearings. Ocasio-Cortez doesn\u2019t mind being underestimated. (\u201cThat\u2019s how I won my primary,\u201d she quipped on CNN.) But she said her refusal to accept corporate Pac donations means that unlike many of her colleagues she spends no time on the phone asking donors for money \u2013 freeing up her schedule to pore over briefing books, study policy proposals and, on occasion, canvas her followers for questions to ask witnesses at hearings. But the congresswoman has said the heavy workload and constant scrutiny can take a toll. \u201cLike many other women + working people, I occasionally suffer from impostor syndrome: those small moments, especially on hard days, where you wonder if the haters are right. But then they do things like this to clear it right up,\u201d she wrote on Twitter, mocking a Republican senator for his bizarre riposte to her climate plan. Her playful repartee on social media, mixing the personal with the political, has helped her build a loyal following far beyond her New York district, which includes parts of the Bronx and Queens. Ocasio-Cortez has emerged as a symbol of a Democratic party that is younger, more diverse and increasingly wary of the excesses of capitalism. She believes voters are tired of pragmatism and consensus-building. Her campaign resonated, she argues, because of her uncompromising clarity of vision. It\u2019s a contested theory of change that she shares with the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, whom she endorsed in October. \u201cIf you\u2019re a one-term Congress member, so what?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in a video produced by Justice Democrats earlier this year. \u201cYou can make 10 years\u2019 worth of change in one term if you\u2019re not afraid.\u201d She stridently, and often wittily, counters internet trolls.

A political and cultural icon on the progressive left, she has also transfixed the right: Fox News covers her religiously while Trump and Republicans have eagerly promoted her as the face of the Democratic party. Trump has labeled her a \u201ccommunist\u201d and a \u201cnightmare for America\u201d. He has also said that she and three other liberal congresswomen of color who form a group that Ocasio-Cortez named \u201cthe Squad\u201d \u2013 Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2013 should \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx, not far from the Trump family home in Queens. Ocasio-Cortez was raised in a working-class family: her father owned a small business as an architect and her mother, who was born in Puerto Rico, cleaned houses. She studied international relations and economics at Boston University. When she was a sophomore in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, her father died of lung cancer and plunged the family into economic hardship. She has said that this ordeal helped shape her views on healthcare and economic reform. \u201cWhen you\u2019re from a working-class background it often feels like you\u2019re just one disaster away from everything falling apart,\u201d she said in an emotional Instagram story titled You can do it pinned to the top of her feed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of what happened when my dad died.\u201d Her lightning-strike rise from bartender to Democratic dragonslayer to member of Congress \u2013 all in the span of little more than a year \u2013 has not been an entirely smooth transition. In February, her office botched the rollout of the Green New Deal by distributing an incorrect fact sheet about the proposal that lead to widespread confusion over key details of the plan and lent itself to parody by Republicans. In New York she faced criticism for being slow to open a district office (she now has two). And she stirred fierce backlash when she described migrant detention camps at the border as \u201cconcentration camps\u201d \u2013 a term she has stood by. \u201cNobody expects to go from not having health insurance to being on the front page of every major newspaper, literally overnight,\u201d Rojas said. Many Democrats have griped privately about her outsized celebrity and combative politics, which they fear imperils vulnerable House members running for re-election in conservative districts where her brand is toxic. In the early days of her tenure, she alienated others in the party by aligning with a movement that runs primary challenges against moderate and right-leaning Democrats. Though she has denied reports that a top target was Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, she has endorsed challengers in two prominent House primaries. Those tensions exploded in spectacular fashion this summer after the House passed a border-funding bill that enraged progressives. On Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s then chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti unloaded on moderates who voted for the legislation, referring to them as the \u201cNew Southern Democrats\u201d and accusing them of enabling \u201ca racist system\u201d. He has since left her office. Pelosi escalated the row when she told the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd in an interview that the four members of the Squad had \u201ctheir public whatever and their Twitter world\u201d but they \u201cdidn\u2019t have any following\u201d. It was not the first time Pelosi has dismissed the left\u2019s influence \u2013 she once referred to the Green New Deal as the \u201cgreen dream\u201d \u2013 but this remark drew an unsparing response. Ocasio-Cortez retorted that the ability to shift public sentiment was proof of her power, and later said that Pelosi was \u201csingling out ... newly elected women of color\u201d. This infuriated allies of Pelosi, especially members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who said Ocasio-Cortez had gone too far. The dispute ultimately ended with a private, one-on-one meeting between Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez to \u201cclear the air\u201d. Though deep rifts remain, the bitter infighting has largely subsided in the three months leading up to the House\u2019s impeachment of Trump. In a recent tweet, Trump accused Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of the party of being so obsessed with his impeachment that they have failed to deliver on their legislative agenda. \u201cIn my first 11 months I\u2019ve cosponsored 339 pieces of legislation, authored 15, took on Big Pharma w/ my colleagues in hearings that brought PreP generic a year early &amp; exposed abuse of power,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez shot back. \u201cIn 4 years, you\u2019ve jailed kids &amp; made corruption the cause celebr\u00e9,\u201d she added. \u201cTry to keep up.\u201d",

Maybe I take 10 photos a day and I share about two online,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But offering a glimpse inside the Cox\u2019s Bazar camps \u2013 home to more than one million Rohingya who have fled persecution and violence in Myanmar\u2013 has become harder since the Bangladeshi government launched a crackdown that they say is for security reasons. The measures used include temporarily blocking internet services and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/05/bangladesh-imposes-mobile-phone-blackout-in-rohingya-refugee-camps\">confiscating mobile phones</a>.</p> <p>Hassan says the poor internet connection makes it difficult to post photos on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s also hard for other reasons,\u201d he adds. \u201cMy grandfather is in another part of the camp and I cannot call him if I urgently need to. That makes me upset.\u201d</p> <p>Hassan\u2019s photography was encouraged by the TV discussion forum Doha Debates and human rights organisation Fortify Rights.</p> <p>\u201cMy favourite photograph is this one,\u201d he says, showing a picture of a man with his arm outstretched, baring a scar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BuKsIyLlKa2/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

He could not speak, but I saw the scar and said: \u2018How did you get it?\u2019 Someone else was accompanying him and told me that he was caught by the military in Myanmar. He was beaten badly and they tied him so hard that it left a scar. That\u2019s when I took the photo.\u201d</p> <p>Hassan is not the only young photographer operating in the camp.

But now I am scared and worried because I have seen many people getting their phones confiscated and my phone is my only camera.

      "bodyText": "For Azimul Hassan, 19, life before he entered the world\u2019s largest refugee settlement was always busy. He would wake early to visit his private tutor before school, then work late every evening to finish his homework. On Fridays, he would play football with friends \u2013 he was a striker. Now his days are very different. Education is limited in the camps, and he no longer plays sport as there is little space. But he has developed a passion for photography and for social media, which has given him a sense of purpose. \u201cI know Instagram has good reach, all over the world. The Rohingya are suffering and I want to tell everyone about that. I take photos and upload them. Maybe I take 10 photos a day and I share about two online,\u201d he says. But offering a glimpse inside the Cox\u2019s Bazar camps \u2013 home to more than one million Rohingya who have fled persecution and violence in Myanmar\u2013 has become harder since the Bangladeshi government launched a crackdown that they say is for security reasons. The measures used include temporarily blocking internet services and confiscating mobile phones. Hassan says the poor internet connection makes it difficult to post photos on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s also hard for other reasons,\u201d he adds. \u201cMy grandfather is in another part of the camp and I cannot call him if I urgently need to. That makes me upset.\u201d Hassan\u2019s photography was encouraged by the TV discussion forum Doha Debates and human rights organisation Fortify Rights. \u201cMy favourite photograph is this one,\u201d he says, showing a picture of a man with his arm outstretched, baring a scar. \u201cI went to a shop to drink tea and met this man. He could not speak, but I saw the scar and said: \u2018How did you get it?\u2019 Someone else was accompanying him and told me that he was caught by the military in Myanmar. He was beaten badly and they tied him so hard that it left a scar. That\u2019s when I took the photo.\u201d Hassan is not the only young photographer operating in the camp. Omal, 18, takes pictures for similar reasons. \u201cI know how to take photographs thanks to some basic training I received [from Doha Debates and Fortify Rights], and now I do it every day,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to be educated and do more for my community. But now I am scared and worried because I have seen many people getting their phones confiscated and my phone is my only camera. I am worried about using the camera when I am out as I do not want to lose it.\u201d There are also other people sharing videos and other information with Rohingya Vision, a YouTube channel based in Malaysia, and the Arakan Times. Jamal, 22, was born in the camps. His family came to Bangladesh in the 1990s, as part of the first influx of Rohingya refugees. He says things have been very different since the new arrivals appeared two years ago. \u201cBefore then, life was quite relaxed. We could move around the country and there was no mobile phone restriction. I heard from elders that we were going to get more permanent cards to stay in Bangladesh. There were talks of integration, but those talks have stopped now,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a WhatsApp group where we share reports.

I did not write the articles, they were written by other people, but I shared what was happening here,\u201d he says.

Rami Malek plays the villain, whom Bond is called out of Jamaican retirement to battle. Fast &amp; Furious 9 The gearhead franchise keeps rolling along. Vin Diesel as back again as street racer Dom Toretto (after that Hobbs and Shaw interlude) with wife Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). Charlize Theron is also back as strife-generating cyberterrorist Cipher. Tenet Christopher Nolan has a long leash nowadays, and this latest excursion into the headtrip realms of Inception/Memento/Interstellar looks pretty baffling from the trailers.

      "bodyText": "A new wave of mercenaries from Sudan is fighting in Libya, deepening concerns that the conflict in the north African state has descended into an intractable international war that could destabilise much of the region. Leaders of two different groups of Sudanese fighters active in Libya have told the Guardian that they had received hundreds of new recruits in recent months. Both groups were fighting with the Libyan National Army (LNA) led by General Khalifa Haftar against the internationally recognised government in Tripoli. \u201cA lot of young men [are coming] \u2026 we even do not have the capacity to accommodate these big numbers,\u201d said one commander who is based in the south of Libya. The commanders said that there are at least 3,000 Sudanese mercenaries now fighting in Libya, significantly more than most previous estimates. Earlier this month the UN said the interference of fighters from Sudan in Libya was a direct threat to the security of the war-torn country. A UN panel of experts said in a 376-page report to the security council that the presence of the Sudanese has become more marked in 2019 and may lead to further instability. Libya has been in turmoil since a civil war in 2011 toppled Muammar Gaddafi, who was later killed. In the chaos that followed, the country was divided, with a weak UN-supported administration in Tripoli overseeing the country\u2019s west and a rival government in the east aligned with Hafter\u2019s LNA, each supported by an array of militias and foreign governments. Hafter launched a surprise military offensive in April aimed at capturing Tripoli but the offensive stalled, leaving both sides dug in and shelling one another along the city\u2019s southern reaches with increasingly sophisticated weapons. Earlier this month Hafter, 76, said that his forces were preparing for a \u201cdecisive battle\u201d to take full control of the city. While the LNA and the eastern government enjoy the support of France, Russia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and other key Arab countries, the Tripoli-based government is backed by Italy, Turkey and Qatar. \u201cJordan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates routinely and sometimes blatantly supplied weapons, with little effort to disguise the source\u201d in violation of a UN arms embargo, the recent report said. But \u201cneither side has the military capability to effectively decide the outcome to their advantage\u201d. The LNA have also been reinforced by Russian mercenaries in recent months. Some of the biggest Sudanese groups based in Libya once fought in Darfur, the restive western region of Sudan, in a series of insurgencies against militia and troops sent by the repressive regime in Khartoum. The Sudanese mercenary commanders said the new wave of recruits included many who had fought against the rule of Omar al-Bashir, who was deposed in April when Sudan\u2019s military withdrew their support after months of popular protests. One said that many had been recruited in Darfur in recent months while others had travelled from there to Libya to enlist. All the commanders interviewed said they hoped to return to Sudan to fight against the current transitional government, installed after al-Bashir\u2019s fall. \u201cI know that we are mercenaries and we are not fighting with honour and dignity \u2026. but this is temporary, we will go back home after we are done with our mission here,\u201d one said. Another commander said that fighting as mercenaries in Libya was the only way to obtain resources necessary to fight the Sudanese state in the future. He said he had not expected al-Bashir to be ousted but, though the veteran dictator\u2019s fall had \u201cchanged the political equation\u201d, the new transitional government in Khartoum was not different from the previous regime. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that Omar Al-Bashir is gone. We are now in Libya \u2026 but there are other battles awaiting for us in Sudan.\u201d Another high-ranking Sudanese mercenary based near Tripoli told the Guardian that they had \u201cno timetable\u201d for leaving Libya but that any stay was temporary. \u201cWe are there just to have a secure base and to get weapons and other military logistics to go back to Sudan,\u201d he said. Jalel Harchaoui, an expert in Libya at the Clingendael Institution in the Hague, said that the new influx of recruits could be a significant destabilising factor in the long term. \u201cThe younger people are coming in to earn money. It could be one year, two years or more but eventually the conflict will cool off. At some point they will start to return home [to Sudan],\u201d he said. There are also claims that a large contingent of Sudanese fighters from the feared paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were deployed to Libya on the request of Hafter. The most recent UN report said that a thousand Sudanese troops from the RSF, which has been accused of major atrocities earlier this year and in Darfur, were deployed to Libya on 25 July 2019 by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, a warlord turned senior official also known as Hemedti. The Sudanese mercenaries are also involved in smuggling and other activities. One commander said he helped smuggle migrants hoping to travel to Europe across the frontier between Sudan and Libya, and the hostile desert. \u201cYou know when the militants have nothing to do, they have to work, so they sometimes smuggle people,\u201d he said. Tim Eaton, a Libya expert at Chatham House, London, said mercenaries were known to extort money from smugglers and from migrants. \u201cThis usually means raising \u2018taxes\u2019 by either facilitating or impeding them,\u201d Eaton said. One Sudanese commander said that the his troops played a crucial role in \u201cliberating\u201d the oilfields seized by Hafter\u2019s forces. The claim is corroborated by previous reports from the UN panel of experts which said Sudanese mercenaries helped the LNA secure the country\u2019s strategic \u201coil crescent\u201d. \u201cWithout our help, they would not be able to liberate it, we contributed to 50% of the military work there,\u201d he told the Guardian.",

You don\u2019t expect them to burn easily, but the intensity of that fire, it just went right through these vineyards.</p> <p>\u201cThis is devastating. This is going to have extraordinary effects on the Adelaide Hills region. Where this fire went through it is arguably one of the most agriculturally rich and productive in South Australia. The cost of this is going to be astronomical.\u201d</p> <p>It is understood the exact number of vineyards and wineries affected will not be known until local authorities have had a chance take stock.</p> <p>\u201cHeat, radiant heat damage, has wiped out a lot of crops, but we expect vines to recover from that if growers can rebuild their irrigation,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cIf they can do that quickly, we\u2019ll see them back quickly. Where they\u2019ve been burnt quickly, it\u2019s a complete rip out and restart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed5481c7ceeecc50b2d4877184cab7223ded53d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed5481c7ceeecc50b2d4877184cab7223ded53d3/106_8_952_1190/800.jpg\" alt=\"Vines ruined by fire\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vines ruined by fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Tilbrook/Tilbrook Estate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the other part of this that makes it more devastating, horticulture is not about just putting vines or trees in the ground and then waiting for a return. To get a commercial crop off a newly planted vineyard, to put this vineyard back in the ground and get it up and running, you\u2019ve got incredible expenses.\u201d</p> <p>To help those worst affected, Stringer said, people are advised to stock up on Adelaide Hills produce over Christmas, as those wineries expecting visits will now end up with nothing.</p> <p>On Tuesday the current tally for the number of livestock killed in the blaze was released.</p> <p>Early surveys of the 537 properties within the area registered as having livestock present put the number of animals killed in the blaze at 2,700 as of Tuesday afternoon, according to Department of Primary Industries and Regions SA (PIRSA). This includes 2635 sheep, 139 cattle, 15 chickens, two alpacas and one horse.</p> <p>In a statement, state controller for Agricultural and Animal Services, Mehdi Doroudi, said this number is expected to rise as the initial assessments are finalised.</p> <p>Meanwhile, growers and winemakers have been taking to social media to share the heartbreak. Among those worst affected are Tilbrook Estate, Vinteloper, New Era Vineyards, Golding Estate, Barristers Block and Tomich Wines.</p> <p>David Bowley of Vinteloper has already met with insurance assessors and says that though his winery has survived on a separate property, he is looking at a \u201ctotal wipeout\u201d of his vineyard.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a frost, or you have a bad rain and it\u2019s too wet, or you have disease, that\u2019s one season gone,\u201d Bowley said. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone thinks about. Then you have this. And the scale just dawns on you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B6UzX9yDdB8/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Wine industry representatives say the fires that have burned through the Adelaide Hills have \u201csmashed\u201d grape growers and winemakers, and it will be years before many can recover. Jared Stringer, vice-chair of the Adelaide Hills Wine Region industry association, says the fire has potentially wiped out a third of wine production in the area. \u201cWe know 25,000 hectares have burned in this fire,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cThere\u2019s around 3,300 hectares in the Adelaide Hills under vine, with 1,100 in the fire burnout zone, which makes up one-third of total vineyard production.\u201d All told, Stringer said, grape production within the fire-affected area is worth $20m, which goes on to become 794,000 cases of wine. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s potentially at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for that fire to rip through \u2013 you\u2019re talking densely green, large canopies of vines here. You don\u2019t expect them to burn easily, but the intensity of that fire, it just went right through these vineyards. \u201cThis is devastating. This is going to have extraordinary effects on the Adelaide Hills region. Where this fire went through it is arguably one of the most agriculturally rich and productive in South Australia. The cost of this is going to be astronomical.\u201d It is understood the exact number of vineyards and wineries affected will not be known until local authorities have had a chance take stock. \u201cHeat, radiant heat damage, has wiped out a lot of crops, but we expect vines to recover from that if growers can rebuild their irrigation,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cIf they can do that quickly, we\u2019ll see them back quickly. Where they\u2019ve been burnt quickly, it\u2019s a complete rip out and restart. \u201cThat\u2019s the other part of this that makes it more devastating, horticulture is not about just putting vines or trees in the ground and then waiting for a return. To get a commercial crop off a newly planted vineyard, to put this vineyard back in the ground and get it up and running, you\u2019ve got incredible expenses.\u201d To help those worst affected, Stringer said, people are advised to stock up on Adelaide Hills produce over Christmas, as those wineries expecting visits will now end up with nothing. On Tuesday the current tally for the number of livestock killed in the blaze was released. Early surveys of the 537 properties within the area registered as having livestock present put the number of animals killed in the blaze at 2,700 as of Tuesday afternoon, according to Department of Primary Industries and Regions SA (PIRSA). This includes 2635 sheep, 139 cattle, 15 chickens, two alpacas and one horse. In a statement, state controller for Agricultural and Animal Services, Mehdi Doroudi, said this number is expected to rise as the initial assessments are finalised. Meanwhile, growers and winemakers have been taking to social media to share the heartbreak. Among those worst affected are Tilbrook Estate, Vinteloper, New Era Vineyards, Golding Estate, Barristers Block and Tomich Wines. David Bowley of Vinteloper has already met with insurance assessors and says that though his winery has survived on a separate property, he is looking at a \u201ctotal wipeout\u201d of his vineyard. \u201cYou have a frost, or you have a bad rain and it\u2019s too wet, or you have disease, that\u2019s one season gone,\u201d Bowley said. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone thinks about. Then you have this. And the scale just dawns on you. \u201cI don\u2019t want to understate the gravity of what has happened. A vineyard \u2013 to regrow a vineyard, it\u2019s not just next year. This wipes out our crop for seven years, at least.\u201d Bowley said the support he had received since announcing the loss has blown him away and that he was determined to start over. \u201cI\u2019m going to rebuild. I\u2019m not giving up. That\u2019s not how we roll.\u201d",

Appearing in a video message with his wife Jenny, Morrison said he and his family knew it would be \u201ca really difficult Christmas for so many Australians\u201d. \u201cFrom the floods up in north Queensland earlier this year to the drought that continues to ravage the country for years now, and of course the bushfires which have been raging since September \u2026 despite all of these great challenges Australians have stood up,\u201d Morrison said. The prime minister gave his thanks to \u201call of those who serve our nation\u201d, including volunteer firefighters, surf lifeguards and members of the defence force. He also paid tribute to the two New South Wales Rural Fire Service firefighters who died last Thursday while on duty at the Green Wattle Creek fire. \u201cWe think especially of the families of Andrew O\u2019Dwyer and Geoff Keaton who we lost in the fires recently here in NSW,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know this is going to be a tough Christmas for you, the first Christmas without those two amazing men, and to all those at the Horsley Park brigade we send our great love and best wishes to you. They are a reminder of why this country is amazing.\u201d In his message, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, also paid tribute to firefighters, and said that while Christmas was a time to celebrate, it could also be a difficult time for some. \u201cWe think particularly of those people in the community who have been fighting bushfires,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cWe think of those empty seats at tables where people have lost loved ones. \u201cThis is the greatest country on Earth. And the thing that makes it the greatest country on Earth is our people. Our people are resilient. Our people are courageous. Our people are committed to each other and to their local communities. \u201cSo, at this time in particular, a huge shout-out to those people who fought fires and done themselves, their community and our entire nation a great deal of pride.\u201d Nationals MP and former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce posted a less conventional, unofficial Christmas video message to Twitter, sounding off on climate change and government intervention while feeding cattle against a drought-stricken backdrop. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me that the climate is not changing, it is changing \u2026 my problem\u2019s always been whether you believe a new tax is going to change it back.\u201d In the tweet, labelled simply \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019, Joyce also said that a \u201chigher authority \u2026 right up there in the sky\u201d needed to be respected or \u201cwe\u2019re going to get nailed\u201d. Morrison also mentioned the homeless and those who worked with charities in his speech. \u201cTo those who will be serving on Christmas Day, whether it\u2019s the homeless, or the many charitable acts that they have been engaged in, we say \u2018thank you\u2019 to you to, because we know it\u2019s not just on Christmas Day but this is a passion of yours, and something you do each and every day over the course of the year. \u201cWe are an amazing country, we are an amazing people, and 2020 is going to be another year in which we demonstrate why this is the best country in the world in which to live.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Around Europe, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2019\" title=\"\">UK general election</a> was followed with huge interest. Leftists were paying particularly close attention, as they understood that a victory for a genuine social democratic party would have an enormous impact on parties and movements around the continent and beyond. Meanwhile, in the brutally simplistic and, ultimately, effective methods of Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, we could also see echoes of our own recent elections, where perceived strong leadership and appeals to national pride struck a chord with many voters.</p> <p>For those of us living in central Europe, this has been all the more acute. The new British government looks familiar to anyone who has been paying attention to politics in this region \u2013 and particularly to Hungary since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-orban\" title=\"\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a> became prime minister again in 2010. In their manifesto, the Conservatives made a pledge to \u201clook at the broader aspects of our constitution\u201d, including the relationship between the three branches of government. That may be vague, but it sounds at least somewhat similar to promises made by Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) to reform the courts, and the ongoing attempts by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party to take control of the judiciary. Since the election, Johnson has made policy promises straight out of the Fidesz and PiS playbook, including threats against the media, crackdowns on Traveller camps, and the creation of a dedicated immigration and borders department.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/17/tories-bbc-line-of-fire-destroy\">The Tories have the BBC in their line of fire. Don\u2019t let them destroy it | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The comparisons between the governments aren\u2019t exact, of course. While Johnson has used racist language on numerous occasions, he hasn\u2019t resorted to a \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d narrative like those repeated by Fidesz or PiS in recent campaigns. And while those parties\u2019 campaigns identified national enemies \u2013 for Poland the godless west, for Hungary the \u201cthreat\u201d of Islam \u2013 that wasn\u2019t a tactic employed by the Tories in this election. But they have been only too happy to rail against the enemies of Brexit in the past, whether that\u2019s judges, bureaucrats or MPs, and they will surely do so again. Let\u2019s not forget, either, that the Conservatives have a direct link to those central European parties: Johnson has met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/22/video-reveals-steve-bannon-links-to-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Donald Trump\u2019s former strategist Steve Bannon</a>, who has attempted to create a grand European alliance of nationalists.</p> <p>No doubt there will be claims that the UK, with its venerable institutions, couldn\u2019t possibly be prone to the same kind of constitutional meddling as in Hungary or Poland. But for all the abuses of power by Fidesz and PiS, they are still reined in to an extent by the EU: governments in this region tend to be too scared of the threat of Brussels cutting their funding, and aware of the overwhelming popularity of EU membership, to risk serious censure by meddling too far. The UK is now free from this sort of concern, so the only barriers to the Conservatives\u2019 potential reforms will be media scrutiny and the judiciary.

      "bodyText": "Around Europe, the UK general election was followed with huge interest. Leftists were paying particularly close attention, as they understood that a victory for a genuine social democratic party would have an enormous impact on parties and movements around the continent and beyond. Meanwhile, in the brutally simplistic and, ultimately, effective methods of Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, we could also see echoes of our own recent elections, where perceived strong leadership and appeals to national pride struck a chord with many voters. For those of us living in central Europe, this has been all the more acute. The new British government looks familiar to anyone who has been paying attention to politics in this region \u2013 and particularly to Hungary since Viktor Orb\u00e1n became prime minister again in 2010. In their manifesto, the Conservatives made a pledge to \u201clook at the broader aspects of our constitution\u201d, including the relationship between the three branches of government. That may be vague, but it sounds at least somewhat similar to promises made by Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) to reform the courts, and the ongoing attempts by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party to take control of the judiciary. Since the election, Johnson has made policy promises straight out of the Fidesz and PiS playbook, including threats against the media, crackdowns on Traveller camps, and the creation of a dedicated immigration and borders department. The comparisons between the governments aren\u2019t exact, of course. While Johnson has used racist language on numerous occasions, he hasn\u2019t resorted to a \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d narrative like those repeated by Fidesz or PiS in recent campaigns. And while those parties\u2019 campaigns identified national enemies \u2013 for Poland the godless west, for Hungary the \u201cthreat\u201d of Islam \u2013 that wasn\u2019t a tactic employed by the Tories in this election. But they have been only too happy to rail against the enemies of Brexit in the past, whether that\u2019s judges, bureaucrats or MPs, and they will surely do so again. Let\u2019s not forget, either, that the Conservatives have a direct link to those central European parties: Johnson has met Donald Trump\u2019s former strategist Steve Bannon, who has attempted to create a grand European alliance of nationalists. No doubt there will be claims that the UK, with its venerable institutions, couldn\u2019t possibly be prone to the same kind of constitutional meddling as in Hungary or Poland. But for all the abuses of power by Fidesz and PiS, they are still reined in to an extent by the EU: governments in this region tend to be too scared of the threat of Brussels cutting their funding, and aware of the overwhelming popularity of EU membership, to risk serious censure by meddling too far. The UK is now free from this sort of concern, so the only barriers to the Conservatives\u2019 potential reforms will be media scrutiny and the judiciary. Fortunately for the press, another manifesto promise was to kill off the Leveson inquiry and promote freedom of speech. Unfortunately for the public, the prime minister\u2019s first soiree following the election was at a party held by a media magnate, and Downing Street is already making threats to the future of the BBC. Our region has no simple lesson for the UK\u2019s left and centre. If anything can be learned, it is that meeting the right on its own terms is a recipe for obliteration. There are no recent examples of a nominally leftwing party successfully flirting with closed-border nationalism or neoliberalism, whereas there are several examples of this approach leading to electoral disaster. As well as the more obvious western examples of Germany\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD) or France\u2019s Socialists, the decline of Poland\u2019s formerly dominant Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) in the 2000s was due, in part, to its decision to join George Bush\u2019s \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d. What seems striking from afar is that Labour has successfully attracted a swathe of younger voters and long-term campaigners who were forced out by decisions of the Blair years. It would be a terrible mistake if the party now drove them away. In the Polish election this October, the left managed to find a happy medium between the old guard and younger activists, in no small part thanks to the older, more established group from the SLD swallowing some pride and accepting they may have needed help refreshing their ideas. Subsequently, once-rival groups formed an alliance and ran a positive campaign that, unusually for Poland, didn\u2019t focus on attacking enemies. As divided parties, they had been polling at levels that wouldn\u2019t have returned any MPs; together, they returned the left wing to parliament, and have recently polled within a few points of the main opposition.

      "bodyText": "Local authorities at Tamborine Mountain have demanded the owners of unapproved bores stop supplying \u201cemergency\u201d water to residents, despite a worsening water crisis in parts of the Queensland Gold Coast hinterland community. With bores running dry and rainwater tanks empty, local anger has been focused on the three commercial water extraction operations that send away a combined 100m litres of water a year to be bottled and sold. Last week, in response to that criticism, one of the extractors, Cedar Creek Estate Winery and Vineyard, said it intended to supply water from an unapproved bore for distribution around Tamborine Mountain. Cedar Creek managing director John Penglis acknowledged last week that he did not have approval for the bore from the Scenic Rim council, but would instead rely on section 166 of the Queensland planning act that allows activities in the event of an emergency. The council has since sought to block Cedar Creek from supplying water from the new bore to a local water carrying service. Guardian Australia has seen a council enforcement notice sent to a second business, Pure Mountain, claiming a state of emergency does not exist and demanding any unapproved water supply cease. It claims that because water carriers can access off-mountain water supply from neighbouring authorities \u2013 in Logan and the Gold Coast \u2013 the operation of the new bores is not necessary. Last week Guardian Australia reported there was a six-week wait for water deliveries to fill empty tanks, and that locals had become increasingly desperate. The primary school bore ran dry on 11 December. In a joint statement on Monday night, three community groups \u2013 the Tamborine Mountain Chamber of Commerce, Tamborine Mountain Progress Association and Save Our Water \u2013 said the actions by the council lacked empathy for locals in the midst of a water supply crisis. \u201cThe facts are clear, there is a lack of immediately available local water with a current six week wait time unless water is sourced from the Gold Coast or Logan (as Canungra standpipe is now closed),\u201d the statement said. \u201cThese off-mountain deliverers are at a higher cost, which creates a significant financial burden to businesses and families. Some families and businesses are doing it tough and are not able to afford high water delivery costs on top of other bills. Many businesses are still recovering from the effects of the fire and loss of trade. \u201cWe have a duty of care to all residents including the elderly, the young and those with serious health issues who are very vulnerable when it comes to water use, both for drinking, cooking and showering. \u201cDue to their already challenging circumstances many of these residents are already constrained financially. The cavalier and dismissive suggestion from council to use water trucked in from Logan and the Gold Coast leads to a huge increase in the price of water. This is not a reasonable alternative nor is it needed, because locally there is water which could be accessed. \u201cWhile the council says \u2018no\u2019 without consultation, and wastes time liaising with water utilities and the broader water carrier industry, local residents continue to suffer, and bores continue to dry up or perform worse without the council supporting a resolution in sight.\u201d In a statement explaining why it took enforcement action, the council said establishing any new bulk water supply tanks or pumping facilities without development approval was a breach of the Planning Act. \u201cThe activity of extracting water without the appropriate authority is only deemed necessary under section 166 of the Planning Act if there is an imminent and definite threat requiring immediate action to ensure a person\u2019s life or health is not endangered,\u201d the statement said. \u201cCouncil will continue to proactively monitor the situation to assess if the thresholds for the section 166 application are triggered. \u201cCouncil recognises water supply is a serious issue for residents and businesses in our communities as a result of the drought. Council strongly urges communities to prepare and plan ahead by booking bulk water delivery with enough lead time to meet their needs.\u201d",

But the court put the Liberal party\u2019s then acting Victorian director, Simon Frost, on notice that it is preparing to make a declaration he committed an illegal practice \u201cin respect to characterisation of the corflutes\u201d. It granted him leave to file submissions as to why it should not make that declaration. A breach of section 329 of the Electoral Act is punishable by up to six months in prison or $2,100 or both. \u201cOn the evidence we find that Mr Frost caused or authorised the printing, publishing and distribution of the corflutes which were matters or things that were likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote,\u201d the court said. \u201cIn our view, the corflutes are properly read, not as encouragement to vote 1 Liberal, but as a statement first, that to vote correctly (that is validly), one must vote 1 Liberal and, secondly, that there was an official instruction of the AEC that electors must cast their votes as indicated.\u201d The chief justice, James Allsop, and justices Andrew Greenwood and Anthony Besanko found that Frost \u201chad full knowledge of the essence of the misrepresentation that the corflute appeared to be a sign of the AEC\u201d, and noted that the criminal code could apply to such an illegal practice. The signs in the Victorian seats of Chisholm and Kooyong had been displayed at polling booths, and told voters that the \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cright\u201d way to vote was to put a \u201c1\u201d next to the Liberal candidate, and used the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s official colours of purple and white. Liu won the marginal seat of Chisholm by only 1,090 votes against Labor\u2019s Jennifer Yang, while Frydenberg won by 11,289 votes against Greens candidate Julian Burnside, after the distribution of preferences during the 18 May election. An unsuccessful Kooyong candidate, Oliver Yates, and climate campaigner Vanessa Garbett then challenged the results in both electorates. Yates and Garbett argued the signs breached section 329(1) of the Electoral Act, which makes it an offence to print material likely to deceive a voter. But on Tuesday, the court ruled that the petition be dismissed, subject to further submissions from Frost about whether he committed an illegal practice. During hearings in October, Liu and Frydenberg\u2019s lawyers admitted that the translation told voters the \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cright\u201d way to vote was to put a 1 next to the Liberal candidate. Frost also admitted that the signs were designed to look like official AEC signage. But the AEC itself also told the court the challenge should be dismissed, and submitted that no reasonable voter could have changed their vote as a result of the signs. The electoral commission said there was no detail or proof that voters would have changed their votes due to the signs. On Tuesday, the federal court agreed. Frost told the court in October the signs were intended to say: \u201cTo make your vote count put a 1 next to the Liberal candidate\u201d. But the translation more accurately said this was the \u201ccorrect way to vote\u201d, \u201ccorrect voting method\u201d or \u201cthe right way to vote\u201d. Frydenberg and Liu denied that publication of the signs was done with their knowledge or authority. Outside court in Sydney, Yates\u2019s and Garbett\u2019s lawyer, Michael Bradley, said his clients were \u201cvindicated\u201d by the judge\u2019s findings on the corflutes. \u201cMr Yates is extremely happy with the result, he feels vindicated,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cHis intent was that this issue be exposed and resolved and a line drawn in the sand by the courts.\u201d \u201cThere were two things the court needed to do,\u201d he said. \u201cDetermine if there had been a contravention of the electoral act by the use of these corflutes by the Liberal party. \u201cAnd the court has found the use of these corflutes were misleading and deceptive, in contravention of the Electoral Act. And it has made a finding that the person responsible for that, Mr Frost, the court has given him an opportunity to make submissions as to why he shouldn\u2019t be referred to the minister, which could potentially lead to prosecution. \u201cThe second part of the case determines if that illegal conduct was likely to have affected the result in the two elections in Kooyong and Chisholm. And the court found that on the facts, not enough electors would have been aware of the corflutes for it to have changed the results.\u201d At a doorstop in Mount Barker, Scott Morrison said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the result \u201cbecause of the nature of the case\u201d. \u201cIt was a smear job and it\u2019s been chucked out,\u201d he said. In a statement, the state director of the Victorian Liberals, Sam McQuestin, said the party welcomed the decision of the court to dismiss the case. \u201cConsequently there will be no by-elections for either electorate as a result of this case.\u201d Labor\u2019s shadow attorney-general, Mark Dreyfus, said the government could \u201ctake no comfort\u201d from today\u2019s decision. \u201cIt is now clear the tactics employed by the Liberal party in this election went well beyond the accepted bounds of a vigorously contested election campaign \u2013 especially in the divisions of Chisholm and Kooyong. \u201cMr Morrison and his colleagues can take no comfort from the fact that the court found that the Liberal party\u2019s potentially unlawful conduct did not affect the election result. What\u2019s relevant here is the conduct of the Liberal party.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For the first time since I was dragged to mass by my extended family as a child, I am awake at midnight on Christmas Eve. Thousands surround me at our chosen place of worship: Chadstone, Australia\u2019s gaudy and glitzy home of luxury and high-street shopping. We\u2019re here to experience the surreal early hours of its 34-hour trade period, in which a vast majority of the centre\u2019s 500+ stores stay open from 8am on the 23rd until 6pm on Christmas Eve.</p> <p>It\u2019s a curiously Australian tradition. Chadstone was one of the first shopping centres in the country to offer extended Christmas trading hours, 17 years ago. Other popular centres, including Westfields in Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane now offer their own \u201cnon-stop shop\u201d marathons too, as does the Highpoint shopping centre in Melbourne\u2019s Maribyrnong. Each late shift features its own line-up of events and installations. This year, one such attraction went terribly wrong in Sydney\u2019s Westfield Parramatta when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/24/several-people-injured-in-parramatta-westfield-christmas-giveaway-crowd-crush\">a balloon drop at midnight resulted in five people being taken to hospital</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/24/several-people-injured-in-parramatta-westfield-christmas-giveaway-crowd-crush\">Several people injured in Parramatta Westfield Christmas giveaway crowd crush</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nothing that dramatic happens at Chadstone. I arrive at around midnight assuming the centre will already be quiet. Chadstone report they receive around 200,000 visitors over this period. But still, I expected to find myself in an LED-lit twilight zone of haunted halls and lonely clerks. Instead, I found a thriving mall.</p> <p>Despite the much-prophesied death of the brick-and-mortar retailer, the 34-hour shopping spree is still clearly a huge draw, due in part to the event\u2019s fanfare, and the fact that online shopping can\u2019t really account for last-minute presents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B6ayAJRAYy_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

There is no overrepresented or underrepresented demographic present; teens lounge around plush seating areas side-to-side with fatigued fathers holding dozens of H&amp;M bags, and young couples scrolling their feeds.</p> <p>There\u2019s not much reliable history of this kind of late-night trade, just a few press clippings and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_hours\">a poorly referenced Wikipedia page</a> that suggests Victoria\u2019s unregulated trading laws made the southern state the birthplace of all night Christmas shopping.</p> <p>Shoppers at Chadstone largely seem to be unfazed by the fact that they\u2019re doing their gift-buying at 1am. Even the centre\u2019s employees tend to be unmoved by the unique conditions of their December work hours. \u201c[Thirty-four hour trade] is alright,\u201d a young MUJI employee working 9pm till 3am tells me, \u201cPretty exhausting. I think we get penalty rates, though.\u201d For a worker in the last two hours of a nine-hour overnight shift, she seems in fairly good spirits. Her fellow employees, too, are largely bemused, not stressed out. As one staff member at the checkouts tells me: \u201cIt\u2019s like an out-of-body experience.\u201d</p> <p>A lab coat-clad worker at one of Myer\u2019s high-end cosmetics counters seems beaten down by the time she offers me a moisturiser sample, only 30 minutes away from ending her 10-hour shift. She began at 4pm on the 23rd, she tells me, and will go home at 2am on the 24th only to return 12 hours later for a five-hour shift setting up for Boxing Day, when she will begin at 5am. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always flat-out, this period,\u201d she tells me, before pausing.</p> <p>\u201cThis year is much quieter than last year, though,\u201d she explains, a somewhat astounding observation considering how busy the centre is, even at 2am. Later on, while walking through the Mecca Cosmetica counter, the same comment comes up, this time from shoppers.</p> <p>Despite reflections that the mall is less busy this year, it\u2019s not hard to see the appeal of the 34-hour trade. By the time the clock strikes 3am, the constant conflict of light, sound and colour from all the open stores feels stimulating. Christmas carols clash with high-octane pop and throbbing EDM. This, in conjunction with the general sobriety being at a mall engenders, makes late-night shopping far less tiresome than many after hours activities. It feels entirely normal \u2013 fun, even \u2013 to be in Sephora after midnight if you\u2019re surrounded by gaggles of excited teens and staff members painted in full faces of Grinch makeup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4866969af0f62fe4d0f62c9bb0d067ad7bc5469b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4866969af0f62fe4d0f62c9bb0d067ad7bc5469b/0_0_783_678/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Chadstone food court at 2am during all-night trading in the lead up to Christmas.\" width=\"500\" height=\"433\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Chadstone food court at 2am during all-night trading in the lead up to Christmas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaad D'Souza</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The buzzing downstairs food court \u2013 which feels more densely populated than the rest of the centre by a ratio of around 2-to-1 \u2013 has a warm, communal feel. There are groups of young girls taking photos with their Boost juices and families sharing boxes of McDonald\u2019s between purchases.</p> <p>This is a social occasion for many attendees, as much as it is a chance to go shopping. \u201cI pretty much just come because it\u2019s fun,\u201d a 21-year-old shopper named Harrison tells me. Accompanied by his girlfriend, this is his third year of late-night shopping at Chadstone. His gifts are largely purchased; this trip is just a lark. \u201cI\u2019ve only been the past couple of years but I like the vibes and the Christmas atmosphere. Besides, there\u2019s nothing else to do at 2am anyway.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For the first time since I was dragged to mass by my extended family as a child, I am awake at midnight on Christmas Eve. Thousands surround me at our chosen place of worship: Chadstone, Australia\u2019s gaudy and glitzy home of luxury and high-street shopping. We\u2019re here to experience the surreal early hours of its 34-hour trade period, in which a vast majority of the centre\u2019s 500+ stores stay open from 8am on the 23rd until 6pm on Christmas Eve. It\u2019s a curiously Australian tradition. Chadstone was one of the first shopping centres in the country to offer extended Christmas trading hours, 17 years ago. Other popular centres, including Westfields in Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane now offer their own \u201cnon-stop shop\u201d marathons too, as does the Highpoint shopping centre in Melbourne\u2019s Maribyrnong. Each late shift features its own line-up of events and installations. This year, one such attraction went terribly wrong in Sydney\u2019s Westfield Parramatta when a balloon drop at midnight resulted in five people being taken to hospital. Nothing that dramatic happens at Chadstone. I arrive at around midnight assuming the centre will already be quiet. Chadstone report they receive around 200,000 visitors over this period. But still, I expected to find myself in an LED-lit twilight zone of haunted halls and lonely clerks. Instead, I found a thriving mall. Despite the much-prophesied death of the brick-and-mortar retailer, the 34-hour shopping spree is still clearly a huge draw, due in part to the event\u2019s fanfare, and the fact that online shopping can\u2019t really account for last-minute presents. A thick and steady stream of shoppers is pouring out of the brightly lit centre into the darkened parking lot outside, with many thousands more still milling around inside, clutching on to plastic shopping bags or empty drink containers. The centre is as busy as I\u2019ve ever seen an Australian mall and, even after 12am, there are plenty of families with small children drifting between shops looking for purchases. There is no overrepresented or underrepresented demographic present; teens lounge around plush seating areas side-to-side with fatigued fathers holding dozens of H&amp;M bags, and young couples scrolling their feeds. There\u2019s not much reliable history of this kind of late-night trade, just a few press clippings and a poorly referenced Wikipedia page that suggests Victoria\u2019s unregulated trading laws made the southern state the birthplace of all night Christmas shopping. Shoppers at Chadstone largely seem to be unfazed by the fact that they\u2019re doing their gift-buying at 1am. Even the centre\u2019s employees tend to be unmoved by the unique conditions of their December work hours. \u201c[Thirty-four hour trade] is alright,\u201d a young MUJI employee working 9pm till 3am tells me, \u201cPretty exhausting. I think we get penalty rates, though.\u201d For a worker in the last two hours of a nine-hour overnight shift, she seems in fairly good spirits. Her fellow employees, too, are largely bemused, not stressed out. As one staff member at the checkouts tells me: \u201cIt\u2019s like an out-of-body experience.\u201d A lab coat-clad worker at one of Myer\u2019s high-end cosmetics counters seems beaten down by the time she offers me a moisturiser sample, only 30 minutes away from ending her 10-hour shift. She began at 4pm on the 23rd, she tells me, and will go home at 2am on the 24th only to return 12 hours later for a five-hour shift setting up for Boxing Day, when she will begin at 5am. \u201cIt\u2019s always flat-out, this period,\u201d she tells me, before pausing. \u201cThis year is much quieter than last year, though,\u201d she explains, a somewhat astounding observation considering how busy the centre is, even at 2am. Later on, while walking through the Mecca Cosmetica counter, the same comment comes up, this time from shoppers. Despite reflections that the mall is less busy this year, it\u2019s not hard to see the appeal of the 34-hour trade. By the time the clock strikes 3am, the constant conflict of light, sound and colour from all the open stores feels stimulating. Christmas carols clash with high-octane pop and throbbing EDM. This, in conjunction with the general sobriety being at a mall engenders, makes late-night shopping far less tiresome than many after hours activities. It feels entirely normal \u2013 fun, even \u2013 to be in Sephora after midnight if you\u2019re surrounded by gaggles of excited teens and staff members painted in full faces of Grinch makeup. The buzzing downstairs food court \u2013 which feels more densely populated than the rest of the centre by a ratio of around 2-to-1 \u2013 has a warm, communal feel. There are groups of young girls taking photos with their Boost juices and families sharing boxes of McDonald\u2019s between purchases. This is a social occasion for many attendees, as much as it is a chance to go shopping. \u201cI pretty much just come because it\u2019s fun,\u201d a 21-year-old shopper named Harrison tells me. Accompanied by his girlfriend, this is his third year of late-night shopping at Chadstone. His gifts are largely purchased; this trip is just a lark. \u201cI\u2019ve only been the past couple of years but I like the vibes and the Christmas atmosphere. Besides, there\u2019s nothing else to do at 2am anyway.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis continues, millions of hectares have been lost, with a tragic impact on wildlife and flora. Among the destruction, the efforts of volunteer firefighters, residents and animal rescuers have stood out, with small acts of heroism that have saved many animal lives. A few have become emblematic images of this year\u2019s terrible fire season. Koalas and Adam At the Cudlee Creek fire in the Adelaide Hills, a firefighter called Adam rescued at least six koalas from one of the most intense blazes to hit the state. The devastating fire, which reached emergency level on Friday, killed one person and destroyed 72 homes and 227 vehicles. On Friday, resident Janelle Michalowski shared an image of the six koalas huddled safely inside after being rescued. Journalist Laura Thomson praised the rescuer \u2013 later identified as Adam Mudge. She later wrote: \u201cI\u2019m told Adam doesn\u2019t quite get why so many people are praising him \u2013 it\u2019s just a part of his job as a volunteer firefighter.\u201d A kangaroo in the living room On the New South Wales central coast, a fire at the start of December burned through thousands of hectares, on a day when eight different fires in NSW reached emergency level. In the town of Kulnura, firefighters set up outside a house, preparing for the firefront. Inside, Narelle Davis and Jill Gilbert were cooking sausages on the stove. Mim the kangaroo sat, unperturbed, on a blanket. The family told Guardian Australia they had raised the eastern grey kangaroo since she was young, feeding her by hand. They released her, and had let her roam wild for years. Now, as the fires burned, she turned up at their door seeking shelter. \u201cNow she\u2019s wild but she comes in. I\u2019ve kept her in because of the fires and that,\u201d Davis told Guardian Australia. One man and a koala At Lobethal in the Adelaide Hills, another town hit by the Cudlee Creek blaze, two koalas came out of the bush to escape the fire. They met the best person who could help. Dale Adams, a lieutenant at the Eden Hills Country Fire Service, took the photo of his colleague. He told Guardian Australia it was common for koalas to come out, apparently looking for firefighters, in these situations. \u201cUp behind us there were a couple of houses under threat so we were working to protect them from ember attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stepped out of the bush seeking help.\u201d He said the koalas were given water and moved to a safer location. The possum in a helmet In Balmoral, NSW, relatives of another volunteer firefighter shared these incredible images of a ringtail possum escaping the flames and finding safety in an RFS helmet. The kangaroo cooling off Taking a cue from Mim the kangaroo in Kulnura, this roo was spotted going further, dipping into a suburb pool on a 42C day in the Hunter. Koala rescue dogs And how could we forget the animals themselves helping rescue animnals: from Taylor the springer spaniel in Port Macquarie, on the NSW mid-north coast, to Bear, the cattle-dog cross with obsessive-compulsive disorder who, after being abandoned by his owners, found a new life as a koala detection dog. Quolls in Oxley national park Conservationist Bronwyn Fancourt shared this video on Friday of a quoll being rescued and released back into the Oxley Wild Rivers national park in NSW, even after the devastation had rolled through. Baby Blossom Berrara Beach Kangaroos gathered on Saturday at this NSW beachside property as fires blazed on a horror day for the state.",
